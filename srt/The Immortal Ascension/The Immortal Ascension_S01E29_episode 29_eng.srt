1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,800
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,160
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,120
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,800
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,140
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,880
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,960
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,518
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:51,000
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,214
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,097 --> 00:01:01,280
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,737
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:10,272
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,272 --> 00:01:13,671
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:15,840
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,160
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,200
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,880
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,960
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,020
 

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,942
 Perhaps the scar of war will disappear 

25
00:01:56,942 --> 00:02:01,010
 when the leaves of Yellow Maple Valley turn red. 

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,600
 Where is his cavern? 

27
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,060
 I should ask around. 

28
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,280
What do I want?

29
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,740
I've always wanted the same thing.

30
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,130
Don't you know?

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,020
Hong Fu.

32
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,710
When Hua Yuan was a new disciple,

33
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,760
we often gazed at the snow mountain here.

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,480
He was a nostalgic person.

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,920
I'm sure he is glad to return to this place.

36
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,010
We promised

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,560
to return and gaze upon the same view.

38
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,260
Little do I know,

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,730
this is how I send him off.

40
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,290
One less drinking friend.

41
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,850
Moonshadow Sect's Immortal Stupor
was his favorite liquor.

42
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,552
What is your plan now?

43
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:47,280
I heard everyone from the Yellow Maple Valley

44
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,140
went to the Nine Kingdoms Alliance.

45
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,750
I am just a rogue cultivator now.

46
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,913
Be it the demonic sects or Yellow Maple Valley,

47
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:58,315
my past no longer has anything to do with me.

48
00:03:58,315 --> 00:04:01,452
However, I promised Hua Yuan

49
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:05,410
to look after his disciples.

50
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,080
Especially his favorite, the youngest one.

51
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,060
He's gone missing.

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,310
That young man who goes by the name of Han?

53
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,280
Han Li.

54
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,490
Have you met him before?

55
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,470
Yes.

56
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:30,710
He looks unassuming, yet he is quite smart.

57
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,840
So he caught my attention.

58
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,310
Your description is apt.

59
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,750
Despite his plain talent, he stands out

60
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,870
and is often favored by fortune.

61
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,190
Xuan Er went to the Yan Clan Stronghold with him.

62
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,470
And she missed him a lot when she returned.

63
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,910
I thought that would become her inner demon.

64
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,580
I see.

65
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,650
You can't judge a book by its cover.

66
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:59,710
It's just a story between the younglings.

67
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,870
There's no point talking about this now anyway.

68
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,910
I can only hope he manages to escape,

69
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,210
like he usually does.

70
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,640
If that is Hua Yuan's last wish,

71
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,430
I can help you find him.

72
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,471
I wouldn't want to bother you with a small matter.

73
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:22,840
Besides, I plan to find them

74
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,317
after I take care of everything here.

75
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:28,377
It's fine.

76
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,840
Moonshadow Sect
is negotiating peace with the demonic sects.

77
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,240
I have nothing to do as well.

78
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,930
In that case, thank you.

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,860
Hong Fu, I'll take my leave.

80
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,460
Hua Yuan, don't worry.

81
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,460
We'll find them.

82
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:04,952
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

83
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:11,634
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

84
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:15,400
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫ 

85
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,280
 ♫ Old scenes rise again ♫ 

86
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,920
 ♫ Too hard to forget, easier just to miss ♫ 

87
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:31,752
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

88
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,160
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

89
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:42,286
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page... ♫ 

90
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,510
Come.

91
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,620
Take this.

92
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:52,405
 ♫ Eyes once looked far, now lost in the shift ♫ 

93
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:58,160
 ♫ Autumn winds stir, smoke curls once more ♫ 

94
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,520
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky
returning to my eyes ♫ 

95
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,680
 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop,
time lost its name ♫ 

96
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,920
 ♫ Was it yesterday or tomorrow? ♫ 

97
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,360
 ♫ The world has changed beyond recall... ♫ 

98
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,830
Han.

99
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,840
It's me.

100
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,720
 ♫ All the words ever spoken... ♫ 

101
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,040
Han.

102
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,580
You're awake.

103
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:42,400
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days... ♫ 

104
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,900
Careful.

105
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:49,350
Senior Song.

106
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,240
Senior Zhong.

107
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,970
How come you are here?

108
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,630
Wait.

109
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,310
I brought some water from the valley.

110
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,900
Have some.

111
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,750
Who is this big guy?

112
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,830
He stands beside you silently for two days.

113
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,940
He looks scary.

114
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,310
He's a friend of mine.

115
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,950
I have some pills.

116
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,460
Take some.

117
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,210
Weren't you at Golden Drum Plains?

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,020
The Seven Sects

119
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,820
lost in the war after all.

120
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,940
Yes.

121
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,530
We were betrayed and defeated.

122
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,310
Spirit Beast Mountain and Skyfort Castle.

123
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:21,950
Those traitors... One day, I'll make them pay.

124
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,560
You are still hurt.

125
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,270
No point in acting tough.

126
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,850
Now that our sect has fallen

127
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,050
and the demonic sects are hunting us,

128
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,260
we need to find a way to survive.

129
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,780
Our sect has fallen?

130
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,380
What about Master and other mentors?

131
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,630
When I was fleeing,

132
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,480
they were fighting the demonic sects.

133
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,170
What happened to them?

134
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:03,850
We just learned that Master fought Yun Lu

135
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,900
to defend our sect.

136
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,810
He sacrificed his Golden Core

137
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,290
and passed away.

138
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,530
How could this be?

139
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,140
Master...

140
00:10:57,821 --> 00:10:59,601
He already

141
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,190
made the decision to die

142
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:06,917
when he went to Mentor Hong Fu's side.

143
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,320
Perhaps this is what Master wanted,

144
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,170
to make peace with himself.

145
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,860
And now,

146
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,140
we're truly disciples without a home.

147
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,670
Senior Song, Master asked me to keep this

148
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,360
and give it to you if I saw you.

149
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,030
Consider it delivered.

150
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,360
Han, Master surely left some for you too.

151
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,040
I already took mine.

152
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,370
The rest is just some gems and pills.

153
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,380
You need them

154
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,410
more than I do wherever you go.

155
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,320
 

156
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,690
He embroidered this word the year

157
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,860
I achieved the Foundation Establishment Stage.

158
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,980
He kept it by his side as if it were his treasure.

159
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,200
I also have some pills that I made.

160
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,630
Take them.

161
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,020
Here you go.

162
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,630
You won't join us to regroup with others?

163
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,100
We can retaliate and fight those scums.

164
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,740
The last thing Master did before he left

165
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,740
was to remove the Soul-Burning Spell on me.

166
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,481
Thinking back, the demonic sects

167
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:29,500
knew precisely where we were.

168
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,960
Master didn't say anything,
but I understood why now.

169
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,530
Were we

170
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:40,956
betrayed by the sect?

171
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,100
Exactly.

172
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,170
I feel bad for our peers.

173
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,260
They didn't even know they were bait
till the very end.

174
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,740
Perhaps this is how the world works.

175
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:18,181
But we are currently powerless to change it.

176
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,140
And I don't want to be bait anymore.

177
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,380
It's time to live differently.

178
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,410
If we live,

179
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,740
there is hope.

180
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,320
Han, now that you've explained everything,

181
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,410
I don't want to regroup with them anymore.

182
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,860
Wei Niang, what about you?

183
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,555
Let's turn to Mentor Hong Fu

184
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:18,625
and see what she plans to do.

185
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,720
Han.

186
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,480
You've always been a free soul.

187
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,810
Go wherever you want.

188
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,200
Yellow Maple Valley may be gone.

189
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,980
But we're still here.

190
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,650
If possible, let's meet again.

191
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,670
Seniors, farewell.

192
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,630
Han Li.

193
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,260
Farewell.

194
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,380
Farewell.

195
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,080
 Reunion is rare. 

196
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,510
 Departure is bitter. 

197
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,390
 Every regret is unique. 

198
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,840
 I can't stop here. 

199
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,670
 My mentors told me to explore the world outside. 

200
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,320
 I'll fix the teleport array first. 

201
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,980
 I wonder if Yun Xiao and the rest are ready. 

202
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,890
 
Qi is...

203
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,100
I'm too late.

204
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,500
Miss Ru Yin.

205
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,290
Her Dragon Roar Body is ferocious.

206
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:27,030
This cask contains the Yun Xiao Heart Technique
you've seen.

207
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,550
My husband has removed all the restriction spells.

208
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:35,088
And the other one
contains all my understandings of the array

209
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:39,320
as well as rare array scrolls
you won't find on the market.

210
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,460
Please accept them.

211
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,510
I can't accept them for free.

212
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,500
What can I do for you?

213
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,370
My days are numbered.

214
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,205
Can I ask you for a favor?

215
00:19:04,205 --> 00:19:05,745
My husband

216
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,640
was killed by the Fu clan.

217
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,070
He fled here and succumbed to his injuries.

218
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,330
I hope you can

219
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,640
avenge us on our behalf one day.

220
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,880
The Fu Clan has poisoned
the Yuanwu Kingdom long enough.

221
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,200
 
They rob and kill

222
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,530
as if it's no different from breathing.

223
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,460
I know it is a huge favor to ask.

224
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,260
But I have no other options.

225
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,220
Get up now.

226
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:07,550
I can give you my promise.

227
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:12,420
When I'm strong enough,
I will bring justice to you.

228
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:17,090
Please accept my bow, Senior.

229
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,790
Miss Ru Yin.

230
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,440
I have done some research on your ailment

231
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,550
and found some recipes too.

232
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,400
While they might not cure you,

233
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,260
they can alleviate your suffering more or less.

234
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,790
I will stay here for a few days
to make pills for you.

235
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,640
Thank you so much, Senior.

236
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,510
Please don't mind my humble abode.

237
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,030
Once I'm done with the teleport array,

238
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,440
you will have it.

239
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,220
Thank you.

240
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:06,270
 Master, I might not understand it now, 

241
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,570
 but I don't regret giving her my promise. 

242
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,070
 But I can only deliver my promise 

243
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,472
 once I reach the Core Formation Stage. 

244
00:22:14,472 --> 00:22:20,252
 Being weak and brash will only kill me. 

245
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,100
 

246
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,550
 Senior Han, unbeknownst to you and my husband, 

247
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,070
 the difficulty in repairing ancient arrays 

248
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,920
 does not lie in technicality, 

249
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,240
 but that it requires
the vitality of array masters. 

250
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,790
 Do not feel guilty. 

251
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,160
 
 Given my impending demise, 

252
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,000
 to sacrifice myself for an array is an honor. 

253
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,240
 Lastly, if my passing makes you
honor your promise, 

254
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,160
 then it's worth it. 

255
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,750
 My husband built this hut himself. 

256
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,490
 It is my home. 

257
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,600
 If it's not too much trouble, 

258
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,900
 please bury me next to my husband
behind the mountain. 

259
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,960
 

260
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,750
 Senior Han, the ancient array
is indeed a mystical one. 

261
00:23:53,750 --> 00:24:00,070
 It took all of me to repair the array slightly. 

262
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,790
 Place it on the stone tablet. 

263
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,960
 Gather the missing ingredients 

264
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,510
 and the Greater Teleport Command Seal. 

265
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,070
 You may then activate the array. 

266
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,200
 You will move a thousand li in an instant. 

267
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,550
 Alas, the ancient array 

268
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,310
 is barely recorded in any scrolls. 

269
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,480
 I can't identify the destination. 

270
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,240
 But given your good luck, you will be safe. 

271
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,680
 I suppose this is the end
for array masters like me. 

272
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,310
 But I am content to have found a spot in my life. 

273
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:43,990
 Please take care and honor your promise. 

274
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,530
 Regards, Ru Yin. 

275
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,830
 The security isn't tight. 

276
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,850
 It seems like they have not
found out about the array. 

277
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,260
He won't give up. How annoying.

278
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,310
 Nangong Wan? 

279
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,050
 What is she doing here? 

280
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,990
 Senior Nangong of the Moonshadow Sect? 

281
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,940
You still stand despite your injury.

282
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,600
As expected of a veteran from the Moonshadow Sect.

283
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,000
 Him again. 

284
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,230
 He's everywhere. 

285
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,180
I suppose you are behind

286
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,530
all the escaped captives lately, then.

287
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,830
Young man, you keep chasing me.

288
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,700
Do you have a death wish?

289
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,720
My apologies.

290
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,350
I wouldn't provoke you if we were anywhere else.

291
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:34,530
But you're now at the heart
of the Ghost Spirit Sect.

292
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,980
Can I help you?

293
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,952
Let's have some tea together.

294
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:46,920
I must be a good host.

295
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,440
 All this because I'm looking
for that stupid Han Li. 

296
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,110
 Why did he return to the Yan Clan Stronghold? 

297
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,510
I don't have the interest, the mood, or the time.

298
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,260
Go away if you want to live.

299
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,090
But you're injured.

300
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,280
Elder Gui, Elder Tong.

301
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,750
Didn't you say
you want to swear loyalty to me again?

302
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:15,173
Show me your devotion.

303
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,660
Of course.

304
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,720
Bring our people across the forest in front of us

305
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,240
and cut off her retreat

306
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,370
by sieging her from the cliff behind.

307
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,875
 Oh, no. 

308
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:57,695
 I'm so close, yet this is happening. 

309
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,020
Whatever.

310
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,020
Lay in ambush here.

311
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,370
Yes!

312
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,635
 It's her. 

313
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:53,545
 I think she is hurt. 

314
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,271
 Dong Xuan Er? 

315
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:58,091
 Why is she here? 

316
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,090
 Did she join the demonic sects? 

317
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:04,052
 And this guy from the Ghost Spirit Sect 

318
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:05,183
 who won't leave us alone. 

319
00:32:05,183 --> 00:32:07,108
Who knew a Core Formation Stage cultivator

320
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:10,953
could run with her tail between her legs?

321
00:32:10,953 --> 00:32:14,070
Senior, isn't it shameful to flee

322
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,000
without putting up a fight?

323
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,110
Not as shameful as ganging up on others

324
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,850
and conquering other lands.

325
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,130
You two, what are you waiting for?

326
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,420
Young Lady!

327
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,110
I am Dong Xuan Er, a disciple of Hong Fu
under Yellow Maple Valley.

328
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,070
Greetings.

329
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,350
Dong Xuan Er.

330
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,965
Why are you consorting with the demonic sects?

331
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:39,440
It's a long story.

332
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,830
Please come with us
and clear up this misunderstanding.

333
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,400
Your sect is negotiating peace
with the Six Demonic Sects.

334
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,310
I can ensure your safety.

335
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:53,720
That peace talk is just one's wishful thinking.

336
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,510
The righteous and evil are sworn enemies.

337
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,750
The demonic cults sow chaos
for their selfish desires.

338
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:03,920
I hate fighting, yet I must avenge my friends.

339
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,480
Let's settle the score today.

340
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,231
Senior, your life-bound treasure is damaged.

341
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:14,472
This sword technique is powerful,

342
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:16,462
but it consumes your cultivation core.

343
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,760
Look.

344
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,690
There are so many of us.

345
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,220
Can you win?

346
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,850
 Now's the time. 

347
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,640
Don't! Don't come near me.

348
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,780
It's him. Why is he here?

349
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,590
Wait.

350
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,550
Let's talk it out.

351
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,000
Don't move.

352
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Impressive.

353
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,260
You snuck into my incompetent team quietly.

354
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,070
 Senior, he and I have a history. 

355
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,400
 I can't show my face. 

356
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,270
 Please deal with him. 

357
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,440
 It's him? 

358
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,200
 Why is he here? 

359
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,510
 No, I can't let him know I'm here for him. 

360
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,810
 It's... It's too embarrassing. 

361
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,660
Make way for me!

362
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,960
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

363
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,510
You there! Let go of Young Lady.

364
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,550
Listen to me.

365
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,160
Do not move an inch!

366
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,670
Silence.

367
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,920
This is weird, Xuan Er.

368
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,440
You've always avoided
the remnants of the Seven Sects.

369
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,070
Why are you so eager to intervene today?

370
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,780
Unless

371
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,000
you want to be held hostage by him?

372
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,270
Wang Chan! Shut your mouth!

373
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,960
Wise words, Young Master.

374
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,310
We were almost fooled by her.

375
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,160
Indeed!

376
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,550
 We split up later. 

377
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,590
 He's a cunning foe. 

378
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,790
 It won't be easy to fight him. 

379
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,590
 Their target is you. 

380
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,200
 You should go first. 

381
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,680
 I have Dong Xuan Er. 

382
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,370
 They won't do anything to me. 

383
00:34:56,634 --> 00:34:57,934
All right.

384
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,000
Enough of this farce.

385
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,880
I don't care if you're doing this on purpose.

386
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,400
Capture them both and we'll know.

387
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,972
Senior, and this masked friend,

388
00:35:11,972 --> 00:35:15,510
just give up already.

389
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,200
 A Foundation Establishment
cultivator cannot burrow underground. 

390
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,790
 Can you escape? 

391
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,370
 Forgive me. 

392
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,460
Take them down.

393
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,480
 I'll be waiting for you a hundred li to the west. 

394
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,180
 Don't come with pursuers. 

395
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,510
I hate this.

396
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,510
The easy prey escaped.

397
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:56,800
Search everywhere within a 100-li radius!

398
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,620
Yes, Young Master!

399
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,725
Han Li.

400
00:36:07,725 --> 00:36:09,465
It's you, right?

401
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,400
You're hurting me.

402
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,930
Can you put it away?

403
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,700
I'm sorry.

404
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,260
It really is you.

405
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,760
Han Li.

406
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,320
You never told us you're safe

407
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,190
after you escaped from the Yan Clan Stronghold.

408
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,740
Don't you know I...

409
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,100
and your master are worried about you?

410
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,620
Forgive my recklessness just now.

411
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,992
You're so courteous.

412
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:51,448
I heard you were kidnapped.

413
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:56,110
It seems like you've joined the Joyful Union Sect.

414
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:59,890
Grandmaster Yun Lu of Joyful Union Sect
is my father.

415
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,810
My master is my mother.

416
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,320
She had a history with him.

417
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,960
She didn't know who he truly was when they met.

418
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,685
When she found out, she was already deeply in love

419
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:20,545
and pregnant with me.

420
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,440
That was why Wang Chan was after you

421
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,410
when he first met you.

422
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,550
Your gift of enchantment

423
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,490
must have come from your father.

424
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:38,670
Father took me in as his disciple.

425
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,280
He even forcefully erased

426
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,150
whatever I learned in Yellow Maple Valley.

427
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,760
But since training under him,

428
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,800
I've progressed very quickly.

429
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,000
Can you imagine a Nascent Soul cultivator

430
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,190
teaching you everything he knows?

431
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:56,220
Not many can turn down an opportunity like that.

432
00:37:56,913 --> 00:37:59,084
Do you understand?

433
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:01,230
But you're not like them.

434
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:05,280
You won't ever be one of them.

435
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,550
But I was told that once I mastered my technique,

436
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,670
my personality would change too.

437
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,110
When that happens,

438
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,780
I might not even remember what you look like.

439
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,337
A cultivator lives longer than a mortal.

440
00:38:21,337 --> 00:38:25,858
You will meet more people and forget more people.

441
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:27,590
But this doesn't matter.

442
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:31,490
What matters is that you don't forget who you are.

443
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,850
All right.

444
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,850
I am Han Li.

445
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,630
How may I address you?

446
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,880
I am Dong Xuan Er.

447
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,410
We're now friends.

448
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,010
Han.

449
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,820
You're also here?

450
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,048
 Master. 

451
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:24,793
 Father, sorry. 

452
00:39:24,793 --> 00:39:28,803
 I still can't let go of him. 

453
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,580
Senior Han, just drop me here.

454
00:39:51,136 --> 00:39:53,070
All right. Go.

455
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,440
I'll explain to my father.

456
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,732
I'll buy you and Senior Nangong some time.

457
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,800
Don't get caught by Wang Chan again.

458
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,590
What exactly did you do to him

459
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,800
in the Yan Clan Stronghold

460
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,210
to make him so obsessed with you?

461
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,000
Dong Xuan Er.

462
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,358
Take care.

463
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:13,768
Take care.

464
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,705
 Senior Han. 

465
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:29,520
 Farewell. 

466
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,030
 Mother, Mentor Li,
and everyone in Yellow Maple Valley. 

467
00:40:35,897 --> 00:40:38,023
 Don't worry. 

468
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:42,272
 I will walk my own path. 

469
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:45,012
 I won't be swayed by anyone. 

470
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,740
 Farewell. 

471
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,590
 A hundred li to the west. 

472
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,450
 This should be the place. 

473
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:51,000
 She's seriously injured. 

474
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,320
 I'm here. 

475
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,100
 I won't let you die.
