1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,540
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,120
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,160
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,480
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,200
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,960
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,000
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,520
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,960
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,221
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,320
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,589
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,280
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,560
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,780
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,100
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,040
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,987
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,960
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,060
 

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,780
Where are you going?

25
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,640
Try to find a decent cavern.

26
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,100
It's all on you now.

27
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,090
Can't you just go the normal way?

28
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,280
I spent all those gems
paying you to find me a cavern.

29
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,680
You didn't find a cavern,

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,700
and now I have to look for you?

31
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,698
Little guy, you really found one!

32
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:54,418
Now hide.

33
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,690
It's pitch dark in here.

34
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,235
There's even a tree?

35
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:35,535
This place is something else!

36
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,460
A spirit spring!

37
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,830
Nice work. You actually did it!

38
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,610
I didn't waste those gems on you.

39
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,360
A natural spirit spring
like this is truly a rare find.

40
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,500
This cavern is ideal for cultivation!

41
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,600
Here, your reward.

42
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,700
Spirit herbs?

43
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,610
How are they even growing here?

44
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,070
Guess I can secretly grow herbs here

45
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,920
without anyone noticing.

46
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,340
It's Han Li's little herb garden.

47
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,360
Stop! Hey, stop!

48
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,480
Don't eat that!

49
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,630
Listen.

50
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,920
Too much of that will harm you!

51
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,070
Those are my precious herbs, got it?

52
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,160
Spit it out!

53
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,700
Come on!

54
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,310
There's a spirit spring here,

55
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,140
and spirit herbs too.

56
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,940
What a perfect spot for cultivation!

57
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,360
Perfect spot.

58
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,050
Absolutely perfect.

59
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,610
You want a nap too?

60
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,360
Unbelievable.

61
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,900
You really know how to ride the wave.

62
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,460
Careless of me!

63
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,500
I need a defense array.

64
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,380
All right. Job well done!

65
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,920
Now, I need to plan this place out.

66
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,900
First, I need a place to sleep.

67
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,580
A bed?

68
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,050
That'll do!

69
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,240
Not bad!

70
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,870
Pretty good, actually.

71
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,850
I can have tea here.

72
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,560
Enough now.

73
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,800
I just fed you.

74
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,290
Don't be greedy.

75
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,780
How'd you get in here?

76
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,430
Looks like Mentor Wu was right.

77
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,720
Free arrays can't be trusted.

78
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,020
Totally unreliable.

79
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,020
Where can I get a proper defense array?

80
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,290
Move aside.

81
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,850
Yuanwu Kingdom?

82
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,560
It's not far from Yue Kingdom.

83
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,090
Quite close, actually.

84
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,630
Maybe...

85
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,410
I should take a trip there?

86
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,900
Don't follow me.

87
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,510
Stay here and watch the place.

88
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,100
And don't let it come inside.

89
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,670
 

90
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,530
All right, deal!

91
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,780
Congratulations on winning this treasure!

92
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,780
Please head to the counter to claim your item!

93
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,840
 Yuanwu Kingdom may be small, 

94
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,320
 but it's got quite a few arrays 

95
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,750
 and some good crafting masters. 

96
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,630
 With any luck, this auction
may have something for my array setup. 

97
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,820
 For now, I'll sell off some stuff first... 

98
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,000
One stalk of Golden Glow Ganoderma!

99
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,020
 
 Let's see what these guests have to offer. 

100
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,390
Ladies and gentlemen, the bidding now begins!

101
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,870
Starting bid, I bid 500 gems!

102
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,120
I bid 1,000 gems!

103
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,320
1,000 gems!

104
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,870
- I bid 1,200 gems!
- 1,200 gems!

105
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,069
- I bid 1,500 gems!
- 1,500 gems!

106
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:23,332
- I bid 2,000 gems!
- I'll trade a high-grade array...

107
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:24,910
For that spirit herb!

108
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,320
A high-grade array?

109
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,240
Oh, must be worth thousands, huh?

110
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,270
Exactly!

111
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,960
Sir, do you really have a high-grade array?

112
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,720
I do.

113
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,600
But...

114
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,170
but it's not fully complete yet.

115
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,480
Hey, you! What you've got is just junk.

116
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,390
Stop making a fool of yourself!

117
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,390
- I bid 2,000 gems!
- 2,000 gems!

118
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,960
- I bid 3,000 gems!
- Any more bids?

119
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,240
3,000 gems, going once!

120
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,600
3,000 gems, going twice!

121
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,910
3,000 gems, going three times!

122
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,410
Sold!

123
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,220
Congratulations!

124
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,530
Please claim your item at the counter.

125
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,330
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's move on with the auction!

126
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,100
Next item up!

127
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,410
Stop right there!

128
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,720
That's odd.

129
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,030
I saw him run this way.

130
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:33,030
Hey! Did you see a tall, skinny
guy wearing a bamboo hat?

131
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,900
Thanks! After him!

132
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,670
This array is really something.

133
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,840
If I have one like this,

134
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,400
no little beasts will sneak into my cavern again.

135
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,910
 
Earlier,

136
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,240
thanks for stepping in.

137
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,000
I didn't help you out of kindness.

138
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,480
If you're also eyeing my array master's skills,

139
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,910
you'd best move along.

140
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,740
The Millennium Spirit Herb.

141
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,410
Do you still want that?

142
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,670
 

143
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,410
 Yun Xiao Pavilion? 

144
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,790
Yun Xiao is my first name.

145
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,330
Qi is my surname.

146
00:14:11,945 --> 00:14:14,870
That Golden Glow Ganoderma is yours?

147
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,900
Didn't you already sell it?

148
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,840
Who says I can only have one?

149
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,550
Fair enough.

150
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,880
That's great news!

151
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,080
May I take a look?

152
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,720
Tell you what, you're a businessman.

153
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,790
Let's talk business.

154
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,153
Show me one high-grade item here,

155
00:14:36,153 --> 00:14:39,330
and I'll let you see my herb.

156
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,810
Nothing here has caught your eye?

157
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:46,960
All right then.

158
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,450
Sir, this way, please.

159
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,270
These arrays are really well drawn.

160
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,260
No, not this one either.

161
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,500
- What's that?
- Don't touch it!

162
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,650
It's for artifact crafting.

163
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,550
Did you draw all these arrays?

164
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,840
I specialize in crafting gear.

165
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
The arrays are someone else's work.

166
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,260
Sir, wait a moment.

167
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,510
Sir, what do you think
of this Five Phases Reversing Array?

168
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,240
The Five Phases Reversing Array?

169
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,690
That's the one that just exploded.

170
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,200
Wait, that explosion wasn't the array's fault.

171
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,440
I just didn't have enough gems to power it up.

172
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,120
My array is an incomplete work now.

173
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,360
It only runs at about 20% power.

174
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,025
But even like this,

175
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:16,630
it's still a top-tier defense array.

176
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,670
It can block attacks

177
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,690
from a Mid Foundation Establishment cultivator.

178
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,150
What if you restore it?

179
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,270
Once it's fully restored, it's more than enough

180
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,630
to protect a small sect as the Mountain Barrier.

181
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,720
A Millennium Golden Glow Ganoderma

182
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,910
for a sect-level defense array?

183
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,570
Sounds like a fair trade.

184
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,290
But yours is still incomplete.

185
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,670
Sir! Sir!

186
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,670
Sir, please wait!

187
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,910
Five years! Give me five years.

188
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,630
I swear I'll restore it to full form.

189
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,500
You won't trade a Millennium Golden Glow Ganoderma
for a broken array!

190
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,860
Sir, are you interested in artifact crafting?

191
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,510
You mean you're offering to teach me?

192
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,080
To be honest, my grandfather

193
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,960
was an elder in the Divine Arms Sect.

194
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,750
All my skills came from him.

195
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,140
Crafting artifacts is what I do best.

196
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,340
I've got something else too.

197
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,860
 

198
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,960
I compiled the Yun Xiao Heart Technique myself

199
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,390
over many years of cultivation.

200
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,720
Besides this array,

201
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,630
I'm even willing to break family rules

202
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,120
and gift this technique to you.

203
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,740
Because I truly need that Millennium Herb
to save a life.

204
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,080
Well,

205
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,870
I happen to have a few materials to refine.

206
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,500
So how about you forge
a few sets of artifacts for me?

207
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,292
As for this technique,

208
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:04,320
if you can restore
the Five Phases Reversing Array,

209
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,670
I won't read a single page of this book.

210
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,170
What do you think?

211
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,170
And the Golden Glow Ganoderma?

212
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,910
You need that herb

213
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,630
to save someone?

214
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,200
You're willing to trade it at any cost.

215
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,330
That shows your sincerity.

216
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,620
A life's on the line, I won't say no.

217
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,630
 

218
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,000
All right.

219
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,750
I've sealed the book.

220
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,070
If you've made up your mind,

221
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,110
just inject your spiritual power.

222
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,720
Even I won't be able to open it.

223
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,030
If one day you fulfill your promise,

224
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,810
I'll return the book exactly as it is.

225
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,480
You trust me this much.

226
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,780
I'll give it everything I've got!

227
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,900
 

228
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,500
Deal.

229
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,440
Sir!

230
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,270
Just follow the jade scroll's instructions,

231
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,720
and you'll activate this array.

232
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,772
The sensory disruption feature
isn't fully developed yet,

233
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:30,160
but for pure defense,
it'll hold up just fine.

234
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,000
- But...
- What is it?

235
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,750
This array consists
of 18 secondary disks and one core disk.

236
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,110
There are also 36 positioning banners.

237
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,640
They're arranged in macro cosmic
and microcosmic cycles,

238
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
calibrated with Hetu-Luoshu divination patterns,

239
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,550
and activated through
the Primordial Eight Trigrams.

240
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,640
Setting it up takes serious effort.

241
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,440
If I had more time to refine it,

242
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,270
maybe I could simplify it a bit.

243
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,740
No worries.

244
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:01,090
Next up, let's talk about artifact crafting.

245
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,750
These are from a Level Two Blackflood Drake?

246
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,180
Horns, fangs, and venom!

247
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:17,020
These are top-tier materials
every crafter dreams of!

248
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,160
You recognized them in a glance,

249
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,020
looks like I came to the right person.

250
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,370
How long will it take?

251
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,720
Half a month will do.

252
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,270
No problem, Han.

253
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,440
With these materials,

254
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,310
I can make several high-grade artifacts.

255
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,700
Oh yeah!

256
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,090
Qi, my name's Han Li.

257
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,200
Good!

258
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,700
This one's good!

259
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,610
Done!

260
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,400
Not bad!

261
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,890
That's it!

262
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,610
Wait, did I mess up a step?

263
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,790
Guess I can't get careless with this.

264
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,510
I should've asked Qi Yun Xiao for more details.

265
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,830
Now I'll have to wait

266
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,890
until I pick up the artifacts in two weeks.

267
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,140
 

268
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,640
Ye Fei, you faked your death once.

269
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,440
You should've just stayed buried.

270
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,790
Why drag your old crew back in?

271
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,635
Is my name something you can call so casually?

272
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:53,375
Back in Bamboo Sect,
you had to call me Young Master.

273
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,720
Fine.

274
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,350
For old times' sake, if you hand over Volume One

275
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,200
of the Great Deployment Art you stole,

276
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,920
I can convince the Master to spare your life.

277
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,940
Volume One?

278
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:35,480
You really haven't changed, still so naive,

279
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,500
still the loser at my feet!

280
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,660
 Earlier, he mentioned the Bamboo Sect. 

281
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,350
Oh no!

282
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,090
A tracking mark!

283
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,050
Who's there? Show yourself!

284
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,640
 He must have backup. 

285
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,180
 I'd better get out of here. 

286
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,500
What is that?

287
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,660
What's going on?

288
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,700
Dead?

289
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,070
A primordial spirit?

290
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,370
Sir,

291
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,770
if you help me find a new body

292
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,640
so I can start over through possession,

293
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,030
I'll pass on the Bamboo Sect's secret technique,

294
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,440
the Great Deployment Art, to you!

295
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,400
What's the big deal with a broken technique?

296
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,030
All it does is control some puppets.

297
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,680
This technique enhances your spirit sense!

298
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,720
If cultivated properly,

299
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,920
you can control over a hundred puppets at once!

300
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,000
Over a hundred!

301
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,160
So what?

302
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,780
It also boosts your odds of forming a core!

303
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,980
It helps with forming a core...

304
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,810
Please, don't kill me!

305
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,460
No.

306
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,110
Tough luck for you.

307
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:26,660
In this life, I'll never trust any body possessor.

308
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,800
So intricate.

309
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,890
Looks like it needs
Bamboo Sect's secret technique to work.

310
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:07,073
Could it be the Great Deployment Art?

311
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,330
If I ever get the chance,
I have to get my hands on it.

312
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,700
I'm the Master!

313
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,510
I am the rightful leader of Bamboo Sect!

314
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,590
I have the first four volumes

315
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,780
of the Great Deployment Art!

316
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,070
No.

317
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,400
If I don't remove this mark,

318
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,240
they'll find me sooner or later.

319
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,180
I need to figure something out.

320
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,790
That was clearly just a tree.

321
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,240
How is that the Young Master?

322
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,510
Greetings, Young Master!

323
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,720
Zhong Wu.

324
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,590
Zhong Shu.

325
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,570
You're with me now.

326
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,310
I will serve you to the death!

327
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,750
If I speak falsely, may heaven strike me down!

328
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,370
May heaven strike me down!

329
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,920
Here, take this.

330
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,720
This is the list of Foundation Establishment
cultivators from the Seven Sects.

331
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,070
Recruit every name on this list for me.

332
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,440
Once it's done,

333
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,550
we'll meet at Yan Clan Stronghold.

334
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,460
Yan Clan Stronghold?

335
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,200
Congratulations, Young Master!

336
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,880
That means Yue Kingdom is now
wide close for the taking!

337
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,180
Your grand plans are sure to succeed!

338
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,530
You mean "wide open," right?

339
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,380
Remember, it's "wide open."

340
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,740
Shouldn't it be "gate close"?

341
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,260
It really is just a tree...

342
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:49,100
 

343
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,010
Han! You're right on time.

344
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,960
 

345
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,110
Take a look at this, a flying artifact I forged

346
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,070
using Blackflood Drake fin and tail.

347
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,270
It doesn't offer much defense,

348
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,270
but it's incredibly fast.

349
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,780
I just haven't had time to name it.

350
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,440
The fin contains wind element power.

351
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,180
At this tier, few artifacts can match its speed.

352
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,240
Wind Boat...

353
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,270
Let's call it Wind Boat!

354
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,960
What do you think?

355
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,310
Swift as the wind!

356
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,070
Great name!

357
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,260
Han, check these out too.

358
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,020
These are Drake Daggers,
made from the Drake's fangs.

359
00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:00,050
This is White Scale Shield,
crafted from its toughest outer scale.

360
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,070
And this one is Azure Smoke,

361
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,750
condensed from the Drake's venom.

362
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,810
It should help you catch your enemies off guard.

363
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,750
Qi, you actually managed

364
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,480
to finish all this in 15 days!

365
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,640
I'm seriously impressed.

366
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,400
I should be thanking you
for that Millennium Spirit Herb.

367
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,680
Ru Yin's condition has improved,

368
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,790
so I could focus on crafting these.

369
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,370
Ru Yin?

370
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,350
You risked everything just to save her.

371
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,330
She must be the one you love, right?

372
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,890
I bet you've got someone special too.

373
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:01,200
 

374
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,180
Wind Boat...

375
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,880
A noble spirit within,

376
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,020
the wind carries me far and free!

377
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,880
You're the one asking to see our young master?

378
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Spit it out.

379
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,160
It's raining and cold too!

380
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,260
Weather changes fast these days.

381
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,240
Bamboo Sect marked me with a tracking seal.

382
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,070
They'll keep hunting me down.

383
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,590
If Ghost Spirit Sect can shelter me,

384
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,810
I'll offer the Yellow Maple Valley map
in exchange!

385
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,720
Not bad.

386
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,680
You've come to the right place!

387
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,660
Bamboo Sect...

388
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,510
Boss! Awesome!

389
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,310
My boss is seriously amazing!

390
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,780
The hat.

391
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,160
You're not messing with me, right?

392
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,890
No way!

393
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,110
This issue is easy to handle.

394
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,090
Right? So...

395
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,460
Relax, sir.

396
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,500
Someone's around. Run!

397
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,810
I didn't expect it.

398
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,000
You're not just a demonic spy,

399
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,270
you're with Bamboo Sect too!

400
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,750
Ye, you've hidden too well all these years!

401
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,960
Wu,

402
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,610
you know too much!

403
00:34:54,223 --> 00:34:59,243
All these years, you've been blocking my profits.

404
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,810
I should've killed you long ago.

405
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,160
So this is who you really are.

406
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,500
I'll never let you off!

407
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,530
Kill him.

408
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,660
Kill him!

409
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,850
Die!

410
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,370
Mentor Wu!

411
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,840
Han Li!

412
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,840
Go tell the Sect Leader that he's a traitor!

413
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,220
He's working with demonic cultivators
disguised as Spirit Beast Mountain disciples!

414
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,280
Too late!

415
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,330
Die with him!

416
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,220
Mentor Wu! Grab me!

417
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,890
Take them down!

418
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,800
Mentor! Hang in there!

419
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,920
My cavern's just ahead.

420
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,190
There are pills that can save you!

421
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,400
Forget about me.

422
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,670
There's no time... Tell Master Zhong,

423
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,840
the demonic sects planted spies
in the Seven Sects!

424
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,320
That Ye guy is one of them!

425
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,190
The other sects are probably infiltrated too.

426
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,920
Don't let them strike from inside and out!

427
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,930
And, keep a close eye on Spirit Beast Mountain!

428
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,410
Enough talking. Save your strength!

429
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,780
Mentor Wu!

430
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,360
Han Li!

431
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,190
Give it up.

432
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,360
That array won't protect you.

433
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,440
Today, you won't make it out alive!

434
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,400
No matter how hidden this place is,

435
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,000
it's still Yellow Maple Valley territory,

436
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,230
full of powerful cultivators!

437
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,890
Aren't you afraid someone might find out?

438
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,010
Still resisting on death's doorstep?

439
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,710
Kill him.

440
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,540
Blow it up!

441
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,320
 Only running at 20% power, 

442
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,150
 and it's already this strong. 

443
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,880
 A fully restored array will be perfect! 

444
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,590
 If I survive today, I swear
I'll finish restoring this array! 

445
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,480
Kid!

446
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,550
You've got quite the array here!

447
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,760
Hand it over to me.

448
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,450
This time, I'll let you live!

449
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,550
Want to learn it?

450
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,590
Kneel.

451
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,000
I'll teach you!

452
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,180
Dream on!

453
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,760
Han Li!

454
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,960
The array's starting to collapse!

455
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,060
You won't hold out much longer!

456
