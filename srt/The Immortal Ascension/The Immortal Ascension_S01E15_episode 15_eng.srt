1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,516
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:27,109
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:29,177
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:32,520
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,171
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:37,920
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,030
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,507
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,507 --> 00:00:50,960
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,920
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,281
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:05,542
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,256
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:13,620
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,720
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,960
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,120
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,034
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,960
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,060
 

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:20,150
Practicing dark arts, harming fellow disciples,

25
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,020
unforgivable!

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,650
Thank you for saving me, Mentor Hong Fu.

27
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,840
What happened?

28
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,846
Mentor Wu caught Ye meeting
someone from the demonic sects.

29
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,280
He tried to silence him.

30
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
I walked into it.

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,595
I meant to escort Mentor Wu to my cavern.

32
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:09,430
However, that traitor still took his life.

33
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,560
Those wicked cultivators won't get away with it.

34
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,780
Mentor Wu wanted me
to report it to the Sect Master.

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,000
The demonic sects had
planted spies in the Seven Sects.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,420
Also, Spirit Beast Mountain is suspicious.

37
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,070
So it really was him.

38
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,700
Fellow Han.

39
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,710
This matter is too important

40
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,285
for a Foundation Establishment Stage disciple
to get involved.

41
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:39,150
I will have it investigated.

42
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,000
Focus on your cultivation.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,950
Do not let word of this spread.

44
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,260
Yes.

45
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:52,235
I didn't expect that after years apart,

46
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:54,516
you would become Hua Yuan's disciple

47
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:56,960
and reach the Foundation Establishment.

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,620
I owe it to my master and
mentors for their guidance.

49
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,530
You sure know how to be polite.

50
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,650
Maybe back then, I underestimated you.

51
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:11,287
But don't forget the path of cultivation

52
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:13,058
is like rowing upstream.

53
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:15,120
Move forward, or fall behind.

54
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,930
You still need to keep up the good work.

55
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,740
I will keep that in mind.

56
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,630
Report Wu Mian's death to the sect.

57
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,580
Give him a proper burial.

58
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,200
 Mentor Wu, 

59
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,980
 this is the other half of the moxa stick
I used on you. 

60
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,410
Mentor Wu,

61
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:37,321
you told me to start calling you Senior Wu.

62
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,797
But I still want to call you Mentor.

63
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,740
If you hadn't reminded me to switch the formation,

64
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,610
I wouldn't have survived yesterday's battle.

65
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,290
Look.

66
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,360
We are near my cavern.

67
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,970
The view is beautiful.

68
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,011
It's the view you always liked.

69
00:06:12,011 --> 00:06:14,240
It has the stream you loved.

70
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,780
And the rock where you used to sit.

71
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,460
Han Li.

72
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,200
It's pouring out here.

73
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,720
Stop standing there!

74
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,380
Head back now!

75
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,657
From now on, you may call me Mentor Wu.

76
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:57,513
Welcome to Yellow Maple Valley.

77
00:06:57,513 --> 00:07:00,114
Whether you reach Foundation Establishment or not,

78
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:03,040
this Foundation Pill must be kept safe.

79
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,750
If you need money, go to Baiji Hall

80
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,270
and take more jobs.

81
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,040
Just say I sent you.

82
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,240
Your spiritual aura is still too thin.

83
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,410
Channel it into your feet, and try again.

84
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,240
Your spirit root may be weak,
but you are diligent.

85
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,170
With time, you will become great.

86
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,570
Mentor Wu.

87
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,090
You really cared about me.

88
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,641
What path

89
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:51,962
 
should Yan Clan Stronghold take going forward?

90
00:07:51,962 --> 00:07:54,892
Everyone, what are your thoughts?

91
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,830
My Lord, the stronghold has always been

92
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,240
the Yue Kingdom's first line of defense
against the demonic sects.

93
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,870
If we defect, won't Yue Kingdom
be completely exposed?

94
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,480
It would give the demonic sects free access.

95
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,950
That's right.

96
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,870
300 years ago,

97
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,040
we broke free from the grip
of the Six Demonic Sects.

98
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,940
There's no way we would join them again.

99
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,780
What is good and what is evil?

100
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,875
It all comes down to who wins and who loses.

101
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,996
A thousand years ago,

102
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:36,391
the Seven Sects were nothing
more than rebels of the Six Sects.

103
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,251
And now they claim to be righteous?

104
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,201
Young Lady Yan is gravely ill.

105
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:45,931
The Seven Sects have done nothing to help.

106
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:48,630
Where is the Blood Spirit Flower they promised?

107
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,430
Do they truly not have it?

108
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,040
Or are they afraid the Yan Clan will have
a Nascent Soul cultivator

109
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,440
and turn the Seven Sects into Eight?

110
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,390
The Six Sects have always welcomed those

111
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,190
who turn to the light.

112
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,870
I speak on behalf of my father,

113
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,240
Sect Leader Wang Tian Gu of the Ghost Spirit Sect.

114
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,070
I promise you all,

115
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,160
if the Yan Clan Stronghold
returns to the Virtuous Sect,

116
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,190
we will treat you as equals.

117
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,270
All cultivation resources and supreme techniques

118
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,070
will be shared with you.

119
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,600
We will be equals.

120
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,970
What say you?

121
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,351
Are these terms not generous enough?

122
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,920
- How can we trust you?
- Yeah.

123
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,160
That's right. Why should we trust you?

124
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,600
The Truedeath Oath!

125
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,000
It's the Truedeath Oath!

126
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,410
My Lord!

127
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,800
- My Lord!
- That's right.

128
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,480
Young Master Wang swore that oath with me.

129
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,290
He staked his life to earn our trust.

130
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,330
He is willing to bet his life
that he can cure Yan.

131
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,780
With such courage, even I have to respect him.

132
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,670
All of you have followed me for many years.

133
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,120
There is no harm in trusting me one more time.

134
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,150
I hope you will keep your promise today.

135
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,840
Do not let us down.

136
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,390
Of course.

137
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,080
From now on, we are one family.

138
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
I also hope the senior members here

139
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,080
will not hesitate to lend a hand.

140
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,510
After all, Yan Clan Stronghold
and Ghost Spirit Sect

141
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,500
are united as one.

142
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,780
We share glory and hardship.

143
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
 The fight paid off. 

144
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,960
 I got the Great Deployment Art from Ye. 

145
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,810
 So all those wooden carvings of his 

146
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,000
 were actually puppets. 

147
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,260
Don't move.

148
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,020
Something feels off.

149
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,800
You're jealous.

150
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,580
I'm carving you, and you're jealous?

151
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,260
Play elsewhere.

152
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,390
Just go.

153
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,810
Go now.

154
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,320
Fine.

155
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,410
If you won't go, I will.

156
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,930
I played the wrong tile.

157
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,020
- Mine.
- Hong Fu.

158
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,780
West Wind.

159
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,780
West Wind.

160
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,410
Red Dragon.

161
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,200
- Don't waste your time.
- Four Characters.

162
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,681
This tile was carved from the bones
of a Level Four demon beast.

163
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:26,769
Specifically made to prevent cheaters like you.

164
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:29,429
No wonder I couldn't see anything.

165
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,910
Come on, old gambler,
we're betting on medicinal wine.

166
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,670
Do you have to be this guarded?

167
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,750
Look at you. You live life
tight-fisted and stingy.

168
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,320
No wonder Fairy Nangong stopped coming.

169
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,360
Save it.

170
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,435
Nangong was unfortunately injured.

171
00:12:45,435 --> 00:12:48,240
Then, she fought with that demonic spy.

172
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,720
Now she's healing.

173
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,670
Otherwise, you wouldn't be sitting at this table.

174
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,270
You're just afraid I'll win.

175
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,200
Everyone knows in mahjong,

176
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,550
you feed the player before you,

177
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,670
block the one after you.

178
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,270
Stop the one across from you.

179
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,330
I wonder if Elder Han
thinks the same way about the three of us.

180
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,000
It was my failure to discipline the sect.

181
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,930
I let a demonic spy
slip into Spirit Beast Mountain.

182
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,880
So you're saying
you've already identified the spy?

183
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,320
A Qi Refining disciple named Zhong Wu.

184
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,600
He let the demonic sects
into the Bloody Trial Ground.

185
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,670
I wanted to interrogate him, but he escaped

186
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,120
before I could catch him.

187
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,260
But I issued a wanted notice.

188
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,550
A Qi Refining disciple managed to escape
from Spirit Beast Mountain?

189
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,620
And you still haven't found him?

190
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,500
Chick.

191
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,550
I'll do everything to find him

192
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,550
and clear the Spirit Beast Mountain's name.

193
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,450
You will have justice.

194
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,220
Draw a tile.

195
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,000
- Nine Characters.
- The name Zhong Wu reminded me of something.

196
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,129
In my sect, a Foundation Establishment cultivator

197
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:55,600
named Ye disappeared.

198
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,720
Before he vanished, a disciple saw him

199
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,030
talking with two people dressed like
Spirit Beast Mountain disciples.

200
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,550
Hurry up! Come on!

201
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,500
Could it be Zhong Wu again?

202
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,900
Sorry. Self-draw.

203
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,840
Fu Yun Zi, were you even listening?

204
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,550
I heard you. But I was playing too.

205
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,910
Exactly. We're discussing serious matters here.

206
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,910
It doesn't stop us from playing. I won.

207
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,000
That was a winning hand.

208
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,200
You're cheating again.

209
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,630
What kind of... Alright.

210
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,910
Just hurry up already.

211
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,320
You.

212
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,150
Come on.

213
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,960
Listen up.

214
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,670
Just like what Hong Fu said, that guy named Ye,

215
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,400
and also your guy, Zhong Wu,

216
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,360
are lurking all throughout the Seven Sects.

217
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,480
There are too many.

218
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,030
So, we must all stay alert.

219
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,200
Including against them.

220
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,030
What? Can't I be a little sneaky at the game?

221
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,630
Hong Fu, Li, and Fu Yun Zi,

222
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,550
we've all been good friends for years.

223
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,440
The demonic sects are our sworn enemies.

224
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,000
I can't speak for others, but as long as I live,

225
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,380
I won't let them take Spirit Beast Mountain.

226
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,520
Even though strange things have happened lately,

227
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,670
I, Hong Fu, have never once doubted you.

228
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,050
Don't take any offense.

229
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:24,440
- Master.
- Xuan Er.

230
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,425
- Just picked this for you.
- I don't want it.

231
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,400
- Mentor.
- No.

232
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,441
We're busy here.

233
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:30,562
Off you go now.

234
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,683
Official business.

235
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:32,834
Go on.

236
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:33,984
Alright.

237
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,315
That kid is sweet.

238
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:38,605
Yeah.

239
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:41,390
Given what happened today,

240
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,240
should we have the disciples leave the room?

241
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,000
Why?

242
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,510
She's fine.

243
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,870
She's not the type to care about what we say.

244
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,960
Exactly.

245
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,550
My disciple just reached
the Foundation Establishment Stage.

246
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,200
Her progress has completely stalled.

247
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,750
It's driving me crazy.

248
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,910
That's easy, Hong Fu.

249
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,800
Just find her a...

250
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,960
a companion.

251
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,140
A companion.

252
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,200
Master. Mentor.

253
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,600
The Sect Master wants you to have this.

254
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,860
What is it?

255
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:12,620
Blank tile.

256
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,790
 

257
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,650
That's great news.

258
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,360
Hong Fu, look.

259
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,480
Shouldn't Yellow Maple Valley send someone
with a gift as well?

260
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,840
They have a wedding.

261
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,260
Let me see it.

262
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,240
The Lord of the Yan Clan Stronghold
is marrying off his daughter.

263
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,960
Ru Yan is getting married.

264
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,510
- Wonderful!
- Right, Wu Xuan, go gather the disciples.

265
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,530
- Yes, Master.
- Come on.

266
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,620
- You sure you've got the right number of cards?
- No.

267
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,170
This is all your fault.

268
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,371
 The Great Deployment Art
can temper the spirit sense, 

269
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:55,870
 and help with the Projection Technique. 

270
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,467
 Even in battle, it can control more puppets. 

271
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,600
 That's incredible. 

272
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,570
 I wonder what brilliant mind created this. 

273
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,380
Get up!

274
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,740
I must expand my spirit sense a bit more.

275
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,080
 Han Li. 

276
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,930
 Come over here. 

277
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,290
Master is looking for me?

278
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,440
Over here.

279
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,383
Master. You called?

280
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,040
We've been waiting. Hurry.

281
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,340
Stand still.

282
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,900
Here's the thing.

283
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,080
The young Lord of Yan Clan Stronghold, Yan Ru Yan,

284
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,440
is getting married soon.

285
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,910
So,

286
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,960
the Lord of Yan Clan sent us an invitation.

287
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,670
Each sect needs to send representatives

288
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,550
to attend the wedding banquet.

289
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,560
Mentor Hong Fu is sending Xuan Er.

290
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,240
One more spot left.

291
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,100
Now tell me, who wants to go?

292
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,590
Here, Hong Fu.

293
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,780
- Have some tea.
- Never mind.

294
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,890
See?

295
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,370
Just as I thought.

296
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,751
Song Meng is too aggressive.

297
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:56,750
And Wei Niang is way too naive.

298
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,110
As for Jing,

299
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,310
he's too rigid.

300
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,280
Not very adaptable.

301
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,640
- Now, you two...
- Master.

302
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,310
My cultivation is lacking.

303
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,070
I'm bad at socializing.

304
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,550
This mission is important.

305
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:14,110
You need proper etiquette,
and look after Senior Dong.

306
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,330
With all that, Senior Wu is the best fit.

307
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,350
Get back here.

308
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,440
Who told you to leave?

309
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,200
What you just said was wrong.

310
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,790
Xuan Er reached her stage later than you.

311
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,350
By the rules, she should be calling you senior.

312
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,200
Besides, from what I've seen,
you two are the only ones

313
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,220
she really talks to.

314
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,180
So...

315
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,980
Hong Fu,

316
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,440
you decide.

317
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,720
You want me to pick?

318
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,290
You make the call.

319
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,370
I pick Han Li.

320
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,830
That boy isn't much to look at,

321
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,700
but he seems steady enough.

322
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,727
Hong Fu, you have great eyes.

323
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:10,960
This kid has always been levelheaded.

324
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,806
- Reminds me of my younger days.
- Alright then.

325
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:15,200
- It's settled.
- Indeed.

326
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,880
If there's nothing else, we'll go now.

327
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,920
Come on, Xuan Er. We'll each prepare our gifts.

328
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,240
Sure. Sure.

329
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,550
Han Li, prepare the gift.

330
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,440
- Hong Fu, I'll walk you out.
- No need.

331
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,830
- We're headed the same way.
- Let's go.

332
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,220
Han,

333
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,750
it's a big responsibility to protect Xuan Er.

334
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,000
Let's go.

335
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,400
Oh, right. Prepare a proper gift.

336
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,330
- So naggy.
- Let's move.

337
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,835
Just my luck.

338
00:20:45,835 --> 00:20:47,895
Now I have to bring a gift too.

339
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,400
No way.

340
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,980
I must ask Master for a reward in return.

341
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,471
I saw people from the Yan Clan Stronghold.

342
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,310
Does that mean Qing came back too?

343
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,440
They delivered a wedding invite.

344
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,720
A wedding invite?

345
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,700
Yan Ru Yan is getting married.

346
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,775
That is so sudden.

347
00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:11,776
Lately, Ru Yan has only
been focused on cultivating.

348
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:13,966
Marriage is the last thing on her mind.

349
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,652
Master, about the wedding trip...

350
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:23,960
During this journey, you must
look after your junior Xuan Er.

351
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,160
Do not give your Mentor Hong Fu
any reason to worry.

352
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,660
Your wish is my command.

353
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,110
But the thing is, I've only mastered one thing

354
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,920
that you taught me.

355
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,220
If something happens on the road with Xuan Er,

356
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,700
I'm afraid I might not be much help.

357
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,590
You rascal.

358
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,850
You look so honest,
but you have plenty of schemes.

359
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,000
You sound like my disciple.

360
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,180
Come here.

361
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,790
I did promise to teach you a new skill

362
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,890
upon reaching Foundation Establishment.

363
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,200
It's all here.

364
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,480
Pick one.

365
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,090
Thank you, Master.

366
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,940
Only one.

367
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,420
 

368
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,350
 

369
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,880
 Restoration Technique. 

370
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,400
 Phantom Technique. 

371
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,495
 Both are pretty solid. 

372
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:44,200
 But they don't really stand out
in any special way. 

373
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,000
 The included techniques
are a shield and a phantom clone. 

374
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,530
 But those are part of the Cyan Sword Technique. 

375
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,700
 These two don't seem worth picking. 

376
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,550
 This silver page looks a lot like
the golden one I found in the Trial Ground. 

377
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,420
 I wonder if there's any connection. 

378
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,046
Master, I picked this one.

379
00:23:15,046 --> 00:23:16,636
You've decided?

380
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:19,720
Are you sure?

381
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,980
I'm sure.

382
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,960
Out of all these techniques, you picked none

383
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,160
and went straight for that one?

384
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,360
That's a surprise to me.

385
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,290
Do you have a sharp eye, or just good luck?

386
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,130
Just lucky.

387
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,310
Alright then.

388
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,750
Hurry back and get ready.

389
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,720
Set out as soon as you can.

390
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,290
Yes, Master.

391
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,020
That's my disciple.

392
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,270
 The golden page I got 

393
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,833
 and the silver one Master gave me... 

394
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:16,354
 This silver page feels heavier than the gold one. 

395
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,044
 Channeling spiritual energy. 

396
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,700
It's the complete Cyan Sword Technique!

397
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,115
Qingzhu Swarm Sword.

398
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:24,165
A Core Formation Stage treasure.

399
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,440
 A full set has 12 swords. 

400
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,245
 Several sets can be deployed at once. 

401
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:33,455
 If I can craft one too, that will be amazing. 

402
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,835
 Triple Cycle Core Rebirth. 

403
00:25:50,835 --> 00:25:53,485
 Is this an auxiliary art
to the Cyan Sword Technique? 

404
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,720
 When I reach Tier Six, 

405
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,270
 as the peak of Foundation Establishment, 

406
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,000
 I must disperse my power. 

407
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,200
 Repeat this three times, 

408
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,290
 and Core Formation will be reached. 

409
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,270
 I started dispersing my power at Tier 4. 

410
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,960
 So it was meant to compress spiritual power 

411
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
 and form cultivation core. 

412
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,920
 Someone used this to overcome
the Core Formation bottleneck... 

413
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,510
 The founder of the Cyan Sword Technique
was truly brilliant. 

414
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:35,050
 But then again, this means
I must redo it three times. 

415
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,050
 Can I really do that in this lifetime? 

416
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,160
You little rascal.

417
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,700
You should be guarding the door.

418
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,790
Han! It's us.

419
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,260
Han!

420
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,830
- This cavern is huge.
- What a nice place.

421
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,240
- Really nice.
- Han.

422
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,720
This cavern of yours is impressive.

423
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,880
Is that the spirit spring?

424
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,460
Spirit spring!

425
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,530
It really is.

426
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,460
 Can't let them see my herb garden. 

427
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,200
My seniors.

428
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,720
- Look at this water.
- Not bad, right?

429
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,440
I can't believe there is one here.

430
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,130
My seniors!

431
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,810
What brings you here?

432
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,400
Where is Senior Wu?

433
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,692
Wu Xuan is...

434
00:27:44,692 --> 00:27:48,780
Han, what gift are you bringing to the wedding?

435
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,780
I almost forgot about that.

436
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,160
We're here to help you brainstorm.

437
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,440
I heard the bride from the Yan Clan

438
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,110
is a cultivator from the Moonshadow Sect.

439
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,172
You're skilled in alchemy.

440
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:02,160
Why not refine something
to aid in cultivation as a gift?

441
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,270
A gift should be practical.

442
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,070
You're the one talking nonsense.

443
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,720
They are marrying off a daughter.

444
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,750
Han is skilled in medicine and herbs.

445
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,640
He should make a nourishing beauty cream.

446
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,160
Now that's thoughtful.

447
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,200
Not everyone is staring at the mirror
all day like you.

448
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,160
- I just saw you looking in the mirror.
- Didn't I?

449
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,880
- When did I look in a mirror?
- Every day.

450
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,790
Alright. We're trying to help Han.

451
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,750
Quit messing around.

452
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,090
Han.

453
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,160
No matter what you prepare, just remember this.

454
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,420
You're representing Yellow Maple Valley.

455
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,590
I will keep that in mind.

456
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,270
One thing eludes me.

457
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,310
Seniors.

458
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,400
You seem very interested in this wedding,

459
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,200
so why did you dodge it when Master asked?

460
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,440
Well...

461
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,400
Of course we want to go for fun.

462
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,480
But didn't Mentor Hong Fu
name Dong Xuan Er to attend?

463
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,000
It wouldn't be right for us to go.

464
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,680
- Since Xuan Er is going, Wu Xuan will go too.
- Yes.

465
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,920
- And they...
- We don't want to see them all lovey-dovey.

466
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,350
You know, he'll be like this.

467
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,240
- Yeah! Exactly.
- Dong Xuan Er.

468
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,830
- Dong Xuan Er.
- Right?

469
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,350
How many times have I told you guys

470
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,350
not to talk about Wu Xuan behind his back?

471
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,960
- You bring him up every time.
- He does this.

472
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,110
- Right?
- That's exactly how he is.

473
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,030
- Am I wrong?
- You shouldn't badmouth him.

474
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,270
Come on. Say it to his face, then.

475
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,532
Don't badmouth him behind his back.

476
00:29:17,532 --> 00:29:19,330
Fine, I'll say it to his face!

477
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,810
Not this. I still need it.

478
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,310
The Mystic Shield.

479
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,550
That's my precious.

480
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,130
Where did you get it?

481
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,030
I really can't part with it.

482
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,570
It hurts my heart.

483
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,200
Those who want to go can't.

484
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,050
Those who don't still must cough up a treasure.

485
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,810
Maybe spirit herbs?

486
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,110
They aren't worth that much.

487
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,330
And I can grow more with the Green Vial.

488
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,980
You really don't waste any time.

489
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,370
You're giving it away?

490
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:22,440
Here.

491
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,115
Take a good look.

492
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:26,596
This spirit herb is over a hundred years old.

493
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:28,136
It's valuable.

494
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,820
And I'm just giving it away?

495
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,270
A barrier?

496
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,520
Han, are you there?

497
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,920
Open up and let me in!

498
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,000
It's me, Dong Xuan Er!

499
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,940
Come on, open the door!

500
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,790
Little guy, you're way too cute.

501
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,500
Are you one of Han's friends too?

502
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm also one of his friends.

503
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,480
My name is Dong Xuan Er.

504
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,220
Can you help me open the barrier?

505
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,370
Thank you.

506
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,940
Han?

507
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,260
Han!

508
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,570
How did you get in here?

509
00:32:10,985 --> 00:32:12,275
Wow.

510
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:15,005
You'd betray your friends for a pretty face?

511
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,200
Come here.

512
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,720
Don't look. She's got enchantment.

513
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,400
Don't look at her.

514
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,440
Come on.

515
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,180
Snap out of it.

516
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:30,310
Han, I came to ask you for a spirit herb.

517
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,240
Every herb here has its purpose.

518
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,090
There are no extras.

519
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,830
Are you upset?

520
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,680
You're not happy going to the wedding with me?

521
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,960
Don't think I don't know what's on your mind.

522
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,790
You're annoyed with Senior Wu.

523
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,810
So, you're using me as a shield.

524
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,160
That's right. You're the only one in this valley

525
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,720
who doesn't chase me around.

526
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,460
Of course I'm using you as a shield.

527
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,440
Since I don't chase you, stay out of my business.

528
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,920
I'm not bothering you!

529
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,960
You're no fun.

530
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,550
Who'd want to go sightseeing with you?

531
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,870
It's just no fun.

532
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,830
If my master hadn't said it's safer with you,

533
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,810
I wouldn't want to travel with you at all.

534
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,440
Fine then.

535
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,200
Let's make some ground rules.

536
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,070
We each mind our own business on the road.

537
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,500
Deal.

538
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,410
Can you really stick to that?

539
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,520
You spend all day with such a boring guy.

540
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,410
Poor little thing.

541
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:53,200
My master said we need to dress properly
for the wedding.

542
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,180
Aren't you going to change?

543
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,140
I think this looks fine.

544
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,650
 Guess I was too subtle. 

545
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,410
I'll go get changed.

546
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,130
Alright, I'm off.

547
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,110
I'm leaving now. I'll come play with you later.

548
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,540
Bye.

549
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,910
Look.

550
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,930
It's Han and Dong.

551
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,850
They are leaving for the Yan Clan Stronghold.

552
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,170
Han, are you giving that spirit herb to the bride?

553
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,070
Han, do you know why I chose you

554
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,480
to come with me this time?

555
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,910
You already said it.

556
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,910
I'm your human shield.

557
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,540
That's true, but there's another important reason.

558
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,540
Take a guess.

559
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,590
I have no idea.

560
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,630
Because you're the only one
who looks at me normally

561
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,060
and talks to me like a regular person.

562
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,550
Don't blame others for that.

563
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:24,040
Even dung beetles are attracted to you.

564
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,520
It's not just dung beetles.

565
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,150
Look at the flowers, plants,

566
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,390
and your Treasure-Hunting Mouse.

567
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,170
They all like me too.

568
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:38,030
But still, sometimes I really wish people

569
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,130
could treat me like they treat anyone else.

570
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,030
Ordinary life is harder than you think.

571
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,950
Besides, those seniors
and juniors try to please you

572
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,080
because of your enchantment.

573
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,610
They can't help it.

574
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,800
I see.

575
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,452
So in your eyes, I'm someone

576
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:04,240
who can't make friends without using enchantment?

577
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,310
You know whether you used it or not.

578
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,350
Even my mouse opened the gate for you.

579
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,690
I didn't use enchantment on it.

580
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,210
You didn't?

581
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,280
I'm done talking to you.

582
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,560
Right now, you just look plain and dull.

583
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,380
You're boring me.

584
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,540
Great.

585
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,510
But I have to warn you,

586
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,470
you shouldn't use enchantment carelessly.

587
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,380
You'll get yourself in trouble.

588
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,160
And how's that your business?

589
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,990
This enchantment is part of me.

590
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,340
It's not like I can choose to have it.

591
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,120
I'm Feng Jun of the Yan Clan Stronghold.

592
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,950
Are you here for the wedding banquet?

593
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,210
Correct.

594
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,390
So it's Han and Dong from Yellow Maple Valley.

595
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,080
Wait here.
I'll register you and arrange your lodging.

596
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,350
Upper City.

597
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,020
Register them.

598
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,240
 

599
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,990
Even the tokens are made of jade.

600
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,080
The Yan Clan Stronghold sure is extravagant.

601
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,120
Sorry for the wait.

602
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,510
This is your city access pass.

603
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,430
You can use it to stay at a designated inn.

604
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,160
Hold onto it.

605
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,580
Feng, why are our tokens different from theirs?

606
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,800
Apologies. There are more guests
than we had expected.

607
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,000
Only the inns in the Lower City still have rooms.

608
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,080
I see.

609
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,900
Why can't we stay in the Upper City?

610
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,910
Please don't worry.

611
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,310
Aside from the location, all the inns were chosen

612
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,240
by the Lord of the Stronghold.

613
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,950
We've even arranged a fireworks show tonight.

614
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,720
You'll both enjoy it.

615
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,650
Thank you, Feng.

616
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,580
Feng, are the Upper City guest rooms really full?

617
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:23,730
Are you sure?

618
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,080
I'm such an idiot.

619
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,160
How could I let such a beautiful lady
stay in the Lower City?

620
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,470
Isn't there still one upper room left?

621
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,640
Let her have it. Quick.

622
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,760
Here you go.

623
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,690
Thank you, Feng.

624
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,713
Who is that girl?

625
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:05,603
You're blaming me
for using enchantment again, aren't you?

626
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,390
The gift of enchantment?

627
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,540
Could she be connected to that old man?

628
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,640
Interesting.

629
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,090
Looks like it's about time
someone taught that old man a lesson.

630
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,390
 Mid Foundation Establishment Stage. 

631
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,090
 Don't look. Let's go. 

632
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,620
 

633
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,870
Shopkeeper.

634
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,290
- One room.
- Coming, sir.

635
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,310
Are you two staying together?

636
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,870
We'll stay separately.

637
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,200
Separately?

638
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
But I'm afraid we only have one room left.

639
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,910
- It's fine. Then...
- You take it.

640
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,280
I'll stay elsewhere.

641
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,310
You're clearly avoiding me

642
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,510
to ditch me in any way you can.

643
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,280
Shopkeeper, show me the room.

644
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,460
Right away.

645
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,030
Fine then. Let's stick to the rules we agreed on.

646
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,860
We'll mind our own business.

647
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,610
Don't come looking for me.

648
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,640
All the guests here are from the Seven Sects.

649
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,390
There are even patrols outside.

650
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,800
It should be a safe place.

651
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,430
Let her calm down on her own.

652
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,210
I'll take a breather too.

653
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,830
Sir, don't get upset.

654
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,200
Cheer her up. She'll be fine.

655
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,800
No lasting grudges between companions.

656
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,350
Exactly.

657
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,680
Sorry you had to witness that.

658
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,120
She's my junior, not my companion.

659
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,200
Really not?

660
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,760
Are you sure?

661
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,420
Definitely not.

662
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,560
You lost the bet.

663
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,210
Hand over the gems.

664
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,200
I'm Han Li.

665
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,240
May I know how to address you?

666
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,870
 
Wu You Zi from Clear Void Sect.

667
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,810
 
Ba Chu Shui from the Giant Sword Sect.

668
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,030
You're also here for the Yan Clan wedding?

669
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,810
Not exactly.

670
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,350
Han, a word in private.

671
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,250
Please.

672
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:25,990
Han,

673
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:29,090
have you heard any rumors
about the Yan Clan Stronghold lately?

674
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,120
They say this place is haunted by an evil.

675
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,120
They feed on mortals and low-level cultivators,

676
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,310
killing for pleasure.

677
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,760
For the past three months,

678
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,240
people have died every night.

679
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,560
All while a Core Formation cultivator

680
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,680
was guarding this place?

681
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,950
The victims were mortals
and low-level cultivators.

682
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,910
Lord Yan is too busy marrying off his daughter.

683
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,870
But rumor has it
that to prevent evil from causing chaos,

684
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,080
during tomorrow's wedding,

685
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,310
Lord Yan will activate
a powerful protective array.

686
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,870
As for the two of us,

687
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,130
we're here to catch the evil spirit.

688
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:06,560
If you're interested, do join us, Han.

689
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,950
I just arrived, and I need some rest tonight.

690
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,120
So I'll pass for now.

691
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,870
Goodbye.

692
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,030
Take care, Han.

693
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,250
Safe travels.

694
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,770
 An evil spirit? 

695
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,830
 Feasting on mortals
and low-level cultivators? 

696
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,200
 I've never heard of this before. 

697
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,200
 Just to be safe, I'd better look around 

698
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,130
 and get a feel for the place. 

699
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:59,846
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

700
00:42:59,846 --> 00:43:05,687
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

701
00:43:05,687 --> 00:43:09,240
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫ 

702
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,680
 ♫ Old scenes rise again ♫ 

703
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,042
 ♫ Too hard to forget ♫ 

704
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:19,827
 ♫ Easier just to miss ♫ 

705
00:43:19,827 --> 00:43:26,480
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

706
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,228
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

707
00:43:32,228 --> 00:43:35,766
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

708
00:43:35,766 --> 00:43:38,160
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

709
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,397
 ♫ Eyes once looked far ♫ 

710
00:43:41,397 --> 00:43:45,838
 ♫ Now lost in the shift ♫ 

711
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:48,959
 ♫ Autumn winds stir ♫ 

712
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,480
 ♫ Smoke curls once more ♫ 

713
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,440
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫ 

714
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,520
 ♫ Returning to my eyes ♫ 

715
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,801
 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫ 

716
00:44:01,801 --> 00:44:04,960
 ♫ Time lost its name ♫ 

717
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,201
 ♫ Was it yesterday ♫ 

718
00:44:08,201 --> 00:44:12,280
 ♫ Or tomorrow? ♫ 

719
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,720
 ♫ The world has changed ♫ 

720
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,940
 ♫ Beyond recall ♫ 

721
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,920
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

722
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,401
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

723
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:29,134
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

724
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:35,240
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫ 

725
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,652
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

726
00:44:38,652 --> 00:44:42,087
 ♫ we call eternity ♫ 

727
00:44:42,087 --> 00:44:48,012
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

728
00:44:48,012 --> 00:44:51,807
 ♫ called eternity ♫
