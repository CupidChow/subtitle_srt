1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,480
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,120
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,161
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:32,546
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:36,140
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,880
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,951
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:46,520
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,920
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,245
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:01,273
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:05,753
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,296
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:13,682
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:15,780
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,100
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,300
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,980
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,972
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,972 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,980
 

23
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,560
Xuan.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,440
What about the two from Yellow Maple Valley?

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,280
Lv, calm down.

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,970
We can find an opening
to ditch the Foundation Establishment cultivators.

28
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,250
Xuan Er!

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,850
- Xuan Er!
- Dong Xuan Er?

30
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,000
Xuan Er. What happened to you?

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,390
Dong Xuan Er.

32
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,670
Senior Wu.

33
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,320
Hurry.

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,640
- Senior Han is...
- What happened to Han Li?

35
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,280
He needs your help now.

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,780
Where is he?

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,920
Xuan Er. Xuan Er, what's wrong?

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,560
Everyone, Xuan Er escaped
from the Yan Clan Stronghold.

39
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,510
I must send her to the Valley.

40
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,840
Go now.

41
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,700
We'll go rescue Han.

42
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,420
Xuan Er...

43
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,290
I feel much better now.

44
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:40,200
The demonic sects might be on the way back.

45
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,900
I should take a detour.

46
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,240
My seniors, aren't we going to rescue Han?

47
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,810
This is the wrong way.

48
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,840
Chen.

49
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,360
The elder sent us a message.

50
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,030
The Yan Clan Stronghold owns a gem quarry nearby.

51
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,120
The demonic sects must not seize it.

52
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,490
We are ordered to take it immediately.

53
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,160
Han Li? Why are you here?

54
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,681
What is she doing here?

55
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:31,111
Senior Chen.

56
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,000
Is he from the Yellow Maple Valley?

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,360
I am Lv Tian Meng from Spirit Beast Mountain.

58
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,900
I am Xuan Yue from Moonshadow Sect.

59
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,460
I am Han Li from Yellow Maple Valley.

60
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,460
I escaped from the Yan Clan Stronghold.

61
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,430
Han.

62
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,750
Are you alright?

63
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,090
You look badly hurt.

64
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,190
No one else can find out
about the change in our route.

65
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,250
We must keep this person here.

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,800
Agreed.

67
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,870
What's with these two?

68
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,371
This is weird.

69
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:13,120
For you to escape the Yan Clan Stronghold

70
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,590
proves you are highly capable.

71
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,800
The rest of us were sent
on a mission by the Seven Sects.

72
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,430
Things are urgent right now.

73
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,280
Join us. We can watch each other's backs.

74
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,590
Senior Xuan.

75
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,280
Since Han is injured,
he should return to the Valley.

76
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,090
We can handle the mission.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,080
Chen.

78
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,680
The coalition gave an order.

79
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,000
All Foundation Establishment disciples
were assigned missions.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,090
Lv has the coalition's official dispatch as proof.

81
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,960
Han.

82
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,880
Please lend us a hand.

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,630
Please don't turn us down.

84
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,310
 It seems they are ready to accuse me. 

85
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,360
-  If I refuse ...
- Han.

86
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,270
 - To help them. 
- Please.

87
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,560
 No choice then. 

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,310
 I'll play it by ear. 

89
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,720
I accept the order.

90
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,050
I'll go with you.

91
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,360
 Senior Chen. What's going on with these two? 

92
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,430
 We were originally ordered 

93
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,510
 to scout the Yan Clan Stronghold. 

94
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,600
 But they suddenly changed course. 

95
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,270
 They claimed to have received 

96
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,830
 an order to seize a gem quarry. 

97
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,530
 A gem quarry? 

98
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,160
 The Yan Clan Stronghold is overrun. 

99
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,510
 With just a few of us, even if we take it, 

100
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,260
 can we hold it? 

101
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,360
Why did you come?

102
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,950
I couldn't just let you
rescue them on your own.

103
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,510
Don't worry, I can handle it alone.

104
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,240
The big battle is coming.

105
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,720
We need you at the front lines to hold the fort.

106
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,000
We don't even know
how many enemies are coming this time.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,260
I heard that person leading them.

108
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,020
That is the very reason I must go.

109
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,650
 Siding with the demonic sects... 

110
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,500
- Xuan Er!
- Are they back?

111
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,000
- Xuan Er!
- Master! Master!

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,430
- Mentor.
- Mentor.

113
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,390
The Lord of the Yan Clan Stronghold
sided with the demonic sects.

114
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,360
Han fought to protect me so I could get back.

115
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,920
He's still fighting those villains.

116
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,560
Please go save him before it's too late.

117
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,630
Alright.

118
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,680
Understood.

119
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,390
Here, take this.

120
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,730
Quick.

121
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,190
He is in danger right now.

122
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,630
You must go help him.

123
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,020
Go, now.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,040
- Wu Xuan.
- Yes, Master.

125
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,680
Take good care of her.

126
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,310
Without your mentor's permission,

127
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,730
she is not to leave the Valley.

128
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,600
Stop standing there.

129
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,920
She just escaped death.

130
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,390
Do you think
she'll get that lucky again next time?

131
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,075
Yes, Master.

132
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:10,375
Hold her.

133
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,580
Alright. Xuan Er is safe.

134
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,760
But your disciple...

135
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,000
I sent Liu Jing to search for him.

136
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,870
That rascal is pretty clever.

137
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,070
Since he was able to get Xuan Er out,

138
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,850
he must be confident he can escape on his own too.

139
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,630
That would be best.

140
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,000
If he returns safely this time, as his mentor,

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,270
I'll have to reward him.

142
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,510
But with this turn of events,

143
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,750
Xuan Er's identity may be exposed.

144
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,020
If she runs into that person, what then?

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,120
Don't worry, Hong Fu.

146
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,390
With me here, I won't let anyone harm you two.

147
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,120
Quit acting like a hero.

148
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,950
Don't forget, you still can't beat me.

149
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,750
Give it a rest.

150
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,390
Enough. Don't worry.

151
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,000
The war is top priority.

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,310
We must head to the front lines,

153
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,140
and stop the demonic sects.

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,290
Exactly.

155
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,020
This is the place.

156
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,460
It seems the guards here are mostly mortals
and low-level cultivators.

157
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,680
Nightfall is near.

158
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,040
No time to waste.

159
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,800
Before the enemy army arrives,
we must take this place.

160
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,630
Senior Lv. Chen. Han.

161
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,430
The four of us Foundation Establishment
cultivators will lead the charge.

162
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,900
Any objections?

163
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,800
Come on. Brothers!

164
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,380
Drink up!

165
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,830
Come on!

166
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,650
Pour it!

167
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,780
Drink up! Hurry up!

168
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,050
Come on!

169
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,690

 ♫ It can't be seen, it can't be heard ♫

Senior Lv.

253
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,000
Han.

254
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,480
Not bad out there.

255
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,640
You flatter me.

256
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,440
They simply underestimated us.

257
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,120
Anyone who made it out of the Yan
Clan Stronghold alive is no ordinary man.

258
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,930
From now on, watch my back.

259
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,000
Glad we took it without trouble.

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,320
As ordered by our sect,
we'll hold this place as a base

261
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,870
and wait for reinforcements.

262
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,080
Well then, Chen, Han.

263
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,200
We'll leave the defenses to you.

264
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,080
Lv and I will scout the area nearby
in case any strays slipped through.

265
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,150
Alright.

266
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,290
Let's go.

267
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,910
Why are those two sneaking off?

268
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,740
Where are they going?

269
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,670
- Zhong Wu.
- Yes!

270
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,220
Yes! What are your orders?

271
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,480
Where is my wife?

272
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,980
Latest news is that she safely arrived
at the Six Sects' territory this morning.

273
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,480
As for Li Fei Yu... Still no sign?

274
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,150
Scouts reported.

275
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,570
No trace of Yellow Maple Valley
disciples on the run.

276
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,030
But they did spot a few cultivators
from the Seven Sects

277
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,510
heading southwest.

278
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,930
Southwest?

279
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,550
It's the Yan Clan Stronghold.

280
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,860
Why would those fools go there?

281
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,840
Let's find out.

282
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,320
Young Master.

283
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,510
There's nothing over there.

284
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,670
Just rocky mountains. Wide open too.

285
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,080
Are you sure we're going?

286
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,620
Sure! No harm in taking a look.

287
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,910
Stupid rock, worthless rock!

288
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,900
- Tripping Young Master!
- Shut up.

289
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,600
Contact our men at the base.

290
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,275
Find out what those fools are really up to.

291
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:38,200
As you say, Young Master.

292
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,120
There's a gem quarry there.

293
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,100
I'll send word right away.

294
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,200
Gem quarry?

295
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,740
A quarry it is!

296
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,410
What are we waiting for?

297
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,840
I was in charge of the gem trade between Yan Clan
and the Moonshadow Sect.

298
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,630
Now that they've sided with the demonic sects,

299
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,030
this ill-gotten wealth
is now earned fair and square.

300
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,360
Han from Yellow Maple Valley

301
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,750
may seem like nothing special,

302
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,720
but his strikes were sharp and clean.

303
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,910
He caught me by surprise.

304
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,240
So what if he's good?

305
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,600
We have orders from the sect.

306
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,630
Doesn't matter if he's elite or useless,

307
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,200
he still has to follow our lead.

308
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,670
Now, these gems seem to be under a seal.

309
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,870
We'll have to break it
before we can store these gems.

310
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,670
So, we need to act fast.

311
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,240
As I recall, you are quite
skilled with sealing spells.

312
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,320
So...

313
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,450
I leave the place in your hands now.

314
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,510
You've got a good eye, Xuan.

315
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,600
Before the demon brats get here,

316
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,960
let's grab much as we can.

317
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,530
But let's be clear.

318
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,510
Whatever we get this time, we split it 50-50.

319
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,930
I promise you will get a fair share.

320
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,690
You call the shots, Lv.

321
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,510
 The sentries are in position. 

322
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,620
 The defense array is ready. 

323
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,500
 Senior Chen truly lives up to her background. 

324
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,720
Mentor Chen.

325
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,530
The array has been set up.

326
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,550
We prepared plenty of gems.

327
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,330
There won't be any mishaps.

328
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,550
Our disciples are also on high alert.

329
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,290
Go on ahead. I'll go to you later.

330
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,570
Senior Chen, well done.

331
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,720
This place...

332
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,370
Han, I'm so glad you're alright.

333
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,740
How's your injury?

334
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,400
Thanks for your concern.

335
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,240
I'm alright now.

336
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,700
Good to hear.

337
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,030
It's only been a few days,

338
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,240
and you've already grown so skilled.

339
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,780
You must've suffered a lot.

340
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,070
You flatter me.

341
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,090
They are only some unremarkable tricks.

342
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,400
By the way, where are the two seniors?

343
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,290
Do you know their next plan?

344
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,550
When the seven sects coalition
was picking scout teams,

345
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,350
Senior Xuan and Senior Lv worked well together.

346
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,590
They volunteered.

347
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,880
But for some reason, they both disappeared

348
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,780
after arriving at the quarry.

349
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,070
This quarry is too important.

350
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,240
I doubt Yan Clan and the demonic sects
will just give it up.

351
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,330
Once they regroup, they will return.

352
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,790
This place has an array,
but against the demonic army

353
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,350
and Core Formation cultivators, it's not enough.

354
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,260
If things go south, we'll all
be trapped like fish in a barrel.

355
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,310
You're right.

356
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,110
It's not just about the defenses.

357
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,440
We need those two late Foundation
Establishment seniors

358
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,030
to lay down a solid plan.

359
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,480
I agree.

360
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,920
Let's split up.

361
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,960
Stay here.

362
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,350
Prepare the array.

363
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,940
I'll look for them.

364
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,850
Mentor Chen.

365
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:42,330
Mentor Chen. Where is the core
of the Four-Menace Array?

366
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,270
 This quarry is like a maze. 

367
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,290
 Where do these tunnels lead? 

368
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,070
 I've got a bad feeling. 

369
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,500
 Better find a spot to get ready. 

370
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,160
Nice and quiet here.

371
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,240
Perfect.

372
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,570
Time for my talismans and puppets.

373
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,050
Hey little guy, where did you come from?

374
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,040
You little rascal.

375
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,606
Impeccable timing.

376
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,740
All done.

377
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,530
With enough gems, this will do.

378
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,689
Alright, here's your task.

379
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:52,709
Scout out the quarry.

380
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,480
Great Deployment Art boosts my spiritual sense.

381
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,750
With my current strength, plus these puppets,

382
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,610
I can take on a mid Foundation
Establishment cultivator.

383
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,700
Who's there?

384
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,880
His spirit sense is strong.

385
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,740
Could he be in the late
Foundation Establishment?

386
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,020
No...

387
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,790
The moment he saw me, he bolted like the wind.

388
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,640
Could it be someone who knows me?

389
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,260
Young Master!

390
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,550
Young Master!

391
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,220
Young Master!

392
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,680
Young Master! Bad news!

393
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,240
- The quarry has been taken!
- By whom?

394
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,000
The guys from the Seven Sects!

395
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,750
The Seven Sects?

396
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,160
And he knows me...

397
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,400
The direction and distance match too...

398
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,510
Could it be you?

399
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,020
Li Fei Yu!

400
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,720
 That villain never stops haunting me. 

401
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,420
 I must leave. 

402
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,660
 Hope Senior Chen sees it and gets ready. 

403
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,050
Yellow Maple Valley's emergency flare!

404
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,830
Firing a signal at a time like this?

405
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,692
Those Yellow Maple Valley fools...

406
00:27:01,692 --> 00:27:04,280
Die, all of you!

407
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,410
Move out at full speed!

408
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,750
A Yellow Maple Valley's emergency flare!

409
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,110
Mentor Chen! Look, an emergency flare!

410
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,480
We're under attack! Quick!

411
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,000
Throw gems into the array core!

412
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,310
Activate the defense array!

413
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,940
Yes!

414
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,030
Senior Chen! We're under attack!

415
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,700
Was that your signal?

416
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,680
Do we have enough gems to power the array?

417
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,830
I sent people to collect a bunch.

418
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,590
But this quarry is huge. Many areas are empty.

419
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,830
It all depends on how many enemies there are.

420
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,780
At least a hundred but no siege weapons.

421
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,680
Saber-Shearing Sect, Giant Sword Sect!

422
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,550
Go look for more gems.

423
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,680
The others, keep powering the array!

424
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,090
Yes!

425
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,180
Finally activated.

426
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,200
This array is way too weak.

427
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,780
It's all low-level cultivators out there.

428
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,720
Are the seniors still not back?

429
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,030
I haven't seen them either.

430
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,370
Something's up. This is strange.

431
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,070
Senior Chen, we're from the same sect.

432
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,680
Let me offer a word.

433
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,110
When it gets critical, we can't count on others.

434
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,720
If things go south, retreat into the quarry.

435
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,460
You just might survive.

436
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,780
In a pinch, this might save you.

437
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,700
I'll go look for them.

438
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,420
Be careful, Han.

439
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,070
Everyone in the Seven Sects knows me.

440
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,830
You will get your share.

441
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,480
Wait, no! Yellow Maple Valley
just sent up a flare!

442
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,740
The demonic sects are here!

443
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,830
They are nothing.

444
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,270
What's the panic?

445
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,700
Keep working.

446
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,680
Of all times to show up... Why now, of all times?

447
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,960
Xuan, what do you think?

448
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,260
I'll follow your lead, Lv.

449
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,520
If the demonic sects send their main force,

450
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,880
our array won't stand a chance.

451
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,240
But if we pull everyone out,
the array will collapse.

452
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,350
Someone has to stay behind to cover the retreat.

453
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,640
Right.

454
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,330
Exactly right.

455
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:52,400
The sect only sent us here to gather intel.

456
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,590
As for where the gems end up, nobody will ask.

457
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,400
Not the Seven Sects, not the demonic sects,

458
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,610
and not the Yan Clan Stronghold.

459
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,050
However, the cultivators from the other sects

460
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,640
are a bit of a problem.

461
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,980
Lv,

462
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,720
under a falling nest, no egg survives.

463
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,880
But still, if we don't join the defense

464
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,310
and let Chen Qiao Qian go alone,

465
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,370
people will start suspecting us.

466
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,530
Got it.

467
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:34,240
How about you and I each send two men
to hold the fort?

468
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,370
That should shut everyone up.

469
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,370
Alright.

470
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,240
Xiao Liu, Xiao Qi.

471
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,720
Ian Yan, Ian Rong.

472
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,090
Listen up.

473
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,480
Right now, the quarry's under attack.

474
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,110
It's a matter of life and death.

475
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,110
Each of you, grab a box of gems.

476
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,550
Get to the main hall fast.

477
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,310
Power up the array.

478
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,570
Yes!

479
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,960
Go tell Chen Qiao Qian we'll be right there.

480
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,440
Yes!

481
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,810
You, start loading.

482
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,890
Yes!

483
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,550
Even the Four-Menace Array is used.

484
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,920
Looks like we picked the perfect time.

485
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,960
Right on time.

486
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,680
They activated the Four-Menace Array.

487
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,310
Li Fei Yu, you little pest!

488
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,750
I finally got you now.

489
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,240
I'll vanquish you.

490
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,960
Someone, tear open that turtle shell for me!

491
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,890
Come on! Break open Young Master's shell!

492
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,660
Now, open that turtle shell for the Young Master!

493
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,590
All disciples, listen up!

494
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,880
This quarry is crucial to our front line.

495
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,590
We can't lose it!

496
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,350
You two, keep powering the array.

497
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,700
The rest, defend with full power!

498
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,780
Yes!

499
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,220
Still putting up a fight, huh?

500
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,220
Scout ahead.

501
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,590
Lv, it's about time.

502
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,980
Let's pull out.

503
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,270
No choice now.

504
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,660
Let's go.

505
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,550
Young master!

506
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,750
Young master!

507
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,270
If this drags on, we'll be stuck forever.

508
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,240
How about I head back
and bring some siege gear?

509
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,550
Stop the barrage!

510
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,640
Cease fire!

511
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,110
Cease fire!

512
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,370
Cease fire! Stop it!

513
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,290
Look! The bombardment stopped!

514
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:28,920
The Four-Menace Array
isn't something a normal spell can break.

515
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,960
Could this be Yan Clan's parting gift to us?

516
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,000
Fight fire with fire!

517
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,500
Too bad it's burning through gems.

518
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,020
Prepare the Blue-Sun Blaze.

519
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,550
Did I hear that right?

520
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,920
Blue-Sun Blaze?

521
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,000
Young master.

522
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,550
That's a rare magic fire!

523
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,960
It's not worth using here!

524
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,850
Why do you care?

525
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,660
That's the Blue-Sun Blaze!

526
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,260
Keep going! Keep it up!

527
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,580
Hurry! Keep powering the defense array!

528
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,320
Are they freaks from the Demonic Flame Sect?

529
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,490
That blast has the might
of a Core Formation cultivator!

530
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,760
Where are Xuan Yue and Lv Tian Meng?

531
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Why are there only four of you?

532
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,960
They are still moving gems in the vault.

533
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,890
They will be here soon.

534
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,410
Keep bombing them.

535
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,710
When it gets critical, we can't count on others.

536
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,320
If things go south, retreat into the quarry.

537
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,550
You just might survive.

538
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,590
Everyone, listen up!

539
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,960
The enemies are too strong.

540
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,840
We can't hold this position.

541
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,670
Saving yourselves is what matters most.

542
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,590
Please don't hold back.

543
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,280
Channel all your gems into the formation.

544
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,100
Buy us some time.

545
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,450
Move! Fall back into the quarry!

546
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,580
Go!

547
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,920
This turtle shell won't hold.

548
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,880
Come on. It's a maze here.

549
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,400
Where is the treasure?

550
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,740
Almost there.

551
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,630
 Found them. 

552
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,480
 Creeping around like rats. 

553
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,000
 Looks like they've been here before. 

554
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,590
 Two late Foundation Establishment cultivators. 

555
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,070
 Two late Qi Refining cultivators. 

556
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,360
 That's trouble. 

557
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,510
 If they find out I know what they're up to, 

558
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,110
 they will silence me. 

559
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,000
 This is bad. 

560
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,260
 I'd better run. 

561
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,490
Young master, that was the third shot.

562
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,760
Our cultivators can't take much more.

563
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,440
What do you know?

564
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,960
Down there are the Seven Sects'
elite meatheads and Li Fei Yu!

565
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,550
He dies here today, no matter what.

566
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,540
Keep blasting!

567
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,060
Move in! Go!

568
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,800
Wait! Where is Mentor Chen?

569
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,480
Run! Head into the quarry!

570
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,490
- Hurry!
- Run!

571
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:54,364
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

572
00:41:54,364 --> 00:42:00,220
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

573
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,660
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫ 

574
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,192
 ♫ Old scenes rise again ♫ 

575
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:09,553
 ♫ Too hard to forget ♫ 

576
00:42:09,553 --> 00:42:14,680
 ♫ Easier just to miss ♫ 

577
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:21,080
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

578
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,653
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

579
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:30,299
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

580
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:32,720
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

581
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,880
 ♫ Eyes once looked far ♫ 

582
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,321
 ♫ Now lost in the shift ♫ 

583
00:42:40,321 --> 00:42:43,442
 ♫ Autumn winds stir ♫ 

584
00:42:43,442 --> 00:42:45,974
 ♫ Smoke curls once more ♫ 

585
00:42:45,974 --> 00:42:48,960
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫ 

586
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,800
 ♫ Returning to my eyes ♫ 

587
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,520
 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫ 

588
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,540
 ♫ Time lost its name ♫ 

589
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,780
 ♫ Was it yesterday ♫ 

590
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,700
 ♫ Or tomorrow? ♫ 

591
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,245
 ♫ The world has changed ♫ 

592
00:43:10,245 --> 00:43:12,340
 ♫ Beyond recall ♫ 

593
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,460
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

594
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,940
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

595
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,640
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

596
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:29,700
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫ 

597
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,212
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

598
00:43:33,212 --> 00:43:36,599
 ♫ we call eternity ♫ 

599
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,532
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

600
00:43:42,532 --> 00:43:46,319
 ♫ called eternity ♫
