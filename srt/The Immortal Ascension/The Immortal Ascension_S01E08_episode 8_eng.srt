OST Credit

3
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,505
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

4
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:27,101
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

5
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:29,164
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

6
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:32,531
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

7
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:36,160
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,080
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,960
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,426
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

11
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:50,960
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,045
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,320
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,696
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,280
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,720
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,780
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,800
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,040
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,543
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

21
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,960
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,980
 

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,790
 

25
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,870
While we're already bound
by the betrothal arrangement,

26
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,910
I still wish to know you better.

27
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,800
I see you're still averse to me.

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,350
You think you're above
a man of my lowly background, don't you?

29
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,800
Not at all.

30
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,500
Then what?

31
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,710
Why are you afraid of me?

32
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,600
Senior Lu, there are people here.

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,820
Behave.

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,410
You're adorable when you're shy.

35
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,790
There is no one here.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,110
Him again.

37
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,610
Senior Lu.

38
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,520
Why do you like to pick on him?

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,110
He picked on me first.

40
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,200
His Foundation Pill should have been mine.

41
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,290
Han Li! Stand right there!

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,920
Senior Lu, ever since I entered the valley,

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,670
I have done nothing but concede.

44
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,400
Why must you back me into a corner?

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,920
You know very well why.

46
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,880
Give me back the Foundation Pill or be the fertilizer to the forest.

47
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,210
You've done nothing wrong, but you stick out like a sore thumb

48
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,790
because you possess something you shouldn't have.

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,690
What are you doing?

50
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,900
This is between him and me.

51
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,710
Please stay out of this, Mentor Wu.

52
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,400
I didn't teach you magic to hurt your peers.

53
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,880
Before I came here, I fought with my life

54
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,900
on the Tianwu Arena before I was offered a Foundation Pill.

55
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,520
Yet he simply took my spot
with a show of his Ascension Token.

56
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,190
It was only reasonable for me to be angry!

57
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,150
The Sect Master and the elders decide who can have the Foundation Pill.

58
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,770
If you have issues with their decision,
appeal to them.

59
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,400
I want fairness!

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,120
The prestigious cultivators
already look down on me.

61
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,310
He's just a rogue cultivator
with a fake spirit root.

62
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,310
How come he gets to steal my thunder too?

63
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,300
You've accepted the compensation gems we offered,

64
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,530
so you're no longer entitled to the pill.

65
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,120
You still have a chance to get it in the future.

66
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,470
Just work hard for it when the time comes.

67
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,960
Senior Lu. Let's go.

68
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,390
Let's not blow this out of proportion.

69
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,600
Han Li.

70
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,800
You will never hear the end of me.

71
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,640
You won't be so lucky next time.

72
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,380
Are you all right?

73
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,574
Thank you, Mentor Wu.

74
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,330
He was right.

75
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,770
You've done nothing wrong, but you stick out like a sore thumb.

76
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,740
There's only one way for you to keep your Foundation Pill.

77
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,630
Get to Tier 13 as soon as possible and ingest it.

78
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,970
It's the only way.

79
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,940
Do I not deserve the pill?

80
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,440
Senior Lu.

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,880
Calm down, Senior Lu.

82
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,510
Senior Lu.

83
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,560
Calm down!

84
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,920
I am calm.

85
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,240
You're digging your own grave here.

86
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,800
I fought for that pill for you!

87
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,830
Only by reaching the Foundation
Establishment Stage that I am deserving of you.

88
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,440
Senior...

89
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,950
Didn't they offer you 300 gems as compensation?

90
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,510
That's a lot.

91
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,600
No need to take any tasks from me anymore.

92
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,870
That's not compensation.

93
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,230
It was a robbery.

94
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,000
Mentor,

95
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,200
I was told that you
know a way to obtain a Foundation Pill.

96
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,260
I do.

97
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,620
But it costs a lot.

98
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,540
Are you going to splurge?

99
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,560
300 gems.

100
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,180
Take it.

101
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,380
300 gems.

102
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,830
You won't keep anything for yourself?

103
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,150
Gems are nothing compared to a Foundation Pill.

104
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,320
Wait for my good news.

105
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,860
Thank you.

106
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,740
&nbsp;

107
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,430
Have you made up your mind?

108
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,280
Almost.

109
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,380
Are you done?

110
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,600
Mentor, ten books in total.

111
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,190
10 books. 20 gems.

112
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,570
Leave the gems here and you can go.

113
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,880
18...

114
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,360
That's not good.

115
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,650
18 gems. Leave one book behind.

116
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,790
Take nine books.

117
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,260
Mentor, can you help me out?

118
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,070
No.

119
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,020
It took me a while to pick those books.

120
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,920
- Perhaps when I...
- Fine.

121
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,800
Just this once. Don't do it again.

122
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,870
Go.

123
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,880
Thank you, Mentor.

124
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,510
Don't move.

125
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:43,240
If I treat your swollen neck, is my effort worth two gems?

126
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,120
You can heal?

127
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,230
You never mention it.

128
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,530
Have you been ingesting supplements
imbued with the fire element?

129
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,870
No.

130
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,670
No?

131
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,980
Perhaps I've spent
too much time at Dihuo Palace lately.

132
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,100
Not bad.

133
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,380
You hide many tricks.

134
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,030
It's swollen because the heat
has pervaded your body.

135
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,360
I need to cut it open.

136
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,600
I'll gather some poisonous herbs and make a numbing soup.

137
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,910
After you drink it, it won't hurt when I cut it.

138
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,490
Han Li.

139
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,700
Come back.

140
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,390
Just cut it open now.

141
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,150
No need to numb it.

142
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,840
It's bothering me so much.

143
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,870
Come.

144
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,630
It's going to hurt a lot.

145
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,960
Not being able to sleep or eat is worse.

146
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,730
Just do it.

147
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,060
Come.

148
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,630
Hurry up.

149
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,450
Liar.

150
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,540
I can't count on him at all.

151
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,680
It hurts.

152
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,100
Mentor.

153
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,600
Come.

154
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,570
Are you sure?

155
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,670
Listen.

156
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,960
If you botch it,

157
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,200
I'll make you pay.

158
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,290
It's true?

159
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,130
What is?

160
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:21,080
I've read that some patients
had a bird coming out of their shoulder.

161
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,750
It hid under the skin like a tumor or a lump.

162
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,550
You can hear a bird's chirping from within.

163
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,870
When it's cold or hungry, you'll feel pain.

164
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,240
Once one uses a silver blade to slice its feet,

165
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,810
the bird will fly out.

166
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,580
The fire energy has taken a form.

167
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,010
Come. I'll apply some ointment.

168
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,490
Brilliant!

169
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,960
What do you think?

170
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,100
It's treated.

171
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,510
Who would have thought that you could heal too?

172
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,730
You have a knack for medicine and herbs.

173
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,870
Here.

174
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,000
Your reward for treating me.

175
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,460
Keep it.

176
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,670
No need, Mentor.

177
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,700
Just keep it.

178
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,910
Like I said,

179
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,860
curing your swollen neck is to be remunerated
by two gems.

180
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,020
Also, I picked ten books,

181
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,770
and find myself short of two gems.

182
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,530
Therefore, adding this to that.

183
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,440
We're even.

184
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,460
You...

185
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,020
You know your math well.

186
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,200
Speaking of gems, living here can be costly.

187
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,790
If you need money,

188
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,490
go to Baiji Hall to take up some tasks and earn some gems.

189
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,020
Are you sure I can do that now?

190
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,320
Just tell them you have my permission.

191
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,230
Thank you, Mentor.

192
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,050
 Mentor Ye is focusing on wood carving, 

193
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,750
 yet I can't help but feel watched. 

194
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,270
 Can someone do two things at once? 

195
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,130
Come in.

196
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,080
Greetings, Mentor Ye.

197
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,910
Here for a task?

198
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,000
It's your first time, and you came alone.

199
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,570
Should I give you a rundown?

200
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,870
Tame a beast.

201
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,700
50 gems.

202
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,700
That's a lot.

203
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,180
 

204
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,790
But taming a beast can be dangerous.

205
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,630
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

206
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,770
If you're too scared for it, there's this one.

207
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,910
Move a mountain.

208
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,870
100 gems.

209
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,220
Anything simpler for me?

210
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,030
I have no use for that many gems anyway.

211
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,480
If you don't want to take these tasks,

212
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,550
feel free to come back next month.

213
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,080
Mentor Ye, is the task at Herbs Garden
still available?

214
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,940
Can I take that one?

215
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,550
Do you know what kind of place it is?

216
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,360
I looked down once when I was flying.

217
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,620
I'm confident enough to carry out
a herb-gathering task.

218
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,860
I have to warn you first.

219
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,650
The herbs in the Herbs Garden are more precious than the disciples here.

220
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,320
If you destroyed one or two herbs,

221
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,180
you would have to pay
more than a few thousand gems.

222
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,010
You don't trust me?

223
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,220
I would like to give it a try.

224
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,240
A fool never heeds any warning.

225
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,820
Pay up.

226
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,870
I'm here to take up a task.

227
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,270
Why do I have to pay you?

228
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,670
I take 10% of the reward as commission.

229
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,990
It's the rule here.

230
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,990
What about other tasks?

231
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,720
Besides, to make sure you can't walk away
should you destroy the herbs,

232
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,180
you need to pay a small fee
as security deposit to accept this task.

233
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,200
You can't get anywhere without gems here.

234
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,840
You're gemless.

235
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,340
How can you survive in Yellow Maple Valley?

236
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,360
Herbs Garden...

237
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,340
There is a way, though.

238
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,650
Mentor Ye, will you help me?

239
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,060
Easy.

240
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,720
Don't you have a Foundation Pill?

241
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,390
Sell it to me.

242
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,960
Not only can you own a large amount of gems,

243
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,010
but I will also offer you better tasks for you to choose freely.

244
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,690
Mentor Ye, you don't have a use
for that Foundation Pill.

245
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,670
Who wants it from me?

246
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,790
Why does it matter?

247
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,480
You have a fake spirit root.

248
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,840
You can never reach
the Foundation Establishment Stage in your life.

249
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,380
You should thank me for
purchasing that pill from you.

250
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,080
I know.

251
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,740
But I plan to seize any chance,
no matter how slim it is.

252
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,600
200 gems. And 50 extra.

253
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,480
Don't be too greedy now.

254
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,910
That's 250 gems in total.

255
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:22,360
You're not strong enough to keep that pill.

256
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,130
So why hold onto it so dearly?

257
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:32,200
You wouldn't want to lose your life for it, would you?

258
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,070
Mentor,

259
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,220
is this a threat?

260
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:10,540
 It seems like I can't leave this place
without surrendering the pill. 

261
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,000
Are you sure you want the task
at the Herbs Garden?

262
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,750
Yes.

263
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,320
I want it.

264
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,010
 
Show this token to Mentor Ma.

265
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,615
 Perhaps it is as Mentor Ye said, 

266
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:57,920
 I am not strong enough 

267
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,400
 to keep the Foundation Pill at this moment. 

268
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,980
 Fortunately, I got the
task at the Herbs Garden. 

269
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,310
 I can focus on nurturing herbs and refining pills 

270
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,350
 to improve my progress. 

271
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,380
 I'll find a way eventually
to get the Foundation Pill. 

272
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,430
Anyone's here?

273
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,660
Anyone's here?

274
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,200
Anyone's here?

275
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,380
I accepted the task to tend to the garden.

276
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,680
My name is Han Li.

277
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,020
Is Mentor Ma here?

278
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,720
Who's there shouting?

279
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,880
You're scaring my plants.

280
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,660
Are you Mentor Ma?

281
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,110
 
Who is Mentor Ma if not me?

282
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,640
Greetings.

283
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,490
- I am...
- Han Li.

284
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,380
This is Herbs Garden.

285
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,320
It has millions of herbs.

286
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,040
You want to stay here?

287
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,640
Count how many plants there are here.

288
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,000
If you get it wrong,

289
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,110
don't come back tomorrow.

290
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,000
Counting herbs?

291
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,750
Count them and you'll know how many you've killed.

292
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,830
Then, I'll ask you to pay for it.

293
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,910
You just have to pay up.

294
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,220
Yes.

295
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,920
1,723.

296
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,640
1,724.

297
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,270
1,725.

298
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,220
1,726.

299
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,200
 

300
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,250
There is a total of 7,123 herbs here.

301
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,110
1,727.

302
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,270
1,728.

303
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,277
- 1,7... 1,729.
- I come here to paint every day

304
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,655
so I remember every plant vividly.

305
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:47,310
- I can't get it wrong.
- 1,739.

306
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,620
You must be new here.

307
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,190
1,7...

308
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,510
 Oh, no. 

309
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,830
 She's using a trick. 

310
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,920
 She's more powerful than I. 

311
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,480
 I must leave. 

312
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,900
Wait.

313
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,530
What is it?

314
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,830
What are you doing?

315
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,730
Stay still. Let me look at you.

316
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,790
You look plain.

317
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,630
Your talent is also ordinary.

318
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,790
But you have great eyes.

319
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,560
Very clear.

320
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,630
Miss, take care.

321
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,440
You don't like people looking at you?

322
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,240
I don't like to be stared at.

323
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,700
Your stare makes me uncomfortable.

324
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,590
Do you get nervous when you see me?

325
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,030
Don't worry. In this garden, other than herbs,

326
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,510
you hardly find any humans here.

327
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,170
Relax.

328
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,820
Don't move.

329
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,480
No. 91 on the rare insect list, Chelonian Beetle.

330
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,160
Look at its long horn.

331
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,880
Its black and white horn points at the sky.

332
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,340
How strong.

333
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,200
And look at its fine hair that gives out a green hue under the sunlight.

334
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,300
It's beautiful. It's like a war general.

335
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,720
What rare insect list?

336
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,010
Even insects have a ranking?

337
00:24:30,062 --> 00:24:32,210
That's right.
If there is a ranking for cultivators,

338
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,790
the bugs and the plants can have one too.

339
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,510
Don't underestimate this garden.

340
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,420
There's more than meets the eye.

341
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,030
Indeed.

342
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,060
This cultivation sanctuary is otherworldly.

343
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,420
What was the last number again?

344
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,250
I lost count.

345
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,220
Can you stop staring at me?

346
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,400
One. Two.

347
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,000
But weren't we born to be admired?

348
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,590
Look at the bugs and the plants.

349
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,580
They don't care about us, so they are happy.

350
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,450
You shouldn't care
if others are looking at you or not.

351
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,580
This garden has a lot of eccentric people.

352
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,120
I don't want any attention.

353
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:29,730
 That said, she seems to be quite familiar with this place. 

354
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,040
 Perhaps I can learn from her. 

355
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,100
Greetings. I am Han Li.

356
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,650
How may I address you?

357
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,130
Oh, you're the one with the Ascension Token.

358
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,240
I don't mean to look down at you.

359
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,950
I am Dong Xuan Er. We're now friends.

360
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,010
Miss, do you work in this garden as well?

361
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,140
She is the Dong Xuan Er.

362
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,740
No one can order her around.

363
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,400
- Mentor Ma.
- Mentor Ma.

364
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,590
Good. Since you two have met, I don't
need to make a lengthy introduction.

365
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,270
This is Han Li. Dong Xuan Er
is different from others.

366
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,750
She is the direct disciple
of a Core Formation Stage cultivator.

367
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,860
She sees things differently in comparison to you.

368
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,140
Don't waste your time with her.

369
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,660
Understood.

370
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,580
This is an excellent bug.

371
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,780
What do you think?

372
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,920
It is good.

373
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,030
Raise it for another decade or so

374
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:39,090
and it will become grade two.

375
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,260
Keen eyes.

376
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,450
The universe is predestined as countless lives were brought to this world.

377
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,340
They exist, so we should learn to admire them.

378
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,000
Don't you think so?

379
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,590
Han Li.

380
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,340
 She sees the beauty in everything. 

381
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,980
 Perhaps this is another way of cultivating too. 

382
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,750
 This garden is wonderful. 

383
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,480
 I love it. 

384
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,790
How is your day?

385
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,130
You don't look happy.

386
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,940
Be happy.

387
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,030
Mentor Ma.

388
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,250
How many did you count today?

389
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,790
If we count the ones on the surface, there are 7,123 plants.

390
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,830
there are 7,123 plants.

391
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,790
If we include Jade Wyrm Root
that grows underground,

392
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,240
we have 7,177 plants here.

393
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,920
Wrong.

394
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,770
I counted twice. I am very sure.

395
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:02,550
7,182 plants.

396
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,580
Impossible.

397
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,880
Impossible. That's impossible.

398
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,700
There are five plants in my hands.

399
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,580
Anyway, you passed. Take them.

400
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,820
You barely pass.

401
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,130
Thank you, Mentor Ma.

402
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,240
Can I stay here?

403
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,880
Mentor Ma, I've tended to herbs before.

404
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,900
Please be reassured.

405
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,880
Wait here.

406
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,870
Don't gawk.

407
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,900
Han Li, come here.

408
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,780
I told you that if you killed any plants,

409
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,310
you'd have to pay.

410
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,690
Did you have a backup plan in your mind already?

411
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,580
I'll do my best.

412
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,210
Good. Write down anything.

413
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,380
Anyway, take care of this garden.

414
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,010
I'm going to cultivate in isolation.

415
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,270
You can stay here for the moment.

416
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,550
It makes it easier for you to manage this place.

417
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,010
I'll return after one season.

418
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,461
After we harvest them,

419
00:29:43,461 --> 00:29:46,540
you will be rewarded with plenty of gems.

420
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,790
Do you understand?

421
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,270
Please put your mind at ease, Mentor Ma.

422
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,480
Also, do not disturb me.

423
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,390
Mentor Ye!

424
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,210
Mentor Ye!

425
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,360
Where did that old man go?

426
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,780
He's often away during the day.

427
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,490
I see he has been tinkering with puppets.

428
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,190
It seems like he is adept in puppetry.

429
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,000
This is huge.

430
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,730
Wow.

431
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,970
I won't be able to defeat him when I fight him.

432
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,560
That ancient fool.

433
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,380
You're so early.

434
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,100
Are you here to snatch up new tasks?

435
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,830
Mentor Ye,

436
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,100
I heard you have obtained a Foundation Pill.

437
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,820
I came to thank you.

438
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,410
Why thank me?

439
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:02,240
An ancient fool like me made a promise to a fledgling fool like you.

440
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,830
Then when can I have the pill?

441
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,100
Be patient.

442
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,980
Just wait.

443
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,650
The disciples will be arriving soon
to accept new tasks.

444
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,510
If you don't mind
that they find out about this deal,

445
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,900
you can wait for me here.

446
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,490
Once they are gone, I'll let you know.

447
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,145
Come in. Come get your tasks.

448
00:31:24,145 --> 00:31:26,916
- Morning, Mentor Ye.
- Morning.

449
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,380
Pick whatever task you like.

450
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:37,540
Which idiot took the task in Herbs Garden?

451
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,450
Does he not know how odd Mentor Ma is?

452
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,730
Or how dangerous the herbs are?

453
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,180
Who else can it be?

454
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,450
Who?

455
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,050
The one with the Ascension Token.

456
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,620
So he took it.

457
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,780
It's over for him.

458
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,970
The Herbs Garden
will be his final stop in Yellow Maple Valley.

459
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,060
This garden is no different from
the garden in Shenshou Valley.

460
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,800
It's only bigger in scale.

461
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,400
I can do it.

462
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,420
Water the root and not the leaves.

463
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,390
You need eight hours of sun.

464
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,160
 Looking after these plants 

465
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,140
 feels so much better than hanging out
with those scheming disciples. 

466
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,040
 The sun is so bright. 

467
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,970
Soak it in.

468
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,820
Grow faster. Bear me more fruits.

469
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,810
My path to riches depends on you.

00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,220
I thought Ye somehow tricked you into it.

501
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,570
It seems like not only
are you good with the art of healing,

502
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:06,700
you have a talent for herbal horticulture too.

503
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,360
Not bad.

504
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,900
Mentor Wu, I merely make use of what I have.

505
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,590
I owe it all to your trust in me.

506
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:25,590
It seems like you have mastered
the Telepathy skill that I taught you last time.

507
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,960
- I'm leaving.
- It's not over yet.

508
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,820
It's not over yet? Sure.

509
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,600
That feels great.

510
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,300
That's the spot.

511
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:52,442
Tell me honestly.

512
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:55,130
What techniques do you want this time?

513
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,780
I want them all.

514
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,280
I'm not talented and I joined late.

515
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,540
I have too many things that I want to learn.

516
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,820
Done.

517
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,120
Okay.

518
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,930
I'll teach you

519
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,490
this technique today.

520
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,230
Watch carefully.

521
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,880
This is Freeze.

522
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,130
This is Quicksand.

523
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,530
Don't underestimate these two tricks.

524
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,860
When used by someone powerful enough,

525
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,880
acres of land can turn into desert.

526
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,780
Raging rivers can turn into glaciers.

527
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,690
Try it.

528
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:27,900
Not bad for a first try.

529
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,000
Don't rush it.

530
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,340
The efficiency of your spell depends
on your ability and your proficiency.

531
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,280
You are not talented, but you're diligent.

532
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,790
In time, it will pay off.

533
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,000
Thank you, Mentor.

534
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,670
I'm leaving now.

535
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,460
Also, when do I come back next?

536
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,450
As often as you want.

537
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,340
All right.

538
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,880
Practice the spells regularly.

539
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,510
Not too shabby.

540
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,540
You've tended to the garden well.

541
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,530
It's all thanks to your notes.

542
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,510
I merely replicated them.

543
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:32,370
Besides, the weather helped me to achieve
the results too.

544
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,880
Mentor, since you know herbs so well,

545
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,410
surely you're well-versed in alchemy too.

546
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,050
Nonsense.

547
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,940
My apologies.

548
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,410
But I see lights on the wall
at the loo every night.

549
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:03,030
I suppose that is the result
of you practicing alchemy.

550
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,080
Hence my question.

551
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,300
If you have the time to study these things,

552
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,250
it means you have too much time on your hands.

553
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,255
Mentor, will you give me a few recipes?

554
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:26,915
Truth be told, I want to try refining a pill.

555
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:35,090
You are asking for too much.

556
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:40,150
I spent more than a decade
to come up with those recipes.

557
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,190
I can't give them to you for free.

558
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,210
Even rough drafts will do. I can experiment with them myself.

559
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,280
This is a different story.

560
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,050
You passed my trial at this garden.

561
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:02,840
But the real challenge is doing it consistently.

562
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,670
From now on, I will drop by every six months.

563
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,760
Take care of this garden.

564
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,810
Do your job well

565
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,610
and you'll have enough gems to buy whatever recipes you want.

566
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,960
Thank you, Mentor.

567
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:38,100
If you truly want recipes, bring gems with you to Lushan Hall.

568
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:42,470
Tell the person in charge
that I told you to go there.

569
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,760
Don't tell anyone.

570
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,920
Thank you so much, Mentor.

571
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,528
You've arrived at Lushan Hall.

572
00:42:24,528 --> 00:42:28,718
How dare you walk in without gems?

573
00:42:30,976 --> 00:42:32,891
 

574
00:42:32,891 --> 00:42:35,011
You may borrow books,

575
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,450
make copies, or rent the alchemy room

576
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:45,640
but you need gems for that.

577
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,190
He's mid-tier
of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

578
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,510
I know who you are.

579
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,630
- I am the one with...
- A fake spirit root.

580
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,290
Indeed, Mentor.

581
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,910
Don't call me Mentor. I don't like that.

582
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,970
My surname is Xu. Call me Xu.

583
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,360
- Elder Xu.
- Xu.

584
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,740
- Mentor Xu.
- Xu.

585
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,910
- Elder...
- Come.

586
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,740
Go to the right for refinement.

587
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,480
- Right?
- Your right.

588
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,170
Go to the left for browsing books.

589
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,910
One gem every two hours.

590
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,930
Do not bring anything outside.

591
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,520
Duly noted.

592
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:57,080
Elder Xu, please don't tell anyone I came here.

593
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:25,950


594
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:31,980

 ♫ Too hard to forget ♫ 

600
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:58,518
 ♫ Easier just to miss ♫ 

601
00:44:58,518 --> 00:45:05,260
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

602
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:10,820
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

603
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,480
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

604

 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

605
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:20,194
 ♫ Eyes once looked far ♫ 

606
00:45:20,194 --> 00:45:24,340
 ♫ Now lost in the shift ♫ 

607
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,680
 ♫ Autumn winds stir ♫ 

608

 ♫ Smoke curls once more ♫ 

609
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,140
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫ 

610
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:37,220
 ♫ Returning to my eyes ♫ 

611

 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫ 

612
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,520
 ♫ Time lost its name ♫ 

613
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,860
 ♫ Was it yesterday ♫ 

614

 ♫ Or tomorrow? ♫ 

615
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:54,522
 ♫ The world has changed ♫ 

616
00:45:54,522 --> 00:45:56,640
 ♫ Beyond recall ♫ 

617

 ♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫ 

621
