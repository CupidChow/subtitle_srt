00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:16,030

00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,080
 "A Mortal's Heart" - Wang Zhengliang 

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,540
♫  Pursuing the wind and moon, I set out on a long journey  ♫

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,089
♫  The road ahead is uncertain, words are insignificant  ♫

5
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:29,160
♫  I’ve tasted joys and sorrows  ♫

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,480
♫  I conceal my abilities, and make careful plans  ♫

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,140
♫  A mortal’s heart with a few concerns  ♫

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,540
♫  Accompanying me around the kingdom  ♫

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,960
♫  I take the opportunity to reverse the desperate situation  ♫

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,400
♫  Longing for a bosom friend in this mortal world  ♫

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,940
♫  I’ve yet to figure out what immortality is  ♫

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,040
♫  That eternity is also a fleeting moment  ♫

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,280
♫  Don’t mock me for being ordinary  ♫

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,604
♫  Alone, I fight the disasters; the world is in a turmoil  ♫

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,280
♫  Don’t scorn me for being ordinary  ♫

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,720
♫  Keep a kind heart, be decisive, and kill if need be  ♫

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,820
♫  There are hidden joys and sorrows in fate  ♫

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,040
♫  Between life and death, I strive to save a desperate situation  ♫

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,160
♫  Faith carries me through the long and endless night  ♫

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,596
♫  I will return with an enlightened heart  ♫

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,960
♫  Extraordinary after final training, I enter the vast three realms  ♫

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,850
♫  And achieved nirvana in the cycle of reincarnation  ♫

23
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,580
   

24
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
   

25
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,060
   

26
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,970
   

27
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,020
   

28
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,390
 Let the hunt begin. 

29
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,900
   

30
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,910
 A Level Six Demon Beast? 

31
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,720
 Take the strike of my sword first! 

32
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,330
 You're quite capable. 

33
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,900
 Again! 

34
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,311
 Four Symbols: Black Tortoise Array! 

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,410
 Go! 

36
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,510
 The purity of the color is not bad. 

37
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,050
   

38
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,030
 They say that time stands still in the mountains 

39
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,860
 while a thousand years pass in the mortal world. 

40
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,560
 My story 
   

41
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,950
 starts from 200 years ago. 
   

42
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,950
Older Brother, wake up.

43
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,940
Mother baked pancakes and wants you to go home now. 
    

44
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,770
Pancakes?

45
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,930
Where did she get the flour?

46
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,530
 Father borrowed flour from Sixth Uncle and Aunt Zheng. 

47
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,770
 I don't think anyone will believe me 

48
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,030
 that I stepped into the world of cultivation 

49
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,690
 because of a pancake and three bowls of flour. 

50
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,070
- This is big. 
 - Here.

51
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,600
 The Han family of Wuligou Village, Qingniu Town... 
   

52
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,205
 had been farmers for generations. 

53
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:27,392
 Third Uncle was the only one who became an outer disciple of the Seven Mystics Sect. 

54
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,906
 He became the most respected man in the village. 
   

55
00:04:29,906 --> 00:04:32,080
Didn't you and Old Uncle Zhang give him an excellent name?

56
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,085
 For a village boy like me, 

57
00:04:35,085 --> 00:04:36,580
 getting into the Seven Mystics Sect 

58
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,080
 was my only opportunity to change my family's fate. 

59
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,020
Han Li?

60
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,210
That's right. Han Li.

61
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,630
 This chubby boy is Zhang Tie. 

62
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,260
 He's my best friend in the village. 

63
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,430
Eating pancakes? 
    

64
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,510
- I have some, too. 
 - You, too?

65
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,752
- Not bad at all. 
 - My father made these for me...

66
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,180
after borrowing three bowls of flour from Uncle Niu.

67
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,420
He forbade me from eating them now.

68
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,140
 According to the village rules, 

69
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,750
 before setting out on a long journey or doing something important, 

70
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,140
 we must eat white flour pancakes 
   

71
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,340
 even if we have to borrow the flour. 

72
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,760
- If Blockhead gets in, we don't need to return the flour. 
  - However, 

73
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,300
 - whatever we borrowed...  
 - You can eat first.

74
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,930
 must be returned. 

75
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,750
 That's also one of the rules. 

76
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,760
 Back then, I thought about the three bowls of flour... 

77
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,740
My older brother has a new name now.

78
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,800
 - those people in front of me...  
 - What's his new name?

79
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,050
 - I must get into Seven Mystics Sect.  
 - Han Li.

80
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,632
"Li," as in "erecting" a tombstone"?

81
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:26,420
Your family is erecting a tombstone instead.

82
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,900
"Li" in Han Li as in "Standing upright between Heaven and Earth". 
    

83
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,312
Han Li...

84
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:35,530
 By the way, I have an official name now. 

85
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,580
 I'm no longer Blockhead. 

86
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,580
 My name is Han Li. 

87
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,900
 "Li," as in "Standing upright between Heaven and Earth". 

88
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,150
   

89
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,400
This year's entrance test is a mountain hike.

90
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,460
The first seven participants to reach the peak will join the sect.

91
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,540
The rest will go home.

92
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:00,170
Stop.

93
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,430
That's enough.

94
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,140
The first seven participants have been decided.

95
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,802
The rest of you didn't make it. 
    

96
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:08,290
Go back.

97
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,310
 We failed? How can I return the flour then? 

98
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,280
Senior Brother, no. Don't!

99
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,480
- Zhang Tie! 
 - You shouldn't have eaten that much.

100
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,460
Do you know?

101
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,870
You wouldn't have been in ninth place if you had eaten less.

102
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,415
I... So that makes me number eight, then.

103
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:26,085
Senior Brother!

104
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,290
- Tie! 
 - Still putting on an act?

105
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,920
- What's wrong? 
 - He's really sick. It's not an act!

106
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,380
Tie! Are you all right?

107
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,770
Where does it hurt?

108
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,380
Physician Mo.

109
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,150
Han Li!

110
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,090
Just look at him.

111
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,390
He ate too many pancakes before the mountain hike.

112
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,460
He ate three.

113
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,260
He was hiking in the cold as well. 
    

114
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,510
Does he have a death wish?

115
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,940
You're fine now.

116
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,210
You're considered lucky.

117
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,330
Physician Mo is the savior of Sect Leader Wang of the Seven Mystics Sect.

118
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,570
He's the divine healer.

119
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,741
Still not thanking him?

120
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:13,043
Thank you, Physician Mo! Thank you for saving me!

121
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:15,235
- Thank you, Physician Mo! 
 - Physician Mo.

122
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,136
Are you here to select those who failed the test?

123
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,726
You're asking the obvious.

124
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,390
What do you think about them?

125
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,270
I'll take these two.

126
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,860
Come with me.

127
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,840
   

128
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,904
 This place is beautiful. 

129
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,700
This is Shenshou Valley.

130
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,820
Sect Leader Wang of the Seven Mystics Sect specially gifted it to me.

131
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,850
I saved his life back then.

132
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,210
Blockhead,

133
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,710
I suppose this is our home now.

134
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,010
It depends on whether you two have good fortune.

135
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,020
Do you recognize what's written on the wall?

136
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:41,622
   

137
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,660
We don't.

138
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,770
   

139
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,997
Are you both illiterate?

140
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:50,915
Yes.

141
00:08:50,915 --> 00:08:53,036
What can you both do then?

142
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:55,092
- Master, we know how to grow crops. 
 - Don't call me Master.

143
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:57,243
I haven't decided to accept you both as my disciples.

144
00:08:57,243 --> 00:09:02,284
It depends on your performance whether you both can stay.

145
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,070
Sit down.

146
00:09:18,076 --> 00:09:19,348
Silly kids.

147
00:09:19,348 --> 00:09:22,699
There's no such thing as a free lunch in the world.

148
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:25,220
This is a three-legged stool.

149
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,930
If you wish to serve me, you must be careful at all times.

150
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,900
What is that smell?

151
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,580
Did you bathe?

152
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,640
Han Li, why do I feel giddy?

153
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,060
What's wrong with the water...

154
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,570
Zhang Tie, wake up.

155
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,060
Wake up.

156
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,690
You are young indeed.

157
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,540
You regained consciousness rather fast.

158
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,650
What did you add in the water?

159
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,180
Immortal Grass Dew.

160
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,460
It gets rid of stench.

161
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,370
Take a sniff at yourselves

162
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,160
and check if you still smell.

163
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:18,820
It wasn't sweat on your bodies.

164
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,200
It was stench.

165
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,680
The stench of a mortal.

166
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:25,210
Stench of a mortal?

167
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,280
Mortals consume grains.

168
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,920
They can't absorb the essence of Heaven and Earth.

169
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,970
They gather all the impurities in their bodies instead.

170
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,300
Of course, they stink.

171
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,720
Don't you two feel any different?

172
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,780
Don't you guys feel spirited and refreshed?

173
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:44,660
Blockhead, I really think I smell nice now.

174
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,781
My head doesn't feel heavy anymore.

175
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,370
 I seem to feel much better now. 

176
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,090
Brat, at first glance, I could tell you came with a motive.

177
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,250
 Was it that obvious? 

178
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,820
I don't care about your motive when you're here.

179
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,900
I can save you or destroy you with just a lift of my fingers.

180
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:19,979
Want to give it a try if you don't believe me?

181
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,440
 This won't do. He'll chase me away if I keep this up. 

182
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:33,370
Physician Mo, thank you for taking us in.

183
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,770
You're our savior.

184
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,420
We will obey you in the future.

185
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,470
We won't upset you.

186
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,700
Don't be scared.

187
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:52,840
I scared you both to let you know who establishes the rules here.

188
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,900
I only have three rules.

189
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:03,010
First rule: You must be mindful of every matter in this valley.

190
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,340
Second rule: Don't make contact with those fools outside.

191
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,200
Third rule:

192
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,361
It's also the most important rule.

193
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,720
I'll teach you a chant.

194
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:21,700
You must always practice it.

195
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,050
Don't be lazy.

196
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,670
If you can't follow these three rules,

197
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,100
you'd better scram and don't waste my time.

198
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,790
I'll remember that.

199
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,810
You accepted this rather fast.

200
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,240
Excellent.

201
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,930
I'll see how you keep your promise.

202
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,960
There are only three of us but there are six dishes.

203
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,120
Physician Mo.

204
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:16,450
I'm not hungry.

205
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,260
I will watch you eat.

206
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,101
How can we do this?

207
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:22,531
Of course, you must pick up your chopsticks first.

208
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,650
Sit down.

209
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,630
Pick up your chopsticks.

210
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,500
Eat.

211
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,380
From tomorrow on, you two will serve me.

212
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,320
Don't let me take care of you again.

213
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,550
What meat is this?

214
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,641
It tastes really good.

215
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:51,140
That's not meat.

216
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,620
It's the root of Chinese cedar.

217
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,530
What's that? Is it the root of a tree?

218
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,670
Chinese cedar has a firm and upright structure.

219
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,340
It's good for hair and skin in traditional medicine.

220
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,100
After it's harvested, mix it with raw scallions and steam it thoroughly.

221
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,530
Steam for half a day, shred it finely,

222
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:12,000
and hang it in the south corner of the house to dry.

223
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,045
Drizzle sesame oil on it

224
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:16,100
and it can be used as a filling.

225
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,440
I thought tree roots were only eaten during famine.

226
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,740
You eat to fill your stomach.

227
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,750
I eat to cultivate.

228
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,380
 Cultivate? 

229
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,900
Rest immediately after finishing your meal.

230
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Don't forget to wake up tomorrow morning

231
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,160
when the rooster crows. Take a bath and light the incense.

232
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,110
Get ready to learn the chant.

233
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,450
 What kind of chant? 

234
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,430
 Why do we need to bathe and light the incense? 

235
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,150
 You still have time to prepare bathwater and cook for them? 

236
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,630
 Hurry and teach them the chant. 

237
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,360
 Check if they have spiritual roots. 

238
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,200
 Don't get me blockheads again! 

239
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,000
Fine... All right.

240
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,590
Go away. Go away!

241
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,972
- Good morning, Physician Mo. 
 - Time to wake up.

242
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:31,730
The sun is shining on your backsides.

243
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,190
We just finished bathing and changing our clothes.

244
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,450
The chant is divided into several levels.

245
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:47,810
If you can master Level One in the next three months,

246
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,050
you can officially pay respect to me as your master.

247
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,400
After that, just like the disciples of the Seven Mystics Sect,

248
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,361
you'll also receive a silver each month.

249
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:58,431
There's actually money?

250
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:02,900
I spent a lot of effort obtaining this chant.

251
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,570
I won't spare you if you dare to tell anyone else about it.

252
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,860
Understand?

253
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,570
We won't tell anyone else about it! We won't.

254
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,450
Since you are illiterate, just repeat my chant.

255
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,845
Attain ultimate emptiness.

256
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:18,872
Attain ultimate weirdness.

257
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,530
This is driving me crazy.

258
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,973
- Emptiness! 
 - Emptiness.

259
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:25,380
You're really annoying me.

260
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,860
Unbelievable.

261
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,540
- Maintain. 
 - Maintain.

262
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,650
- Profound tranquility. 
 - Profund tranquility.

263
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,240
Profound. 
  (Phonetic sound is "Du") 

264
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,150
- "Du.." (phonetic sound also for stomach) 
 - That's "stomach".

265
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,876
It's "Du" as in "Profound".

266
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:41,620
All things flourish.

267
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,440
Flourish.

268
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,380
I watch their cycles of return.

269
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,880
I watch their cycles of return.

270
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,620
Attain ultimate emptiness.

271
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,573
Maintain profound tranquility.

296
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,660
Take off your belts.

00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,630
Take off your outer shirts.

298
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,000
Show me how you circulate your energy.

299
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,530
 Useless. 

300
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,760
It's your turn.

301
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,780
 Why is his hand like a block of ice? 

302
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,800
 It's like a dead man's hand. 

303
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:27,730
Attain ultimate emptiness.

304
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,930
Maintain profound tranquility.

305
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,400
All things flourish.

306
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,630
I watch their cycles of return.

307
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,140
Attain ultimate emptiness.

308
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,820
Maintain profound tranquility.

309
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,930
All things flourish.

310
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,180
I watch their cycles of return.

311
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,530
That hurts!

312
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,100
- Be quiet. 
 - That hurts!

313
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,780
- That hurts! 
 - Be quiet.

314
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,830
Be quiet!

315
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,460
This is great.

316
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,250
I finally found someone who is not a blockhead.

317
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,230
This is great.

318
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,411
You must work hard like this in the future.

319
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:36,581
From today on, you are my direct disciple.

320
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,441
Does this mean I can learn medical skills, reading, and writing?

321
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:52,490
I'll teach you everything you want to know.

322
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:57,190
I'll give you the best of everything.

323
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,940
Master, Zhang Tie spent a lot of effort practicing the chant as well.

324
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,200
He's the same as all the other blockheads.

325
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,380
He's useless.

326
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,650
He wakes up earlier and sleeps later than I every day.

327
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,420
He has never slacked off when he practices the chant.

328
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,410
Please give him another chance.

329
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,730
He cannot do it.

330
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,250
Even if you give him several lifetimes,

331
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,530
he can't master it.

332
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,540
Physician Mo, don't chase me away!

333
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,780
I can endure hardships! I can do chores!

334
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,650
I... I can grow crops!

335
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,010
I can wash your feet!

336
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,060
I... I can also bake pancakes!

337
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,370
Physician Mo, I'm begging you! Please don't chase me away!

338
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,430
Master, if you're not willing to let Zhang Tie stay,

339
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,170
I will leave with him!

340
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,760
Zhang Tie.

341
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,360
Let me see what else you can do.

342
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,620
I do have a technique that's suitable for you.

343
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,950
It's called the Elephant Armor Technique.

344
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:52,070
Even at the initial stage of mastery,

345
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,060
you'll gain the power to move mountains.

346
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,050
It's that amazing? I'll practice this!

347
00:22:56,656 --> 00:22:58,460
When you practice this,

348
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,750
you must endure what a normal person can't endure.

349
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,060
Can you do it?

350
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,750
I'm not afraid of hardships as long as you don't chase me away.

351
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,210
Excellent.

352
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,890
Excellent.

353
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,550
Let's do this. You both stay with me.

354
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:20,830
Let me guide and teach you both.

355
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,540
- Thank you, Master. 
 - Don't. Get up.

356
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,170
Listen.

357
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,190
From now on, concentrate on practicing the chant.

358
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,490
You must monitor him at all times.

359
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,380
Do not let him slack off.

360
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,340
Go now.

361
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,560
This is great. We can finally stay here.

362
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,280
We're staying in Shenshou Valley!

363
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,960
We're staying in Shenshou Valley!

364
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,330
It's been many years.

365
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,600
We finally found a mortal with a spiritual root!

366
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,140
Old Geezer!

367
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,170
Enough. Stop talking.

368
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,730
I need to prepare some good prescriptions for him.

369
00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:21,015
No. This won't do.

370
00:24:21,015 --> 00:24:24,180
You must follow my formula. Don't use these common goods.

371
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,380
Delaying his cultivation progress won't be good for us.

372
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,380
Enough, enough. Leave!

373
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,430
I know what to do.

374
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,380
Smells great.

375
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,560
Master, we're back.

376
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,140
Master, what is this for?

377
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,210
Hurry and take off your clothes.

378
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,580
Who's talking about you?

379
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,320
Han Li, hurry and take off your clothes.

380
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,730
- All right. Zhang Tie, follow me to fetch water.

381
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,560
Coming, Master.

382
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
How do you feel?

383
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,740
I concocted this special herbal water for you.

384
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,010
It's filled with precious herbs.

385
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,490
Soak in it for four hours.

386
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,940
Pay attention. It's four hours.

387
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,620
How do you feel?

388
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,730
Does your body feel unblocked and transparent?

389
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,690
Maybe a little.

390
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,660
Just a little?

391
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:53,250
 The herbs aren't potent enough. You stingy old man! 

392
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,170
 You must add more fine herbs. 

393
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,805
 Don't be so stingy. 

394
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,380
 Hurry! Hurry up! 

395
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,300
I gave out most of my treasured items

396
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,220
just to help this brat in his cultivation.

397
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,980
Zhang Tie!

398
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,300
Mix it slowly.

399
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,280
Be careful with it!

400
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,420
Sorry, Master.

401
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,410
That's right.

402
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,800
For the next four hours,

403
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:44,350
regulate your breathing with the chant that I taught you.

404
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,580
Come here, Zhang Tie. Help me with this.

405
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,860
Maintain the water temperature.

406
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,320
Make sure it's not too high or too low.

407
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,780
Attain ultimate emptiness.

408
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,050
What's wrong?

409
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,820
I can't take this. It's too hot.

410
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,250
Master, Han Li's unwell.

411
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,820
What's wrong?

412
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,590
Master, quickly pull him out of the bathtub.

413
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,680
Han Li! Come! Hurry! Don't move!

414
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,690
Be steady! Be steady!

415
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,220
Good disciple.

416
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,900
How is it? How do you feel?

417
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,340
It's so hot.

418
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,930
It's so hot.

419
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,100
It's very hot.

420
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,325
That's more like it. Remember the chant I taught you.

421
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:56,580
Regulate your breathing slowly.

422
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,230
Zhang Tie, keep an eye on him. Give him a reminder.

423
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,187
Attain ultimate emptiness.

424
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,010
Maintain profound tranquility.

425
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,875
Shut up.

426
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,510
All things flourish.

427
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,221
Shut up!

428
00:28:12,221 --> 00:28:14,061
Master, he...

429
00:28:14,657 --> 00:28:16,777
Recite the chant. Recite it.

430
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,200
- Attain ultimate emptiness. 
 - Attain ultimate emptiness!

431
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,540
Maintain profound tranquility.

432
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,680
Maintain... Maintain what?

433
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,930
- Maintain profound tranquility. 
 - Maintain profound tranquility!

434
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,900
- All things flourish. 
 - All things flourish!

435
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,510
- I watch their cycles of return. 
 - I watch their cycles of return.

436
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,380
- Attain ultimate emptiness. 
 - Attain ultimate emptiness.

437
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,790
Maintain profound tranquility.

438
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,930
Get down. Don't do this!

439
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,980
Attain ultimate emptiness!

440
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,620
- Attain ultimate emptiness. 
 - Attain ultimate emptiness!

441
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,030
- Maintain profound tranquility! 
 - Maintain profound tranquility!

442
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,400
- All things flourish! 
 - All things flourish!

443
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,730
Master! Master, what's wrong with Han Li?

444
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,340
Blockhead, wake up!

445
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,670
Blockhead! Master?

446
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,240
Master, what's wrong with him?

447
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,330
Master?

448
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,130
Come here.

449
00:29:57,877 --> 00:29:59,737
Blockhead, you're awake.

450
00:29:59,737 --> 00:30:02,970
Do you know you scared me? I thought you were dead!

451
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,597
Shut your inauspicious mouth!

452
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,549
Master,

453
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:09,639
what's wrong with me?

454
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,260
You've attained Level One.

455
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,780
Blockhead, Master said you broke through to Level One.

456
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,280
It indeed worked with more potent herbs.

457
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,930
Good disciple.

458
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,130
Zhang Tie, wipe his body with cold water.

459
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,340
Take your time. It's not urgent.

460
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,716
I will find more herbs to replenish your body.

461
00:30:34,716 --> 00:30:36,280
I'll brew it.

462
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,970
And I'm going to buy new clothes for you.

463
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,620
New clothes?

464
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,820
I've never worn new clothes.

465
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,380
I wore my older sister's used clothes.

466
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,000
My second sister wore my eldest sister's used clothes.

467
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,410
My third sister would do the same. 
    

468
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,260
After that, I would wear the clothes sewn from their used clothes.

469
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,420
 Unknowingly, we've been in Shenshou Valley for more than a year. 

470
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:05,160
 In order to remain here, Zhang Tie has sacrificed a lot. 

471
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,770
 To practice the Elephant Amor Technique, 

472
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,720
 the body must be tempered countless times. 

473
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,010
 He endured it all. 

474
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,780
 Master didn't allow me to do chores such as gathering herbs or cooking. 

475
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,280
 Zhang Tie had to do everything. 

476
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,000
 Once I've completed my training and leave the mountain, 

477
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,930
 I must treat him better. 

478
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:27,512
 As for me, besides taking herbs, meditating, and chanting, 

479
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:28,590
 I have to take herbal baths 

480
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,480
 consisting of precious herbs that I don't even know the names of. 

481
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,010
 I don't know what they are used for.  
    

482
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:38,540
 However, Master also taught us how to read and write 

483
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,780
 and open our minds to the gate of wisdom. 

484
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,620
 So, this is what the sky looks like. 

485
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,690
 All this while, Zhang Tie and I saved 

486
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,532
 our monthly allowances and sent them home. 

487
00:31:53,532 --> 00:31:56,412
 I also prepared a birthday present for Xiaomei. 

488
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,740
 By the way, we also returned the flour that 

489
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,000
 we borrowed from our neighbors. 

490
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,410
 In the future, Father and Mother 

491
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,830
 won't need to borrow from our neighbors again. 

492
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:09,179
 We'll have enough buns and pancakes. 

493
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:17,040
♫  In a fleeting moment called eternity  ♫

494
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,625
 Although Master didn't want me to do chores, 

495
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:27,752
 but whenever I was free, I would gather herbs from the nearby forest. 

496
00:32:27,752 --> 00:32:32,555
 It's preparation for when I learn medical skills from him in the future. 

497
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,070
What is this?

498
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,480
What is this?

499
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,560
It's so green.

500
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,490
It's green, right?

501
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,010
It's beautiful.

502
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,950
What's in it?

503
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,720
Let's open it and check.

504
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,381
Here.

505
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,100
What are you doing?

506
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,740
Chop it.

507
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,480
Hand me the cleaver.

508
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,930
Let me take a look.

509
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,140
I'll take a look.

510
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,650
This vial is kind of weird.

511
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,030
We can't even cut it with a cleaver.

512
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,250
Let's throw it away.

513
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,820
Don't! Let's keep it.

514
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,720
Fine, then.

515
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,150
   

516
00:34:31,246 --> 00:34:34,320
Master, time to eat.

517
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,520
Master.

518
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,750
Han Li! Time to eat!

519
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,580
Han Li!

520
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,210
- Coming! 
 - I made them according to your recipes.

521
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,160
There's duck, fish, and braised meat.

522
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,210
Excellent.

523
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,470
Come here.

524
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,040
Make some space.

525
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,080
Come, place the braised meat here.

526
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,290
Here.

527
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,300
Han Li, eat this.

528
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,770
Have some duck.

529
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,670
Here.

530
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,000
Han Li!

531
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,700
Han Li?

532
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,740
Why are you out here? Go in now!

533
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,510
What are you doing?

534
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,090
What's wrong?

535
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,090
You fool!

536
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,780
What's the biggest taboo for cultivators?

537
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,220
They must avoid impure food like meat and wine.

538
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:12,090
It means this boy has reached Level Two!

539
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,907
Level Two?

540
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:19,030
He has set foot on the immortal path!

541
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,050
Really?

542
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,450
From now on,

543
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:31,380
he'll be entirely different from mere mortals like you!

544
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,760
 This year, I broke through Level Two of my chant training. 

545
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:53,050
 Master kept his promise. 

546
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,070
 He taught me medical skills, 

547
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,130
 refinement of medicines, herb preparation, acupuncture. 

548
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,700
 He taught me everything without reservation. 

549
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:08,480
 Right now, even my monthly allowance has more than doubled. 

550
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,410
 I wonder how everyone in the village is doing. 

551
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:16,240
 Father, Mother, and Xiaomei. 

552
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,410
 I'm doing well here. 

553
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,460
 You don't need to worry about me. 

554
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,900
 Apart from taking care of our daily meals and needs, 

555
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,250
 Zhang Tie spent the rest of his time 

556
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,660
 practicing a technique called the Elephant Armor Technique 

557
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,316
 which Master has imparted to him. 

558
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,340
 I don't see any bronze muscles or iron bones. 

559
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,040
 Being covered in cuts and bruises became the norm instead. 

560
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,360
 Using the medical skills that I've learned, 

561
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,180
 I created medicines to heal his injuries. 

562
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,840
 At least I can finally help to relieve some of his pain. 

563
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,670
 After reaching Level Two, 

564
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,530
 I realize that I can see even further. 

565
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,220
 My hearing is clearer, too. 

566
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,090
 My mind has become a bit sharper, as well. 

567
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:59,100
 Seems like there's something magical about the chant indeed. 

568
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,450
 Back then, Li Feiyu, who led us into the sect, 

569
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,978
 also known as Senior Brother Li, 

570
00:38:05,978 --> 00:38:07,900
 was also promoted from an ordinary steward 

571
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,670
 to the Deputy Hall Master of Outer Blade Hall. 

572
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,930
 He deals with the villainous and wicked bandit gang 

573
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,680
 called the Wild Wolves Gang. 

574
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,536
 I was once very envious of him. 

575
00:38:17,536 --> 00:38:19,300
 I wanted to be like him. 

576
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,030
 I wanted to train to become a martial arts expert and be a chivalrous hero. 

577
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,710
 I wanted to roam the world, 

578
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,690
 take revenge and repay gratitude swiftly. 

579
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,400
 A pity there are no "what ifs" in life. 

580
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,380
 I could only practice daily and consume herbal medicines. 

581
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,800
 Unknowingly, that thought seems to have faded. 

582
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,270
Scram!

583
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,710
Tell the entire Wild Wolves Gang

584
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,230
to stop dreaming of stepping into the Seven Mystics Sect.

585
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,850
Otherwise,

586
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,900
you will end up like this.

587
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,910
 Let's go! 

588
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,230
Master, look at the gardenias. 
    

589
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,780
They're growing so well.

590
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,600
If we boil them

591
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,731
and mix them with powdered licorice root to make Duanmu tofu,

592
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:43,461
it'll turn into a top-notch vegetarian dish.

593
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,910
Child, plants are not the only edible food around here.

594
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:51,130
In this vast world, even stones and sand,

595
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,970
dew at dawn and glow at dusk,

596
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,524
can serve as sustenance.

597
00:39:55,524 --> 00:39:57,490
Lately,

598
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,050
I've been thinking about the chant that you taught me.

599
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:04,130
Tell me what's on your mind.

600
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,660
Attain ultimate emptiness.

601
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,230
Maintain profound tranquility.

602
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:11,700
Maybe it's because nothing is perfect in the world.

603
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,420
Due to the imperfection, mortals feel empty and lost.

604
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:21,000
Only by accepting such emptiness,

605
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,090
we will be able to find tranquility.

606
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,460
Did I say something wrong?

607
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,030
From now on, you're only allowed to gather herbs.

608
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,480
Do not read any books again.

609
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,170
Why?

610
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:46,660
Your cultivation speed has been too slow for the past few months.

611
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,670
Focus on your cultivation.

612
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:52,480
Other matters have nothing to do with you.

613
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,320
It's all your fault!

614
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,281
Who told you to let him read books?

615
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:12,402
He now has his own opinions.

616
00:41:12,402 --> 00:41:13,597
How can we control him like this?

617
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:15,670
Shut up!

618
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:19,520
If I didn't use medical skills to entice him to stay in this valley,

619
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,650
would he have focused on his cultivation?

620
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,550
You're pathetic.

621
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,830
You only know how to nag at people nonstop.

622
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,000
If you have that much time,

623
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,260
you should keep a close eye on that child.

624
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,510
 Master took all the books away. 

625
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,400
 He replaced them with herbs. 

626
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:58,875
 Why is Master's mood so unpredictable? 

627
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:01,180
 It's like he has suddenly turned into a different person. 

628
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,200
 I must be careful in the future. 

629
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,330
 I must not let people read my mind that easily. 

630
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,380
 That chant brought me into Level Two of cultivation. 

631
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,880
 This situation has never happened in the past. 

632
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,310
 I keep feeling that something bad is about to happen. 

633
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,220
 What is this? 

634
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,760
 Why is this vial glowing? 

635
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,360
 It can absorb moonlight? 

636
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,780
 Seems like my hypothesis was correct. 

637
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,000
 The closed door and windows 

638
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,930
 were obstructing the vial from absorbing the rays of light. 

639
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,090
 The vial can absorb the rays of light better 

640
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,480
 in spacious areas with open space. 

641
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,030
 Only then will the light orb be larger. 

642
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:38,380
 Although I don't know where the rays of light are coming from 

643
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:42,080
 or what the usage of the vial is when it absorbs the rays of light, 

644
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,940
 but I should be getting closer to solving the puzzle. 

645
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,330
 But why can't I open it? 

646
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,880
Why are you only here now?

647
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,150
Aren't we supposed to meet at the 3rd quarter of the Hour of Yin*? 
  (*Around 3:45 a.m.) 

648
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,900
Li Feiyu is doing his rounds tonight.

649
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,700
I'm lucky that I'm able to be here.

650
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,740
 Is that a member of the Wild Wolves Gang 

651
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,740
 and a member of the Seven Mystics Sect? 

652
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,860
Did you find any news about that batch of goods?

653
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,150
Of course.

654
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,450
This is a birthday gift for the prince's residence.

655
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,320
 He's actually colluding with the Wild Wolves Gang 

656
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,030
 and betrayed the Seven Mystics Sect. 

657
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,360
 I must rush back to report this. 

658
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,080
We'll depart in three days.

659
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,260
How much can we rob from them this time?

660
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,620
Who's there?

661
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,480
You should return first.

662
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,000
Don't let people see us together. 
   

663
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,560
I'll go after him.

664
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,960
You don't know martial arts, but you can run fast.

665
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,650
Master?

666
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,820
I told you to focus on your cultivation in the valley.

667
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,010
Why did you get into a fight with him here?

668
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,720
Master, I couldn't sleep last night

669
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,010
and came to the forest to practice.

670
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,840
I accidentally overheard about his collusion with the Wild Wolves Gang.

671
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,970
He betrayed the Seven Mystics Sect!

672
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:19,660
What Seven Mystics Sect?

673
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,780
What Wild Wolves Gang?

674
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,180
The mortals can fight and betray each other.

675
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,050
That's none of your business.

676
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,900
Do you know that your life

677
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,340
is more precious than the entire Seven Mystics Sect?

678
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:43,140
I won't let anyone harm you.

679
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,190
He's a mole.

680
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:48,570
Did you not hear me?

681
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,970
Go back and focus on your cultivation.

682
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:55,850
Reach Level Three as soon as possible.

683
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:05,888
You scoundrels have never shown me any respect.

684
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:06,970
Do you think

685
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:10,780
I'm old, deaf, and blind?

686
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:13,880
Do you know who his life belongs to?

687
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,972
No one can touch a strand of his hair, except me!

688
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,930
Han Li! Something bad has happened!

689
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:44,310
A member of the Seven Mystics Sect fell off the mountain!

690
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,570
Master killed him.

691
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,330
Master...

692
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,820
Master?

693
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,570
It can't be.

694
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,390
Master killed someone!

695
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,530
Master killed someone?

696
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,240
 Master is actually a hidden martial arts expert. 

697
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,300
 Why hasn't he shown his skills in front of us? 

698
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,740
 Did he deliberately hide it, 

699
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,390
 or... 

700
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:45,608
How can you cultivate in peace

701
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:48,800
when your heart is so restless?

702
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,700
You've been slacking off too much lately.

703
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,510
It's raining heavily out there.

704
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:56,530
Sleep early.

705
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:57,960
Once the weather has cleared,

706
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,670
I'll descend the mountain to seek medicine for you.

707
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,330
Remember.

708
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,760
I'll always keep an eye on you.

709
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:25,040


710
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,580
 "A Fleeting Moment" - Tan Weiwei 

711
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:48,620
♫  Shards of dreams inside a dream  ♫

712
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:54,556
♫  The slanting moon falls into the water  ♫

713
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:58,020
♫  I’ve been wandering for many years  ♫

714
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,540
♫  The sceneries surface again  ♫

715
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,837
♫  And are hard to forget  ♫

716
00:49:03,837 --> 00:49:08,680
♫  Why not just reminisce about them?  ♫

717
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:14,400
♫  It’s said that the past is like smoke  ♫

718
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:21,060
♫  Looking back, it’s so absurd that I can’t bear to talk about it  ♫

719
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,680
♫  The noisy mortal world, those lonely scrolls  ♫

720
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,080
♫  Swept away by the passing years  ♫

721
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,300
♫  And obscured the views  ♫

722
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,540
♫  Things change over the passage of time  ♫

723
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:38,000
♫  The autumn wind rises ♫

724
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,400
♫  Smoke from the fires of cooking  ♫

725
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,380
♫  Like the horizon  ♫

726
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,460
♫  It comes into view again  ♫

727
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,740
♫  Looking back from the mountain peak  ♫

728
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,580
♫  I've lost track of time  ♫

729
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:56,920
♫  Was it yesterday?  ♫

730
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,120
♫  Or tomorrow?  ♫

731
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,660
♫  The world has changed a lot  ♫

732
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,860
♫  And no longer as before  ♫

733
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,880
♫  Time will also  ♫

734
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,080
♫  Obliterate every word that was spoken in this world  ♫

735
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,960
♫  Only this longing remains  ♫

736
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:24,200
♫  Spanning thousands of years  ♫

737
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:30,512
♫  In a fleeting moment called eternity  ♫

738
00:50:30,512 --> 00:50:41,532
♫  In a fleeting moment called eternity  ♫
