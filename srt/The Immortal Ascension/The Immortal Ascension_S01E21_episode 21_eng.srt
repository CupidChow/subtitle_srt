1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,524
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,115
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:29,176
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,176 --> 00:00:32,561
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:36,140
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,960
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,960
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,511
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:50,985
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:56,252
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:01,280
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,760
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:08,057 --> 00:01:10,272
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,272 --> 00:01:13,620
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,678
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:17,982
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:17,982 --> 00:01:20,175
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,175 --> 00:01:22,855
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,001
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,020
 

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,780
 

24
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,800
Caught you.

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,082
Are you fleeing the battle?

26
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:56,662
Meng, cut it out.

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,694
Han,

28
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:01,785
I got these pills on my last mission

29
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:03,870
to help with recovery and strengthening.

30
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,920
Take them.

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,540
Just in case.

32
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,100
You've all heard.

33
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,530
The Master trusts us the most.

34
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,880
Here. Take it.

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,560
Thanks.

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,560
Han, why not ask Master to let me go with you?

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,880
It's not easy to find a good sparring partner.

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,000
I haven't had enough fun yet.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,710
The war is in full swing.

40
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,640
You trying to dodge the fight?

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,530
Who said I was dodging?

42
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:34,110
Han, come here a second.

43
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,390
I heard there's a new
cosmetics shop in the capital.

44
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,985
The Moxiang Abode.

45
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:42,430
They sell all kinds of skincare and perfumes.

46
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,888
Pick some up for me, will you?

47
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,400
I made a list.

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,280
Just follow it.

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,570
Don't let Senior Liu find out.

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,350
 Things look lively. 

51
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,310
 That brat. 

52
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,980
 Let's see how he acts when he sees me on my ark. 

53
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,760
 If she doesn't want to see me, 

54
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,420
 then I'll just pretend we're strangers,
like she said. 

55
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,280
 What's that supposed to mean? 

56
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,090
 He didn't even say hi. 

57
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,710
Where are you going?

58
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,000
Aft cabin.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,310
 You brat. 

60
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,210
 You didn't even look at me. 

61
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,500
 Who do you think you are, huh? 

62
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,840
 Nangong Wan. 

63
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,680
 You're already in the Core Formation Stage. 

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,120
 Why are you still mad over some nobody? 

65
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,910
 It's not worth it. 

66
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,370
 I'm not mad. 

67
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:10,680
Calm down.

68
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,881
Who he's with, who he's buying rouge for,

69
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,430
has nothing to do with me!

70
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,140
He's not even worthy.

71
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,270
This is maddening!

72
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,720
I'm going to forget him.

73
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,610
I have to forget him!

74
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,730
Back to my cultivating.

75
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,190
Han Li...

76
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,290
I'll never forgive you.

77
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,260
She wouldn't

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,820
really kill me, would she?

79
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,560
 That should be Yuanwu Kingdom. 

80
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,040
 A good chance to find Qi Yun Xiao 

81
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,750
 and the array master he serves 

82
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,650
 to ask about the teleport array. 

83
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,140
Mr. Han, we're not in the capital yet.

84
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,310
I have a mission.

85
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,850
I'll take my leave.

86
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,430
Right. One more thing.

87
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,650
Please pass this to Senior Nangong.

88
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,700
What is it?

89
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,580
Ageless Pill.

90
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,090
Ageless Pill?

91
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,830
Grandmaster,

92
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,830
that guy in the back cabin left.

93
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,070
He left?

94
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,050
Looked like he headed toward Yuanwu Kingdom.

95
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:33,115
He didn't even come to see me.

96
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,830
He told me to give you this.

97
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,510
Give me what?

98
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,600
It's a pill.

99
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
He said it's the Ageless Pill.

100
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,170
Ageless Pill?

101
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,340
What for? Does he think I'm old?

102
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,070
- You may go.
- Yes.

103
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,800
Wait. Don't tell anyone about this.

104
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,380
Especially not my senior Ni Chang.

105
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,940
Forget it. I'll let you off this time.

106
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,920
 

107
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,600
Shouldn't you be minding the shop?

108
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,970
Where did you go?

109
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,720
 

110
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,800
Top-grade artifact, the Flamecloud Sword.

111
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,190
It has fire-element techniques.

112
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,360
Personally refined by a Core Formation cultivator.

113
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,920
Starting bid. 200 gems.

114
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,340
Any takers?

116
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,950
- I bid 400.
- 400.

117
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,120
400 gems! Any more bids?

118
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,950
- 500.
- 500 gems!

119
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,680
Anyone going higher?

120
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,160
-  This auction's on another level... 
- 500, once.

121
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,920
-  These are all Early Foundation Establishment. 
- 500, twice.

122
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
500, thrice.

123
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,530
Sold!

124
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,460
Congratulations to the bidder.

125
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,950
Alright. Next item.

126
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,870
Let's bring it up.

127
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,830
High-grade pill, Ageless Pill.

128
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,932
- Two pills.
- Ageless Pill?

129
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:52,720
Ageless Pill! I want one too!

130
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,810
- This pill comes from the Joyful Union Sect.
- I want it!

131
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,190
- I want it too!
- It's rare in the market.

132
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,120
If you know, you know.

133
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,480
Starting bid. 100 gems.

134
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,390
This stuff is good. I want this one.

135
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,240
- I bid one-thirty.
- You're a grown man.

136
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,150
Why do you need the Ageless Pill?

137
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,910
Do you have no shame?

138

Any higher offers?

143
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,000
Looks do matter in cultivation.

144
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
These two Ageless Pills might sell

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,320
for as much as a top-tier artifact.

146
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,150

Excellent.

150

Please collect your item at the counter.

151
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,750
Esteemed guests, next up,

152

It's also the final item this month.

153
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,220
Golden Glow Ganoderma.

154

- Now that's rare.
- A millennium-old one.

155

1,000 years old!

156
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,050
No starting bid set.

157
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,480
- Smells amazing...
-  Isn't that the one I sold... 

158
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,510
 To Treasure House? 

159
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,480
 Is that shady merchant
actually backing this auction? 

160
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,120
- 1,800!

163
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,510
- 2,500!

164

167
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,630
- 3,800, once!
- Hold it!

168
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,020
Qi Yun Xiao?

169
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,600
This Millennium Ganoderma shall be mine.

170
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,910
Stop causing trouble!

171
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,550
Guards, throw him out!

172
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,100
-  Not this again! 
- Who even are you?

173
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,490
- I'll trade an array for it!
-  Still haven't learned, huh? 

174
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,480
- This time... 
- Wait!

175
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,360
 he even dropped the disguise. 

176
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,870
Esteemed elders,

177
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,165
I am Qi Yun Xiao,
an Artifact Crafter in this city.

178
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:38,880
I truly need that Golden
Glow Ganoderma to save a life.

179
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,882
I'm willing to offer two high-grade
arrays in exchange for it.

180
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,320
Where did this guy come from?

181
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,480
Two arrays, you say?

182
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,812
- I have eight myself!
- Throw him out!

183
00:11:47,812 --> 00:11:49,400
- I'm just trying to...
- Kid, stand down!

184
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,320
- Get lost.
- Hold on, wait!

185
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,690
Young man, come back next time.

186
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,670
- Come on.
- Elder, please!

187
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,150
I really need it to save a life.

188
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,750
- Elder, wait!
-  A Qi Refining rookie? 

189
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,510
-  An Artifact Crafter? 
- Move it.

190
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,750
- 4,000!
- Elder!

191
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,950
- 4,000!
- To save a life!

192
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,790
4,000! Anyone want to bid higher?

193
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,720
- 4,500!
- 4,500!

194
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,840
- 4,800!
- 4,800!

195
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,380
Any bid higher than 4,800?

196
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,240
Blade Arts?

197
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,550
You're from the Fu Clan?

198
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,670
Now that you know, even
if you hand over the array,

199
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,500
we still can't let you live.

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,570
Han!

201
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:35,220
 

202
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:39,790
 

203
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,000
Yun Xiao.

204
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,480
Ru Yin?

205
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,790
How did you get hurt?

206
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,550
I let my guard down for a moment,

207
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,790
and some thugs mugged me.

208
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,550
-  Is this girl... 
- Han saved me.

209
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,740
 the one he cares so much about? 

210
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,650
Han, come in.

211
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,670
The Millennium Spirit Herb you took earlier

212
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,690
was the one he traded to us.

213
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,030
Yun Xiao often mentioned you.

214
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,910
You saved me once.

215
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,500
I, Xin Ru Yin, am deeply grateful.

216
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,780
Senior Han, come inside.

217
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,680
Han, you might not know,

218
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,910
those two are from the Fu Clan,
the top family in Yuanwu.

219
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,240
They are trouble.

220
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,870
My advice? Leave here soon.

221
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,630
You stepped in to protect me.

222
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,690
I don't want to get you involved.

223
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,480
Just now, I wiped out all their traces.

224
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,980
I won't stay long.

225
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,360
However, I think you two
should find somewhere quiet

226
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,290
and lay low just to be safe.

227
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,080
Ru Yin, did you hear that?

228
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,910
Han says we should find a quiet place
and stay a while.

229
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,870
Yun Xiao,

230
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,100
we're not even married yet.

231
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,150
By the way, Han, thanks to Ru Yin's help,

232
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,550
the upgrade for the Five Phases
Reversing Array went smoothly.

233
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,720
Its defense is stronger now,

234
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,440
plus it now has an illusory trap
to restrain enemies.

235
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,870
I'll go get it.

236
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,380
Qi, no rush.

237
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,840
Since Miss Ru Yin is here too,

238
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,140
I actually came to ask for your help
to appraise something.

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,630
Teleportation, stabilization, acceleration,

240
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,330
spiritual channeling, amplification.

241
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,240
I can't believe this ancient teleport array
actually exists.

242
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,030
Once this array is infused with spiritual power,

243
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,810
it can teleport across great distances.

244
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,480
It seems you also need
a Greater Teleport Command Seal

245
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,810
to withstand spatial turbulence.

246
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,870
Judging by your expression,

247
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,860
that shouldn't be a problem for you.

248
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,510
Unfortunately, this array isn't complete.

249
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,360
A part is missing.

250
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,220
It may no longer be usable.

251
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,720
Do you think you can restore it?

252
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,320
This array is very ancient,
and part of it is broken.

253
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,750
To fix it would take rare high-grade materials.

254
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,810
It also involves a secret art.

255
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,510
Right now, I'm still unwell.

256
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm afraid we're not able to help you with it.

257
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,900
We're truly sorry.

258
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,000
If it's about the cost, don't worry.

259
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,780
I'll handle all of it.

260
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,120
I still have Golden Glow Ganoderma.

261
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,690
I can trade it.

262
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,240
Ru Yin, your illness can be cured.

263
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,320
Let's just agree to it.

264
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,630
Don't worry, Han. I'll figure it out.

265
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,360
Yun Xiao, my condition comes from
being born with the Dragon Roar Body.

266
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,440
As I cultivate, my meridians gradually wither.

267
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,480
No medicine can cure it.

268
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,790
To have lived this long is already a blessing.

269
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,762
I shouldn't leave you disappointed

270
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:36,690
and waste Senior Han's spirit herb.

271
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,960
Besides, the demonic sects are on the rise.

272
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,030
The ancient teleport array
is bound to attract attention.

273
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,320
 She must think I'll betray them
when they are no longer useful, 

274
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,670
 then silence them for good. 

275
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,100
 Looks like I'll have to put her doubts to rest. 

276
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,080
Hear me out.

277
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,330
I'm a free soul with no interest in power.

278
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,600
But with the world in chaos now,

279
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,440
a great conflict is brewing.

280
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,690
We can't just idle away anymore.

281
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,480
This time, it was pure chance

282
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,240
that I came upon this ancient teleport array.

283
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,690
Naturally, I planned to use it as an escape route.

284
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,390
Though I'm no expert,
I've studied a bit of medicine.

285
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,320
The ancients once said
this world is vast and full of wonders.

286
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,740
No disease is incurable.

287
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,240
We only think so because of our limited knowledge.

288
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,670
Miss Ru Yin, don't ever give up hope.

289
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,240
Han is right.

290
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,460
With this array, nowhere is out of our reach.

291
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,370
Ru Yin, stop saying it's pointless to find a cure.

292
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,590
With Han and this array,

293
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,050
we'll definitely find a way to heal you.

294
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,700
Senior Han, if that day really comes,

295
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,940
would you take us with you?

296
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,180
Of course.

297
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,070
 Come to think of it, 

298
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,370
 this is my first time in the capital. 

299
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,200
 The cultivation world is in chaos, 

300
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,260
 yet this place stays lively as if untouched. 

301
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,680
 I just wonder how long this peace will truly last. 

302
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,960
Grandpa! Grandpa, come chase me!

303
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,110
- Cui Er!
- Sweet sugar hawthorn!

304
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,270
- I'm over here!
- Fresh sugar hawthorn!

305
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,560
Sweet sugar hawthorn!

306
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,940
Watch where you're going, little girl!

307
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,070
Cui Er!

308
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,200
Don't run, Cui Er. Slow down!

309
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,350
Careful! Slow down!

310
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,700
Cui Er!

311
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,270
 

312
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,750
 Qi Refining Stage? 

313
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,960
 I can't detect his cultivation. 

314
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,330
 Did he use Aura Concealment? 

315
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,820
 

316
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,200
I was a fool for not knowing your might.

317
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,220
I offended you, Master. Please forgive me!

318
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,200
 Calm down. 

319
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,750
 Your technique is rather interesting. 

320
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,440
 I've memorized your aura. 

321
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,530
 Once I'm done here, I'll come find you again. 

322
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,720
Come take a look!

323
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,960
Painted umbrellas!

324
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,130
Sir, where is the Qin Residence?

325
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,750
Thank you.

326
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,220
Fresh and fragrant buns here!

327
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,370
Grandpa, what's wrong?
 

328
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,360
- Did someone bully you?
- Run!

329
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,720
Run!

330
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,980
- Wait, what's going on?
- Hurry, let's go!

331
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,920
Who are you to trespass into the Qin Residence?
 

332
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,350
That's a crime!

333
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,070
- Sir, please...
- Who are you calling "sir"?

334
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,400
Handsome, it's an urgent matter.

335
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,830
I must see your master.

336
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,350
Please inform him.

337
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,260
My master isn't someone you can meet on a whim.

338
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,020
 

339
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,330
That's our lord's name...

340
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,890
Come with me.

341
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,790
Qin Yan greets the Master.

342
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,960
I failed to recognize you and showed disrespect.

343
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,980
Please forgive my offense.

344
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,350
Master, take a seat.

345
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,310
Please sit. Have a seat.

346
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,500
Please.

347
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,200
Calm yourself down.

348
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,240
As the letter stated, I, Han,
came on my master's orders.

349
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,620
I may have to stay for a few days.

350
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,510
 

351
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,310
Thank you for your generosity.

352
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,750
You bring honor to our humble home.

353
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,790
Before my father passed away,

354
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,400
he once said that
if disaster ever befell the Qin family,

355
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,270
Master Li would surely lend us a hand.

356
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:43,000
May I know if that's the reason you've come,
Master Han?

357
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,880
You need not ask further.

358
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,640
But indeed, my master sent me here

359
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,460
to ensure your family
survives this coming disaster.

360
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,852
A disaster...

361
00:22:53,852 --> 00:22:54,880
In that case,

362
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,740
the lives of the entire Qin family
are in your care, Master Han!

363
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,200
 No wonder he's a man of power. 

364
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,350
 Much more sensible than the gatekeeper. 

365
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,560
We are in your hands.

366
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,310
Please protect us.

367
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,700
At ease, Lord Qin.

368
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,500
This is my sect's duty, so I will do my best.

369
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,310
However, for this mission,
I was ordered to proceed in secret.

370
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,960
From now on, we shall
address each other as uncle and nephew.

371
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,660
Uncle and nephew...

372
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,550
As you wish, Master.

373
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,790
As you wish, Master.

374
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,160
As you wish, Master.

375
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,350
As you wish, Master.

376
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,530
- As you wish, Master.
- That's enough.

377
00:23:44,432 --> 00:23:45,862
Please, have a seat.

378
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,850
From now on, we're uncle and nephew.

379
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,040
Did he say he's the descendant
of the old Master's friend?

380
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,300
Yes.

381
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,640
Sounds like another freeloader to me.

382
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,110
Young Master, Madam,
while I was observing in the hall,

383
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,760
Master was rather indifferent at first,

384
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,110
but after reading the letter,
his expression turned grave.

385
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,100
He even dismissed all the servants
to speak with him alone.

386
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,110
How old is he?

387
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,270
 
And what does he look like?

388
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,790
Tell me everything.

389
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,200
Madam, his looks are very ordinary.

390
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,160
His clothes were plain and shabby.

391
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,160
At first, I thought he was another
penniless fool trying to make a connection.

392
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,680
But I've served Master since childhood.

393
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,772
He's never treated anyone

394
00:24:30,772 --> 00:24:32,890
with such respect.
 

395
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,200
Come!

396
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,270
The Master actually poured tea for him.

397
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,440
I want him dead.

398
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,550
Qin Gui! Throw him out!

399
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,400
Madam, I wouldn't dare!

400
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,660
Calm down. Please calm down.

401
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,420
- Grandpa!
- Cui Er, hide quickly!

402
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,520
Who did this?

403
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,090
It's a complete mess in here!

404
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,892
So much blood...

405
00:26:48,892 --> 00:26:53,590
 The mark on the old man from yesterday
vanished here. 

406
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,350
 The trail is still fresh. 

407
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,180
 It must have just happened. 

408
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,350
Rogue cultivators, welcome to your paradise,

409
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,660
the Black Fiend Cult.

410
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,030
Everyone here has been
cast aside by the Seven Sects.

411
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,880
- We're...
- Quiet!

412
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,070
- not overthrowing the Seven Sects.
- Let him finish.

413
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,680
And we won't make you die for us either.

414
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,640
We just want you to know
the so-called Foundation Pill

415
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,440
is a lie by the Seven Sects!

416
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,030
Without that pill,

417
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,240
you can still break through Qi Refining

418
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,362
and reach the next stage!

419
00:27:40,362 --> 00:27:41,510
Seriously?

420
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:46,110
The Master of the Black Fiend Cult
is using a secret technique.

421
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:50,160
Soon, he'll break through to Core Formation.

422
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,920
What the Seven Sects keep hidden,

423
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,790
our Black Fiend Cult shares with all of you.

424
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:02,200
Now, the Black Fiend Cult is willing to share

425
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,240
our secret arts with you all

426
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,110
so we may cultivate together.

427
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,750
Da, this sounds sketchy to me.

428
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,160
What should we do then?

429
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,830
Sharing secret arts!

430
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,400
- Cultivating together!
- What is this place?

431
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,030
- Who are these people?
- Sharing secret arts!

432
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,920
 
Cultivate together!

433
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,830
Share secret arts!

434
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,750
Cultivate together!

435
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,590
Share secret arts!

436
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:26,290
Cultivate together!

437
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,590
San.

438
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,720
You alright?

439
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,020
I'm fine.

440
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,790
How do you feel?

441
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,570
I'm all itchy.

442
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,510
It has nothing to do with me.

443
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,110
Sir, save my grandpa!

444
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,500
Let go!

445
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,000
If you save my grandpa,

446
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,640
I'll give you this book
that holds the Aura Concealment.

447
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,460
No. I'll even serve you if you want!

448
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,400
I already told you, I can't help you.

449
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,570
Stop bothering me. Leave now.

450
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,090
If you won't help me,
then I'll just die right here!

451
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,310
If you won't help me, then kill me yourself!

452
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,270
We rogue cultivators are all being hunted anyway.

453
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,240
They got my grandpa yesterday.
Last month, a boy from the Li family.

454
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,830
Three months ago, it was Miss Zhao.

455
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,780
Next time, it might be me.

456
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,720
How is it my concern?

457
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,160
Grandpa was right after all.

458
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,830
You are all two-faced hypocrites.

459
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,830
You don't care if rogue cultivators live or die!

460
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,480
If it weren't for that Aura Concealment,

461
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,270
Grandpa wouldn't have left the city.

462
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,960
And if I hadn't insisted
on seeing the Lantern Festival...

463
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,530
If it weren't...

464
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,500
What is it?

465
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,310
Young Master, The Master has
asked you to come to the front hall.

466
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,640
He says it's something important.

467
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,440
Alright. Understood.

468
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,570
Hold on a sec.

469
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,780
Sorry about this.

470
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,220
As for you, we'll settle this later.

471
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,160
 They were all taken, but not killed on the spot. 

472
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,600
 Seems like they're still useful. 

473
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,200
 It's no easy task to control so many rogues. 

474
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,240
 They must be locked up separately. 

475
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,850
 There are different locations too. 

476
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,070
Did Uncle Qin say what it was about?

477
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,160
Young Master, Prince Xin's
estate sent an invitation.

478
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,830
The Master thinks highly of you.

479
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,240
Perhaps he wants to take you along.

480
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,020
You'll know when you're there.

481
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,919
Greetings, Mr. Qin.

482
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,510
Steward Wang, how have you been?

483
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,110
 
Thanks to you, quite well.

484
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,700
- Please.
- Yes.

485
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,810
Qin Fei, you sit here.

486
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,330
Han Li, you sit here.

487
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,850
Please, Young Master Han.

488
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,960
 What a strange wave of spiritual power. 

489
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,530
 The demonic sects? 

490
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,330
Young Master Qin, please.

491
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,290
Prince Xin has arrived.

492
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,740
 

493
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,070
Tonight's family banquet is an opportunity

494
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,920
for me to share a once-in-a-lifetime chance

495
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,110
with all of you.

496
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,890
Steward Wang, invite the cultivator.

497
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,920
Amazing!

498
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,700
Incredible!

499
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,620
 

500
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,510
 It may just be a basic Fireball Technique, 

501
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,110
 but the control was remarkably precise. 

502
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,890
 Quite interesting. 

503
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,990
- Good. Excellent.
- So impressive.

504
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,980
- Amazing.
- Truly spectacular.

505
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,220
Honored guests,

506
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,350
this cultivator
shares a connection with the Prince.

507
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,310
He has accepted the Young Prince
as his personal disciple.

508
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:41,510
 All this fuss,
and he's just a Tier Five Qi Refiner? 

509
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,510
He's also seeking others
with spirit roots and potential

510
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,550
to guide them onto the immortal path

511
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,460
and teach the way to eternal life.

512
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,880
 He is indeed a cultivator,
but his cultivation is weak. 

513
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,180
 He won't stir up much trouble. 

514
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,240
Master.

515
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,460
Master.

516
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,720
- Master.
- Master.

517
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,030
Can you take a look at me?

518
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,550
Look at me, please.

519
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,510
Please, look at me!

520
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,720
 Aside from this Steward Wang, 

521
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,000
 no one else here has any spiritual power. 

522
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,083
 Miss Mo? 

523
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,623
 Why is she here? 

524
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,460
You caused the commotion last night.

525
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,000
How did it end up like this?

526
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,790
 
We got the old one. The girl escaped.

527
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,780
No idea what spell she used,
but she hid her aura well.

528
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,270
Master will soon return.

529
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,960
No mistakes are allowed.

530
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,160
You're being too flashy.

531
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,150
If this causes trouble, and Master gets upset,

532
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,330
he might use us as dummies!

533
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,850
Understood, Protector.

534
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:54,110
Lately, I've told those five idiots

535
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,850
to search the capital for rogue cultivators.

536
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,710
Miss Mo?

537
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,320
Why are you here?

538
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,140
You're here too?

539
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:24,060
You're tailing Steward Wang?

540
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,280
He's the one I told you about.

541
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,480
He wiped out my clan,

542
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,230
Sect Leader of the Five-Color Sect.

543
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,630
He's dangerous.

544
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,620
Way out of your league.

545
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,070
Is he a cultivator?

546
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,490
More or less.

547
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,710
But he reeks of dark aura.

548
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,960
Clearly a demonic type.

549
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,410
Not a righteous man.

550
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,200
I should've figured.

551
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,860
Everything he said
and all those shady dealings...

552
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,805
How are there so many cultivators in the world,

553
00:36:58,805 --> 00:37:01,065
and I just happen to meet them all?

554
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,480
Miss Mo, this place is dangerous.

555
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,000
Before anyone sees you, go back.

556
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,700
Don't come again.

557
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,890
Li.

558
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,260
I thought

559
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,290
I'd never see you again.

560
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,920
On the day we parted at the Yan Clan Stronghold,

561
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,260
you didn't say anything.

562
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,930
But I knew

563
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,660
a mortal like me who can't cultivate

564
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,370
could never walk the same path as you.

565
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,890
Our lives are far too short,

566
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:55,490
like morning dew that will be gone in a blink.

567
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,060
All love, hate, longing will turn to dust.

568
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,030
But even with such a fleeting life,

569
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,370
I still want to make it count.

570
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,320
Even if it's like a moth to a flame,

571
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,960
even if it ends in nothing, I still want to try.

572
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,370
- But you...
- Li!

573
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,590
All these years,

574
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,330
you haven't changed

575
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,810
a single bit.

576
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,700
Don't worry.

577
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:48,710
Today, I won't kill him.

578
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,540
I won't go head-on with him again.

579
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,510
I'll do as you and Father taught me.

580
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,960
I'll do it one step at a time,

581
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,000
find his weakness and trap him,

582
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,450
until the day I can kill him.

583
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,800
No matter how it's done,

584
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,220
no matter how long it takes.

585
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,850
Farewell,

586
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,220
Li.

587
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,450
Miss Mo.

588
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,620
If I told you to stop, you wouldn't listen.

589
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,810
Very well, then.

590
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,930
 You've been compromised. 

591
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,140
 Do you admit your guilt? 

592
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,070
I was too blind to see your powerful presence.

593
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,780
Please, spare me!

594
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,180
Senior,

595
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,190
I am just a newcomer here.

596
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,030
All I've done is enjoy some mortal offerings.

597
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,630
I don't know

598
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:12,070
what crime I've committed.

599
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:16,590
 Whether you have or not, that's for me to decide. 

600
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:20,190
I'll ask the questions. Answer truthfully.

601
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,800
Yes! Yes!

602
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,070
-  You may rise. 
- Thank you, Senior.

603
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,850
Many thanks, Senior.

604
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,030
 What is your name? 

605
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,110
 Who is your master? 

606
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:35,510
 That Fire Control Technique
you used back in the hall, 

607
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,400
 where did you learn it? 

608
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,510
Senior,

609
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,550
I'm Wu San Xing.

610
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,000
I have no sect or master.

611
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,150
I'm just a rogue cultivator.

612
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:48,452
As for that spell, I developed it

613
00:42:48,452 --> 00:42:52,000
through my own practice and knowledge.

614
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,880
It was a simple trick to fool the mortals.

615
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,850
I meant no offense.

616
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,230
If you like it, I'm willing

617
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,760
to offer it up with both hands.

618
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,920
 A smooth talker. 

619
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,080
 Clearly used to dealing in the mortal world 

620
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,931
 and very street smart. 

621
00:43:12,931 --> 00:43:14,981
 Quite impressive. 

622
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:40,670
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫
