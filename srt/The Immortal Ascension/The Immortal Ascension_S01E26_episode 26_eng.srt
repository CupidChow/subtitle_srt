1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,512
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,512 --> 00:00:27,115
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:29,146
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:32,531
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:36,187
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:37,932
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:41,990
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,534
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:50,969
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,198
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:01,312
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:05,792
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,304
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:13,569
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:15,694
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:17,889
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:20,130
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,810
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,984
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,984 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,020
 

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,050
 Qu Hun, 

25
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:48,771
 where are you? 

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,320
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

27
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:12,899
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

28
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,860
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫ 

29
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,885
 ♫ Old scenes rise again... ♫ 

30
00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:21,415
 Found you. 

31
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,080
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

32
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:40,101
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

33
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:43,675
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

34
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:46,106
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

35
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:52,746
 ♫ Eyes once looked far, now lost in the shift... ♫ 

36
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,225
 Why? 

37
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:02,820
 Why is spiritual power from Tier Five or Six
of the Qi Refining Stage radiating from him? 

38
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,230
 Zhang Tie, is that you? 

39
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,980
 Have you come back? 

40
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,376
Blockhead!

41
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:20,906
Blockhead!

42
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,700
Where have you been?

43
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:29,596
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

44
00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:32,316
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

45
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,039
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

46
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,840
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days... ♫ 

47
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,520
 Is this real? 

48
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,045
 Zhang Tie,is it really you? 

49
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:48,120
 Have you come back? 

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,555
Father!

51
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:50,985
Father!

52
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,280
Come here, darling. Good girl.

53
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,020
Is that medicine for your mother?

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,750
- She fell asleep after lunch.
- Good girl.

55
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,150
Is that so?

56
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,780
 He's not Zhang Tie. 

57
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,490
 Who is he? 

58
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,930
You're certainly good at playing the part.

59
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,800
Who are you?

60
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,520
Who are you?

61
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,750
That's my question.

62
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,310
I don't understand what you're saying.

63
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,190
Is that so?

64
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,750
You've taken someone else's body.

65
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,590
That woman and child aren't yours either.

66
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,190
So, I'll ask you again.

67
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,900
Who are you?

68
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,250
You know me?

69
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,910
To be honest with you, I've forgotten everything

70
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,410
since I fell off that cliff five years ago.

71
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,490
I don't remember my name, or why I'm here.

72
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,140
But I keep hearing a friend calling out to me.

73
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,630
Over and over, he calls my name,

74
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,690
yet I just can't remember.

75
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,090
There's something important I must have forgotten.

76
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,520
Why?

77
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,580
Why can't I remember?

78
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,340
Why?

79
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,800
Why can't I remember?

80
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,460
Why can't I remember?

81
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,900
I just can't seem to recall...

82
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,510
Zhang Tie, don't be like this.

83
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,170
It's not your fault.

84
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,700
Zhang Tie?

85
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,460
My name is Zhang Tie?

86
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,820
You really aren't Zhang Tie.

87
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,410
There's no way you could be.

88
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,560
Though, you are very much like him.

89
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,270
Watching you
eat, work the forge,

90
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,600
even the way you talk...

91
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,580
I almost believed he had come back.

92
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,730
But a person's eyes never lie.

93
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,270
Yours are cold and calculating.

94
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,460
You couldn't possibly be him.

95
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,360
So what?

96
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,260
Why does it matter to you?

97
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,950
His life-bound artifact is with you?

98
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,800
This body isn't yours.

99
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,460
Get out of it!

100
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,020
Dear, what's going on?

101
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,410
Father.

102
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,210
Did you hear something?

103
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,070
There was a stray cat sneaking up on our duckling.

104
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,650
We chased it away.

105
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,340
Dear.

106
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,430
And who is our guest?

107
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,070
He's a friend who came looking for me.

108
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,830
Kept insisting I make him a new set of weapons.

109
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,120
I've already turned him down several times.

110
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,600
That's right.

111
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,480
- I hope I didn't disturb you, Ma'am.
- Not at all.

112
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,630
- Please, come in.
- No need.

113
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,580
We'll just have a quick word,
then I'll be on my way.

114
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,040
Yue, help your mother back to her room.

115
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,810
- Close the door. It's windy.
- Go on.

116
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,970
Hurry. Go inside.

117
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,360
Speak.

118
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,070
Who are you?

119
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,160
If you tell the truth,
I promise I won't harm them.

120
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,530
But if you lie, well, you can try me.

121
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,830
I was injured in a battle against an enemy.

122
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,800
I was desperate and took this body.

123
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,720
I had no choice.

124
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,120
Please forgive me.

125
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,090
At least that sounds reasonable.

126
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,780
Which sect are you from?

127
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,920
I'm from Spirit Beast Mountain.

128
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,970
Are you also with the Seven Sects?

129
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,950
Oh, you're from the Spirit Beast Mountain.

130
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,730
How's your Senior Zhong Wu doing?

131
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,120
You know Senior Zhong Wu?

132
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,820
That's good to hear.
Looks like we're all acquainted.

133
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,720
Yes.

134
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,260
All acquaintances.

135
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,460
Zhong Wu cut ties with Spirit Beast Mountain
a long time ago.

136
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,360
Still not ready to tell the truth?

137
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll talk!

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,210
I'll talk.

139
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,270
I'm a disciple

140
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,940
of the Beast Taming Sect under the Tiandu Kingdom.

141
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,040
The Six Demonic Sects?

142
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,460
Yes.

143
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:58,423
 Years ago, I fought someone here 

144
00:09:58,423 --> 00:09:59,840
 and was seriously injured. 

145
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,360
 My body was destroyed, and in desperation, 

146
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,310
 I let my primordial spirit leave the body. 

147
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,070
 Just when I had lost all hope, 

148
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,750
 I found this empty vessel without a soul. 

149
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,360
 But after entering this body,
my cultivation plummeted. 

150
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,550
 To avoid that powerful enemy, 

151
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,983
 I disguised myself as an ordinary man 

152
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,510
 and made a living with a blacksmith in the city. 

153
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,440
Over time, I got close to the townspeople,

154
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,200
and someone even tried to matchmake for me.

155
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Eventually, she became my wife,

156
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,930
and that child became my daughter.

157
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,080
Before I knew it, five years
had passed just like that.

158
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,530
You never thought about going back?

159
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,500
In the demonic sects,
it's all survival of the fittest.

160
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,870
Now that I'm weak, if I returned,

161
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,690
my own fellow sect members would likely kill me.

162
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,500
Besides,

163
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,510
these hands are better suited to the forge

164
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,620
than the battlefield.

165
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,240
Life is peaceful now.

166
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,780
Why would I want to go back
to a world of endless killing?

167
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,150
Peaceful?

168
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,960
The demonic sects have already taken
over the eastern region of Yue Kingdom.

169
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,150
How long do you think this peace will last?

170
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,720
Already?

171
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,860
That can't be. It's far too soon.

172
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,410
You're not an ordinary demonic cultivator.

173
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,960
Tell me.

174
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,860
Who are you, really?

175
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,870
No matter who I used to be,

176
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,790
that part of me is gone now.

177
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,360
Why press me for answers?

178
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,080
Take my advice.

179
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,720
The Seven Sects will lose.

180
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,790
Make your move early.

181
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,930
Don't lose your life in vain.

182
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:03,080
 This man knows more than he's letting on. 

183
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,930
 I'll have to pry more information out of him. 

184
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,960
Right now, the battle is at a stalemate.

185
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,870
The Seven Sects are united
against the demonic sects,

186
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,220
but talk of victory or defeat
seems a little premature.

187
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,550
There's a long and bitter
history between the Seven Sects

188
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,120
and the Six Demonic Sects.

189
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
Cultivators are innately selfish.

190
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,902
Backstabbing is nothing new.

191
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:33,030
The so-called impenetrable
alliance of the Seven Sects

192
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,050
has already been thoroughly infiltrated by us.

193
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,270
In fact, Spirit Beast Mountain

194
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,480
is the Beast Taming Sect's spy here.

195
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,397
The Six Demonic Sects will win this battle.

196
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,080
Spirit Beast Mountain pretended to defect,

197
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,870
then wiped out two Core Formation
Stage cultivators from the demonic sects.

198
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,810
Everyone in the Seven Sects knows that story.

199
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,480
This whole "spy" thing

200
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,260
was just a lie to fool the ignorant.

201
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,240
Without those Core Formation cultivators "dying,"

202
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,030
would the Seven Sects have so easily trusted us?

203
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,190
Besides, do you genuinely
believe the ones who died

204
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,320
were actually Core Formation cultivators?

205
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,589
As far as I know, the Six Demonic Sects

206
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:23,120
have at least three secret techniques

207
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,200
that forcefully boost
a Foundation Establishment cultivator

208
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,030
to appear as a Core Formation one.

209
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,120
The effect doesn't last long,

210
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,220
but long enough to deceive your people.

211
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,810
Give me one reason not to kill you.

212
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:12,630
If you spare me, I'll tell you
where I've been hiding.

213
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,620
All the artifacts and gems there will be yours.

214
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:22,810
They are of no use to this body anyway.

215
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,220
You expect me to believe your generosity?

216
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,960
You're calculating, that's for sure.

217
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,270
Fine.

218
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,270
Given how things have turned out,

219
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,290
I'll hand over the artifacts and gems

220
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,870
as well as the jade slips and letters

221
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,030
that detail my sect's dealings

222
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,020
with Spirit Beast Mountain.

223
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,510
If what you find isn't enough,

224
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,000
go ahead and kill me right here.

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,200
I won't complain.

226
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,860
But please,

227
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,980
spare my wife and daughter.

228
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,030
They're mere mortals.

229
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,960
They've done nothing wrong.

230
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,750
 Something about this feels off. 

231
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,020
 Better to be cautious. 

232
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,860
Where can I find the items?

233
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,720
Right here.

234
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,410
If you're not convinced, I'll go with you.

235
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,390
You seem impatient.

236
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,020
You'll have to wait right here until I get back.

237
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,191
 Such a crude trap. 

238
00:16:50,191 --> 00:16:52,611
 You think too little of me. 

239
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,780
Go.

240
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,620
What's...

241
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,570
It's fast.

242
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,450
It even blocked off my escape.

243
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,160
 

244
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,660
What kind of demon beast is this?

245
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,890
It even flies.

246
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,685
 Even if it's not Level Five,
it's at least peak Level Four. 

247
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:15,335
 That's enough to hold its own
against a Core Formation cultivator. 

248
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,200
 My Mother-Child Blades! 

249
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,920
 This loss cuts deep. 

250
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,110
 If this keeps up, 

251
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,990
 it's only a matter of time before I get caught. 

252
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,610
 This better work. 

253
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,240
 That was too close. 

254
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,350
 I nearly lost my life back there. 

255
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,240
 This place isn't far from Jiayuan City. 

256
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,780
 A demon beast that strong can't be wild. 

257
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,550
 It probably belongs 

258
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,750
 to that man from the Beast Taming Sect. 

259
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,240
 No Foundation Establishment cultivator 

260
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,200
 could control a creature like this. 

261
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,810
 Could that guy have been
a Core Formation cultivator? 

262
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,445
 Curses. 

263
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:37,775
 The pouch I risked everything to retrieve
is empty. 

264
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,020
All right.

265
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,020
So you set me up.

266
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:49,027
Don't blame me for what happens next.

267
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,700
You're still alive.

268
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,720
 That pill has a strange effect. 

269
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,290
 It pushed his power straight
up to Mid Foundation Stage. 

270
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,530
Blood Spirit Drill!

271
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,030
The Verdant Sword.

272
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,700
That's a Core Formation Stage artifact.

273
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,480
 A Spirit Companion,
a Core Formation Stage artifact, 

274
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,510
 and a Golden Core. 

275
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,400
 This man was definitely
a Core Formation Stage cultivator. 

276
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,680
Even...

277
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,260
Even the Goldenback Demon Mantis
couldn't kill you.

278
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,420
Being bested by you today

279
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,090
is no dishonor...

280
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,290
You are indeed a Core Formation cultivator.

281
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,460
Any last words?

282
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,920
Father!

283
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,070
Dear!

284
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,740
What happened to you?

285
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,350
They... They had nothing to do with this.

286
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:31,130
Please... Please do not harm them...

287
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,920
Was I the one who harmed them?

288
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,440
You should know this already.

289
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,180
Your body is steeped in dark aura.

290
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,510
Just being near you drains their life force.

291
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,790
They don't have much time left.

292
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,920
You think I don't know that?

293
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,510
All the cultivation I have left

294
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,660
is sealed inside this broken core.

295
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,550
Once they take it, it will restore their vitality

296
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,940
and extend their lives.

297
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,740
You knew this day would come.

298
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,420
Father...

299
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,070
I spent half my life committing evil,

300
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:16,372
and now the last thing I do is for two mortals...

301
00:25:16,372 --> 00:25:20,780
- Dear...
- Father, please don't die.

302
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:28,240
The things I promised
are on my real body in the cave.

303
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,350
I wasn't lying.

304
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,240
The messages with Spirit Beast Mountain,

305
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,940
and my identity token, will prove everything.

306
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,220
I leave the rest to you.

307
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,890
Thank you...

308
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,827
When you wake,

309
00:26:04,123 --> 00:26:06,413
forget all of this...

310
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,540
Cultivator, in your world,

311
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,290
what's genuine and what's forged?

312
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,477
Now,

313
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:10,967
it's time to figure out
how to handle that demon beast.

314
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,370
The Five Phases Reversing Array
has never let me down.

315
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,070
This has to be the remains
of that Beast Taming Sect cultivator.

316
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,880
With wounds like those,

317
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,720
it's no surprise he didn't even have time
to retrieve his mystic pouch.

318
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,260
 This is a Spirit Companion Beast Egg. 

319
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:13,270
 These insects are unbelievably tough. 

320
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:16,850
 The Beast Taming Sect does have some skill. 

321
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,810
"Compendium of Mystical Insects."

322
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Blood Jade Spider, ranked 108.

323
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,880
Goldenback Demon Mantis, ranked 73.

324
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,090
Gold-devouring Bug, ranked 12.

325
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,680
Seriously?

326
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,510
You're kidding.

327
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,810
That Goldenback Demon Mantis ranks just 73?

328
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,090
"A Guide to Breeding and Commanding Them."

329
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,590
Never mind.

330
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,330
I'll study this when I have the time.

331
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:18,640
Found it.

332
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,480
Correspondence between Spirit Beast
Mountain and the Beast Taming Sect.

333
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,880
Your master is dead.

334
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,680
You can rest now.

335
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,590
The damage you caused to my artifact

336
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,510
will be repaid using your materials.

337
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,020
Qu Hun, I'll craft you a proper armor with this.

338
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,680
The matter's wrapped up.

339
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,460
It's time to report back.

340
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,130
No matter the outcome,

341
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,700
I have done my part.

342
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,510
Elder Han rose to fame in a single battle.

343
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,510
I'm nowhere near that level.

344
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,590
Even with the stalemate at Golden Drum Plains,

345
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,440
you still hold everything together.

346
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,700
I respect that.

347
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,510
At this point,

348
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,400
the Seven Sects are on the verge of destruction.

349
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,550
No one can afford to sit this out.

350
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,270
Watching our disciples storm
the battlefield one after another,

351
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,400
how could an old man like me just stand aside?

352
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,368
Even if not for myself,

353
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:48,700
I must fight for all my disciples.

354
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,680
Everyone! Look who just showed up!

355
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,240
No one going to give me a proper welcome?

356
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,720
Shameless. You show up late
and expect a grand entrance?

357
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,550
I'm late? My apologies.

358
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,750
Han, when did you arrive?

359
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,000
Just got here myself.

360
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,110
See? We're about the same.

361
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,200
Enough.

362
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,000
I'm hungry and thirsty.

363
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,350
Bring out the best pastries
from Yellow Maple Valley.

364
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,110
No pastries, but plenty of sand.

365
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,640
Want some?

366
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,920
Enough banter. Let's get down to business.

367
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,680
Take out your upgraded Level Four
demon beast mahjong set.

368
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,590
Waging war every day gets tedious.

369
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,350
We need a way to relieve some tension.

370
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,110
Now that's more like it.

371
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,460
Put that away.

372
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Fu Yun Zi, stop turning up just to eat and play.

373
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,880
We called you here for a serious matter.

374
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,000
That's right.

375
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,330
Hong Fu, please speak.

376
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,030
Our scouts on the front lines

377
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,720
have observed signs that
the demonic sects may launch

378
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,790
an offensive at the start of next month.

379
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:51,160
Hua Yuan and I are planning to send a group

380
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,310
to strike their rear lines.

381
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,940
Hit them where they least expect it?

382
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,640
Hong Fu, that's a brilliant strategy!

383
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,880
How about we make a wager on the outcome?

384
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,680
You want to bet on this, too?

385
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,920
What are you betting on, success or failure?

386
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,798
- Success, of course.
- And the rest of us?

387
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:06,879
Failure.

388
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:08,099
Get out of here!

389
00:33:09,338 --> 00:33:11,078
Getting out of here...

390
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,260
 Dear Master, this is Han Li, your disciple,
sending my respects. 

391
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,110
 I have returned
to the valley to cultivate in seclusion. 

392
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,510
 All is well within the valley. 

393
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,890
 My thoughts are with you and you alone. 

394
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,440
 The situation at the front remains uncertain. 

395
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,960
 On my journey back,
I uncovered evidence of collusion 

396
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,480
 between Spirit Beast Mountain
and the Beast Taming Sect. 

397
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,790
 I have submitted this proof to the Sect Master. 

398
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,590
 For the sake of morale and caution, 

399
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,460
 the Sect Master has chosen to keep
this matter undisclosed. 

400
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,480
 I fear it may affect the front lines 

401
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,890
 and place you and the other mentors in danger. 

402
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,310
 Though it breaks protocol,
I felt compelled to write. 

403
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,500
 May you remain vigilant. 

404
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,590
 I have done all I can from afar. 

405
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:06,615
 Master, may this message reach you in time
to avert disaster. 

406
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,090
The great war approaches.

407
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,810
You must keep yourself safe too.

408
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,500
The Goldenback Demon Mantis armor...

409
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,090
is too small.

410
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,890
They've already hatched.

411
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,180
And they eat so much.

412
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,460
I suppose not all cultivators
can afford to keep Spirit Companions.

413
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,610
I should find time to visit the Herbs Garden.

414
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,660
Get in.

415
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,370
Master replied already?

416
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,880
Do you remember our promise to admire the flowers

417
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,700
beneath Baili Mountain?

418
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,180
Maybe you can go on my behalf?

419
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,220
Senior Chen.

420
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:34,298
When I was young, my mother often brought me here

421
00:36:34,298 --> 00:36:36,670
to gather wild chrysanthemums.

422
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:40,550
To her, no flower was more beautiful

423
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,700
than these wild chrysanthemums.

424
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,670
But after she passed away a few years ago,

425
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,700
I stopped coming.

426
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,230
Senior, please accept my condolences.

427
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,660
It's all right.

428
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,280
To her,

429
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,600
it might have been a release
from the burdens she carried.

430
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,600
She was also married into the Chen family
through a political alliance.

431
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,190
Before their wedding,
she and my father had never met.

432
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,620
After marriage, they treated
each other with respect,

433
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,810
but I know

434
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,010
they never truly opened up to one another.

435
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,400
Do you think it's unbecoming for me
as a cultivator

436
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,620
to always be caught up in matters of love?

437
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,290
Not at all.

438
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,150
Sadly, you don't understand.

439
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,510
For women born into noble families,

440
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,440
from the day we are born,

441
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,000
our lives no longer belong to ourselves.

442
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:50,030
We train day after day,
bringing benefits to our clans.

443
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,030
Maybe, just maybe, 1 prodigy out of 10,000

444
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,190
might earn the trust of the
Seven Sects within 100 years

445
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,840
and gain the right to choose their fate.

446
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,740
But most of them end up like me.

447
00:38:05,898 --> 00:38:07,590
You're being too modest.

448
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,704
Since you entered the valley,

449
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:11,590
your diligence and calmness in all matters

450
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,880
have surely not gone unnoticed by anyone.

451
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,150
Even if you're not a prodigy,

452
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,260
you're well beyond the average clan disciple.

453
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,410
You know that's not the answer I wanted to hear.

454
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:31,330
The reason I asked to see you today

455
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,100
is that hat I may soon be married.

456
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,760
The groom is the son of the Qi family.

457
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,566
We've never met,

458
00:38:44,566 --> 00:38:48,710
but I've heard he's a man of decent character.

459
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,400
War is raging across the land, and no one is safe.

460
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,010
If the Chen family can form an alliance with them

461
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,220
and find shelter from the chaos, then...

462
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,110
When we were in the Imperial Capital,

463
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,320
I saw Wei Niang and Senior Liu together.

464
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,710
I found myself envying them.

465
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,760
At least they met and fell in love.

466
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,140
Even if they were separated by life and death,

467
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,660
it was still better

468
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,410
than living an entire life trapped, never free,

469
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,700
and dying with regrets.

470
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,410
Why?

471
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,740
Why should I be forced
to marry someone I've never met?

472
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,070
Why should I be passed around like some commodity,

473
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,780
today to the Lu family, tomorrow to the Qi family?

474
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,850
Why should the fate of the entire clan

475
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,490
be placed on the shoulders of a single woman?

476
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:55,220
No one has ever asked what I want.

477
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,010
Not once.

478
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,060
Can I lean on you, just for a moment?

479
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,410
Han,

480
00:40:21,707 --> 00:40:24,360
I know you're different.

481
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,740
Are you planning something?

482
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,320
Can you take me away from here?

483
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,550
Just take me away.

484
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,810
Anywhere will do, so long...

485
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,140
So long as it's a place where I can be free.

486
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,299
I've done all of this and yet you still hold back.

487
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:47,550
You're making me feel quite embarrassed.

488
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,330
Do you

489
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,700
already have someone in your heart?

490
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,820
Senior, please don't tease me like that.

491
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:03,300
 ♫ Time and time again, it never changes... ♫ 

492
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,100
Thank you for all the times

493
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,741
you've saved me.

494
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:12,300
 ♫ Taking away my emptiness... ♫ 

495
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,590
I have nothing worthy to give in return,

496
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,780
but I am skilled with embroidery.

497
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,360
I made a robe for you.

498
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,000
Try it on and see if it fits.

499
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,920
You're a Late Foundation Stage cultivator now.

500
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,010
You ought to look the part.

501
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,630
It's just a gift.

502
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,370
If you refuse, I'll have to throw it away.

503
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,330
Thank you, Senior.

504
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,840
 ♫ We promised to enter the dream together... ♫ 

505
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,100
It has purification and water-repelling arrays
woven into it.

506
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,700
You put a lot of thought into it.

507
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,360
 ♫ Let time sweep through... ♫ 

508
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:04,030
Senior, I have some beauty-enhancing pills here.

509
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,550
I made them myself.

510
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,180
Please, accept them.

511
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,100
As long as they're not anything weird.

512
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,161
 ♫ It's as if we've never left each other ♫ 

513
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:20,721
 ♫ Searching and searching... ♫ 

514
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,190
It's getting late.

515
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,280
It's time for me to leave the valley.

516
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,850
Han,

517
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,260
until we meet again.

518
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,140
Take care, Senior.

519
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,565
 ♫ Let time sweep through ♫ 

520
00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:57,254
 ♫ The mountains ♫ 

521
00:43:57,254 --> 00:44:00,854
 ♫ Thoughts turn... ♫ 

522
00:44:01,992 --> 00:44:07,104
No matter what happens, I hope
you find the freedom you seek.

523
00:44:07,104 --> 00:44:10,092
 ♫ If our heart connects ♫ 

524
00:44:10,092 --> 00:44:13,100
 ♫ It's as if we've never left each other ♫ 

525
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,685
 ♫ Searching and searching ♫ 

526
00:44:15,685 --> 00:44:20,645
 ♫ For your whereabouts ♫ 

527
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,405
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

528
00:44:41,405 --> 00:44:47,278
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

529
00:44:47,278 --> 00:44:50,719
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫ 

530
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:53,172
 ♫ Old scenes rise again ♫ 

531
00:44:53,172 --> 00:44:56,533
 ♫ Too hard to forget ♫ 

532
00:44:56,533 --> 00:45:01,318
 ♫ Easier just to miss ♫ 

533
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:08,009
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

534
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:13,765
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

535
00:45:13,765 --> 00:45:17,318
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

536
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:19,734
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

537
00:45:19,734 --> 00:45:22,948
 ♫ Eyes once looked far ♫ 

538
00:45:22,948 --> 00:45:27,258
 ♫ Now lost in the shift ♫ 

539
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:30,531
 ♫ Autumn winds stir ♫ 

540
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:33,070
 ♫ Smoke curls once more ♫ 

541
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,925
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫ 

542
00:45:35,925 --> 00:45:40,060
 ♫ Returning to my eyes ♫ 

543
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,340
 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫ 

544
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,453
 ♫ Time lost its name ♫ 

545
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:49,601
 ♫ Was it yesterday ♫ 

546
00:45:49,601 --> 00:45:53,671
 ♫ Or tomorrow? ♫ 

547
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:56,912
 ♫ The world has changed ♫ 

548
00:45:56,912 --> 00:45:59,459
 ♫ Beyond recall ♫ 

549
00:45:59,459 --> 00:46:01,555
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

550
00:46:01,555 --> 00:46:06,906
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

551
00:46:06,906 --> 00:46:10,653
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

552
00:46:10,653 --> 00:46:16,758
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫ 

553
00:46:16,758 --> 00:46:23,359
 ♫ In a fleeting moment we call eternity ♫ 

554
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:31,327
 ♫ In a fleeting moment called eternity ♫
