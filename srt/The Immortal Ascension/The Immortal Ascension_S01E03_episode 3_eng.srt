"A Mortal's Heart" - Wang Zhengliang

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,480
♫  Pursuing the wind and moon, I set out on a long journey  ♫

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,120
♫  The road ahead is uncertain, words are insignificant  ♫

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,160
♫  I’ve tasted joys and sorrows  ♫

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,480
♫  I conceal my abilities, and make careful plans  ♫

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,140
♫  A mortal’s heart with a few concerns  ♫

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,580
♫  Accompanying me around the kingdom  ♫

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,960
♫  I take the opportunity to reverse the desperate situation  ♫

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,480
♫  Longing for a bosom friend in this mortal world  ♫

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,860
♫  I’ve yet to figure out what immortality is  ♫

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,921
♫  That eternity is also a fleeting moment  ♫

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,280
♫  Don’t mock me for being ordinary  ♫

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,180
♫  Alone, I fight the disasters; the world is in a turmoil  ♫

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
♫  Don’t scorn me for being ordinary  ♫

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,440
♫  Keep a kind heart, be decisive and kill if need be  ♫

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,660
♫  There are hidden joys and sorrows in fate  ♫

18
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,000
♫  Between life and death, I strive to save a desperate situation  ♫

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,080
♫  Faith carries me through the long and endless night  ♫

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,415
♫  I will return with an enlightened heart  ♫

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,960
♫  Extraordinary after final training, I enter the vast three realms 

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,470
♫  And achieved nirvana in the cycle of reincarnation  ♫

23
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,980
   

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,892
   

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,300
   

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,490
 He's back. 

27
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,550
 And he brought someone with him. 

28
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,980
 Who's that person with the mask? 

29
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,910
What's the progress of your chant?

30
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,840
You're asking too early. It's not time yet.

31
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,460
The world is so vast. No matter where I go,

32
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,010
I always worry about you.

33
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,130
 Physician Mo's face is looking more lifeless. 

34
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,800
Show me your hand.

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,370
 Since you lied to me first, I see no reason to tell you the truth. 

36
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,260
 The power of Level Five can let me control the strength and weakness of my vital energy. 

37
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,980
 If I control it at Level Three, he won't notice my progress. 

38
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,950
I told you not to play tricks in front of me.

39
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,950
How will you punish me?

40
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,350
Not bad. I indeed chose the right person.

41
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,740
You can remain calm now.

42
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,310
But don't worry, you'll be fine.

43
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,130
Your deadline for a year is not up yet.

44
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,430
But it's already been so long.

45
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,560
Why is your cultivation still stuck at Level Three?

46
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:31,359
I did my best.

47
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,080
Do you know what I previously let you consume?

48
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,770
 Consume this. 

49
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,650
That medicine is called the Corpse Worm Pill.

50
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,420
Perhaps, it's not a medicine.

51
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,960
It's a worm's egg concocted with a secret method.

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,700
Once swallowed, it hides in your body.

53
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,930
But don't worry.

54
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,810
You'll be completely safe for now.

55
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,080
As long as, within a year,

56
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,260
you take my antidote regularly,

57
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,300
that egg will dissolve on its own without leaving any side effects.

58
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,680
Otherwise...

59
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:32,740
it'll absorb nutrients inside your body, hatch,

60
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,900
and start eating every last one of your organs,

61
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,400
until you die slowly in unspeakable pain.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,380
Besides, a few days ago, I went to Qingniu Town.

63
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,470
I saw your family from a distance. They're doing fine

64
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,990
and eating big pancakes.

65
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,570
As your younger sister, she's grown into a young lady.

66
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,740
She's quite a beauty.

67
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,610
I swear!

68
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,020
In three months, I'll reach Level Four.

69
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,260
This is more like it.

70
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,420
All right then.

71
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,420
I'll stay here in the valley for three months.

72
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,590
I'm not going anywhere else.

73
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:31,000
I went through a lot of effort to find these pills for you.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,970
It'll greatly help your cultivation.

75
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,020
Do whatever you want during these three months.

76
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,300
Rest assured, I won't keep watch on you again.

77
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,800
But... if you still haven't achieved it by then,

78
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,610
our lives will expire after these three months.

79
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,620
 Only three months left. 

80
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,750
 I must make the most of it. 

81
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,380
That brat even learned to make poison!

82
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,620
I didn't teach him this.

83
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,260
This rotten brat is so ruthless

84
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,270
and ungrateful to the core.

85
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,580
 I've only just started cultivating. 

86
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,000
 I can't rely on normal tactics to defeat someone like Physician Mo. 

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,050
 Li Feiyu found a tactic for me. It's called the Secret Manual of the Blinking Sword Technique. 

88
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,110
 He said it suits someone like me without any foundation. 

89
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,810
 Instead of a sword technique, it's more like a technique for assassination. 

90
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,800
 It's about using your surroundings, setting traps, 

91
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,430
 manipulating lights and shadows to mislead your enemy, 

92
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,980
 so you can land a fatal strike. 

93
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,580
 

94
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,700
 I've finally reached Level Six. 

95
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,290
 All my five senses have grown sharper. 

96
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,680
 From the gurgle of distant streams 

97
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,185
 to the flutter of nearby insect's wings, 

98
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:32,885
 I can sense them with perfect clarity. 

99
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,170
I give up!

100
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,800
Teaching a disciple is really exhausting work!

101
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,770
How do you get faster by the day?

102
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,080
You're just a good master.

103
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,080
Take this.

104
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:24,295
It matches your Blinking Sword Technique perfectly.

105
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,600
Thank you.

106
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,510
I'm heading back now.

107
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,800
Han Li.

108
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,440
I don't know what you've been through lately.

109
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,952
But no matter what happens, don't face it alone.

110
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,402
Send a message by pigeon if you must.

111
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,280
Take care.

112
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,380
 The three months' deadline is up. 

113
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,204
 Physician Mo, I'm coming for you. 

114
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,499
 I've prepared whatever I can for today. 

115
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,829
 I won't be afraid again. 

116
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,370
You're punctual.

117
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,990
Where's the antidote?

118
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,220
Have you reached Level Four?

119
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,910
Where's the antidote?

120
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,900
When people fight to survive,

121
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,280
they will unleash their unimaginable abilities.

122
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,430
Take this.

123
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,700
I have one more question.

124
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,290
Speak.

125
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,160
Did Zhang Tie

126
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,870
really go home?

127
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,880
Of course.

128
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,650
You're lying!

129
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,170
I made a pact with him.

130
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,820
If we didn't amount to anything, we'd never go home!

131
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,570
See?

132
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,140
You only believed half of what I told you.

133
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,660
You acted cautious, but you're laughably naïve.

134
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,340
You already knew the answer,

135
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,130
why even ask?

136
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,142
You wanted me to cultivate to Level Four to remove your poison and cure you.

137
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,020
In fact, that was a lie.

138
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,650
Whatever you want to know,

139
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,180
I will tell you.

140
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,490
It's chilly out here.

141
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,280
Come, let's talk inside.

142
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,080
Come.

143
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,130
Heaven is on my side.

144
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,850
You've really reached Level Four!

145
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:01,556
I'm not going to die!

146
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:04,740
I'm only 37 years old.

147
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,700
I've barely started living!

148
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,340
Strange, isn't it?

149
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,050
I look so old at the age of 37.

150
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,620
Anyone who sees me would think I'm almost 80 and on death's door.

151
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,760
If not for the strange poison in my body that I've struggled to suppress it,

152
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,030
why would I go through all this trouble?

153
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,380
Come here.

154
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,030
Han Li.

155
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,600
Today marks the end of our master and disciple bond.

156
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,340
Show me what you've got.

157
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,570
Let me see what you've prepared.

158
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,170
In less than three months,

159
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,860
you've achieved a lot.

160
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,840
You really keep surprising me

161
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:16,410
but my reputation wasn't built on medical skills alone.

162
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,180
Do you think you can defeat me?

163
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:09,370
My ultimate technique, the Demon's Silver Palm, 
    

164
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:17,530
returns to the martial art community today.

165
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,340
Be good. Calm down, my dear disciple.

166
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:36,507
It'll all be over soon.

167
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,930
Rotten brat,

168
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,900
you even have a hidden trick?

169
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,690
You poisoned me.

170
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,620
You've the guts.

171
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,240
"Hide your skills with and intelligence in clumsiness."

172
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,950
You taught me that.

173
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,520
Armored Puppet!

174
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,480
"Hide cleverness with clumsiness."

175
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,080
That's what I taught you.

176
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,240
Iron Slave.

177
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,070
Stop struggling.

178
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,140
I created this puppet.

179
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,770
He only listens to me.

180
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,160
Relax, Han Li.

181
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,890
We were master and disciple, after all.

182
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,160
I won't let you suffer too much.

183
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,730
Did you also harm Zhang Tie?

184
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,620
Take a guess.

185
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,550
He regarded you as father, and you still harmed him?

186
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,610
I had no choice, too.

187
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,610
He didn't have a spiritual root.

188
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,010
He couldn't practice the Eternal Spring Technique.

189
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:46,220
He was useless to me.

190
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:50,894
Mo Juren!

191
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,060
Stop wasting time talking to him.

192
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,510
Do it now!

193
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,600
What's the rush?

194
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,180
At this point,

195
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,030
as long as your Seven Ghosts Devouring-soul Curse works

196
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,380
he can't escape.

197
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,450
Who are you talking to?

198
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,470
Whose voice is that?

199
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,820
Don't be afraid.

200
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,920
Don't resist.

201
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:15,290
Just enjoy this grand feast I've spent years preparing.

202
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,430
I can hardly wait for the thrill of rebirth.

203
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:29,370
The Soul-devouring Seven Ghosts!

204
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,560
Who are you?

205
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,330
Take a look.

206
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,960
This is what I used to look like.

207
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,200
Don't be afraid.

208
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,880
It won't hurt that much.

209
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,200
Relax.

210
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,030
Everything will end in a while.

211
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,480
Hurry, use the Immobilizing Talisman!

212
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,080
Don't let him bite his tongue!

213
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,680
Hurry up!

214
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,720
Or everything that you've done will be in vain!

215
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,350
Everything of yours will belong to us!

216
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,880
   

217
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,240
Give me your body.

218
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,720
Give it all to your master.

219
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,590
Give it to me.

220
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,960
- Give it to me!
 - Give it to me!

221
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,510
Mine... It's mine!

222
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,350
Give up everything you have. Hand it over!

223
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,510
Hand it over!

224
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,850
Give it all to your master!

225
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,750
Hand it over! Hand it over!

226
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,880
Hand it over! You're mine!

227
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,640
You belong to me! Give it to me!

228
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,550
- Give it to me!
- Give it to me!

229
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,550
Hand it over! Hand it over!

230
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,830
- Give it to me!
- Give it to me!

231
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,270
- Hand it over!
- No!

232
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,680
This is my body!

233
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,190
All of you, get out!

234
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,380
How did he break free?

235
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,000
Didn't you say I could possess him with your curse?

236
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,790
The curse I gave you could only hold the power of Level Four.

237
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,400
As for him, he has reached Level Four.

238
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,620
So, you want us to struggle and wear each other down,

239
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,750
so that you could swoop in and take over?

240
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,180
What do you think?

241
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,750
You cunning evil person.

242
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,880
I won't let you take him.

243
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,550
He's my disciple!

244
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,550
Enough talking.

245
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,500
Let's settle this with skill!

246
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,860
Level Six?

247
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,010
He tricked us.

248
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,600
He has reached Level Six!

249
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:34,670
Han Li, Han Li... Looks like...

250
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,900
I've really underestimated you.

251
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,099
"Use obscurity to do good deeds overtly."

252
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:41,880
That's what you taught me too.

253
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,290
You truly are my worthy disciple.

254
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,330
Now that it has come to this,

255
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,810
do you still have anything to say?

256
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,280
I don't.

257
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,670
I've nothing else to say.

258
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,625
That man just now was Yu Zitong.

259
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:20,386
Once you're out, don't believe a word he says.

260
00:29:20,386 --> 00:29:22,587
Kill him immediately.

261
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:25,340
A primordial spirit fears poison the most.

262
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,970
Use what you used on me.

263
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,720
That's enough.

264
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,420
Also, he fears the light.

265
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,610
Goodbye,

266
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,230
Master.

267
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,860
What about you?

268
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,030
Do you have anything else to say?

269
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,620
My name is Yu Zitong.

270
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,190
I'm from an aristocrat family of cultivators.

271
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:41,250
A cultivator, and from an aristocrat family?

272
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,160
I understand.

273
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,350
If you help me to find another body so that I can start over again,

274
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,930
in return, I'll recommend you to my aristocrat family.

275
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,410
 Don't believe a word he says. 

276
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,640
 Kill him immediately. 

277
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,380
 A primordial spirit fears poison the most. 

278
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,011
 Use what you used on me. 

279
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,590
In the world of cultivation, everything becomes easier

280
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,540
with a strong clan behind you.

281
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,520
How about it?

282
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,900
You said the same thing to Physician Mo, didn't you?

283
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,800
That lowly mortal, is he fit to be mentioned in our discussion?

284
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,485
That's right, too.

285
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,515
But he entrusted me with something for you.

286
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,010
Get lost!

287
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,880
Come out.

288
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,620
Come out!

289
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,570
 Also, 

290
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,600
 he fears the light. 

291
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,860
Let me out!

292
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,800
What are you doing?

293
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,830
Let me out!

294
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,390
Let me out now!

295
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,445
Whatever happened between you and Physician Mo,

296
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:41,960
I couldn't care less.

297
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,780
I just want to stay alive.

298
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:49,530
I don't harm others and I won't let others harm me!

299
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:23,260
Without Physician Mo's command, he indeed can't move.

300
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,210
 You should like this place. 

301
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,580
 No one will bother you 

302
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:16,010
 because no one knows you're no longer alive. 

303
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:23,800
 Master, rest here in peace. 

304
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:42,440
Old man, you won't even spare me after you're dead.

305
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,597
 Disciple Han Li, if you're reading this letter, 

306
00:35:58,597 --> 00:36:02,800
 it means I've lost, and you've won. 

307
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,680
 Congratulations. 

308
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,300
 I was helpless and resorted to this out of desperation. 

309
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,480
 It was fate. 

310
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,670
 It was destiny. 

311
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,480
 Now that I'm dead, 

312
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,230
 there's no point talking about who's right or wrong. 

313
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,740
 It'd just be laughable. 

314
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,480
 As for the poison in you from the Demon's Silver Palm, 

315
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,000
 I've left you some antidote. 

316
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,990
 It'll keep it suppressed for a few months. 

317
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,670
 But to fully cure it, 

318
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:35,010
 you'll need my family heirloom, the Sunwarmed Jade. 

319
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,960
 Han Li, I've never owed anyone an explanation. 

320
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,915
 Fate decides victory or defeat. 

321
00:36:42,915 --> 00:36:47,450
 However, my wife and daughter have nothing to do with this. 

322
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,620
 I trust you'll know what to do. 

323
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:58,130
 You kept asking me the whereabouts of Zhang Tie. 

324
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:02,930
 Sadly, in this world, there's no Zhang Tie left. 

325
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:07,840
 I never meant to kill him but he uncovered my secret. 

326
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,660
 Thus, I had no choice but to use his body to forge 

327
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,510
 a soulless and mindless puppet. 

328
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,360
 I named him Iron Slave. 

329
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,090
 This person's mind was completely wiped out. 

330
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,880
 It moves at the sound of a bell. 

331
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,600
 Bind it with your blood, and it obeys your will. 

332
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:39,380
♫  Shards of dreams inside a dream  ♫

333
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:46,040
♫  The slanting moon falls into the water  ♫

334
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,580
♫  I’ve been wandering for many years  ♫

335
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,020
♫  The sceneries surface again  ♫

336
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,360
♫  And are hard to forget  ♫

337
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,300
 ♫ easier to remember than to let go ♫ 

338
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,780
 ♫ We say the past is smoke and haze... ♫ 

339
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,565
 Blockhead, we should leave 

340
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,630
 Tie. 

341
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,700
 I have some, too. 

342
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,975
 My father made these for me after borrowing three bowls of flour from Uncle Niu. 

343
00:38:15,975 --> 00:38:18,320
 Blockhead, why don't you wear it? 

344
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,040
 It looks better on you. You can alternate them. 

345
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,180
♫  And obscured the views. Things change over the passage of time  ♫

346
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:32,900
All souls in this world eventually end like a song.

347
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:35,911
From now on,

348
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,200
you'll be called Qu Hun.
 (Song of a Soul) 

349
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,352
♫  Looking back from the mountain peak  ♫

350
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:45,200
♫  I’ve lost track of time  ♫

351

♫  Was it yesterday?  ♫

352

♫  Or tomorrow?  ♫

353

♫  The world has changed a lot  ♫

354
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,720

♫  Only this longing remains  ♫

♫  Spanning thousands of years  ♫

359
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:23,776
♫  In a fleeting moment called eternity  ♫

360
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,141
 Physician Mo left behind many secret manuals. 

361
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:31,892
 The outside world is dangerous and evil. 

362
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:35,497
 I need to learn a few more skills before I leave here. 

363
00:39:35,497 --> 00:39:38,967
   

364
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,280
   

365
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,490
 Eternal Spring Technique. So, that's the name of the chant. 

366
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,210
Why is there only half of it?

367
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,800
 Moving objects with the mind is called the Object Control Technique. 

368
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,830
 Heaven's Eye Technique is a kind of spell that reveals the depth of one's cultivation power. T

369
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,000
 Back then, Yu Zitong must have used this technique 

370
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,010
 to instantly recognize that I had reached Level Six. 

371
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:25,330
 But among them, the hardest to master must be the Fireball Technique. 

372
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:30,820
 But if I master this, the power is amazing. 

373
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,340
 81 strikes of the mountain bell. 

374
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,840
 The Wild Wolves Gang could even attack the Seven Mystics Sect? 

375
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,300
 Qu Hun, let's go. 

376
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,110
   

377
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,490
Seven Mystics Sect have suppressed us for many years.

378
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:28,520
I'm here today to settle the score!

379
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,220
   

380
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,740
Kill!

381
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,810
Kill them all!

382
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,570
Sect Leader Wang, do you want to fight till the end?

383
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,530
Sect Leader Jia,

384
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,700
I won't let you destroy the foundation of Seven Mystics Sect.

385
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:26,180
If I trigger the mechanism, the mountain will collapse!

386
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:33,660
If you don't want us to fight till the end, why not hear me out?

387
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,880
Sect Leader Wang,

388
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,220
what do you have in mind?

389
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,480
Stop the mechanism, and we'll talk!

390
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,360
Qu Hun, hurry!

391
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:06,030
I'm coming.

392
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,530
Move back.

393
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,336
Han Li!

394
00:44:17,336 --> 00:44:18,900
My good buddy!

395
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,580
I knew you will show up when the sect is in trouble.

396
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,010
They have invaded.

397
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,880
Let's go and protect the Sect Leader now!

398
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,620
   

399
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,060
I, Wang Juechu, the Sect Leader

400
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,810
agree with Jia Tianlong to settle this by a blood duel.

401
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,960
Ten men on each side

402
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,110
will fight till death.

403
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,550
Li Zhanling of the Seven Mystics Sect!

404
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,790
Liu Chong of the Seven Mystics Sect!

405
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:48,130
Count me in!

406
00:44:51,132 --> 00:44:53,570
Li Feiyu of Outer Blade Hall is here!

407
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,900
Who has the guts to fight me till death?

408
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:01,110
 I really didn't want to get involved but I can't just watch him walk into death. 

409
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:08,491
I won't sign the blood pact but I'll fight along with you.

410
00:45:08,491 --> 00:45:10,902
You're a physician. Why would you fight?

411
00:45:10,902 --> 00:45:13,130
- Step back!
- All of you, step back!

412
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,820
I'll handle this!

413
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,880
Martial Uncle Lu is here! We'll definitely win!

414
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,230
Martial Uncle Lu, kill them!

415
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,090
 

416
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:39,330
Jia Tianlong, are you making fun of me?

417
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:47,490
Even a lion goes full force when it's fighting a rabbit.

418
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,920
Forgive the offense!

419
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,940
 A cultivator? 
 

420
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,440
 His level is lower than mine. 

421
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,110
We have the help of a cultivator.

422
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:11,290
Didn't expect that, right?

423
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,230
- Martial Uncle!
 - Excellent!

424
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,840
Excellent!

425
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,010
Demon!

426
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,230
How dare you act so wildly!

427
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,260
You ant! Are you seeking death?!

428
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,990
Know your ability!

429
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,480
All of you will die today!

430
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:17,620
Why won't this precious thing obey me?

431
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,570
A cultivator!

432
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,890
Han Li...

433
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,530
Leave it to me.

434
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,250
Senior Brother Li.

435
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,550
This thing is not bad.

436
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:01,820
I'll keep it.

437
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,900
You!

438
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,110
Which family are you from?

439
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,410
Which family do you belong to?

440
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,290
I'm from the Ye family of Qinling,

441
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,460
just passing through on my way to Tainan Valley.

442
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,700
I didn't mean to be your enemy.

443
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,860
Since you're here, I'll back off.

444
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,740
What nonsense is this?

445
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,820
The Ye family from Qinling?

446
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,520
I've heard of them.

447
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:28,140
So why did you interfere?

448
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,610
I... I merely took up his offer.

449
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,540
I made an exception. I didn't mean to offend you!

450
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,410
An exception?

451
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:39,610
As cultivators, we really shouldn't meddle in mortal's affairs.

452
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,760
But... I also had no choice.

453
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:49,980
Since you've admitted your mistake, take back your Flying Sword Talisman.

454
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,610
I'll accept your kindness.

455
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:54,110
And you might want to stay away from these mortal ants,

456
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,550
or you'll be tainted by their bad luck.

457
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:08,890
- Great!
 - Great!

458
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,050
 What kind of treasure is this? 

459
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,810
 Even the Fireball Technique can't burn it. 

460
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,500
   

461
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,120
- Great!
 - Great!

462
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,780
Sect Leader Jia, where are you going?

463
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,565
Immortal Master, let's talk this through.

464
00:49:39,565 --> 00:49:41,740
I don't have any feud with you.

465
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:46,580
If you're willing to spare my life, I'll gladly reward you handsomely!

466
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:53,400
You kill people like mustard seeds. 
 (Kills without taking their lives seriously) 

467
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,750
Have you never thought this day would come?

468
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,820
Never mind about the rest. However,

469
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,510
I won't spare your life.

470
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,640
Will you take your own life

471
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,710
or shall I do it for you?

472
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,030
Brothers of the Wild Wolves Gang!

473
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:14,940
Kill!

474
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,991
Kill him!

475
00:50:18,991 --> 00:50:21,812
- Charge!  
 - Kill him!

476
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,030
I'm dead either way...

477
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:31,540
Sect Leader!

478
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,740
Immortal Master, you saved Seven Mystics Sect from danger today.

479
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,700
I'm extremely grateful.

480
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,830
I wonder how we can reward you.

481
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,420
I'll give you the position of Deputy Sect Master and one thousand taels of silver.

482
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,700
All the elders and disciples will obey your orders.

483
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:08,060
But the sect can only be handed over to you upon my death.

484
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,035
What do you think?

485
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,800
Why don't you first dismiss those who are lying in ambush?

486
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:40,590
They were probably instructed by Elder Zhang.

487
00:51:42,037 --> 00:51:46,410
Immortal Master, I didn't mean to disrespect you.

488
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:49,410
As a sect leader, there are things I can't control.

489
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:54,090
You'll understand when you establish your own sect one day.

490
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,340
Don't worry, Sect Leader.

491
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,380
I won't stay for long in Seven Mystics Sect.

492
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:05,070
I'll leave here for a distant place and will never return.

493
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:09,220
But before I leave, I would like to make a deal

494
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,080
that benefits us.

495
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,770
Of course. No problem.

496
00:52:18,274 --> 00:52:20,794
You haven't even heard my terms yet.

497
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,740
Immortal Master, please speak.

498
00:52:25,388 --> 00:52:27,324
Take Li Feiyu as your final disciple.

499
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:31,940
Also, appoint him as the head of Outer Blade Hall.

500
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,230
Fine.

501
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:36,850
Anything else?

502
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,450
He likes Elder Zhang's third daughter, Zhang Xiu Er

503
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,960
but Elder Zhang dislikes him because he's from a poor family.

504
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,880
I'll talk to him. It's not a big deal.

505
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,570
Anything else?

506
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,780
I have a third uncle

507
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,999
who's an outer disciple.

508
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:55,960
He brought me to the Seven Mystics Sect.

509
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,810
- If anything happens to him, I hope you'll take care of him. 
 - Of course.

510
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,360
No problem at all.

511
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,570
I won't leave without gratitude.

512
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,970
This is a rare and precious Nourishing Essence Pill.

513
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,110
Keep it.

514
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:16,290
It will save your life at a critical moment.

515
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,230
Whatever you've said,

516
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:25,720
I accept them all.

517
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,290
Farewell.

518
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,160
 ♫ That day I first saw you ♫ 

519
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,000
 ♫ We held close, hearts full of joy ♫ 

520
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,080
 ♫ We made a promise to reunite ♫ 

521
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,280
 ♫ And walked into the unknown ♫ 

522
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,040
 ♫ But now that we've met again... ♫ 

523
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,030
I've always been a loner.

524
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:59,590
Never thought I'd find a true friend like you.

525
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,010
I may not be good at much,

526
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:04,230
but I've never feared a fight!

527
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,640
Since we're brothers now,

528
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:10,620
if anyone ever dares to mess with you,

529
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:15,180
just give them my name, Li Fei Yu!

530
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,780
- Someday, my name will echo across the Tiannan Continent! 
 - Deal!

531
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,440
Li Feiyu!

532
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,620
Li Feiyu!

533
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:30,281
 ♫ There's still hardship ahead ♫ 

534
00:54:30,281 --> 00:54:32,906
 ♫ Even as cold winds blow... ♫ 

535
00:54:32,906 --> 00:54:36,176
Farewell, Master Han!

536
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,960
 ♫ We're just fleeting mortals ♫ 

537
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:46,005
 ♫ Time slipped by before we knew ♫ 

538
00:54:46,005 --> 00:54:50,206
 ♫ Yet we burn that spark of light ♫ 

539
00:54:50,206 --> 00:54:54,333
 ♫ Into this starry sky ♫ 

540
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:58,594
 ♫ Starlight fades into the Milky Way ♫ 

541
00:54:58,594 --> 00:55:04,554
 ♫ While the mayfly dies in the whirlpool... ♫ 

542
00:55:04,554 --> 00:55:07,000
 This time, I really am leaving. 

543
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,260
Han Li!

544
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,300
I caught a fish!

545
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,700
What a big one!

546
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,130
Come on! Let's get a fire going!

547
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,641
 ♫ But my heart has never rested ♫ 

548
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:27,760
 ♫ Ever chasing, still searching on ♫ 

549
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,941
 ♫ Through all the joy and sorrow ♫ 

550
00:55:31,941 --> 00:55:36,140
 ♫ How do I choose the way? ♫ 

551
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:41,269
 ♫ Now we part, so far apart... ♫ 

552
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:42,860
 Six years have passed. 

553
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,665
 Everything's changed. 

554
00:55:44,665 --> 00:55:46,435
 No one's left. 

555
00:55:48,702 --> 00:55:52,052
Remember what I told you.

556
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:57,340
Staying alive is what matters most.

557
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:02,571
If you can't win, just run.

558
00:56:02,571 --> 00:56:04,551
Got that?

559
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:10,580
Don't forget you started as a mortal.

560
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:14,130
Even if you become immortal,

561
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,110
act like a human being.

562
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:26,060
Just imagine how you'll mess
with those cocky immortals,

563
00:56:27,143 --> 00:56:30,773
I can't help but laugh out loud.

564
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,705
Sure.

565
00:56:34,705 --> 00:56:36,120
Just rest in peace.

566
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,888
 ♫ The ones before once told me ♫ 

567
00:56:39,888 --> 00:56:43,840
 ♫ There's still hardship ahead ♫ 

568
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,880
 ♫ Even as cold winds blow... ♫ 

569
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,190
Why should only immortals soar through the skies,

570
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:55,840
while we mortals stay trapped
like frogs in a well?

571
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:01,320
Han Li, there's so much beauty in this world.

572
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:06,980
Go see it in my place.

573
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:12,180
 ♫ Starlight fades into the Milky Way... ♫ 

574
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:21,760
 Goodbye, Physician Mo,
Zhang Tie, and Shenshou Valley. 

575
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:28,761
 ♫ Each step of fate's game unclear ♫ 

576
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:33,028
 ♫ Who can guess the ending? ♫ 

577
00:57:33,028 --> 00:57:37,229
 ♫ But my heart has never rested ♫ 

578
00:57:37,229 --> 00:57:41,454
 ♫ Ever chasing, still searching on ♫ 

579
00:57:41,454 --> 00:57:45,534
 ♫ Through all the joy and sorrow ♫ 

580
00:57:45,534 --> 00:57:50,774
 ♫ How do I choose the way... ♫ 

581
00:57:50,774 --> 00:57:52,539
 I'm off. 

582
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:55,860
 The pills I left you are enough to last ten years. 

583
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,750
 
 Even without the Bone Agony Pill, 

584
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,920
 you'll become a great hero. 

585
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:01,780
 Don't worry about me. 

586
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,780
 Take care of yourself too. 

587
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,120
 I believe the day will come 

588
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,120
 when your name echoes across the Tiannan Continent. 

589
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,266
Han Li!

590
00:58:12,266 --> 00:58:14,200
Han Li, remember this:

591
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:19,480
Before the name Li Fei Yu shakes the Tiannan Continent, I won't die.

592
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,510
And you're not allowed to die either.

593
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:41,940


594
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:46,820
