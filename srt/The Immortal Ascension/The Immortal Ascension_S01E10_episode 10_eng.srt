1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,520
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,120
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,193
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,193 --> 00:00:32,520
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,160
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,080
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,000
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,480
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,960
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,920
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,289
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,573
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,240
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,600
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,720
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,000
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,160
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,175
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,968
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,060
 

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,270
 How did scum like him
end up in Yellow Maple Valley? 

25
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,240
 And yet the Foundation Pill
has fallen into his hands. 

26
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,235
 He deserves to die. 

27
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:51,984
 But his cultivation is higher than mine. 

28
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:53,600
 I doubt I stand a chance against him. 

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,350
This is a Joyful Union Pill,

30
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,290
refined with lust poison
extracted from a Level 2 demon beast.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,540
Here.

32
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,960
I'm curious to see what becomes of you

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,130
after swallowing this.

34
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,840
Hey, you've been lurking long enough.

35
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,780
Time to show yourself.

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,030
It's you.

37
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,200
I've been waiting for the chance to eliminate you.

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,000
And now, you come straight to me.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,530
I'll have to fight him.

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,480
Turns out you're not just a thief,

41
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,570
but a pervert as well.

42
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,060
Come!

43
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,060
Wind Barrier!

44
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,630
It's useless.

45
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,520
This banner is powered by a mid-grade gem.

46
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,240
Its spiritual power never runs out.

47
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,150
Your artifact isn't fully refined.

48
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,150
It's no better than an ordinary weapon.

49
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,060
Still want to fight me?

50
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,780
Swift Travel Talisman!

51
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,800
No wonder it costs 50 gems a sheet.

52
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,310
The speed boost is incredible.

53
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,930
Thanks for the tip.

54
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,020
So all I have to do
is wield it like a normal weapon.

55
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,680
Wait, this is mine.

56
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,240
Even the box is the same.

57
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,480
So Ye sold it to him.

58
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,489
The Foundation Pill

59
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:05,639
has finally been returned to its rightful owner.

60
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,210
I'll take this one

61
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,580
as compensation.

62
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,820
Senior Chen.

63
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,780
Senior, please behave yourself!

64
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,000
Your clothes... Your clothes are loose!

65
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,120
Your clothes are loose!

66
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,190
Please compose yourself!

67
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,340
Now!

68
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,120
That scoundrel drugged you.

69
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,140
Come back to your senses!

70
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,970
Senior!

71
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,950
 Even if I stepped in to do the right thing, 

72
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,360
 killing a fellow disciple
is still a serious offense. 

73
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,940
 I'm not the kind of person
who'd silence someone through murder. 

74
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,070
 So, Senior Chen,
you'll have to take an Oblivion Pill. 

75
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:02,090
 Once you swallow it, you'll forget everything
that happened today, 

76
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,650
 including my presence. 

77
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,940
Ni Chang, any news about Ru Yan?

78
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,630
I heard from the Yan clan

79
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,310
that she still hasn't woken up.

80
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,750
But they're looking for the Blood
Spirit Flower in the Bloody Trial Ground.

81
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,970
If they find it, she might still have a chance.

82
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,830
The Trial Ground is dangerous,

83
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,510
and we also have sect duties.

84
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,000
We can't have our disciples make a detour
just for that flower.

85
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,070
Indeed.

86
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,680
With Ru Yan's talent,

87
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,340
she should've been the one leading the trial team.

88
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,040
But now that she has fallen ill,

89
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,730
everything is out of order.

90
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,610
Ni Chang, I might have a solution.

91
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,040
Absolutely not.

92
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,310
The Seven Sects have clearly stated that
only Qi Refining Stage disciples

93
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,950
may enter the Bloody Trial Ground.

94
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,120
Breaking that rule...

95
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,600
Have you forgotten?

96
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,360
My Maiden Cycle Art allows me

97
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,920
to suppress my cultivation.

98
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,000
If I lower it to the Qi Refining Stage,

99
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,070
then I'm technically
still a Qi Refining Stage disciple.

100
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,120
No one can say otherwise.

101
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,270
Are you seriously risking everything

102
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,310
for a single Blood Spirit Flower?

103
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,720
You'd cripple your cultivation
down to the Qi Refining stage?

104
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,390
You must be mad.

105
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,270
Even if you're willing, I'd never stand for it.

106
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,430
Ru Yan is the Yan clan's only heir.

107
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,310
Ever since what happened to her
at Moonshadow Sect,

108
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,550
we owe her everything.

109
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,000
Besides, I'm rather fond of her.

110
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,600
And the Yan Clan Stronghold

111
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,080
has defended the border of Yue Kingdom

112
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,440
for nearly a hundred years,

113
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,960
holding off the demonic sects for the Seven Sects.

114
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm certain I can retrieve the Blood Spirit Flower

115
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,270
and save Yan Ru Yan's life if I enter the grounds.

116
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,670
The item we seek is of utmost importance.

117
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,150
Only I can ensure it's brought back safely.

118
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,240
Besides, my cultivation will recover soon enough.

119
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,650
It's decided.

120
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,380
This secret must be kept at all costs.

121
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,420
 

122
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,170
Young Master.

123
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,860
Your Blood Spirit Spell has improved a lot.

124
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,852
I told you to look into the list of those

125
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:02,480
heading to the Bloody Trial Ground
from Spirit Beast Mountain.

126
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,810
Where's the list?

127
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,200
Many have signed up,

128
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,640
but we're supposed to be selecting
only the obedient ones, right?

129
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,750
Are we choosing based on obedience,

130
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,080
or the quality of their gifts?

131
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,480
 
Young Master, what are you implying?

132
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,000
Take Yan Lei for example.

133
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,960
He's come seven or eight times.

134
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,270
I only accepted his gift the very first time.

135
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,030
I thought you might appreciate it.

136
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,480
But rest assured.

137
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,720
Even if we had taken his offerings,

138
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,120
he still wouldn't be allowed in.

139
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,220
After all, he's from the Yan Clan Stronghold.

140
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,290
The Yan Clan Stronghold?

141
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,860
 

142
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,960
My Lord,

143
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,818
the disciples from each sect attending
the Bloody Trial have already been decided.

144
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:51,910
 

145
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,030
Even if ours send gifts,
it might not change anything.

146
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,300
But the Moonshadow Sect said...

147
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,750
 

148
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,120
They would help us get the Blood Spirit Flower.

149
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,200
They told us to wait for good news.

150
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,240
This happened under their watch.

151
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,410
Of course, they should help.

152
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,720
That may be true... But...
But everything in this world

153
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,900
is a matter of exchange.

154
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,790
Elder Liu,

155
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,390
make another trip to Moonshadow Sect

156
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,670
and give this letter to their sect leader.

157
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,240
As long as they give their all

158
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,870
to find the Blood Spirit Flower and save Yan,

159
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,440
the Yan Clan Stronghold's quarry will be theirs.

160
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,030
My Lord, you mustn't do this!

161
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,790
The quarry's profits
are the lifeblood of the Yan Clan Stronghold.

162
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,870
How can we hand it over just like that?

163
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,120
She is my only daughter.

164
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,510
I would give my life to save her.

165
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,900
What is a gem business compared to that?

166
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,020
Who's there?

167
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,380
 Core Formation cultivators. 

168
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,450
 But all of them are Early Core Stage. 

169
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,960
 And yet a Mid Foundation Establishment
Stage cultivator can command them. 

170
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,510
It's just a trip to the Bloody Trial Ground.

171
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,900
Lord Yan, is this really necessary?

172
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,720
Who are you?

173
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,840
I am Wang Chan, the Young Master

174
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,220
of the Ghost Spirit Sect.

175
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,630
You're Wang Tian Gu's son?

176
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,750
That's me.

177
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,910
Word is you're desperate to get your disciples

178
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,670
into the Bloody Trial.

179
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,810
I assume you're after something important.

180
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,360
Since the Seven Sects are unwilling to help,

181
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,260
why not turn to the Six Sects?

182
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,360
The Seven Sects always claim
to walk the righteous path,

183
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,000
yet they monopolize the Bloody Trial Ground.

184
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,790
Asking them for help is harder

185
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,740
than climbing to the heavens.

186
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,640
You are the Lord of the Yan Clan Stronghold.

187
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,793
Isn't this far too humiliating

188
00:14:24,793 --> 00:14:26,883
for someone of your stature?

189
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,910
What are you trying to say?

190
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,270
I can arrange for someone
to enter the Bloody Trial Ground

191
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,200
and retrieve what you are after.

192
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,810
No matter what it is,

193
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,500
I can help you.

194
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,670
Have you forgotten that centuries ago,

195
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,840
the Yan Clan Stronghold and Ghost Spirit Sect
were one and the same?

196
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,980
You should go back.

197
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,150
You should also remember,

198
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,030
only those who are willing to help you

199
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,880
are truly your friends.

200
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,231
Enough. Leave.

201
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,440
How's the investigation going?

202
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,030
Yan Yun Shan is desperately
dispatching people to the Bloody Trial Ground,

203
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,720
not for a Foundation Pill,
but for his ailing daughter.

204
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,510
Her daughter?

205
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,720
Her name is Yan Ru Yan.

206
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,960
She was born with a heavenly spirit root,

207
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,530
something that only appears once in centuries.

208
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,550
A heavenly spirit root?

209
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,840
That explains why the Yan Clan Stronghold
will stop at nothing to protect her.

210
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,550
However, her old illness has returned,

211
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,000
and she teeters on the brink of death.

212
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,080
The only thing that can save her

213
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,030
is the Blood Spirit Flower,
which only grows inside the Trial Ground.

214
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,570
That explains things.

215
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,600
I see.

216
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,720
So if we control the Blood Spirit Flower,

217
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,670
we can control the Yan Clan Stronghold.

218
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,480
And if we control the Yan Clan Stronghold,

219
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,290
we gain the upper hand in the coming war.

220
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,870
Interesting.

221
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,650
Looks like Zhong Wu has work to do again.

222
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,690
The heavenly spirit root,

223
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,170
I've finally found you.

224
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,980
 

225
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,740
 She won't remember what happened that day, right? 

226
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,260
The weather is good today.

227
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,900
You can even see the snowy peaks.

228
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,260
The Grandmaster is here.

229
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,620
Grandmaster.

230
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,390
Take a good look.

231
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,320
This is the Soul-Burning Spell.

232
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,500
Each of you will be randomly teleported
to a location inside the Trial Ground.

233
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,360
Where you land depends entirely on luck.

234
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,120
What we can do as a sect is plant

235
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,960
our Soul-Burning Spell on your bodies.

236
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,790
Within a certain range,

237
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,810
you'll be able to sense the location
of your fellow disciples.

238
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,910
Every sect is secretly competing in this trial.

239
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,480
The number of spirit herbs collected will affect

240
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,150
our sect's standing for the next 60 years.

241
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,720
The Moonshadow Sect is abusing their influence

242
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,150
and altering the Trial Ground's seal times
as they like.

243
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,220
We must not let them walk all over us.

244
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,170
We'll show them who
the true force among the Seven Sects is!

245
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,120
Got it!

246
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,480
- Understood!
- Got it!

247
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,980
Got it.

248
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,980
Move out!

249
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,700
 ♫ Chasing wind ♫ 

250
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,140
 ♫ I set out afar ♫ 

251
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,060
 ♫ The road ahead lost ♫ 

252
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,600
 ♫ My voice unheard ♫ 

253
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,580
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

254
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,020
 ♫ Laying low ♫ 

255
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,980
 ♫ I plan every move ♫ 

256
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,940
 ♫ With a mortal heart 

257
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,860
 ♫ And lingering ties ♫ 

258
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,030
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide... ♫ 

259
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,610
You've gained weight.

260
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,340
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

261
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,460
- Move out!
- Let's go!

262
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,500
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

263
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,790
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

264
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,260
Off we go!

265
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,740
 ♫ As chaos shakes the world ♫ 

266
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,500
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

267
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,140
 ♫ Kind at heart ♫ 

268
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,941
 ♫ Ruthless when I must be ♫ 

269
00:19:57,941 --> 00:20:00,200
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

270
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,503
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

271
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,600
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

272
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,040
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

273
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,020
 ♫ Forged by trial ♫ 

274
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,420
 ♫ I rise through three realms ♫ 

275
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,420
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

276
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,420
 ♫ Drunken steps,
high song over ocean and mountaintop ♫ 

277
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,800
 ♫ The celestial gourd bears dew
the Golden Core takes shape ♫ 

278
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,400
 ♫ Deep in the night,
the crane soars through autumn's clear sky ♫ 

279
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,305
 ♫ Across endless western winds
cuts a lone sword, cold and true ♫ 

280
00:20:37,305 --> 00:20:41,378
 ♫ A lone sword, cold and true ♫ 

281
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,220
 

282
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,160
Steady now!

283
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,180
We're almost there.

284
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,640
Everyone, the Young Master has ordered

285
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,880
that we are not to let the Yan Clan Stronghold
obtain the Blood Spirit Flower.

286
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,680
If you encounter
elite disciples of the Seven Sects,

287
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,640
do everything to kill or injure them.

288
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,420
Don't reveal your identity.

289
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,500
That's a given.

290
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,780
 This is the Bloody Trial Ground. 

291
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,020
 It's so quiet. 

292
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,340
 

293
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,000
 

294
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,260
The Trial Ground is now open.

295
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,660
 

296
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,810
 Where am I? 

297
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,812
-  I should hide... 
- Help!

298
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:17,520
 - And observe the situation. 
- Help!

299
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,440
Skyfort Castle disciples?

300
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,680
Clear Void Sect!

301
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,400
Fellow disciples?

302
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,240
Senior Li! Senior Ren!

303
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,030
Over here!

304
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,270
Quickly! Let's get out of here!

305
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,980
Any Yellow Maple Valley disciples?

306
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,480
Qiao Qian, time is tight.

307
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,980
We should get going.

308
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,780
Let's go.

309
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,310
 I can't let them find out
the secret of the Green Vial. 

310
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,660
 I should act alone from here on. 

311
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,890
Senior Xiang.

312
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,370
Let the hunt begin!

313
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,050
 The spiritual aura has indeed become thinner. 

314
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,660
Grandmaster.

315
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,350
The Spirit Fusion Talisman actually worked.

316
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,960
This talisman links the spiritual aura
of its users.

317
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,550
Even though the teleportation is random,

318
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,960
there's at least a 50% chance

319
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,850
we would land near each other.

320
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,750
We landed here of all places.

321
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,890
The odds are in our favor.

322
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,400
 I was right. 

323
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,310
 The closer you get
to the outer edge of the Trial Ground, 

324
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,440
 the younger the spirit herbs. 

325
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,030
 This means fewer rivals for me. 

326
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,680
 I'll gather some seedlings and seeds, 

327
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,370
 then rely on the Green Vial
to hasten their maturation. 

328
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,290
Pardon me.

329
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,370
 The Gilded Five-Petal Flame. 

330
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,370
 Someone's already dead. 

331
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,130
I'll have to be careful not to end up like him.

332
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,310
 The northeast edge of Wulong Pool 

333
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,800
 lies in a secluded corner, 

334
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,510
 its terrain shaped around a deep pool
plunging dozens of feet down. 

335
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,750
 According to the map, the Violet Monkey Blossom 

336
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,700
 should grow somewhere near here. 

337
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,180
 The miasma is dense here. 

338
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,940
 

339
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,160
 Coldwisp Herbs. 

340
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,420
 They're valuable ingredients
for concocting poisons. 

341
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:30,015
Who's there?

342
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,180
Show yourself.

343
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,180
You've already been exposed.

344
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,290
Did my Stealth Talisman fail?

345
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,270
Come out!

346
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,090
I saw you lot!

347
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,850
What a bluff.

348
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,130
My precious.

349
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,090
Frost Toads.

350
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,310
Senior Yu, your Beast Taming Powder is incredible.

351
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,350
Just a small bottle
and the Frost Toads became completely obedient.

352
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,680
Another elite of the Seven Sects taken down.

353
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,574
These little creatures
have certainly earned their keep.

354
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:51,550
 Frost Toads are docile by nature. 

355
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:55,850
 They almost never attack unless provoked. 

356
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,940
Qi, collect the Coldwisp Herbs.

357
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,480
 There's no need to risk my life for some herbs. 

358
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,090
 I'll let them have it. 

359
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,720
My goodness.

360
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,090
I didn't expect to find you guys here.

361
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,270
Keep your guard up.

362
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,940
There could be an ambush.

363
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,480
 He was cautious,
yet he still lost his life so easily. 

364
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,550
 Those two came here to kill. 

365
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,750
 What exactly are they after? 

366
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,840
 Why won't they leave? 

367
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,960
 Forget it. 

368
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,240
-  If they won't go, I will. 
- The Coldwisp Herbs...

369
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,480
May be highly poisonous,

370
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,200
but they're surprisingly beautiful.

371
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,610
Indeed.

372
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,400
Let's take his mystic pouch too.

373
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,570
All right.

374
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,510
Strange.

375
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,180
It was just here.

376
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,700
Is there someone else lurking nearby?

377
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,400
I didn't find any spirit herbs,

378
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,460
but I did get several mystic pouches.

379
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,220
Now where should I go?

380
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,510
 I don't see any Violet Monkey Blossoms here. 

381
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,130
 Seems the map the sect provided
isn't entirely reliable. 

382
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,850
Senior Xiang, the path is slippery. Go slow.

383
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,830
I've simply been here more times and know the way.

384
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,880
I'll be counting on you talented young cultivators

385
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,400
if we encounter spirit beasts.

386
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,720
Leave it to us.

387
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,000
This Trial Ground
is practically a death labyrinth.

388
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,830
Knowing the lay of the land is half the battle.

389
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,550
You're the old steed who knows the way.

390
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,920
With the three of us united,
success is all but guaranteed.

391
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,440
 Why is he traveling
with disciples from another sect? 

392
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,850
Han, I didn't expect to run into you here.

393
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,610
Han.

394
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,570
What do you say?

395
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,790
Care to join us?

396
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,220
We can look out for one another.

397
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,550
You may not know this,

398
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:54,510
but each sect's map for the Bloody Trial Ground

399
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,750
marks different priorities.

400
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:00,440
That's why sharing information and cooperating

401
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,980
with other sects is the smart move.

402
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,480
Thank you for your kind offer.

403
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,920
But I'm weak

404
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,070
and this is my first time in the Trial Ground.

405
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,830
I only plan to gather some spirit herbs
to complete my task.

406
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,420
I wouldn't want to burden the three of you.

407
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,680
No worries.

408
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,270
No worries.

409
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,740
Still, you didn't have to be so hasty
to refuse us.

410
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,500
Or are you perhaps after something important?

411
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,510
If this guy doesn't know what's good for him,

412
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,240
you shouldn't waste your breath on him.

413
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,960
That's right, Xiang.

414
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,180
Let him fend for himself.

415
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,590
I shall leave now. Please excuse me.

416
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,350
Farewell.

417
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,400
No choice.

418
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,220
I'll head in another direction.

419
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,720
 It's as if Senior Xiang
has turned into a completely different person 

420
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,890
 once we entered the Trial Ground. 

421
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,940
Hey, gambling addict.

422
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,090
I'm talking to you!

423
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,320
Why didn't you answer?

424
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,620
What do you want?

425
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,110
How about we place a bet?

426
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,400
What bet?
No bets.

427
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,110
This trial will shape the future
of the Seven Great Sects for the next 60,

428
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,010
maybe even 100 years, no?

429
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,150
I'm right, aren't I?

430
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,240
So, let's bet
on which sect gathers the most spirit herbs.

431
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,308
Whoever collects the most wins.
How about that?

432
00:36:09,308 --> 00:36:11,150
All right.

433
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,920
But your rules aren't foolproof.

434
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,670
What if it's a tie?

435
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,110
- Then what?
- Good point.

436
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,892
Let me think.

437
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:21,840
How about this? We bet on
whether the number of disciples

438
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,400
who make it out alive is odd or even.

439
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,580
Shoo. Leave me alone.

440
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,000
Han, you in?

441
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,550
I'm not betting with you.

442
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,670
He's no fun.

443
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,850
Sheesh.

444
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,410
Come on.

445
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,670
Here's my offer.

446
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:45,760
I'll wager two Bloodvein Drake Core Pills

447
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,180
against your two pieces of iron concentrate.

448
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,850
That's a fair deal, right?

449
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,700
Bloodvein Drake Core Pills?

450
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,550
What do you say?

451
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,740
Fine. Two pieces it is.

452
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,000
We're only betting on spirit herbs, nothing else.

453
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,140
Whoever gathers the most wins.

454
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,180
Go back.

455
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,780
The bet's on.

456
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,970
 That guy's dead. 

457
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,850
 That guy's dead too. 

458
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,875
 It's only day one, 

459
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:00,885
 yet their murderous intent
has already been unleashed. 

460
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,490
Invisible and razor-sharp.

461
00:38:41,341 --> 00:38:44,100
A perfect weapon for ambushes indeed.

462
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,180
Who goes there?

463
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,320
It's that young man from Tainan Bazaar.

464
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,220
Should we capture him and interrogate him?

465
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,960
I had to suppress my cultivation
to the Qi Refining Stage

466
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,190
just to enter the Trial Ground.

467
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,670
I'm already in a troublesome position.

468
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,190
Let's focus on the mission.

469
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,110
We don't want to invite more trouble.

470
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,180
We should regroup with our other disciples first.

471
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,000
Give these disciples a proper burial.

472
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,580
- Yes, Grandmaster.
- Yes.

473
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,140
 This should be a safe spot. 

474
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,760
 The first day is already over, 

475
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,660
 but I still haven't found what I came here for. 

476
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,030
To all disciples of the Seven Sects,

477
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:16,440
congratulations
on surviving the first daylight cycle.

478
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,400
Remember, the night in the Bloody Trial Ground

479
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,070
is far deadlier than the day.

480
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,800
Death may come from the skies above.

481
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,700
It'd be wise to find a safe place to hide.

482
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,030
 Senior Xiang knows this Trial Ground well, 

483
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,840
 yet he still hasn't reached the Foundation Stage
after three attempts. 

484
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,630
 I can't share his fate. 

485
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,060
 I never want to set foot in this place again. 

486
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,360
 This rain chills me to the bone. 

487
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,000
 There's something cursed about it. 

488
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,850
 I have to circulate my energy to dispel the cold. 

489
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,710
It's only the first day

490
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,840
and already so many have fallen.

491
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,588
Seems this year's competition is fiercer
than we anticipated.

492
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:17,540
 

493
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,780
The Soul-Burning Spell is reacting.

494
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,000
Don't kill me!

495
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,320
Don't kill me!

496
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,880
Senior, save me!

497
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,920
 This is quite a predicament. 

498
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,760
Senior!

499
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,330
Help won't come.

500
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:35,439
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

501
00:43:35,439 --> 00:43:41,335
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

502
00:43:41,335 --> 00:43:44,900
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫ 

503
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,360
 ♫ Old scenes rise again ♫ 

504
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,721
 ♫ Too hard to forget ♫ 

505
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:55,506
 ♫ Easier just to miss ♫ 

506
00:43:55,506 --> 00:44:02,280
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

507
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,880
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

508
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,440
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

509
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,840
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

510
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,120
 ♫ Eyes once looked far ♫ 

511
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,360
 ♫ Now lost in the shift ♫ 

512
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,520
 ♫ Autumn winds stir ♫ 

513
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,160
 ♫ Smoke curls once more ♫ 

514
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,083
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫ 

515
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:33,960
 ♫ Returning to my eyes ♫ 

516
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,360
 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫ 

517
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,560
 ♫ Time lost its name ♫ 

518
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,800
 ♫ Was it yesterday ♫ 

519
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,024
 ♫ Or tomorrow? ♫ 

520
00:44:48,024 --> 00:44:51,040
 ♫ The world has changed ♫ 

521
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,441
 ♫ Beyond recall ♫ 

522
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,562
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

523
00:44:55,562 --> 00:45:01,043
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

524
00:45:01,043 --> 00:45:04,759
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

525
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:10,880
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫ 

526
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,332
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

527
00:45:14,332 --> 00:45:17,628
 ♫ we call eternity ♫ 

528
00:45:17,628 --> 00:45:23,692
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

529
00:45:23,692 --> 00:45:27,348
 ♫ called eternity ♫
