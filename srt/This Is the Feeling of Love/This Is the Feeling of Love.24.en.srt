Beixing.

18
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,430
When will you wake up?

19
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,480
Oh, no.

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,560
Beixing is dreaming again.

21
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,040
What can I do to wake you up?

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,430
Where am I?

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,840
How come my mind is a blank?

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,470
I can't recall anything.

25
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,240
Who are you?

26
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,150
Why does that face look so familiar?

27
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,560
As if it appears often in my dreams.

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,520
He must be someone important to me.

29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,120

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,870
You're finally awake.

Beixing,

33
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,160
you finally woke up.

34
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,310
Do you know?

35
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,750
After you fainted,

36
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,240
I sent you one paper crane every day,

37
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,720
praying that you'd wake up soon.

38
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,950
Look around you.

39
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,870
There are more than 1,000 paper cranes in this ward.

40
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,720
Exactly.

41
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,070
My hands are all calloused from folding the paper.

42
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,040

- Qian. - Both of you almost...

52
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,040
Beixing just woke up.

53
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,070
She needs to rest.

55

Were you not afraid?

65
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,870
I heard that if you couldn't wake me up,

66
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,720
you would fall into an endless slumber as well,

67
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,360
turning into a coma patient in bed.

68
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,680
I wasn't afraid.

69

Only when you live

70
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,510

74

in those dreams?

75
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,510
Because I believe

76
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,270
that no matter how many times we meet,

77
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,720
