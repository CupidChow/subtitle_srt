Pretending to be your fiance is going against my principles.

185
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,100
There is another reason why you want to work for me, isn't it?

186
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,900
Ms. Zhen,

187
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,740
I'm just an ordinary person hired to protect you.

188
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,740
You suddenly appeared by my side

189
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
and you fight very well.

190
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,900
Thank you. Those who work as bodyguards

191
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,100
usually fight very well.

192
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,100
I know why you became my bodyguard.

193
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,780
Aren't you trying to get the Flutterheart Ring?

194
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,140
If you help me find the truth,

195
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,740
I will give you

196
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,820
the Flutterheart Ring.

197
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,300
If I really want the Flutterheart Ring,

198
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,140
I will get it myself.

199
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,140
Our family

200
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,700
has a secret about the Flutterheart Ring.

201
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,820
If you help me,

202
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,940
I will tell you about it

203
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,340
because I'm the only one who can unlock the secret.

204
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,280
Deal.

205
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,500
Deal.

206
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,340
Are you that person?

207
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,820
If I get the Flutterheart Ring,

208
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,740
I'll know the truth.

209
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,380
But who are you?

210
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,600
Are you her?
