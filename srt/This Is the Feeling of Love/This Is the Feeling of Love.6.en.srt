00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,980
Thank you.

18
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,380
No matter what happens,

19
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,580
I'll always be by your side.

20

What do you mean?

25
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,910
Spring is here.

26
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,410
Every creature awakens.

27
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,610
The animals are beginning to breed and multiply.

28
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,780
We still have work to do. Stop talking nonsense.

29
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,340
I'm getting something.

30
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,740
Boss, Zhen Beixing is ruthless.

31
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,740
She fired me.

32
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,940
I've been serving you for so long.

33
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,110
I deserve some credit for my hard work.

34
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,340
You must save me.

35
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,580
She's not showing me any respect.

36
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,940
I can't survive like this.

37
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,940
You are an important subordinate of mine.

38
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,210
I won't give up on you so easily.

39
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,610
But you saw it yourself.

40
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,440
Zhen Beixing is too smart.

41
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,940
Don't worry. I know what to do.

42
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,180
However, you should keep a low profile

43
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,610
and stop causing any trouble recently.

44
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,140
Also, stop harassing any women.

45
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,110
Ma Tianming has information

46
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,510
that Zhen Quan doesn't want exposed.

47
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,210
If he can threaten Zhen Quan,

48
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,940
that means he does have something important in his hands.

49
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,340
Someone like him is the most dangerous.

50
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,110
He might take drastic measures when he's desperate.

51
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,010
So, we must act instead of waiting.

52
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,710
We must find a way

53
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,510
to dig out all of Ma Tianming and Zhen Quan's

54
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,310
inside dealings.

55
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,540
I'll try to readjust the listening device.

56
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,910
Let's see if we can capture more useful conversations.

57
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,210
When there's a chance,

58
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,510
we will expose Ma Tianming's conduct to the public.

59
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,710
Sure.

60
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,940
Uncle Zhen Quan.

61
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,900
Why are you here in person?

62
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,500
I came here for Ma Tianming.

63
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,110
I can just deal with it myself.

64
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,740
You don't need to come here.

65
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,210
Ma Tianming has served the Zhen family for a long time.

66
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,180
He contributed a lot to the company.

67
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,910
You just took over.

68
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,410
If you are too harsh on him,

69
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,210
it might hurt the veteran employees' feelings.

70
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,510
Uncle Zhen Quan, you are right.

71
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,540
I understand.

72
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,910
However, it might be hard to appease the other employees

73
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,410
if Ma Tianming isn't punished for his act.

74
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,940
In that case, let's call for a board meeting

75
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,380
and get every shareholder to discuss a solution

76
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,740
that protects the company's interests

77
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,610
and also takes care of the veteran employees.

78
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,580
Ma Tianming

79
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,710
might have made a mistake

80
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,310
but he has been in the company for decades.

81
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,740
His loyalty to the company is unquestionable.

82
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,940
We should give him a chance to reflect on his mistakes.

83
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,940
Uncle Zhen Quan,

84
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,110
I understand your concern

85
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,910
but Ma Tianming's action this time

86
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,700
has seriously tarnished the company's reputation

87
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,010
and breached our employees' rights.

88
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,340
I can't sit by and do nothing.

89
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,510
Ma Tianming is an old employee.

90
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,140
Sometimes, he gets carried away.

91
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,740
We should focus on correcting him instead.

92
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,780
You are right.

93
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,140
We should

94
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,900
consider the company's internal harmony and stability.

95
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,740
I can see how Ma has been doing in recent years.

96
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,980
He has been doing his best for the company all his life.

97
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,510
Even though he made a small mistake,

98
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,740
his merit overshadows his blunder.

99
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,980
A small mistake?

100
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,780
Harmony and stability might be important

101
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,500
but we can't sacrifice the company's image

102
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,140
and the employees' rights to achieve that.

103
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,980
He completely broke the company's rules with his behavior.

104
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,700
He must be dealt with according to the law and rules.

105
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,510
Beixing, you just came here.

106
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,500
You don't know the company's internal structure well.

107
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,410
We can completely

108
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,240
resolve Ma Tianming's problem internally.

109
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,310
There's no need

110
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,110
to make an issue out of it.

111
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,780
It can only be resolved internally under the condition

112
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,380
that Ma Tianming has truly regretted his actions

113
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,910
and is willing to accept the punishments.

114
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,510
Otherwise, I must protect the company's image

115
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,910
and the employees' rights

116
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,180
as the company's leader.

117
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,610
If we look past his mistake,

118
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,140
where's the justice for all our employees?

119
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,910
I must maintain my principles firmly.

120
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,140
A new leader has to show authority.

121
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,380
I understand that.

122
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,610
But you can't sacrifice a veteran employee.

123
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,540
Zhang, you will be retired in two years, right?

124
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,210
If she can fire someone who has worked for the company for decades today,

125
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,710
she can also slowly get rid of the people

126
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,900

Since Ma Tianming's behavior has affected the company negatively,

this is too reckless of you.

162
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,710
You will bring more trouble to the company.

163
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,330
Ma Tianming, we hope you can regret your actions in time

164
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,470
because of your past contributions.

165
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,950
But now,

166
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,390
your behavior

167
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,730
completely went against the company's rules.

168
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,750
We can't just sit idly and do nothing.

169
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,420
For the sake of the company's long-term development,

170
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,210
we must make the correct decision.

171
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,160
That's right.

172
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,910
You are right.

173
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,420
That's it.

174
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,520
Ma Tianming, you've betrayed our trust

175
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,320
and harmed the company and its employees.

176
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,580
I also agree to relieve you of all your duties

177
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,920
and hand you over to the authorities for further investigation.

178
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,400
Zhen Beixing,

179
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,200
this is personal, isn't it?

180
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,270
I contributed so much to the company

181
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,270
and you cut me off easily.

182
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,900
You completely went against the company's rules

183
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,940
and moral standards.

184
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,050
We must have zero tolerance for acts like these.

185
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,320
This is the decision of the board.

186
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,680
It also shows our firm stance to the public and all our employees.

187
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,240
Yes! Fire him!

188
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,560
- Fire him! - He must be fired!

189
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,060
Gu Chen.

190
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,570
Thank you for today.

191
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,650
It's what I should do.

192
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,360
Sorry. I can't accompany you tonight.

193
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,050
This is a hidden tracker.

194
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,190
Here.

195
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,680
This hidden tracker

196
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,080
has two-way communication.

197
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,350
If you are in danger,

198
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,650
press the button twice.

199
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,880
Your position will be sent to my device.

200
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,280
You should be careful, too.

201
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:05,990
Sure.

202
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,120
Do you think you can just do anything to me as you wish?

203
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,940
Let me tell you.

204
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,980
It's not that easy.

205
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,450
Ma Tianming,

206
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,330
why are you here?

207
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,200
I've contributed so much to the company.

208
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,710
How can you just fire me as you wish?

209
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,390
If you won't give me a way out,

210
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,650
you will die with me!

211
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,180
Stop!

212
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,540
Are you all right?

213
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,190
Zhen Beixing, your father was...

214
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,470
It isn't what you think...

215
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,270
I will investigate it clearly.
