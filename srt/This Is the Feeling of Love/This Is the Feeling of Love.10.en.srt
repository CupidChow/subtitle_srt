144

We've known each other since childhood. We've always been like this.

A good friend?

146
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,660
He's getting close to you under the guise of friendship.

147
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,420
Did you notice the way he looked at you?

148
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,120
I really wanted to punch him.

149
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,620
You're being completely unreasonable.

150
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,420
I think you should see him less in the future.

151
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,320
I've known him for 20 years.

152
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,660
You're being overly sensitive.

153
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,620
And who are you to interfere with my friendships?

154
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,820
Right.

155
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm only your fake fiancé.

156
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,260
I have no right to interfere in your friendships.

157
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,720
But don't forget I'm also your bodyguard.

158
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,260
It's my job to protect you.

159
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,760
I don't want you to be in danger.

160
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,060
Besides,

161
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,260
I do believe he has an agenda.

162
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,460
Bodyguard?

163
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,520
Let's draw up an agreement first.

164
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,360
You'll act as my bodyguard and my fiancé

165
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,260
until I uncover the truth about my father's death.

166
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,120
I only applied for the bodyguard job.

167
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,360
But playing your fiancé?

168
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,460
That goes against my principles.

169
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,360
I know why you want to be my bodyguard.

170
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,820
Because you want the Flutterheart Ring, right?

171
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,560
As long as you help me find the truth,

172
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,320
I'll hand it over to you myself.

173
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,320
Deal.

174
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,020
I'm just doing my job.

175
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,560
I don't want you hurt or threatened.

176
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,020
Zhen Quan has been brought to justice.

177
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,660
I will honor our agreement

178
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,420
and give you the Flutterheart Ring.

179
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,220
That way, you won't need to fulfill your duty anymore.

180
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,120
Zhen Quan

181
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,960
isn't the mastermind.

182
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,620
He never confessed to being the culprit.

183
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,620
So Gu Chen really only cares about his duty as my bodyguard

184
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,260
and the Flutterheart Ring.

185
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,720
Thank you.

186
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,160
I'll continue the investigation on my own.

187
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
Our agreement ends now.

188
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,020
You're ending it?

189
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,660
You're ending our agreement because of him?

190
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,420
It's over.

191
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,960
We never had any real relationship to begin with.

192
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,560
I refuse!

193
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,560
All his concern for me

194
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,760
was just about doing his job

195
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,160
and getting the Flutterheart Ring.

196
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,920
Why can't she understand?

197
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,920
Everything I did was for her safety.

198
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,920
Tian Yu clearly approached her with an ulterior motive.

199
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,520
How can she not see it?

200
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,320
Worse still,

201
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,620
she's actually cutting ties with me because of him?

202
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,560
Zhen Beixing,

203
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,260
I won't let you off.

204
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:37,860
Zhen Beixing,

205
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,820
I won't let you off!
