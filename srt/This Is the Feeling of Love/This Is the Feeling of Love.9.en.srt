I'd rather destroy us both

00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,230
than let you walk away unscathed.

I'm fine.

00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,200
You think catching me will expose everything?

22
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,230

Take him to the police station.

24
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,300
I did have someone threaten your father,

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,960
but I didn't kill him.

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,030
Beixing,

27
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,760
he was my big brother.

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,900

It's all too complicated.

34
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,700
I don't know.

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,630
If he isn't the killer,

36
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,600
then who is? And why did they do it?

37
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,300

00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,970
Zhen Quan has a safe

00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,300
he never lets anyone touch.

48
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,250
It's empty.

49
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,800
How could it be empty?

50
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,110
A safe usually holds important documents,

51
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,840
but...

52
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,220
Bad news, Ms. Zhen, Mr. Gu.

53
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,570
What happened?

54
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,230
Since Zhen Quan's arrest went public,

55
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,230

56
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,410

58
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,710

59
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,440

60
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,610

61
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,910

70
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,810
Is that even possible?

71
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,710
We have no viable plan.

72
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,870
Ms. Zhen, that's too little time.

73

77
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,440

78
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,840

79

85

86
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,840

87
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,470
Trust me. We will win this battle, and we will win it beautifully.

88
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,640
Take a look at this proposal. Any suggestions?

89
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,570
No.

90
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,170
No, it won't work.

91
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,710
I think this plan...

92
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,900
I think it could be refined further.

93
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,770
If we iterate on this,

94
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,310
the result could be even better.

00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,070
Yes.

Mr. Gu,

132
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,850

133
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,050

Besides the drafts, what else

141

142
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,990
Some gold bars.

143
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,390
Nothing else?

144
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,090

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,490

146
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,820
I didn't read it.

147
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,750

148

149
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:31,950
That's unforgivable.

151
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,690
Miss Zhen,

152
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,850
I'm sorry.

00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,050

155
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,650
how did you know there was a mole?

156
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,150
I've actually been protecting you in secret.

157
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,150
Since the plagiarism incident,

158
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,290
I knew something must have gone wrong inside the company.

159
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,750
If you hadn't come up with a new design,

160
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,550
they might not have made another move.

161
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,050
But you did,

162
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,490
so I knew he'd act again

163
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,590
to complete his mission.

164
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,190
Taking you away

165
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,290
was to set a trap and draw the mole out.

166
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,350
Gu Chen,

167
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,750
thank you.

168
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,750
You've been such a great help.

169
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,290
I'm truly grateful.

170
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,290
It's what I should do.

171
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,250
Oh, right.

172
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,450
That mole mentioned

173
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,550
a letter.

174
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,590
But when we

175
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,350
checked the safe,

176
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,390
we didn't find one.

177
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,020
Could that letter

178
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,290
contain clues about my father?

179
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,090
Whether it does or not,

180
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,150
that letter must be very important.

181
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,790
Otherwise, no one would've bothered to hide it.

182
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,220
I keep feeling

183
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,050
there's a much bigger secret behind all this.

184
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,190
No matter what's written in that letter,

185
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,050
it should be directly linked to your father's death.

186
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,090
Thank you.

187
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,390
I will find the truth

188
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,250
and protect the Zhen Group my father left behind.

189
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,620
And I'll be by your side.

190
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,750
Do you think my new design

191
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,650
can save the Zhen Group?

192
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,650
Of course it can.

193
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,220
Your work has always been outstanding.

194
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,950
This piece is even more so.

195
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,820
I'm sure it will stand out

196
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,050
and help the Zhen Group through this crisis.

197
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,150
Thank you.

198
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,090
In the distant past,

199
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,690
there was a legend of a princess from the Ocean Kingdom.

200
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,050
- During an exploration of mysterious seas, - Not bad at all. Look.

201
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,390
the princess encountered a violent storm

202
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,450
and sank into the dark depths below.

203
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,750
Just as despair took hold,

204
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,990
a brave prince appeared.

205
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,750
He was like the brightest star in the sky.

206
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,150
He crossed the abyss of darkness

207
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,690
and freed her from the prison of fate.

208
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,790
This piece represents the prince's promise to the princess.

209
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,290
No matter where you are,

210
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,350
I will find you.

211
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,490
[No matter where you are]

212
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,290
[I will find you]
I promise.

213
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,350
Bravo!

214
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,090
Amazing!

215
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,490
This is really impressive.

216
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,420
What a brilliant idea.

217
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,390
Fantastic.

218
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,350
Tian Yu's influence is truly unmatched.

219
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,820
Preorders and sales have both passed ten million!

220
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,310
That's great.

221
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,310
- Congratulations, Beixing. - Awesome.

222
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,780
That's incredible.

223
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,490
Amazing.

224
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,630
Tian Yu,

225
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,850
thank you so much for helping me like this.

226
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,050
Beixing, the credit should go to you.

227
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,950
It was your design that made the Promise collection a huge hit.

228
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,390
Whenever you need me,

229
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,490
I'm always here.

230
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,550
Thanks.

231
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,830
Everyone has worked so hard.

232
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,560
To celebrate our success,

233
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,220
I've decided to organize a team outing next week

234
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,620
so we can celebrate together.

235
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,510
Wow, yes!

236
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,720
You're the best, Miss Zhen!

237
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,490
We're having a party!

238
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,080
- I knew you wanted to have fun. - Awesome.

239
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,120
Hello.

240
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:24,940
Okay.

241
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,280
Beixing, I just got a call from a fashion magazine.

242
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,130
They want to do a special feature

243
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,390
centered on the Promise collection.

244
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,490
They really hope you'll join the shoot.

245
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,110
After all, you're the lead designer of the collection.

246
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,440
That's wonderful news.

247
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,580
Of course I'd love to take part.

248
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,430
