17
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,020
Morning.

18
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,020
I saw these two breakfasts

19
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,420
in your childhood photos.

20
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,020
I thought I could try making them.

21
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,090
I wonder how they taste.

22
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,820
Try it.

23
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,020
It's delicious.

24
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,740
Thank you.

25
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,520
You're welcome.

26
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,850
I was a picky eater when I was little.

27
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,950
Dad had to make me delicious

28
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,650
or fun dishes

29
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,750
before I would eat.

30
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,450
These two are my favorites.

31
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,050
Where did you learn to make them?

32
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,120
I have no idea.

33
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,090
I can't remember many things.

34
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,720
Perhaps

35
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,720
I made them for someone I loved.

36
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,550
She's a lucky girl.

37
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,020
I thought

38
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,450
no one could make them anymore after Dad passed away,

39
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,920
because these are difficult dishes.

40
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,890
It's all right. I can make them for you whenever you crave them.

41
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,850
Thank you.

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,920

Qin, let's visit the hot spring.

170
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,140
Sure. I brought a bathing suit anyway.

171
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,310
Let's go.

172
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,140

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,040
Okay.

176
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,710
Beixing, where do you want to go now?

177
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,670
I'll come with you.

178
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,540
Let's take a stroll.

179
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:46,770
Sure.

183

I wonder what's happening.

Your hair is messy.

185
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,240
Thank you.

186
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,440
Do you remember? When we were little,

187
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,510
we used to count stars

188
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,940
at night like this.

189
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,070
Of course, I remember.

190
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,840
We were so carefree back then.

191
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,310
Good old days.

192
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,840
May you be just as carefree now too.

193
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,940
Tian Yu, you're so sweet.

194
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,710
We've known each other for a long time.

195
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,740
18 years, seven months, and 16 days.

196
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,870
You keep tabs?

197
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,670
Beixing.

198
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,110
Do you know?

199
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,140
When I was little, everyone only saw my brother

200
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,310
because he always got first place.

201
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,940
One year, when I finally got first place,

202
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,440
he was accepted into an advanced academy.

203
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,910
Everyone was busy congratulating him.

204
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,110
No one cared

205
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,710
if I got the first place.

206
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,040
Everyone

207
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,240
only saw my accomplished brother.

208
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,110
Only you

209
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,540
gave me an apple

210
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,370
as a reward.

211
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,440
Do you know?

212
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,470
My whole world lit up at that moment.

213
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,710
Tian Yu.

214
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,310
I can't believe you still remember

215
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,370
this small gesture of mine from when I was little.

216
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,340
Yes, Beixing.

217
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,710
From that moment onward,

218
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,440
you occupy a special spot in my heart.

219
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,870
Beixing,

220
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,710
I know I'm not perfect.

221
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,240
But I want to be someone you can rely on,

222
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,510
a shoulder you can cry on.

223
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,740
Tian Yu...

224
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,640
I had this specially made for you.

225
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,710
It means my heart

226
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,510
belongs to you only.

227
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,140
I know you like Gu Chen.

228
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,240
But it's fine.

229
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,070
After all, you're not married.

230
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,040
Tian Yu...

231
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,740
I still stand a chance, don't I?

232
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,570
It's okay, Beixing.

233
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,270
Regardless of your decision,

234
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,070
I will always wait for you here.

235
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,370
Tian Yu, I don't want to give you false hope.

236
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,940
You're my best friend.

237
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,070
But my heart already belongs to someone else.

238
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,940
And that's fine.

239
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,070
We're still friends.

240
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,240
Isn't it great to be friends?

241
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,710
We will always be best friends.

242
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,770
Sleep early tonight, Beixing.

243
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,040
You too. Goodnight.

244
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,220
Tian Yu is...

245
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,070
Tian Yu is...

246
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,870
Whatever. I should stop thinking about it.

247
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,340
I was told the hot spring here was amazing.

248
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,440
Since it's so late now,

249
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,670
there won't be any people there.

250
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,110
I can finally wind down.
