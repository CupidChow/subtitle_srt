In Factory X of Western Suburb?

194
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,360
Mister,

195
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
what are you talking about?

196
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,320
I went to the ingredient market in the east.

197
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,840
I don't know the place you mentioned.

198
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,960
If there are no more questions,

199
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,910
I'll take my leave now.

200
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,320
I need to bake several cakes.

201
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,240
Hello.

202
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,960
They found the bakery.
