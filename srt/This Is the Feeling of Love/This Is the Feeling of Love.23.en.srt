I see.

191
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,150
You may go now.

192
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,870
Are you sure you're okay, Ms. Zhen?

193
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,720
Should I book an appointment with a doctor for you?

194
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,720
I'm fine.

195
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,510
Just go back to your work.

196
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
How come everything about Gu Chen in my company

197
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,150
disappeared too?

198
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,550
It's impossible for a person to vanish without a trace.

199
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,600
Hey.

200
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,960
Qian.

201
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,320
Is this a prank?

202
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,150
Where is Gu Chen?

203
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,120
Gu Chen,

204
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,240
my fiance.

205
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,750
Even though I don't know

206
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,270
why no one remembers you,

207
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,150
I'll find you,

208
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,000
Gu Chen.

209
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,320
Beixing.

210
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,150
Beixing.

211
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,600
Beixing.

212
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,630
Beixing.

213
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,390
Beixing.

214
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,000
Beixing.

215
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,840
Beixing.

216
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,120
Beixing.

217
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,080
Beixing.

218
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,000
Beixing.

219
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,510
Beixing!

220
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,360
Beixing.

221
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,510
Beixing.

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,840
Beixing.
