Mo?

189
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,600
Lin Mo?

190
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,750
Yes.

191
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,020
[Lin Mo]

192
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Hey, Lin Mo.

193
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,910
Su Qian is in City A now.

194
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,550
You will take care of her, won't you?

195
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,790
But why?

196
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,120
She is now the biggest investor of the Zhen Group.

197
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,550
Also, haven't you been keeping an eye on her?

198
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,360
Mo,

199
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,910
you've been keeping an eye on me?

200
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,120
No, I have not.

201
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,840
You should've told me earlier.

202
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,790
I would have flown to you immediately.

203
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,750
So Mo,

204
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,150
I'm back.

205
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,910
Are you very surprised to see me?

206
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,000
How come you came back suddenly?

207
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,120
Because I miss you.

208
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
And I've decided

209
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,840
not to leave China anymore.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,320
I'll stay by your side.

211
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,360
Stop it, Su Qian.

212
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,120
I'm busy. I don't have time for you.

213
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,510
It's okay.

214
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,720
I have time for you.

215
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,910
I can assist you in your work as well.

216
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,240
Su Qian, you don't have to do this for me.

217
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
We...

218
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,790
Mo.

219
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,120
I know you care about me.

220
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,630
The presents I received every month were from you.

221
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,030
I didn't do that.

222
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,600
You did.

223
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,150
Just because you didn't write your name doesn't mean I won't know.

224
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,630
You're a dummy.

225
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,320
I didn't send gifts to you.

226
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,390
Go back now.

227
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,840
I have many things to do.

228
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
I won't leave.

229
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,750
Unless you agree to let me stay.

230
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,390
You...

231
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,960
Hmph!

232
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,000
- Fine. You won. - Hehe.

233
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,150
Don't worry.

234
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,840
I will not bother you.

235
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,630
Yes.

236
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,390
Okay.

237
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,360
Mmm...

238
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,200
Mo, I'm hungry.

239
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,150
What do you want to eat?

240
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,030
Just order anything.

241
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,080
Mo,

242
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,750
you're so sweet.

243
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,630
Why did you bring me here all of a sudden?

244
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,960
I have been meaning to tell you something.

245
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,720
Gu Chen,

246
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,840
why are you so serious suddenly?

247
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,150
If I don't say it out loud,

248
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,840
I might regret it.

249
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,360
What is it?

250
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,840
Beixing.

251
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,200
I like you.

252
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,120
More than you can ever imagine.

253
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,790
My heart ached when I saw you

254
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,030
wearing a wedding dress for someone else.

255
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:32,910
I...

256
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,240
I didn't know that.

257
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,440
Beixing, give me the chance

258
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,790
to spend your life with you.

259
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,720
I don't want to just look at you from afar.

260
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,840
I want to keep you company,

261
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,440
to go through everything together,

262
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,440
and to share joy with you.

263
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,720
Beixing.

264
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,960
I love you.

265
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,150
Now and forever.

266
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I love you too.

267
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,360
Gosh! They are so sweet!
