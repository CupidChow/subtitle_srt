Ms. Zhen.

189
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
20 million yuan can only buy us a few days.

190
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,000
We need more liquidity.

191
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,360
If we can't gather 100 million yuan in two days,

192
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,550
we'll wind up.

193
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll think of a solution.

194
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,550
Come in.

195
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,670
Ah.

196
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,200
Hi, Mr. Zhang.

197
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,200
Your reputation precedes you.

198
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,270
Oh, Ms. Zhen.

199
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,390
Come.

200
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,030
Hmm...

201
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,030
I...

202
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,720
Oh.

203
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,510
The other investors are on the way.

204
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,360
Once they are here,

205
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,120
the food will be served.

206
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,960
Come.

207
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,750
Take a seat.

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,910
Ms. Beixing,

209
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,150
I am willing

210
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,080
to help your company.

211
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,510
I'm hoping we can develop a more personal relationship

212
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,870
other than this business bond.

213
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,550
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

214
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,720
But I think we should stay professional for now.

215
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Let's go over the investment details.

216
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,480
Come on, Ms. Beixing.

217
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,360
You're a beautiful woman.

218
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,720
You should show some goodwill.

219
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,550
Let's have a toast to our business partnership.

220
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,390
We can relax a bit.

221
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,510
Ms. Zhen.

222
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,390
Ms. Zhen.

223
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,870
What are you doing?

224
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,150
Let go of me.

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,790
Let go of her.

226
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,360
You brat.

227
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,150
Who are you?

228
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,510
Don't hit my face.

229
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,510
Are you okay?

230
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,440
I'm fine.

231
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:29,910
Let's go.

232
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,510
Zhen Beixing.

233
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,480
You're going to ruin your family business soon.

234
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,720
I'll be here waiting for you to beg me.

235
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,150
Gu Chen.

236
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,270
Thank you for intervening in time.

237
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,870
Don't worry.

238
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,870
I won't let anyone hurt you,

239
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,150
your body,

240
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,080
or your soul.

241
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,600
We'll think of another way

242
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,390
to save your company.

243
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,510
No need to sacrifice your dignity.

244
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,080
Okay.

245
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,200
Beixing.

246
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,440
Hmm?

247
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,320
I know you're having a crisis now.

248
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,480
My company is willing to bail your company out.

249
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,600
But I have

250
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,080
one condition.

251
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,750
What condition?

252
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,390
Be my fiancee.
