184
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,540
Urgh! I shouldn't have left her at home alone.

185
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,180
I can only track the last known location of the signal.

186
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,780
[Western Suburb Warehouse]

187
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,260
It's near an abandoned warehouse in the Western Suburb.

188
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,860
Zhen Beixing, nothing must happen to you. Wait for me.

189
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,780
Got it, Boss.

190
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,320
Ah!

191
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,060
You're still trying to escape when you're just a cripple.

192
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,340
You deserve to be punished!

193
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,380
Who are you?

194
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,380
Gu Chen.

195
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,580
You are hurt.

196
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,140
Let's get your wounds treated at the hospital first.

197
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,340
It's too late.

198
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,740
I must attend the shareholders' meeting.

199
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,140
I can't be absent now.

200
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,980
- Can you hold on? - Yes.

201
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,780
Hey, we won't make it!

202
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,180
We will make it.

203
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,740
We've been waiting until nighttime.

204
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,540
Let's not wait for Zhen Beixing anymore

205
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,060
and begin the shareholders' meeting.

206
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,380
According to the company's rule,

207
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,620
Zhen Beixing's absence means she is giving up her authority.

208
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,340
Sir, make the announcement.

209
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,340
Yes, my time is precious.

210
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,620
Let's begin the meeting.

211
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,340
You can't go inside!

212
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,800
Ah!
