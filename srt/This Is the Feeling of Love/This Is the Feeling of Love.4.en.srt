17
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,700
Where's the thing?

18
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,300
- It's here. - Why is he here?

19
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,530
Is he working for Zhen Quan?

20
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,940
But first, I want to make sure

21
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,500
you'll fulfill your part of the deal.

22
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,700
You will get what you want.

23
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,460
So it's all fake.

24
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,820
He has been lying to me.

25
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,700
Don't worry.

26
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,020
Come with me.

27
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,140
Gu Chen.

28
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,700
You actually work for Zhen Quan.

29
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,700
Beixing, listen to me.

30
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,580
All right.

31
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,810
Tell me.

32
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,310
Tell me why you betrayed me.

33
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,180
Or have you been working with him since the beginning

34
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,740
to keep lying to me?

35
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,910
No.

36
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,640
This is more complicated than you think.

37
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,710
Trust me. I won't hurt you.

38
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,780
Where's the folder?

39
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,710
I remember it's in the study.

40
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,810
Boss, someone is looking for you urgently.

41
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,910
He is waiting for you in the living room.

42
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,510
Put me down.

43
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,520
I can walk on my own.

44
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,980
This is not the place to talk.

Beixing, listen to me.

48
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,910
I did not betray you.

49
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,310
- I made a deal with Zhen Quan because... - Beixing!

50
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,180
Where were you?

51
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,310
I've been looking everywhere for you.

52
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,110
What's wrong with you?

53
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,140
What happened?

54
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,310
It's nothing, Tian Yu.

55
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,580
This is between us.

57
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,010
If you treat her badly in any way,

58
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,010
I will intervene.

59
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,910
- Tian Yu, let's go. - All right.

60
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,610
Careful.

61
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,910
Are you sure you want to keep doing this?

62
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,110
We've managed to get a hold of Zhen Quan's plans.

63
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,610
But you're doing this behind Beixing's back.

64
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,580
What if she finds out?

65
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,340
- She already found out. - What?

66
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,210
- You... - Everything I've been doing is to protect her.

67
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,340
Whether she believes me or not,

68
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,940
I won't allow her to be harmed in any way.

69
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,610
First, I need to confirm

70
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,140
that you will keep your promise.

71
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,110
You will get what you want.

72
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,610
It's all fake.

73
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,010
He has always been lying to me.

74
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,140
Got it, Gu Chen.

75
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,310
You have to be careful.

76
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,310
Zhen Quan

77
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,210
is a tough one.

78
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,110
If he finds out about our plan,

79
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,780
the consequences would be dire.

80
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,340
I know. Be careful with everything.

81

I'm the new bodyguard.

84
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,110
Hello, is anyone here?

85
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,910
Ms. Zhen.

86
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,910
Ms. Zhen, are you all right?

87
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,510
I'm fine. My stomach hurts.

88
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,780
It's a recurring illness.

89
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,610
Let me send you to the hospital.

90
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,940
Good morning, Ms. Zhen.

91
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,610
I made this sandwich myself.

92
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,980
Good morning, Ms. Zhen.

93
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,910
Ms. Zhen, your breakfast.

94
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,140
You can explain it now.

95
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,510
I had another purpose for making a deal with Zhen Quan.

96
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,010
However, I can't tell you about it now.

97
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,510
I can only tell you that I haven't betrayed you.

98
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,610
- You can't tell me about it? - Not now.

99
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,180
I know it's hard to accept it.

100
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,610
Regardless, I'm still your bodyguard

101
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,410
and your fiance.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,880
According to our agreement,

103
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,010
I will keep protecting you.

104
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,510
I will keep my distance from you

105
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,110
but please allow me to be around you.

106
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,140
All right.

107
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,240
I'll trust you one more time.

108
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,010
You can make your own choices

109
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,510
but don't expect me to forgive you soon.

110
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,380
- Sure. - If you betray me…

111
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,090
I won't.

112
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,010
Look.

113
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,540
Gu Chen and Ms. Zhen look quite distant today.

114
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,810
He used to speak to her with a smile.

115
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,110
Yes.

116
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,740
They were the picture of a loving couple in the company previously.

117
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,980
Hey.

118
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,910
It feels like there is something going on between them.

119
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,810
You can let go now.

120
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,580
I can go inside on my own.

121
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,360
This is serious.

122
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,540
Are they going to break up?

123
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,180
Someone saw them

124
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,510
arguing at Zhen Quan's birthday party yesterday.

125
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,740
From what we've seen today, that seems to be true.

126
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,720
[Tian Yu]

127
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,740
- Hello. - Beixing.

128
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,580
I know you are conflicted now.

129
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,810
You don't know if you should trust Gu Chen or not.

130
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,980
But you need to see this.

131
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,340
It might be related to your father's accident.

132
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,880
All right. Thank you, Tian Yu.

133
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,140
I will take a look.

134
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,610
I remember this file was in the archive.

135
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,680
Everything is

136
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,940
going well at Zhen Quan's side.

137
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,410
The scanned information on the USB drive has been recovered.

138
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,610
What's wrong with you?

139
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,910
She got angry at me.

140
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,710
Of course.

141
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,940
But is she really the target?

142
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,210
I don't know.

143
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,340
As long as we can get the Flutterheart Ring.

144
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,340
Should I spy on her phone as well?

145
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,110
- No. That's her privacy. - Fine.

146
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,010
Do you think there's an internal problem

147
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,610
at the Zhen Group?

148
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,710
I found some information

149
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,510
and sent it to your email.

150
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,610
Sure.

151
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,310
Let me teach you a method that always works with girls.

152
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,810
If you make a mistake,

153
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,810
you need to apologize. Find an opportunity

154
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,580
and explain everything to her.

155
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,810
Only the truth

156
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,580
can resolve her misunderstanding.

157
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,140
I know.

158
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,310
Someone else is also investigating Dad's cause of death.

159
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,110
Who is it?

160
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,610
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

161
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,340
Gu Chen?

162
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,910
- Why are you here? - I...

163
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,180
I came in to find some files.

164
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,110
I saw you come in

165
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,140
and didn't want to disturb you.

166
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,110
Actually, I've always been here.

167
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,140
I'm not peeking at you.

168
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,710
I just want to protect you.

169
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,110
I know you might not need it

170
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,540
but I can't leave you.

171
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,380
I can't

172
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,110
let you face the dangers alone.

173
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,910
I... I don't know what I should say.

174
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,380
Beixing, listen to me.

175
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,780
I didn't betray you.

176
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,710
All right. I'll trust you one more time.

177
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,410
Perhaps the power is out.

178
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,710
Let's find an emergency exit.

179
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,180
It seems like we've been trapped here.

180
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,980
It's all right.

181
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,710
The building's power should come back soon.

182
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,510
Actually,

183
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,440
my deal with Zhen Quan

184
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,440
was to give him the information on the USB drive.

185
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,780
However, I wanted to make a copy of it.

186
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,210
USB drive?

187
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,240
The footage on the USB drive

188
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,780
only captured Zhen Quan's subordinate.

189
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,640
But it didn't have evidence of Zhen Quan's wrongdoing.

190
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,540
So, I did something

191
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,010
to the USB drive.

192
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,840
If he tries to harm you again,

193
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,210
I will know immediately.

194
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,510
Besides, I think

195
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,110
there's a reason why he's anxious

196
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,340
about the footage.

197
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,540
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

198
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,910
I didn't want to give you false hope.

199
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,040
I also didn't want to involve you in any danger.

200
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,640
I wanted to confirm everything

201
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,610
before telling you everything.

202
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,780
I don't want you to worry.

203
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,710
However,

204
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,540
I've already confirmed the identity

205
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,040
of the person in the footage on the USB drive.
