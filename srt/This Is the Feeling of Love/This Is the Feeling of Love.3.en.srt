According to the company's rules,

18
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,700
Zhen Beixing's absence means she's giving up her authority.

19
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,780
Sir, make the announcement.

20
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,980
Wait!

21
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,340
What?

22
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,860
A man is carrying her inside.

23
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,660
Are you sure you can do this?

24
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,100
Yes.

25
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,700
I'll wait for you outside, then.

26
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,300
Time's up, Zhen Beixing.

27
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,540
You had no regard for the family rules

28
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,580
and created many controversies after you returned to China.

29
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,580
Why not give up voluntarily

30
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,260
and save yourself a little dignity?

31
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,700
According to the family rules,

32
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,260
I'm not late.

33
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,780
This is the proof of my assault this morning on my way here.

34
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,740
She was assaulted?

35
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,580
It shows that someone is trying to stop me from attending the meeting.

36
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,580
I have evidence.

37
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,100
If any of you have any objections

about me taking over the Zhen Group,

39
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,140
I will reveal the evidence I have.

40
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,260
Zhen Beixing might be reckless

41
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,260
but she was indeed assaulted.

42
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,580
She did not go against the family rules on purpose.

43
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,700
We should be understanding.

44
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,060
This is a crucial period for the family.

45
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,060
The reputation of the Zhen family cannot afford to take a hit.

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,860
We don't need any unnecessary scandals

47
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,260
because of groundless suspicion and conflict.

48
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,060
Yes. This is a crucial period.

49
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,060
Our competitors might be using this window of opportunity

50
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,980
to stir up an internal conflict.

51
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,060
Since Zhen Beixing could expose and deal with this problem in time,

52
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,660
it means she is capable enough

53
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,740
to become the CEO of Zhen Group.

54
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,060

Isn't he working in the subsidiary financial company?

184
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,040
That's their eldest son.

185
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,140
This is their second eldest son.

186
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,080
He owns

187
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,710
shares of many companies.

188
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,740
- He's only in the entertainment industry as a hobby. - Oh.

189
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,940
Ms. Zhang, may you always be so straightforward from now on,

190
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,840
as we will no longer be interested in

191
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,110
doing any business with the Zhang family.

192
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,640
It's all Ms. Zhang's fault for messing up.

193
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,940
She can blame no one else but herself.

194
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240
He's blacklisting her from everyone.

195
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,440
Who will dare do business with their family now?

196
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,000
I pity her old father.

197
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,760
The family will go bankrupt now.

198
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,880
Ms. Zhen.

199
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,840
Mr. Tian Yu, sorry.

200
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,240
My daughter was out of line.

201
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,710
Please be magnanimous

202
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,600
and forgive her.

203
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,840
Come on.

204
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,910
Sorry.

205
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,760
What's going on?

206
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,240
It's already so lively before I'm here.

207
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,080
- Hello, Mr. Zhen. - Hello, Mr. Zhen.

208
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,160
Mr. Zhen, Ms. Zhang was being rude.

209
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,560
She made Beixing and Tian Yu upset.

210
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,700
The Zhang family has caused me so much trouble.

211
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,560
Today is my birthday.

212
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,160
Young people can be quite rash at times.

213
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,660
Let's not make a fuss.

214
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,500
Zhang is here to congratulate me on my birthday.

215
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,530
He is also one of our own.

216
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,130
Don't let a minor issue affect our relationship.

217
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,460
If you say so, Mr. Zhen.

218
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,280
We will show you respect.

219
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,360
However, I don't want

220
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,460
to hear anyone speaking badly about Beixing.

221
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,530
Of course.

222
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,900
It won't happen again.

223
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,560
Uncle Zhen Quan,

224
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,930
happy birthday.

225
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,930
I wish you health and longevity.

226
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Mr. Zhen Quan, happy birthday.

227
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,060
I wish you longevity.

228
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,330
Tian Yu is impressive.

229
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,300
With this man supporting Beixing,

230
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,060
I need to be cautious.

231
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,660
All right, make yourself at home, everyone.

232
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,360
- Mr. Zhen, please sit. - Go.

233
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,930
Tian Yu is a tough opponent.

234
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,260
You need to

235
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,460
make Zhen Beixing's fiance fight with Tian Yu.

236
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,330
Next...

237
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,160
Yes, Mr. Zhen.
