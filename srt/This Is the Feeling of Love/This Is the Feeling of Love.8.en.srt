Didn't he go after Zhen Quan?

185
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,280
Zhen Quan,

186
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,120
this is where your crimes end.

187
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,680
Right here

188
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,720
is all the evidence of your wrongdoing.

189
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,350
The police will arrive any moment.

190
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,320
Your overseas accounts

191
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,450
have already been frozen.

192
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,250
Gu Chen, please don't let anything happen to you.

193
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,650
You again. Ruining everything for me.

194
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,250
If that's how it is,

195
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,750
I'd rather destroy us both

196
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,920
than let you walk away unscathed.

197
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:43,500
♪The hazy streets rewind, bidding farewell to every heartbroken visitor♪

198
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:51,180
♪Parting flowers wither and fall, their lingering fragrance fades away♪

199
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:59,140
♪Your figure is swallowed by the crowd, as if you never stood by my side♪

200
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:08,700
♪The once moving vows vanish with the passing of time, who remembers them?♪

201
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,190
♪It's hard to define what I've truly possessed until now♪

202
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,180
♪Was it you or just memories? Snow melts, winter passes♪

203
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:25,180
♪Everything is like our fleeting encounter, how can one let it go?♪

204
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:30,020
♪It's hard to define what I've truly possessed until now♪

205
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,300
♪Was it love or regret? Amid the river of time and sea of people♪

206
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:43,900
♪You and I embrace only for a moment before we part unwillingly♪
