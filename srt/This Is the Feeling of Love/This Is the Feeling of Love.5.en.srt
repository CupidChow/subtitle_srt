Ma Tianming?

Yes.

19
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,140
He works for Zhen Quan.

20
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,100
He must be involved in your father's death.

If you want to know the truth,

22
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,540
you can start by investigating him.

23
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,270
Thank you, Gu Chen.

24
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,740
I shouldn't have doubted you.

25
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,300
It's fine.

Before you find the true culprit,

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,440
you should doubt everyone.

How dramatic.

38
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,040

Is he here for Ms. Zhen?

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,900
He's so handsome.

53
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,240
Yes.

54
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,470
Why is Ms. Zhen surrounded by handsome guys?

55

Beixing, why didn't you answer my calls yesterday?

00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,540
I was so worried about you.

57
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,070
My phone was dead.

58
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,240

It's good that you're fine.

60
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,940
However, this is a special situation.

66
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,940
we found

67
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,900
some important documents that might be connected to my father's case.

68
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,100
Ma Tianming appeared on the USB drive.

69
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,500
Today,

70
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,640
I also found out some clues about Ma Tianming.

71
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,100
He has been in the company for ten years.

72
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,300
I didn't expect him to work for Zhen Quan.

73
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,040
Hello. What's wrong?

74
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,440
Where in the world are you?

75
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,100
I'm dealing with something important.

76
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,540
You need to go on stage soon.

77
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,640
You are late.

78
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,040
Sure. I'll be there soon.

79
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,870
Tian Yu,

80
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,300
you should get back to work.

81
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,240
I can handle things here myself.

82
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,900
You can rest assured

83
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,940
with Gu Chen around.

84
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,900
I'll be fine.

85
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,860
Ma Tianming, I have a bunch of complaint letters

86
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,100
about you here.

87
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,470
You need to give me a good explanation

88
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,100
for these serious allegations.

89
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,340
Ms. Zhen,

90
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,670
the management I implemented

91
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,500
was to improve the company's work efficiency.

92
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,140
These complaint letters

93
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,070
are making a mountain out of a molehill.

94
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,340
We need to make sure that strict management

95
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,270
doesn't turn into an abuse of power.

96
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Your method has obviously affected team morale.

97
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,670
Ms. Zhen, what I did was approved by your uncle,

98
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,640
the chairman of the company.

99
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,070
If you're not happy,

100
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,700
you can talk to him.

101
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,870
In that case,

102
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,240
I think I need to speak to him.

103
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,500
At the same time, I'll instruct the HR department

104
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,140
to investigate these complaints individually.

105
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,270
Sure.

106
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,470
I'll be waiting.

107
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,900
We need to gather more evidence

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,640
that proves Ma Tianming's abuse of power

109
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,240
before we can take action against him.

110
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,840
I will observe his every move

111
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,240
to gather any possible evidence.

112
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,640
Once he does anything against the rules,

113
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,440
I'll take action immediately.

114
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,640
Trying to remove me as soon as she got appointed?

115
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,900
Mr. Ma, take a look at this proposal.

116
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,500
Qin, come here.

117
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,420
Come here.

118
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,340
Come here.

119
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,370
Look at this.

120
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,040
She's always dressed up so glamorously,

121
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,440
yet she's playing hard to get?

122
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,140
Qin, this proposal obviously won't do.

123
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,940
As a veteran employee,

124
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,670
how could you make such a basic mistake?

125
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,300
There's no problem with this.

126
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,640
Is the data correct?

127
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,640
Mr. Ma.

128
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,840
Who is it?

129
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,070
Sorry. My bad.

130
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,740
Assistant Gu.

131
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,840
Ms. Zhen called Wang Qin over just now.

132
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,940
Do you still need her here?

133
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,140
No. I dare not take Ms. Zhen's people.

134
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,740
Come with me.

135
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,300
Flaunting another person's authority.

136
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,270
I'll teach you a lesson sooner or later.

137
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,670
Ma Tianming is really disgusting.

138
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,070
You should've avoided him sooner.

139
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,470
Thankfully, Mr. Gu saved me.

140
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,470
Thank you.

141
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,240
I will report this to Ms. Zhen.

142
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,840
In the future, all of you will no longer be treated this way.

143
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,470
Qin, the hot pot shop downstairs is doing a promotion.

144
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,840
Let's have a meal together after work.

145
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,670
Let's go,

146
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,470
Qin. It's very delicious.

147
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,870
I'll go next time.

148
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,840
Qin.

149
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,070
You'll go home late today.

150
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,640
Complete this report first.

151
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,270
Sorry,

152
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,100
Mr. Ma. Today is my daughter's birthday.

153
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,640
I promised to take her to the park after work.

154
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,640
After I divorced her father,

155
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,240
I've always been comforting her

156
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,670
and telling her I'd take her to the park if possible.

157
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,100
I've broken my promise a few times because of work.

158
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,900
I'll get it done and submit it to you tomorrow.

159
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,300
Is that okay?

160
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,500
This has nothing to do with me.

161
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,100
Today, you have a parent-teacher meeting to attend.

162
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,300
Tomorrow, her father has a headache.

163
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,940
Then no one will work.

164
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,300
No company will survive.

165
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,700
But I've finished all my work today.

166
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,770
What you just gave me...

167
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,900
Just do whatever I say!

168
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,870
Who's the superior now?

169
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,670
Do all of you want to work overtime?

170
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,100
We'll be leaving first.

171
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,870
Let's go.

172
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,840
Qin, look at you.

173
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,700
You can actually live a better life if you serve me.

174
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,240
Ma Tianming,

175
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,270
please respect me.

176
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,440
I've always been doing my work professionally.

177
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,440
Nuo is obedient.

178
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,440
I don't think my life is hard.

179
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,140
Don't you get all dressed up every day just to seduce me?

180
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,670
Why are you acting all high and mighty?

181
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,300
You're being so uncooperative.

182
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,940
Do you still want to work here?

183
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,420
Huh?

184
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,100
Ma Tianming, I've always respected you.

185
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,100
I just want to do my job well.

186
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,240
Nothing else.

187
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,100
Women

188
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,270
don't always mean what they say.

189
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,100
I didn't know

190
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,700
you had this much power, Ma Tianming.

191
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,100
According to the company's regulations,

192
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,500
transfer of employees

193
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,440
who have worked more than three years

194
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,220
must be approved by three department managers.

195
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,840
She has worked in the Zhen Group for five years

196
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,240
and has performed very well.

197
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,840
What is your reason for terminating her?

198
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,700
She seduced me first.

199
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,840
- I didn't... - She usually looks at me in a weird way.

200
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,940
Today, she purposely stayed back

201
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,140
to seduce me.

202
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,300
Ma Tianming!

203
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,340
Don't cover up your perverted acts with excuses.

204
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,900
I have evidence of

205
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,270
you abusing your position

206
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
to sexually harass female employees.

207
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,470
From now on,

208
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,540
you have been terminated.

209
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,640
I will report to the police about what happened today.

210
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,840
The company has a zero-tolerance policy for this behavior.

211
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Assistant Gu.

212
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,140
Yes.

213
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,470
Set up a complaint box.

214
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,470
You will manage it directly.

215
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Any employees who are harassed in similar ways

216
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,470
can report the incident anonymously.

217
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,040
Yes, Ms. Zhen.

218
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,900
Sorry.

219
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,840
I just made a mistake.

220
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,270
I need this job.

221
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,140
I have a family to feed.

222
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,870
Please.

223
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,540
If you know this is wrong in the beginning,

224
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,900
why do you still do it?

225
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,840
You should pay for your own mistakes.

226
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,940
Can you give me a chance?

227
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,140
Wang Qin, you may leave.

228
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,900
Thank you, Ms. Zhen.

229
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,840
Just wait.

230
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,900
I won't forgive you.

231
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,270
What's wrong, Wang Qin?

232
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,070
Oh.

233
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,840
Ms. Zhen, it's nothing.

234
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,640
It's not easy to get a ride during the peak period.

235
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,070
We'll give you a ride. Let's go.

236
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,440
I can't trouble both of you.

237
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,900
It's all right, Ms. Zhen.

238
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,100
I can just wait for a while longer.

239
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,040
It's all right. We are also heading the same way.

240
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,870
Thank you, Ms. Zhen.

241
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,470
Sorry, Nuo.

242
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,040
I'm late.

243
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,640
It's fine.

244
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
Mom.

245
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,270
Who are the pretty lady and the handsome guy

246
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,470
who look like celebrities?

247
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,740
They are my bosses.

248
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,840
They sent me here today.

249
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,340
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to meet you this soon.

250
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,540
Hello, Nuo.

251
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,870
I am Beixing.

252
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,670

I am Gu Chen.

254

Ms. Pretty

255
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,440
and Mr. Handsome, today is my birthday.

256
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,700
Can you play with me?

257
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,640
Of course.

258
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,540
What do you want to play?

259
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,640
Do you want me to lift you up?

260
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,670
Okay.

261
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,040
Come on.

262
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,420
Oh!

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,270
