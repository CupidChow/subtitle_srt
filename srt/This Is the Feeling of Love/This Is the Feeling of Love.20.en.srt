Are you sure

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,870
this can make them reconcile?

19
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,310
It sounds very risky.

20
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,150
According to psychology,

21
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,590
facing a danger together deepens one's bond with another.

22
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,590
We need a dangerous situation

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,360
so that Gu Chen can show his protective side

24
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,150

When one is in a dangerous or stressful environment,

they tend to seek comfort in someone else.

29
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,360
If Gu Chen can protect Beixing from danger,

30
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,280
it will increase Beixing's trust

31
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,710

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,360

It's just a short power cut.

Beixing.

191
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,030
I'm hungry.

192
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,630
Hungry?

193
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,120
Then I'll cook breakfast for you.

194
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,600
Mmm?

195
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,080
Beixing, flowers for you.

196
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,200
Thank you.

197
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Put them there.

198
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,390
How come Gu Chen is not here?

199
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,390
Oh.

200
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,870
He's busy planning the wedding.

201
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,030
The wedding?

202
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,600
Yes.

203
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,790
He proposed to me yesterday.

204
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,600
Beixing,

205
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,840
I'm sure I told you

206
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,240
to beware of Gu Chen.

207
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,080
We've just met him.

208
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,630
We don't know him well.

209
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,200
We've cleared up the misunderstanding.

210
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,630
I trust him.

211
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,870
Must you always side with him

212
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,670
like this?

213
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,510
I'm not siding with him blindly.

214
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,600
Gu Chen and I spend every day together.

215
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,600
He genuinely touched my heart.

216
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,440
I believe in my gut feeling

217
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,790
and true love.

218
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,390
Because of love,

219
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,270
I become a better version of myself.

220
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,870
That's how

221
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,390
I can design such beautiful and warm jewelry.

222
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,720
Why won't you believe me?

223
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,270
You view him with hostility.

224
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,200
You're not the young Beixing anymore.

225
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,120
Yes, I've grown up now.

226
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,670
I know you want to protect me.

227
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,510
I also appreciate your company.

228
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,200
So are you leaving me now?

229
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,480
Of course not.

230
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,870
As I said, we will be good friends forever.

231
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,670
I see.

232
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,600
It's okay.

233
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,600
It's all thanks to Su Qian.

234
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,480
Were it not for her suggestion,

235
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,600
Gu Chen and I wouldn't have been able to see the fireworks,

236
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,870
and I wouldn't have been inspired by it.

237
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,670
Tell me.

238
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,510
Is it better if I change the aquamarine here

239
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,600
to turquoise?

240
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,320
It looks good either way.

241
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,320
As long as it's your design.

242
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,150
Beixing.

243
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,390
When will you ever notice me?

244
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,120
I truly hope

245
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,000
that one day,

246
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,390
you can notice me,

247
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,320
the me that belongs to you.
