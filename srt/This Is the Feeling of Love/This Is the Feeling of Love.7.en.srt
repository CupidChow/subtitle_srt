[Episode 7]

17
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,630
Zhen Cheng, according to the rules,

18
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,030
we are supposed to take turns keeping the Flutterheart Ring.

19
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,530
I know Dad has given the ring to you.

20
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,930
Why not give me back what I deserve right now?

21
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,270
Also, about my removal from the office.

22
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,830
I don't get it.

23
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,900
You are my older brother.

24
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,730
Why are you always siding with the others?

25
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,300
Zhen Quan.

26
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,270
You have embezzled a lot of money from the company.

27
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,430
I can cover the tracks for you,

28
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,030
but I cannot allow you to use inferior materials

29
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,270
that might put someone's life in danger.

30
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,730
You should resign now

31
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,730
before things get out of control.

32
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,700
Seriously, Zhen Cheng?

33
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,630
I merely took some money.

34
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,430
You have lost your mind to old age.

35
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,930
Stop me again

36
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,230
and I might stop treating you as my brother

37
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,430
and kill you.

38
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,170
- Hmph. - You...

39
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,270
Come in.

40
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,670
And these

41
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,430
are ledgers indicating Zhen Quan's embezzlement in recent years.

42
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,300
Does this mean

43
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,500
Uncle Zhen Quan killed my father?

44
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,530
And why does he want the Flutterheart Ring?

45
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,730
To fill the monetary shortfall

46
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,230
or is it for another nefarious plan?

47
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,700
This key evidence

48
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,670
shows that Zhen Quan has an ulterior motive.

49
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,500
But it isn't enough

50
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,070
to prove his intention to kill.

51
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,830
We need something more direct.

52
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,330
What should we do now?

53
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,700
We can't just let him do what he wants.

54
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,100
We can use the video

55
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,270
and the ledgers

56
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,470
as our bargaining chip

57
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,430
to pressure him into slipping up.

58
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,230
I'll make the necessary arrangements

59
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,930
to make sure that nothing goes wrong.

60
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,230
Beixing, rest up now

61
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,330
for the upcoming storm.

62
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,300
I trust you.

63
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,700
No matter what,

64
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,070
I won't let my dad die for nothing.

65
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,230
I've examined all ledgers.

66
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,530
Zhen Quan has transferred all his money to an offshore account.

67
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,700
The evidence is irrefutable.

68
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,030
These ledgers and footage should be enough

69
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,870
to make Zhen Quan slip up.

70
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,270
But we need him to do that

71
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,270
in public.

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,700
So you plan to...

73
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,020
I plan to

74
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,630
meet him

75
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,700
with the evidence.

76
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,300
He will panic,

77
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,070
and then, he will make mistakes.

78
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,270
Why don't we call the police?

79
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,430
Police can't do much without

80
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,470
incriminating evidence.

81
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,030
The board members will back him up too.

82
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,870
You're taking

83
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,030
a huge risk for Zhen Beixing.

84
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,430
She's my only lead

85
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,630
to my past memories.

86
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,930
- I have to... - Don't get carried away.

87
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,300
Love is a double-edged sword.

88
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,630
What if she isn't the person you seek?

89
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,030
I don't know.

90
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,330
But I won't forgive myself

91
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,470
if she gets hurt.

92
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,500
The conversation between Zhen Cheng and that person was interrupted.

93
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,300
Why is that?

94
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,030
It says here that there was a power cut.

95
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,830
I'm seeing Zhen Quan tomorrow.

96
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,070
Let's make sure everything is in order.

97
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,070
Every piece of remote equipment is already in place,

98
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,730
and they are ready for activation during crucial moments.

99
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,970
Tomorrow is the day.

100
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Beixing cannot be in danger anymore.

101
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,070
Oh.

102
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,830
Keep an eye out for Beixing.

103
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,430
Zhen Quan might harm her again.

104
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,100
Ma Tianming's car crash is not an accident.

105
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,900
If Zhen Quan did kill Zhen Cheng,

106
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,670
he wouldn't spare Beixing either.

107
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,130
Okay.

108
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,220
I will keep an eye on them at all times.

109
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,270
Lin Mo invented this.

110
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,730
It contains a global communication and positioning chip.

111
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,670
I made a few tweaks

112
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,970
so that it's connected to my watch.

113
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,300
You can call me

114
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,630
whenever

115
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,700
and wherever.

116
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,670
It's no problem at all.

117
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,630
Okay.

118
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,270
I'm seeing Zhen Quan tomorrow.

119
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,700
Let's make sure everything is in order.

120
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,070
Tomorrow is the day.

121
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,030
Beixing cannot be in danger anymore.

122
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,730
Dad,

123
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,330
I cannot wait for someone else take the risk for me.

124
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,670
It is what I must do.

125
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,300
I will face Zhen Quan in person.

126
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,630
Uncle Zhen Quan,

127
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,100
let's talk.

128
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,700
Beixing.

129
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,530
What brought you here so early in the morning?

130
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,530
Seriously, Zhen Cheng?

131
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,430
I merely took some money.

132
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,270
You have lost your mind to old age.

133
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,830
Stop me again

134
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,060
and I might stop treating you as my brother

135
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,270
and kill you.

136
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,830
What is the meaning of this?

137
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,630
I hope you can surrender yourself to the police.

138
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,030
Otherwise, I'll take immediate action.

139
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,700
You really are very naive.

140
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,900
You think this is enough to blackmail me?

141
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,630
I was arguing with your dad.

142
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,930
And people say all sorts of things in the heat of the moment.

143
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,500
This doesn't prove anything.

144
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,300
Uncle Zhen Quan,

145
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,030
come clean as to whether you asked someone

146
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,700
to call my dad and cause that fatal accident.

147
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,230
These ledgers prove that you committed embezzlement.

148
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,530
If you don't turn yourself in,

149
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,630
I will hand them to the police.

150
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,030
Beixing.

151
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,900
I know who was behind it.

152
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,230
But why must I tell you?

153
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,700
You should work with me

154
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,420
and hand over the Flutterheart Ring

155
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,630
and the shares.

156
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,570
And maybe, I'll tell you the truth before you die.

157
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,130
Do you know how much trouble you're in?

158
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,030
You might not be able to leave this building alive.

159
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,900
If I'm ready to be here, I'm ready for anything.

160
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,630
I want everyone to know the truth.

161
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,230
I can't let my dad die for nothing.

162
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,330
You have one day to turn yourself in, Uncle Zhen Quan.

163
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,130
And don't go thinking that I don't have extra copies.

164
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,220
If I don't leave this place alive,

165
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,620
the evidence will be given to the police immediately.

166
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,070
Follow Zhen Beixing.

167
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,830
Kidnap her after half an hour.

168
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,700
Destroy any evidence you find.

169
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,730
Oh, no, Gu Chen.

170
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,470
Zhen Beixing went to meet Zhen Quan.

171
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,870
Zhen Quan just ordered to have her kidnapped.

172
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,270
What? Where are they?

173
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,230
I'm trying to locate Zhen Beixing

174
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,130
through her watch signal.

175
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,030
I don't see anything here.

176
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,230
Stop talking and start searching.

177
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,330
- Found anything? - No.

178
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,470
It's all useless stuff.

179
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,500
Boss.

180
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,470
We found nothing.

181
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,230
Keep on searching.

182
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,130
Leave no stone unturned.

183
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,730
Yes. Let's continue.

184
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,830
She's in a remote area near the beach.

185
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,130
Zhen Beixing, where are you?

186
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,900
Zhen Beixing? This is bad.

187
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,430
She is in danger. I must go to her.

188
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,900
Update me about her location at any time.

189
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,430
Okay.

190
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,030
This is your final warning.

191
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,700
Hand over the documents in the USB drive.

192
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,030
No.

193
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,030
You won't have those documents.

194
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,730
Beixing, hand over the ledgers

195
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,030
and you will still be my beloved niece.

196
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,870
I won't let you have them.

197
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,530
I see. In that case,

198
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,670
you shall be reunited with Zhen Cheng.

199
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,500
So you did kill my father!

200
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,630
So what?

201
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,670
You will see him soon.

202
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,070
You're digging your own grave.

203
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,230
Hang in there, Zhen Beixing.

204
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,030
I'm almost there.

205
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,500
Goodbye, Gu Chen.

206
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,140
Please, doctor. Save her.

207
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,860
Sorry. We've done everything we could.
