We must

193
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,000
get their study reports as soon as possible

194
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,720
to expose their true agenda.

195
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,550
It must be difficult to crack the computer's password.

196
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,030
We must be quick.

197
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,960
I'll try.

198
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,550
Give me some time.

199
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,720
Time waits for no one.

200
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,240
I know.

201
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
Just one more minute.

202
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,100
[Security Code]

203
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,390
We got it.

204
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,000
Their research is quite in-depth.

205
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,030
They must have made a lot of progress.

206
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,720
We must take the reports away

207
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,720
so that we can investigate and analyze it.

208
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,670
But now,

209
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,750
let's find a way out.

210
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,120
We must be careful.

211
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,910
Don't let them see us.

212
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,720
Let's go.

213
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,200
Who's there?

214
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,630
Come out now.

215
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Someone has entered the room.

216
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,240
Find them.

217
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,870
Noted.

218
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,390
Quick. Over here.

219
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,550
There's no one here.

220
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,120
Oh.

221
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,120
I must have made a mistake.

222
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,510
There is no one here.

223
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,670
Search other areas.

224
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,120
Okay.

225
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,840
That was close.

226
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,550
They almost found us.

227
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,000
We can't take any more risks.

228
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,750
We must hand this to the police now.

229
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,030
Let's get out of here.

230
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,200
Come.

231
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,550
