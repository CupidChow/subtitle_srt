What?

18
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,430
Am I more interesting than the magazine?

19
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,150
Of course.

20
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,630
When you're focusing on your work,

21
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,190
you're more beautiful than any landscape in the world.

22
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,120
But you should relax a bit now.

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,840
Let's play a game.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,150

Yay!

33
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,360
It seems like we came at the wrong time.

34
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,520
You two are so engrossed.

35
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,800
What brought you here?

36
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
We're here

37
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,430
to congratulate you on tying the knot.

38
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,310
Yes.

40
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,310
I want to be your bridesmaid.

41
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,240
Sure.

42
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,750
Great!

43
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,400
Let's try the wedding dress.

44
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,960
Okay.

45
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,750
Mo, do I look good?

46
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,560
Yes.

47
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,600
But you're not wearing a bridesmaid gown, are you?

48
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,040
And you're not wearing a groomsman tuxedo either.

49
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,830
But it looks good

50
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,720
and I want to try it out.

51
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,830
Then let's wear these when we get married.

52
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,040
Please, Mo?

53
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,360
Please.

54
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,160
The wedding dress looks good on you.

55
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,560

support her?

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,630
Like what you did when you were little.

62
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,920
She betrayed you.

63
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,390
She ignored

64
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,830

65
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,600
That's not true.

I don't mean that.

79

83
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,310
He just doesn't know how to express it.

84
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,040
Now, he met Su Qian, an extrovert.

85
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,720
They complement each other.

86
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,310
We complement each other too.

108

How could they have released me so easily?

109

121
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,390

can't you tell he's been lying to you?

124
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,910
Why do you believe him again and again?

125
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,360
Beixing, do you not trust me?

126
