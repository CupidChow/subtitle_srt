Why didn't you think about

188
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,440
Beixing's happiness?

189
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,480
Gu Chen.

190
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,600
I love Beixing.

191
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,240
I won't give up on her.

Tian Yu.

193
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,630
You don't know

194
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,150
what love is.

195
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,320
Gu Chen.

196
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,440
Gu Chen.

197
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,600
Are you okay?

198
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,360
Are you okay?

199
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,240
Why can't you ever notice me?

200
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,870
Gu Chen.

201
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,320
If you're gone,

202
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,840
Beixing will be mine!
