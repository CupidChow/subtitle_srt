What are you doing here?

20
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,450
I just came back.

21
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,050
I was worried you might get into trouble alone,

22
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,590
so I came.

23
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,390

regarding your father here yesterday.

41
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,350
We found nothing useful.

What do we do now?

165
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,740
Don't worry.

166
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,900
It'll get better.

167
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,740
Thank you.

168
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,540
Hey, Lin Mo.

169
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,940
I don't want to see any negative posts on Zhen Beixing.

have been circulating online.

177
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,850
It has drawn widespread attention

178
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,480
and created many rumors.

179
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,970
We wish to clarify the matter before you.

180
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,900
Ms. Zhen and Mr. Tian

181
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,100
are childhood friends.

182
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,770
They are just friends.

183
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,130
The photos you've seen

184
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,100

Any speculation or rumor about their allegedly inappropriate relationship

186
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,630
is just a misunderstanding.

187
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,590
We are deeply sorry for creating

188
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,830
this huge distraction and for occupying public online spaces.

189
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,900
The Zhen Group upholds the principles of integrity and accountability.

190
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,770
We will always be open and receptive

191
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,730
to your criticisms and feedback.

192
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,270
Additionally, we

193
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,170
will also take necessary legal action

194
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,170
to protect our employees

195
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,100
and reputation

196
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
so that they are not affected

197
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,630
by baseless slanders and allegations.

198
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,900
We hope this press conference

199
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,100
clears things up for everyone.

200
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,230
In the meantime, we urge the public and the media

201
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,970
to be just as aware and respectful.

202
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,130
Let's not spread unverified information

203
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,770
so that we can shape a healthy

204
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,830
and rational discussion space.

205
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,900
We promise to work harder

206
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,930
to push the company to greater heights.

207
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,350
Mr. Gu is awesome.

208
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,270
Like a knight protecting his wife.

209
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,070
Indeed.

210
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,130
To protect Ms. Zhen,

211
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,430
he faced the media alone.

212
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,230
He is the definition of a good husband.

213
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,920
Ms. Zhen is an amazing woman.

214
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,950
She deserves a man like him.

215
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,120
I can do what you did for Beixing too.

216
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,070
Hi, everyone.

217
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,430
This is Tian Yu.

218
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,530
I have a few things to say

219
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,830
regarding the photos of me

220
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,830
and Ms. Zhen circulating online.

221
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,670
First of all,

222
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,330
Ms. Zhen and I have been friends

223
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,170
for many years.

224
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,530
We share

225
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,670
a tight friendship bond.

226
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,690
That night,

227
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,050
we were in a hot spring resort,

228
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,850
taking a stroll.

229
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,250
This is a normal activity

230
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,390
between two close friends.

231
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,190
Besides,

232
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,150
there were other people with us too.

233
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,990
In a short while,

234
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,320
my studio will release the relevant details.

235
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,490
It is not

236
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,150
what the allegedly inappropriate relationship

237
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,030
people have been saying online.

238
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,050
I understand

239
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,650
that as a public figure,

240
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,450
I will be

241
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,520
under the public's scrutiny.

242
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,120
But it is unfair to anyone involved

243
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,320
for a normal, leisure activity

244
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,720
undertaken by old friends,

245
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,750
to be taken out of context and twisted maliciously.

246
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,590
I urge everyone

247
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,750
to leave

248
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,750
the innocent individuals

249
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,320
as well as their family alone.

250
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,320
Let's view this matter in a more

251
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,520
positive perspective.

252
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,520
I look forward

253
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,850
to see what she can achieve

254
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,250
with the Zhen Group under her stellar leadership.

255
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:58,830
Lastly,

256
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,550
I'd like to voice my support for Ms. Zhen.

257
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,320
I believe

258
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,520
in her capability

259
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,920
as the new leader of the Zhen Group.

260
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,920
Thank you for your support and understanding.

261
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:08,750
My name is Tian Yu.

262
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,090
I hope this is enough to end the debacle.

264
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:14,750
Hello?

265
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:15,430
Tian Yu.

266
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,350
Are you busy?

267
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,720
I saw the video.

268
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,720
Thank you so much.

269
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,520
It's very helpful.

270
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,350
No worries.

271
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,190
Don't mention it.

272
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,050
I urge everyone

273
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,720
to leave the innocent individuals

274
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,320
as well as their family

275
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,550
alone.

276
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,350
No way!

277
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,350
Why would Tian Yu

278
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,690
come out and defend that girl?

279
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,920
She must have used

280
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
some dirty tricks.

281
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,520
You don't deserve to stand next to Tian Yu.

282
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:44,920
You're a home wrecker.

283
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,690
I'll teach you a lesson.

284
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,990
Tian Yu is mine.

285
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,990
You home wrecker.

286
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,720
I won't let you have your way.

287
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,090
You don't deserve Tian Yu.

288
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,230
Tian Yu is mine.

289
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,190
Tian Yu is mine.

290
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,090
I won't let you have your way.
