Allow me to present someone.

Come here.

This is the buddy I mention often

21
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,370
to you.

22
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,740

Hi, Lin Mo.

25
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,250
Hi, Beixing.

26
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,710
Thank you so much.

27
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,170
Thanks to you,

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,570
the negative articles all disappeared.

29

It's just a piece of cake.

While the scandal is over,

31

there is something odd about it still.

32
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,170
Tian Yu and I have been photographed together before.

33
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,170
But it has never snowballed

34
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,740
like it did this time.

35
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,870
It's as if someone

36
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,500
is trying to blow it out of proportion.

37
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,740
Am I reading too much into it?

38
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,470
I have implemented online surveillance.

We will track IP addresses that post inflammatory articles.

40
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,740
That way, they won't

41
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,770
be able to hurt you again.

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,870

68
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,970
I don't know.

69
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,070
I'm just in charge of the delivery.

70
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,970
Don't drink this coffee.

71
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Let me get you a glass of water.

72
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,540
Gu Chen is always by her side

73
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,370
when we act.

74
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,970
We can't find any opening.

75
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,470
- Right. - Exactly.

76
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,070
Only when she's away

77
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,940
from Gu Chen

78
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,470
that we can succeed.

79
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,700
How to lure him away then?

80
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,340
Gu Chen is with her 24/7 now.

81
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,500

00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,480

84
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,090

If you want the truth,

87
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,970
come to the rooftop alone within 10 minutes.

88
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,400
This could be the key

89
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,700

90
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,070
They are members of the fan club?

91
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,740
Yes.

92
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,540
Most of them are students,

93
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,570

94
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,700
Their plan

95
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,170
is systematic and organized.

96
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,500
Keep an eye on them at all times.

97
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,270
If anyone approaches Beixing,

98
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,340
let me know.

99
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,070
There is one suspicious IP address.

100
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,060
Which one?

101
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,300
It always appears within the Zhen Group office building.

102
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,740
She could be one of the employees.

103
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,940
Who could she be?

104
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,170
She's still inside the office building.

105
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,220
Hello, the person you call...

106
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,370
Lin Mo.

107
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,770
Locate Beixing for me.

108
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,700
Zhen Beixing and the owner of the IP address

109
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,300
are on the rooftop.

110
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,900
Rooftop?

111
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,540
Be careful!

112
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,900
Stay still.

113
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,100
One wrong move

114
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,670
and you might fall.

115
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,170
You're the one who texted me.

116
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:22,970
Yes.

117
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,900
But also no.

118
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,470
All you need to know

119
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,770
is that many people want you hurt.

120
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,370
Even if I didn't do this today,

121
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,540
someone else would have done it.

122
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,870
What do you want?

123
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,300
What do I want?

124
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,740
I want you gone forever.

125
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,740
You are engaged to your fiance.

126
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,570
You're not worthy of Tian Yu's company.

127
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,870
You're not worthy of what Tian Yu has done for you.

128
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,100
You are

129
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,540
Vivian.

130
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,700
You figured it out very quickly.

131
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,100
In this case,

132
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,270
I don't need to hide myself anymore.

133
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,170
Vivian.

134
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,700
I've been nothing but kind to you.

135
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,300
You...

136
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,770
You like Tian Yu?

137
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,270
Tian Yu is perfect.

138
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,740
If not, just a bit too kind sometimes.

139
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,970
He failed to see

140
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,300
your true face.

141
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,370
I won't let anyone hurt him.

142
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,070
But

143
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,470
what you see

144
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,940
isn't necessarily the truth.

145
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,070
If what I see isn't the truth,

146
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,300
what is the truth then?

147
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,700
An infidel woman like you

148
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,270
must have lied to Tian Yu.

149
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,070
Ah!

150
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,540
Stop!

151
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,980
Stop!

152
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,700
See?

153
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,900
Mr. Gu sure loves you a lot.

154
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,670
He rushed to rescue you.

155
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,470
Don't come any closer.

156
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,970
Take one step further

157
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,140
and I'll push her.

158
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,940
Okay, I'll stay here.

159
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,140
Calm down.

160
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,540
Do you think Tian Yu will fall in love with you

161
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,670
once I'm gone?

162
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,500
You broke his heart.

163
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,900
So you shall die.

164
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,300
But you can't even break his heart.

165
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,940
You're just a stranger to him.

166
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,700
A creepy stalker.

167
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,940
I'm sure you have your friends and family.

168
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,140
I'm sure you parents put in a lot of effort

169
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,270
to raise you.

170
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,270
I'm sure they want you

171
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,700
to have a happy life,

172
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,300
don't they?

173
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,140
If you hurt me today,

174
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,300
Tian Yu will regard you as a criminal.

175
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,270
Do you want to sacrifice the rest of your life

176
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,540
for a celebrity who won't even bat you an eye?

177
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,500
What about those who love you?

178
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,900
- Stop talking! - Ah!

179
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,140
Beixing!

180
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,700
Ah!

181
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,900
Consider yourself lucky that Beixing is safe.

182
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,470
Wait.

183
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,870
I wish to speak to her.

184
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,900
Tian Yu.

185
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,170
I'm doing this for you.

186
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,270
Tian Yu.

187
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,370
You are not me.

188
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,870
You are not responsible for my life.

189
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,340
And I don't need anyone to save me.

190
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,970
No one can make a decision for me.

191
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,870
Love cannot be an excuse to hurt someone else.

192
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,270
Even less so to commit a crime.

193
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,370
No matter what you do,

194
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,500
I will never choose you.

195
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,700
Let go of your obsession.

196
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,870
Tian Yu.

197
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,180
Tian Yu.

198
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,670
If possible,

199
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,900
I want Beixing to be mine solely.

200
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,170
But will she accept me

201
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,070
once she sees the real me?

202
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,940
It's not that serious.

203
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,500
The wound I get from scaling

204
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,470
my high school dormitory wall

205
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,100
was worse than this.

206
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,740
Gu Chen.

207
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,470
What's the matter?

208
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,900
I'm fine.

209
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,340
Zhen Beixing.

210
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,700
Why did you meet Vivian alone?

211
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,470
Don't you know that was dangerous?

212
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,770
You never listen to me.

213
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,570
I didn't know she would do something crazy.

214
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,270
I just wanted to handle it myself.

215
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,470
I didn't know it'd turn out like this.

216
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,670
Why must you face danger alone?

217
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,970
Zhen Beixing, I want to protect you.

218
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,470
Can you stop getting hurt,

219
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,700
please?

220
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,400
Gu Chen.

221
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,770
Why do you care so much about me?

222
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,740
Because I'm in love with you.

223
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,900
Beixing, seeing you injured

224
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,100
pains me.

225
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,900
Not only do I want to protect you,

226
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,470
I want to be someone you can rely on.

227
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,070
No matter what happens,

228
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,270
I'll be there for you.

229
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,870
I like you a lot.

230
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,470
Let's date.

231
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,540
For real.

232
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,270
Zhen Beixing.

233
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,370
Would you date me?

234
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,870
Yes.
