187
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,870
Is the couple I ship falling apart now?

188
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,720
What happened between them?

189
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,550
I hope

190
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,630
they make up soon.

191
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,910
Sigh.

192
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,320
Have you heard, Mo?

193
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,080
Beixing and Gu Chen are arguing.

194
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,840
She is truly mad this time.

195
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,670
I texted her today

196
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,550
and she replied to me with one word only.

197
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,080
She must be very upset now.

198
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,240
What should we do?

199
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,440
It must

200
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,670
have been tough on Gu Chen too.

201
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,840
But I can assure you

202
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,960
that he is serious about Beixing.

203
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,270
I believe you.

204
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,630
But at this moment,

205
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,480
how can we help them?

206
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,630
Isn't open communication

207
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,510
the foundation of love?

208
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,270
We need to find a way to help them.

209
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,480
How?

210
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,030
I have an idea.

211
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,440
Who is the woman?

212
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,550
Is that why you approached Beixing?

213
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,030
So you've been treating Beixing

214
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,440
as a mere substitute.

215
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,840
So all this time,

216
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm just

217
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,080
a substitute.

218
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,840
If you still want to see me,

219
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,150
please keep a one-meter distance from me.

220
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,030
Beixing, hear me out.

221
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,120
Beixing,

222
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,030
can we talk?

223
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,600
There is

224
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,440
nothing we can talk about.

225
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,840
I am your boyfriend.

226
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Should we face and solve difficulties

227
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,550
together?

228
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,080
We have broken up.

229
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,240
I am not a substitute for anyone else.

230
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,150
You lied to me.

231
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,870
I can no longer trust you.

232
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,600
Beixing.

233
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,870
I can explain.

234
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,840
I don't need your explanation.

235
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,510
Just leave.

236
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
Beixing.

237
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,120
I didn't mean to lie to you.

238
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,670
I will make it up to you with my sincerity.

239
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,840
I will wait for you

240
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,910
until you're willing to let me explain.

241
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,510
Beixing.

242
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,630
I will

243
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,440
keep waiting till I explain everything to you.

244
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,510
I don't want you to be threatened by anyone else.

245
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,480
The agreement between us is terminated.

246
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,510
Beixing!

247
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,720
Beixing!

248
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,150
Beixing!

249
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,670
Beixing!

250
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,150
Beixing!
