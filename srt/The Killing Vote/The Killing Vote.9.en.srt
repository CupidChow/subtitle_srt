1
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,043
WOULD YOU LIKE TO VOTE?

2
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,060
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,353
SAFETY OF CHILD ACTORS WAS ENSURED

4
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,689
Everyone.

5
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:06,442
Gaetal isn't one person.

6
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:10,613
Anyone who wants to fight corruption
and promote justice in this world

7
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,991
can become a watchdog.

8
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,453
All of us are Gaetal.

9
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,996
CHAE DO-HEE'S KILLING VOTE SPECIAL

10
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,414
Hello.

11
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:23,959
This is The Killing Vote Special

12
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,336
and I'm your host, Chae Do-hee.

13
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:32,426
Three months ago, the Killing Vote
sent shock waves across the country.

14
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,720
And recently,
the host of the Killing Vote, Gaetal,

15
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:38,349
reaffirmed he was alive and well
in an extraordinary fashion.

16
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,518
Tonight, we're presenting
this surprise special

17
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,020
to show how he has
the nation's full support.

18
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,108
...and promote justice in this world

19
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,654
can become a watchdog.

20
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,990
All of us are Gaetal.

21
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:58,619
The moment he suggested
that all of us could be Gaetal,

22
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,580
we at SBNS knew we had to do this.

23
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:05,042
A just society is a society

24
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,671
where each and every one of us
is able to voice our opinions.

25
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,634
These are the message boards
on our network's website

26
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,053
where you can share your stories.

27
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,431
Please feel free to share
any instances of injustice or corruption

28
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:23,018
that Gaetal may have missed
for the Killing Vote.

29
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,771
The stories with the most likes

30
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,731
will be presented by me on this program.

31
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:31,485
Please keep in mind that each user account

32
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:35,281
can share and like
only one story every 24 hours.

33
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,741
The identity and credibility of sources

34
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,494
will be thoroughly vetted
before broadcasts.

35
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,248
Now, let me introduce
tonight's special guest.

36
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:45,958
Please come on out.

37
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,717
Former justices of the Supreme Court,
former Prosecutor Generals,

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,970
currently active lawyers,
and former chiefs of police.

39
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:02,016
Meet our fact checkers,
who will share their honest views

40
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,393
on truth, justice,
sentencing, and judgments.

41
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:14,111
And here's our message
to all the Gaetals who are watching this.

42
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,741
I hope you see our intentions
to become watchdogs.

43
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:23,037
And until our society achieves
rational justice,

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,247
I will stand by your side.

45
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,882
EPISODE 9

46
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,249
Drop the knife!

47
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,960
- Stay away!
- Requesting backup.

48
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,504
The suspect being transferred
has taken a hostage!

49
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,672
Some have been injured.

50
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,092
Move!

51
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:23,597
Press the button!

52
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:27,726
The suspect is moving with the hostage.

53
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,730
Lee Min-soo's first letter

54
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:33,440
is missing.

55
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,903
Where is it?

56
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,615
What was the letter about?

57
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:56,755
SUPERINTENDENT KIM MU-CHAN

58
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,301
It's Kwon Seok-joo.

59
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,265
What?

60
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,733
Calm down.

61
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,484
Let's talk it out, okay?

62
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:22,948
It's always been him.

63
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:24,992
The real Gaetal
who started the Killing Vote.

64
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,744
It's Kwon Seok-joo.

65
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,205
Kwon Seok-joo!

66
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,092
Kwon Seok-joo has escaped!

67
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,019
- Sir!
- Sir, what are you doing?

68
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,104
Move!

69
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,606
No, please don't.

70
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,622
Jung Jin-wook!

71
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,874
Plate number 7980. It's a water truck!

72
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,876
Kwon Seok-joo has escaped!
Situation room, now!

73
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,758
What's the matter, ma'am?

74
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,135
Please tell us why...

75
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,636
- Hey!
- Wait!

76
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,749
Can't you find them faster?

77
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,757
Hey, he's entering a tunnel.

78
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,759
A water truck is entering
Sanggok Tunnel from the south.

79
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:08,280
There must have been an accident. Darn it.

80
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:09,865
What's going on?

81
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,411
What are you doing?

82
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,873
Hey! Move the truck!

83
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,917
What on Earth is going on?

84
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,698
Darn it.

85
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,829
Kwon Seok-joo changed his clothes and ran.

86
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,748
Check both sides
for motorcycles that exited.

87
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,209
Motorcycles in the tunnel?

88
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,045
There were two motorcycles in the truck.
Start the search now.

89
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,922
- Okay.
- Darn it.

90
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,887
Darn it.

91
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,872
DEAR PROFESSOR KWON

92
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:43,834
Professor, how's life in there?

93
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,961
I was reading a book,

94
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,047
and I came across a part
about Joseph the tattletale.

95
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:52,968
I had a friend who was a tattletale
when I was young too.

96
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,595
But I gave this friend a second chance.

97
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,641
I carried out justice so they wouldn't be
a devil who was deemed innocent.

98
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,687
But now, I guess
they'll forever be a child

99
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,606
along with their cherished pet dog.

100
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:56,907
The Body of Christ.

101
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,351
LET'S TELL THE WORLD ABOUT THIS SIN

102
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,435
JI-HOON

103
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,031
Goodness.

104
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,867
Go get him right now.

105
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,912
You lost Kwon Seok-joo,
so I want you to bring him back!

106
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,247
I apologize, sir.

107
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,750
Well, he literally broke down
the walls of the police agency.

108
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,544
How could she have stopped that?

109
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,254
Are you siding with her?

110
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,215
If only the guard had come on time,
he wouldn't have escaped.

111
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,844
Fighting amongst ourselves
won't help us catch him.

112
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,805
Let's put out an APB on him first.

113
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,056
Excuse me?

114
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,766
How are you going to explain

115
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,269
he escaped from the police agency
and not from prison?

116
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,645
I told you if people find out

117
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,314
we took Kwon out of prison,
we'll all be hung out to dry!

118
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,525
That's why we should hurry and catch him!

119
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,902
You could lose your job
trying to save face.

120
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,738
You punk! How dare you?

121
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,242
Let's do things the right way!

122
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,707
The moment that brat Kim Mu-chan

123
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,127
steps into this room again,
you better tell me right away. Got that?

124
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,549
Hello, Warden.

125
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,551
Right. I'm terribly sorry.

126
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,555
Quiet? Yes, I made sure
everyone keeps this quiet.

127
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,018
Of course, we must catch him
as soon as possible.

128
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,229
The Commissioner is also uneasy
about this situation.

129
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,283
It's okay. We'll just catch him.

130
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,036
You can't even hail a taxi
in Korea without the internet,

131
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,622
so how dare he mess with the Cyber Bureau?

132
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,417
Jjoo, let's start by going through
Jung Jin-wook's phone again.

133
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,502
From now on...

134
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,588
This still hurts.

135
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,672
It's war.

136
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,519
Hey. How's Jung Jin-wook?

137
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,191
Surgery went well,
but he's still unconscious.

138
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,943
All right, stay with him today.

139
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,736
And get some shut-eye if you need to.

140
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,321
Call me when he wakes up.

141
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,073
- Will do, sir.
- All right.

142
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,832
Jung Jin-wook's not awake yet.

143
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,877
How could the two have communicated?
I haven't the faintest idea.

144
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,714
Nobody knew Kwon Seok-joo
was out except for our team.

145
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,508
You know none of us would ever do that.

146
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,218
That's what makes it more puzzling.

147
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:07,264
Lee was suspected to be Gaetal,
so he was going to be released anyway.

148
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,266
So why escape now?

149
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,517
Isn't it obvious?

150
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,562
He's trying to kill Lee Min-soo himself,
just as he killed Byun.

151
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,565
He's still holding grudges
about what happened eight years ago.

152
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,234
You saw how he even targeted you
on the Killing Vote.

153
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,488
In any case, just wait it out
at home for a few days.

154
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,907
The higher-ups know
it's hard to proceed without you,

155
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,200
so they'll call you back soon.

156
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,702
Kwon Seok-joo and Lee Min-soo.

157
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,537
I'll catch them both.

158
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,331
Cover for me for a few days.

159
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:37,294
I can't do it for long,
so come back soon, okay?

160
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879
You know I'm retiring soon.

161
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,992
It seems the professor's picnic is over.

162
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,962
CCTV
OPERATE, CANCEL

163
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,823
That bastard...

164
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,741
When did he join forces with Lee Min-soo?

165
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,326
Lee Min-soo?

166
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,495
Are you sure?

167
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,247
I doubt Number Five did this alone.

168
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,915
Hacking and stealing a program

169
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,793
and deleting all the data
left in the server that quickly?

170
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,169
Only experts can do that.

171
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,756
Does this mean all
of our identities will be revealed?

172
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,135
I've secured the main server on my side,
so we're pretty safe,

173
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,595
but there will have to be
many changes to our plan.

174
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,767
Right. How's Number Four?

175
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,602
He was shot and is in the hospital now.

176
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,354
I haven't heard about him since.

177
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,191
I hope the professor
can at least join us without any trouble.

178
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,654
I'll start restoring the data first.

179
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:33,678
I'm at the playground. I won't leave
until you come, so you better show up.

180
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,432
- Darn it.
- "Darn it"?

181
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,185
What? Were you guys planning to meet here?

182
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,355
I was wondering if we had a mole,

183
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:27,774
and it was you.

184
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:33,571
What about yourself?
Talk about perfect timing.

185
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,991
How come he escaped
just as you figured out he was Gaetal?

186
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,536
You just can't lose an argument, can you?

187
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,957
You see, the director's scolding
didn't hurt me at all.

188
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,542
However,

189
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,628
my anger has reached its limit for sure.

190
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,592
Did you find anything?

191
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:58,680
You knew they'd search this place first,
so you wouldn't be here without a reason.

192
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,390
There is no big reason.

193
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,894
I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss
anything for trusting him too much.

194
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,730
That's why I came.

195
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,027
Well, I'm here
because I still can't believe

196
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,321
that Lee Min-soo isn't Gaetal.

197
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:19,659
If we search his house and seize
his computers and servers now,

198
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,953
I'm sure we'd find evidence.
Don't you think so?

199
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,080
You weren't sure about him either.

200
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,834
You felt like Lee and Gaetal
weren't the same person.

201
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,210
At first, yes.

202
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,298
But you saw his reaction
when you were the Killing Vote's target.

203
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,259
Only the real Gaetal
would react like that.

204
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,770
Apparently, he was her best friend.

205
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,481
He's in every one of her drawings.

206
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,735
He was her brother, not her friend.

207
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,574
Na-rae was murdered
when Kwon was about to adopt him,

208
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,075
and the adoption never happened.

209
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,621
Kwon said they lost contact,

210
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,706
but we should look for him.

211
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,396
Hey.

212
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,442
That threatening text
was so old-fashioned.

213
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,194
"I won't leave until you come"? Seriously?

214
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,947
Then, why did you come?

215
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,575
And is it that hard to reply
to one text? Why...

216
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,166
I haven't even eaten yet.

217
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,251
If you keep hitting me,

218
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,003
you might probably kill me.

219
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,089
Jeez.

220
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,890
I'm actually really touched.

221
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,518
Hurry and take it. My arms hurt.

222
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,146
Thank you, ma'am.

223
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,107
One's for me.

224
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:23,491
JI-HOON

225
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,621
All done.

226
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,005
Hyun said I should give up too.

227
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,090
And Hye-mi said
boys who leave you on read...

228
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,343
I mean...

229
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:47,473
I was trying to reach you,
because I'm the class president.

230
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:54,355
It's been so long
since anyone's looked for me like that.

231
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,940
Who else looked for you?

232
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,192
My sister.

233
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:03,114
Wherever I went, she'd always call me.

234
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,242
Right. She actually said
the same thing too.

235
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,996
"I won't leave until you come."

236
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,165
"You said you'd go with me,
so hurry and come."

237
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:17,879
So that's why I came.

238
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:19,881
You reminded me of my sister.

239
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,092
Did your sister go somewhere?

240
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,595
Your house has been empty
the past two days.

241
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,974
- My house?
- Shinyeon Complex, Building 206, Unit 901.

242
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,188
Well...

243
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,024
We don't live together.

244
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,442
And Grandma is on a trip.

245
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,236
I see.

246
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,572
But is that place...

247
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,450
really your house?

248
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:50,953
Yeah.

249
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,331
But...

250
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,791
we're moving soon.

251
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,752
So from now on,

252
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,545
stop waiting for me here.

253
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:02,298
Fine.

254
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,686
Ji-hoon, your house...

255
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:24,904
Sorry, but I have to go.

256
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,991
My father's here to pick me up.

257
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,998
I'm really sorry.

258
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,963
What's wrong with him?

259
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,855
How have you been?

260
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,445
How do you find out
where someone actually lives?

261
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:09,031
Are you trying to find out
where your teacher lives?

262
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,950
Kim Ji-hoon.

263
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,285
Ji-hoon?

264
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,287
Did he receive his counseling?

265
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,790
The police even came to our school,
because his address was wrong.

266
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,711
They said no one lives at the address
registered in the school records.

267
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,546
No one's ever lived there.

268
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,048
Why don't you ask him yourself?

269
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,260
We at SBNS...

270
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,596
When I was just about to ask,

271
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,515
he left with his dad.

272
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,975
Dad?

273
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,685
Didn't he say his parents passed away...

274
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,270
Maybe they're divorced.

275
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:42,273
He's acting suspicious, isn't he?
It's like he's hiding something.

276
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,608
Just focus on your studies.

277
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,818
And if you ditch
because I'm too busy to pick you up,

278
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:46,944
you're dead meat.

279
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,697
Whatever.

280
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:56,537
And here's our message
to all the Gaetals who are watching this.

281
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:01,375
I hope you see our intentions
to become watchdogs.

282
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,504
And until our society achieves
rational justice,

283
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,215
I will stand by your side.

284
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,739
I'm so sorry.

285
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,158
I should've made sure
security was tighter.

286
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,954
He had it all planned out,
so how could you stop him by yourself?

287
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,707
He was always a little off.

288
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,293
I should've watched him more closely.

289
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,671
This is no one's fault.

290
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,881
We just chose the wrong person
from the start.

291
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,718
He must've leaked information,
so let's close this place down.

292
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:54,470
What about Number Three?

293
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,556
We can't be sure Number Three
won't act like Number Five either.

294
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,310
We know each other very well,
but you said he's a bit different.

295
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,105
He would never turn against us.

296
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,774
We go back a long way.

297
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,319
And at this moment, his position
could be more valuable than anything else.

298
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,198
We must trust him.

299
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,784
Let's go home first.

300
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,912
We need to move fast before the police
goes public with their pursuit.

301
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,464
It must have been so tough.

302
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,717
I'm so sorry.

303
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,343
This time...

304
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,972
let's catch him at all cost.

305
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,565
We will.

306
00:26:54,113 --> 00:27:00,202
POLICE BRUTALITY, EVIDENCE FORGERY
THE FOURTH KILLING VOTE: KIM MU-CHAN

307
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,287
This is insane!

308
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,374
It's even better than I expected.

309
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,044
The speed, the system...

310
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,795
I love everything about this program.

311
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,633
That Number One guy made this,
but you really don't know who he is?

312
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:17,053
I told you I've never met him in person.

313
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,307
I used to think that maybe
they all knew each other except me,

314
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,185
but now, I don't even care.

315
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:27,646
Darn it.

316
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,650
Where's the hideout?

317
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,447
You have to keep your promise
if you want to see what I know.

318
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,367
Money and revenge.

319
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:50,002
Just lie low, okay?
And don't use the internet.

320
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:53,089
The second you leave a trace,
they'll come find you.

321
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,674
Don't let your guard down, okay?

322
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:04,141
MOM:
KWON SEOK-JOO ESCAPED

323
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,731
My dear professor must be so angry.

324
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,865
Min, did you watch Chae Do-hee's show?

325
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,202
I've been staying up all night
reading all the comments.

326
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,413
Do you think
Gaetal's really watching this show?

327
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,748
It would be awesome
if this is the next vote.

328
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,209
A DRUNK DRIVER KILLED MY PARENTS

329
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,335
SAVE

330
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,257
Looks like you're a little late, sir.

331
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,092
Ji-hoon?

332
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,761
Right?

333
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:42,138
How are you this morning?

334
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:46,142
You're scaring the students.

335
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,310
This is incredibly rude.

336
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,729
Mr. Lee Yun-seong.

337
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:54,567
"Without being detained"
doesn't mean you're innocent.

338
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,943
It's still our duty

339
00:28:56,026 --> 00:29:00,739
to keep an eye on you as a murder suspect.

340
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,534
We must protect the students too.

341
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,996
You're saying you're here
to protect my students from me?

342
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,749
Mr. Lee, can we talk later?

343
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:52,958
All right.

344
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,435
It was convenient to play hooky
while I wasn't around, right?

345
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,689
I'm sorry. I needed some time off.

346
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,900
Attendance is important
for college admissions,

347
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,027
so I'll record it as sick leave for you.

348
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,738
Submit the sick leave request
with proof by tomorrow.

349
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,906
Yes, sir.

350
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,121
By the way, did you move?

351
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,292
The police came by school
and said you didn't live there.

352
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:37,461
Min didn't know where you lived either,

353
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,880
so the police officer came for nothing.

354
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,591
Min...

355
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:44,969
met with a police officer?

356
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,887
The police officer said

357
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:50,224
Min's sister made a request
for you to receive counseling.

358
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:54,019
Are you and Min's sister close?

359
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,648
Ji-hoon.

360
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:58,732
Yes?

361
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,073
Thank you.

362
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,086
I watched the first episode.

363
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,713
FAMILY COMMITS SUICIDE
DUE TO REAL ESTATE SCAM

364
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,965
The show's ratings were ranked first.

365
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,926
It's a smooth start.
Now, it's time to kick it into high gear.

366
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,389
I've emailed you the stories
and instructions for the next episode,

367
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,558
so use them when you prepare the show.

368
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:37,354
The case of a family's suicide
after a real estate scam.

369
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,398
Don't make this awkward.

370
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,192
You gave me the cue sheet,
so let me handle the rest.

You can't fabricate the content
of TV shows these days, you know.

If we get caught for manipulation,

Ms. Chae. Two years ago,

376
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,629
you made your way up the ranks
after exclusively covering news on me.

377
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:05,674
I've always wondered why
you never had any big stories since.

378
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,885
But now, I can see why.

379
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,512
You're not too bright.

380
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,933
Should I pretend I didn't hear that

381
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,185
or was it your mistake?

382
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:25,944
I'm saying while you may see
one step ahead, I see the bigger picture.

383
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:31,325

389
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,435
Hello?

390
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,193
KIM MU-CHAN

391
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,827
Well, look who's calling.

392
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,453
What's up?

393
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,539
Do you need me?

394
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:25,546
We need to put out an APB on him
and search every corner.

395
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,172
We don't have time for this.

396
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,176
Right. A public search can't be official.

397
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:32,761
If people find out

398
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:35,681
the cops got help from a prisoner,
it would be embarrassing.

399
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,100
It turns out Kwon Seok-joo

400
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:41,019
got a lot of special treatment.

401
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:44,440
Since when are prisoners in this country

402
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,693
allowed to have this in their cells?

403
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:49,528
It looks very dangerous.

404
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,239
Look here.

405
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:58,370
Those jailhouse lawyers like Inmate 0512

406
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:02,332
trade their legal smarts
to live the good life behind bars.

407
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,501
You know nothing.

408
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:06,253
If he received such good treatment,

409
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,132
then it must mean Inmate 0512
had a client with high status.

410
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,217
A guard?

411
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:13,594
No.

412
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:14,928
The warden.

413
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,229
You sure do talk like a jerk.

414
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,485
Come on.

415
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:33,071
Police investigations
always begin with suspicions.

416
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:34,364
Guards, the warden...

417
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,366
Everyone in this prison is a suspect.

418
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,328
- Suspect?
- Yes, a suspect.

419
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,079
We're going to start the investigation

420
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:44,875
assuming that everyone in this prison
is Kwon's potential communication link.

421
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,293
First off,

422
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,047
we need to meet his doctor.

423
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,049
He was getting regular check-ups.

424
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,595
She happens to be off today.

425
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,348
The suspect, I mean.

426
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,144
That no good...

427
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,985
She isn't stationed in the prison.

428
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,196
She comes twice a week as a volunteer.

429
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,989
Yang Hye-jin.

430
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,075
Yang Hye-jin?

431
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,244
PERSONAL INFORMATION
YANG HYE-JIN

432
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,079
Dr. Yang from Saehyeon Hospital?

433
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,289
Do you know her?

434
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,302
That's Tae-yang.

435
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,263
Of course, I remember him.

436
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,765
He was such a smart kid.

437
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:45,853
We're looking for Professor Kwon Seok-joo.
He wanted to adopt Kim Tae-yang.

438
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,272
Do you remember Professor Kwon?

439
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,398
Of course.

440
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,943
He visited here often with his daughter.
He made a lot of donations too.

441
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:58,031
And when he said he wanted
to adopt Tae-yang despite his illness,

442
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:00,409
I was so grateful.

443
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,119
I never knew he was ill.

444
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:06,540
Tae-yang witnessed his parents' deaths.

445
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,958
When he first came here,

446
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:13,088
he had been decimated by shock and anger.

447
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,465
He couldn't speak.

448
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,598
Could I meet him?

449
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,684
Luckily, he was adopted by a great family.

450
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:30,439
And I don't want to remind him
of what happened then.

451
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,364
JOO HYUN

452
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,035
I searched Kwon Seok-joo's room,

453
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,912
but there were no traces of him.

454
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,705
Nothing about the accomplices either.

455
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,125
How did he communicate with them
and direct the Killing Vote?

456
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,628
I'm sure he is
even with the accomplices now.

457
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,171
It's obvious where escaped convicts hide.

458
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:57,674
They go to their families, friends,
lovers, or their prison friends.

459
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,886
Have you looked into
any of his acquaintances?

460
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:01,970
Speaking of which,

461
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,556
remember Kwon was suffering
from a collapsed lung?

462
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,351
The doctor
who's been treating him for years

463
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:12,147
turned out to be the grandmother
of the boy that Captain Oh took hostage.

464
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,982
Dr. Yang Hye-jin from Saehyeon Hospital.

465
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:17,819
A doctor and a patient. The guard said
it was nothing more than that.

466
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,781
But it's too suspicious
to consider as a coincidence.

467
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,283
Out of all hospitals,
it's Saehyeon Hospital?

468
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,953
Too many coincidences
mean it's not a coincidence.

469
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,913
Does it apply to investigations too?

470
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:32,209
The grandmother is Kwon's doctor,
and the grandson is Lee's student.

471
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,631
Like you said,
it's too much of a coincidence.

472
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,968
- I'll go meet her.
- Okay.

473
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:42,928
Jo-dan is trying
to figure out her address.

474
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,389
What?

475
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,598
I've got to go.

476
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,225
What's she doing here?

477
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:51,728
An inmate serving time escaped
while helping police in an investigation.

478
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:53,814
The inmate's name is Kwon Seok-joo.

479
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:57,859
A heinous criminal who exacted revenge
eight years ago on the suspect acquitted

480
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,028
for the abduction
and murder of his daughter.

481
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,613
According to our sources,

482
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:04,658
Kwon had been staying here
at Nambu Police Agency

483
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,952
as a major witness and advisor
for a recent case.

484
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:11,248
For allowing a criminal to reside
at the police agency in return for help

485
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:16,086
and for helping him escape, the police
are expected to face severe criticism.

486
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,255
Hey, it's unfair to put it like that.

487
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:19,756
She's making this harder for us.

488
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,551
I know. But how did they find out?

489
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,928
The commissioner told us
to keep our mouths shut.

490
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:28,223
Exactly. Is one of us leaking information?

491
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,851
Whether we leak information or not,

492
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,395
they'll always find a way
to get what they want.

493
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,523
What's out is already out,
so let's focus on finding Kwon.

494
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:39,860
Have you found any family members
he might have gone to?

495
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,614
- Hey, Cyber Bureau.
- Yes?

496
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,617
Right. Yes.

497
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,831
All his family members
either live abroad or have passed away.

498
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:56,293
So I'm looking into the inmates
he shared sentence periods with.

499
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:59,004
And I'm waiting for a response
from the KCS.

500
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,048
And as for his friends,

501
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:02,299
it's like a desert.

502
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,843
He has zero friends, like me.

503
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,094
GAETAL NUMBER ONE
ARE YOU READY?

504
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,679
I suddenly feel upset.

505
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:09,097
Good work. See you later.

506
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,351
Wait. Hold on!

507
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,187
Wait!

508
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,980
Hey, get out of the car!

509
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:18,565
That little...

510
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,233
Darn it!

511
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,915
I'm Kim Mu-chan from Nambu Police Agency.

512
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,585
The warden must've called you.

513
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,378
Yes, he did.

514
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:43,256
But I don't feel comfortable
with such unexpected visits at this hour.

515
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,966
Let's meet somewhere else on another day.

516
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,722
I want to say hi to Ji-hoon.

517
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:53,934
Do you know Ji-hoon?

518
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:57,312
Well, I'm the one who saved Ji-hoon
at the incident in Saehyeon Hospital.

519
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,481
I wanted to check on him,

520
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,025
but I've been too busy
with this case I'm working on.

521
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,403
Could we have a moment to talk?

522
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:07,239
This is very urgent.

523
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,176
Have a seat.

524
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:29,845
Thank you.

525
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,641
As you've probably heard,
we're after an escaped inmate.

526
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:35,976
Inmate 0512.

527
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,104
He's had a collapsed lung for a while.

528
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,773
Do you think there's a chance
he'll stop by at a hospital?

529
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:45,068
He managed his own condition well.

530
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,070
Unless his condition worsens,

531
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:49,072
I doubt he'll go to the hospital.

532
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:53,410
All his family members live abroad.

533
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,954
Has he ever said anything
about who he wanted to meet

534
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,123
or where he wanted to go
when he was released?

535
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:01,459
He barely talked about himself.

536
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:02,961
Rather, he asked me questions.

537
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,714
He'd ask about my grandson, for example.

538
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:10,677
He also asked how high school students
study and what they do for fun these days.

539
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,680
Why was he interested in Ji-hoon?

540
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:14,890
Well...

541
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,518
Was it Na-rae?

542
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:19,644
His daughter's name.

543
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:25,358
I assumed the reason was
if she were still alive, she'd be his age.

544
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:32,699
Having a private conversation
with an inmate isn't as easy as you think.

545
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:36,203
I see.

546
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,788
Thank you for your cooperation.

547
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:42,083
If Inmate 0512 ever contacts you
or shows up, please let me know.

548
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,502
You must not meet him alone.

549
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,254
Okay.

550
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,011
Is Ji-hoon's room upstairs?

551
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:55,847
Ji-hoon.

552
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:58,016
What do you think you're doing?

553
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,684
I told you Ji-hoon isn't home!

554
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:00,977
Please come back down here!

555
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:04,022
What is the meaning of this?

556
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,072
It would've been nice to see him.
What a shame.

557
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:16,993
He finishes school at 10 p.m.

558
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:18,662
I'll tell him you said hi.

559
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,039
Okay. Thank you.

560
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,615
I was so nervous.

561
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:58,410
Do you think we're all right?

562
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,621
Yes, you did well,
just as we talked about.

563
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,833
Thank goodness
you prepared me for this situation.

564
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:10,630
By the way, that detective
seemed to know a lot about you.

565
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:12,924
Is he Number Three, by any chance?

566
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,783
YANG HYE-JIN

00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,251
Hi, Jin-soo.

570
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:51,629
We need to gather more information
about Dr. Yang from Cheongnang.

INMATE KWON ESCAPES FROM CHEONGNANG PRISON

574
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,102
Oh, no.

575
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:07,645
What's taking so long to catch him?

576
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,898
They need to catch him quick.

577
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,741
- What's the government doing?
- I'm so scared.

578
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:20,825
Me too.

579
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:22,660
Where could he be?

580
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,413
- I'm scared.
- I can't even go out anymore.

581
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,751
ASSUMED TO BE IN HIDING IN SEOUL

582
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,441
Hey!

583
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:57,362
Hey, Kim Mu-chan!

584
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,864
Hey, Director.

585
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:01,157
Yes, Commissioner.

586
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:05,412
Sang-jae.

587
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,163
I hear you have a new captain now.

588
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:08,248
Captain Kwon Seok-joo.

589
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,335
That's not cool.

590
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:14,671
How dare you glare
at your superior officer like that?

591
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:18,758
I knew this would happen
when I saw them form a team of jalopies.

592
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:22,512
How could you take investigation lessons
from a criminal? How embarrassing.

593
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:23,847
What the...

594
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,182
Even jalopies can run you down.

595
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:29,519
"What the"?
Is that how you talk to your colleagues?

596
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,271
What a scumbag.

597
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:32,647
I'm sorry, sir.

598
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,731
Let's go.

599
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:40,405
- How's Jung doing?
- He's still unconscious.

600
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:43,783
The doctor suggests it might be
psychological rather than physical.

601
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:46,411
Sir.

602
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,329
You really didn't take long.

603
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,291
We decided to put out an APB on Kwon.

604
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:52,959
Any luck with the plates?

605
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:56,171
We checked shops and found
a few motorcycles with changed plates.

606
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,006
But we've yet to identify the drivers.

607
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,341
Now, we have to comb through
all the CCTV footage.

608
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:02,594
And that's right up this team's alley.

609
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:05,930
I like this clear distribution of tasks.

610
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:08,433
As for Lee Min-soo,
should we halt the investigation?

611
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,602
He's still the prime suspect
in Jovovich's murder.

612
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,353
We'll continue to monitor him closely.

613
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:16,816
CYBER BUREAU

614
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:18,485
Where's the Cyber Bureau team?

615
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,375
Stop that. You look suspicious.

616
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,002
What? Fine.

617
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,338
Are you sure we can do this?

618
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:40,548
Come on. You saw Chae Do-hee's show too.

619
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:43,051
There's a mole in our team.
I'm sure of it.

620
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,386
No one can know about this
until the superintendent returns.

621
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,971
Are the time and location correct?

622
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:49,140
GAETAL NUMBER ONE
AT 5:00 P.M., APRIL 20 INJEONG PARK

623
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:50,266
Okay.

624
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:56,022
This is brilliant. I didn't think
of online communities of high schoolers.

625
00:46:57,106 --> 00:47:01,152
Gaetal Number One must be the jerk
who posted stuff to instigate people.

626
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,820
The system administrator.

627
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,323
Dragging kids into this is
crossing the line.

628
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,325
I think we're the ones crossing the line.

629
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:08,701
Who'd think we were teenagers?

630
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:10,119
Then, keep your head down.

631
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:11,204
That's what I mean.

632
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,834
- Jjoo, he's here.
- He is?

633
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:17,961
GAETAL NUMBER ONE
WHERE ARE YOU?

634
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,256
IN A BLUE SCHOOL UNIFORM ON A BENCH

635
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:31,224
What?

636
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,309
She's...

637
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:35,311
You... Hey.

638
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:38,606
Wait! Stop!

639
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:42,318
Hey, aren't you Min's friend?

640
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:44,821
What are you doing? I don't know anything.

641
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,030
Just a second.

642
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:48,408
GAETAL NUMBER ONE

643
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,243
It's her.

644
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,037
Are you really Gaetal Number One?

645
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,039
I'm just...

646
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,541
a fan.

647
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,295
- What?
- Number One asked me to come here.

648
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:08,803
SEE YOU WHEN THE WEATHER IS NICE

649
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,430
Darn it.

650
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:12,015
Wait.

651
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:14,058
BENCH, BLUE UNIFORM, DISGUISE

652
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:15,476
Jjoo.

653
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:18,354
This bastard has been watching us.

654
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:54,849
The message has been delivered.

655
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:57,435
Do you think they'll get the message?

656
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,646
I'm sure Joo Hyun will.

657
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:02,690
There's probably no way
we can get the program back, right?

658
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:04,275
Voting day is drawing near,

659
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:06,361
and we don't know
who will be the next target.

660
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:08,529
Lee's abusing it for his own good,

661
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,698
so it's better to get rid of it quickly.

662
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:18,539
SEE YOU WHEN THE WEATHER IS NICE

663
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:29,592
Just give up already.

664
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:31,886
He made a complete fool out of us.

665
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:35,556
It just bothers me how much effort
he put into making fools out of us.

666
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,475
Why did he bother to send this message?

667
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:41,145
I guess he wants to go
on a date with you on a nice day.

668
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:43,147
Go ahead then, Gaetal. Go ahead!

669
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:46,359
It's the weather that's nice, not the day.

670
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:49,112
Today's weather was nice too.

671
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:51,781
Nice weather...

672
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,826
What's the weather like this week?

673
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,831
Even these gloves
are making a fool out of me.

674
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,207
TODAY'S WEATHER

675
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,959
TODAY'S WEATHER IS NICE

676
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:07,296
Hey, see if there's a weather app
on Jung Jin-wook's phone.

677
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:09,841
Okay.

678
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,517
I don't see anything special.

679
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:27,650
APPS

680
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,030
What?

681
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:34,407
WEATHER APP
WEATHER APP

682
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,036
I found it!

683
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,913
You startled me.

684
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,709
- What is it?
- What?

685
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:46,711
I found it!

686
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:51,174
The secret behind Gaetal's message.

687
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:53,593
WEATHER APP
WEATHER APP

688
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,100
Hello, everyone.

689
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:03,519
This is The Killing Vote Special.
I'm your host, Chae Do-hee.

690
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:07,273
After announcing we'd accept stories,
we were flooded with submissions.

691
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:11,611
Among the numerous heartbreaking
and infuriating stories of the past week,

692
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:15,656
we'll reveal the story
that received the most likes.

693
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:20,411
Land? Is this from a reliable source?

694
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:23,206
It's slated to be taken out
of the greenbelt zone for development.

695
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,958
You know my cousin works
for the Ministry of Land, right?

696
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:29,796
This is strictly confidential.
Just invest 300 million won.

697
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:32,507
Well, it hasn't even been decided yet.

698
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,008
Forget it, then.

699
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,011
Once this land is developed,
you'll hit the jackpot.

700
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,846
Don't you want to turn your life around?

701
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:43,267
"Turn your life around."
These words changed his mind.

702
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:45,853
Only after taking out
hundreds of millions in loans

703
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:50,691
and being sued by numerous victims
of the real estate scam did he realize...

704
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:53,945
that he was registered
as the chairman of a real estate agency.

705
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:56,489
Some higher-up in the back
was looking for you.

706
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:57,865
Legally, in a situation like this...

707
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:59,492
Okay. Thanks.

708
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,327
We're with the special investigation unit.

709
00:52:02,078 --> 00:52:03,079
I'm Lieutenant Joo Hyun.

710
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:05,373
- What's going on?
- Go and see what's going on!

711
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,460
What are you doing?

712
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:11,963
We, the police, will now show you

713
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:15,216
the truth behind Gaetal
and the Killing Vote.

714
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,260
If you're watching this show,

715
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,720
please take a look
at the apps on your smartphones.

716
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:27,812
Normally, you cannot download
the same app twice on your smartphone.

717
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:31,524
But look. There are two weather apps.

718
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:33,067
WEATHER APP
WEATHER APP

719
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,193
She's right.

720
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,362
Goodness, she's right.

721
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,365
One of them is the hidden app

722
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:42,034
that Gaetal installed
by illegally hacking your phones.

723
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:57,884
Default apps like weather and map apps
are typically set for auto-updates.

724
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:00,887
Gaetal used that to intrude
into your most private spaces.

725
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:05,141
- Delete it.
- Gaetal hacked everyone's smartphones,

726
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,101
installed an invisible malicious program,

727
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,229
and used all of us
to justify his serial murders.

728
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:11,814
That is Gaetal.

729
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:13,858
No more,

730
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:15,818
no less.

731
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:19,989
I'm going to kill him!

732
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,241
Damn it, I'm going to kill him!

733
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:24,076
I'm going to kill them all!

734
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,078
Please calm down.

735
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,209
Yun-seong!

736
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:33,878
Calm down.

737
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:36,797
Keep it together and breathe.

738
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:38,382
Breathe.

739
00:53:40,635 --> 00:53:41,636
Yun-seong.

740
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,388
You don't need to be mad.

741
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:45,556
This isn't over yet.

742
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,103
Honey.

743
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:57,777
When humans commit crimes together,

744
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,403
they never forget
that feeling of exhilaration.

745
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,616
Just trust me and watch.

746
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,327
To the public,

747
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:08,454
justice is merely a fantasy.

748
00:54:24,637 --> 00:54:26,973
I told you my arresting skills
have improved.

749
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:29,433
You ruined my show. I'm going to sue you.

750
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:31,060
You're the one who started this.

751
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:33,145
Forcing this stupid show
to air may have been fine,

752
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:36,440
but revealing confidential case details
to screw us crossed the line.

753
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,025
Wake up!

754
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:42,613
Your show has nothing to do with justice.
It's just a contract killing show.

755
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:44,240
Is there no teamwork on your team?

756
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,450
If you want deceive,
at least get your stories straight.

757
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,285
What are you talking about?

758
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,539
I didn't find this out myself.
You told me.

759
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:56,419
This is why people
call you pigs, not police.

760
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,045
Think about it.

761
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:00,297
Who would be good at this?

762
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:20,776
Hyun.

763
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,201
What are you doing? We have to hurry back.

764
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:39,295
Were you really the one
who tipped them off about Kwon's escape?

765
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,632
Yes.

766
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:46,177
That was the fastest way
for me to get back to work.

767
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:51,140
Do you have any idea
how much criticism fell on us after that?

768
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,808
That criticism

769
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:56,979
will be gone once we catch Kwon
and end the Killing Vote. If you bear it--

770
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:59,523
Then, how is that
any different from Chae Do-hee

771
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,859
and that crazy show
pretending to be for justice?

772
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:04,528
You've been planting evidence
to catch criminals

773
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:07,031
and leaking information
to screw over your own team.

774
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:10,534
To me, that's not what
a good cop would ever do.

775
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:13,788
A righteous but incompetent cop
or a bad competent one?

776
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:15,998
Who do we need more?

777
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,919
Being a cop is not just about honor.

778
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,378
Fine!

779
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:23,631
Let's say you're right.

780
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:24,882
But still,

781
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:28,469
I don't want to be your pawn.

782
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:32,348
I'm going back to my original team.

783
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:38,104
Kwon Seok-joo may be Gaetal,

784
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,857
but we didn't have to make him
look like an evil felon.

785
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,444
You're a total disappointment.

786
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:50,116
Don't you think
of starting your own investigation.

787
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:51,700
Don't you dare!

788
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:04,004
WEATHER APP
WEATHER APP

789
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,466
It's surging again.

790
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,469
He's using enough electricity
for the entire town.

791
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:11,929
Gosh, this is electrifying.

792
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,183
Everyone must be
frantically looking for Kwon.

793
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:18,602
I feel bad that we're doing this here.

794
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:19,895
Jjoo.

795
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:21,730
Are you sure you want to do this alone?

796
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,192
There's a reason why Gaetal
gave us a hint about the weather app.

797
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:28,821
If he told the police
about his secret for nothing,

798
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:31,115
then that means
it wasn't a secret anymore.

799
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:34,076
He told us about the secret for...

800
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,370
Put it into simple words, please?

801
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:38,789
Gaetal's having problems within his team.

802
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,293
For instance, the system administrator
lost the entire system,

803
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,837
or they're having internal strife.

804
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:47,882
Are you saying
Kwon Seok-joo might have lost

805
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:51,218
his control over the Killing Vote
to Lee Min-soo?

806
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:53,762
Then, his reason for escaping makes sense.

807
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,097
Right?

808
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:56,182
So that's why

809
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,767
I have to look into
Lee Min-soo's computer.

810
00:57:58,851 --> 00:57:59,977
No.

811
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,189
There's no way you can do that.
His place has airtight security.

812
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:04,398
No way.

813
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:08,819
Jeez. None of these people
deleted the app.

814
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:10,946
Goodness, nothing has changed.

815
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:14,783
It's so fun that they'd risk
leaking their personal data.

816
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:17,203
They can basically kill a person
with one click.

817
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,121
Everyone's gone crazy.

818
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:20,831
Yes, so it seems.

819
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:25,419
I BELIEVE THE VOTE WILL HAPPEN

820
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,712
WOULD YOU LIKE TO START THE KILLING VOTE?

821
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:29,256
Hello, my fellow citizens.

822
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,967
I am well aware
of your loss of faith in me

823
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:36,931
after the unfortunate incident
that took place recently.

824
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,225
I'll keep it short.

825
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:42,645
I still believe

826
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,855
that we are working together

827
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:47,566
to monitor and uphold justice.

828
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:54,198
Therefore, I will take your appeals
from the TV show seriously.

829
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:56,242
Bang Chun-sik.

830
00:58:56,867 --> 00:59:00,955
His real estate scam destroyed
numerous families.

831
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,041
A family crushed by debt and litigation
was pushed to commit suicide

832
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,293
because of this con artist.

833
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,421
Will you choose to execute him? Yes?

834
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:11,840
Or no?

835
00:59:11,924 --> 00:59:17,388
Now, let the Killing Vote
on Bang Chun-sik begin.

836
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:30,985
Maximum transaction value.

837
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,194
And...

838
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:33,279
confirm.

839
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,489
Transaction complete.

840
00:59:36,824 --> 00:59:38,325
Don't be mad, my friend.

841
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:41,662
Cryptocurrency prices have plummeted,
so I added just a little interest.

842
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:52,965
Fine. I did pretend to be a victim too.

843
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,758
I sold the land knowing everything.

844
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:58,887
But you didn't have to put all the blame
on me and send me to prison.

845
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,807
My wife and child died because of that.

846
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,350
You scumbag.

847
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:09,273
Five.

848
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,566
Four.

849
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:12,568
Three. Two.

850
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:13,736
One.

851
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:16,572
Ta-da!

852
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:17,698
EXECUTE: 53%

853
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:29,877
Hold on.

854
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:32,713
Darn it.

855
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:51,523
It's him, Bang Chun-sik.

856
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:55,903
The participation rate didn't drop much.

857
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:59,281
The people who deleted the app
were less than we thought.

858
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:00,741
How is this possible?

859
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:03,660
Murder has already become
like a game to them.

860
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:06,455
Let's first compile a list
of those Bang has scammed.

861
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:08,707
We'll start with the family
who committed suicide.

862
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,925
We're living in such convenient times.

863
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:21,387
KWON SEOK-JOO, JUNG JIN-WOOK, LEE MIN-SOO

864
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,056
Kwon Seok-joo, Jung Jin-wook, Lee Min-soo.

865
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,185
Let me add Ko Dong-gyu here.

866
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,603
Ko Dong-gyu.

867
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,563
- Ko Dong-gyu?
- Why over Lee Min-soo?

868
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:34,358
Lee Min-soo isn't Gaetal.

869
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:38,320
KO DONG-GYU

870
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,656
Done.

871
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:49,331
YANG HYE-JIN?

872
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:57,089
Gosh, it's not breathing at all.
Come on, breathe.

873
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:59,341
The router isn't routing at all.

874
01:01:59,425 --> 01:02:00,843
It must be frustrated.

875
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,761
I'll do my best to fix this.

876
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:04,471
Excuse me, ma'am.

877
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:07,099
Is there only one router here?

878
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:10,060
There must be another one upstairs.

879
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:13,105
I'm not sure if there's one
in their son's bedroom.

880
01:02:14,273 --> 01:02:17,359
You see, someone crashed
into a utility pole nearby,

881
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:19,945
so the entire neighborhood
lost internet connection.

882
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:24,533
Since you're using a lot of electricity

883
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:27,035
and have an expensive internet plan,

884
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,580
there must be something upstairs too.

885
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,166
I'm not allowed
into their son's bedroom either.

886
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,543
Please get it done
before my boss's family returns.

887
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:36,712
Okay.

888
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,344
Connect to the internet in ten.

889
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:46,388
- To do what?
- Just trust me.

890
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,975
Don't!

891
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:58,108
Jjoo, I got it.

892
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:00,319
It's working now.

893
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:03,864
- It's working.
- By the way,

894
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:07,034
could I have a glass of water
before we leave?

895
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,077
One second, please.

896
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:30,349
What? What's wrong?

897
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,975
My partner? She already left.

898
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:35,062
She's so busy. She kept getting calls
from other households.

899
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:36,396
I see.

900
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,690
Thank you.
I will happily drink this water.

901
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,571
Is this water expensive?

902
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,784
Since it's expensive,
I'll have another glass. Thank you.

903
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:02,047
What's all this?

904
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:16,019
How can he use
such an expensive security program

905
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,522
without any ethernet sockets in the room?

906
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:20,691
I don't even see a router.

907
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:25,904
And there are so many IPs here.
What's going on here?

908
01:04:25,988 --> 01:04:27,489
Maybe he has separate room for it.

909
01:04:27,573 --> 01:04:28,615
Like a study.

910
01:04:29,408 --> 01:04:31,326
The housekeeper never mentioned that.

911
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:35,372
Darn it.

912
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:22,878
Weird.

913
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:49,946
What is this?

914
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,202
There's something here.

915
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:02,626
Have a good day.

916
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,503
Have a good day, sir.

917
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:07,631
- Have a good day.
- You too. Bye.

918
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:28,944
What a weirdo.

919
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:04,271
I got you now.

920
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:08,442
SCANNING IRIS

921
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,289
Where's the computer tower?

922
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:24,708
There it is.

923
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,560
PASSWORD COMBINER

924
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,084
I got it.

925
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:33,068
I'm on my way home.
Almost there. What about you, Mom?

926
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,166
MOVING FILES

927
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:49,376
What?

928
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,086
He locked the videos.

929
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,921
I can't save or copy them.

930
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:55,465
Even though you're using his account?

931
01:08:55,549 --> 01:08:57,384
Try changing the security settings.

932
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:00,220
There are too many things to copy.

933
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:02,305
I think I'll need more storage space.

934
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,309
I need more storage space.

935
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:08,645
Darn it.

936
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:17,863
Wait.

937
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,449
No.

938
01:09:22,576 --> 01:09:24,160
The door's closed!

939
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,679
Damn it!

940
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:44,180
The door's closed.

941
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:45,891
I'm locked in here!

942
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:47,392
What do we do?

943
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:49,019
I told you not to go in there.

944
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:50,395
Gosh!

945
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,070
First, calm down. Okay? Calm down and...

946
01:09:59,154 --> 01:10:01,114
- Wait, I need to calm down.
- What do I do?

947
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,532
Let's stay calm.

948
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:11,207
There's got to be something here.

949
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:19,132
You've got to be kidding me.

950
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,134
FUN FOLDER

951
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:24,304
What's this?

952
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:26,306
FUN FUN FILE

953
01:10:44,491 --> 01:10:48,870
Dad, I miss you.

954
01:11:53,852 --> 01:11:55,520
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Damn it.

955
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:57,313
Na-rae, you're so pretty.

956
01:11:57,397 --> 01:12:00,400
Isn't it fun to play with me?

957
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:02,652
- Where did you get this?
- It was all Lee's doing.

958
01:12:02,736 --> 01:12:04,487
Kwon had to escape,

959
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:06,114
because the vote was stolen?

960
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:07,949
I'm Gaetal.

961
01:12:08,033 --> 01:12:10,577
How about we make
the show together this time?

962
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:14,539
One week from now,
there will be another vote.

963
