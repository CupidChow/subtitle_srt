CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,312

00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:05,524
EPISODE 5

6
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,907
I didn't know the air
was so fresh in the morning.

7
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:03,457
Is Officer Park coming with you?

8
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,001
It's a felon we're releasing here.

9
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:08,754
I need to monitor him
so he won't try anything.

10
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,215
Did you bring it?

11
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:13,926
Hey.

12
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,302
Have you put this on anyone before?

13
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,012
It can't be too hard.

14
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:21,141
You are one fearless lady.

15
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,812
At least you brought the newest model.

16
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,814
This can be linked to your smart watch.

17
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,399
If it goes out of monitoring range,

18
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,484
it'll immediately notify
the control center.

19
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,237
And an APB will be put out.

20
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:39,618
For making sure a murderer
can't roam around freely,

21
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:42,162
this is the perfect device.

22
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,960
Just because you're being released

23
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,170
doesn't mean you're special,
so don't be mistaken,

24
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,797
- you damn murderer--
- We should hurry.

25
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,174
To avoid the reporters,

26
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,719
We need to arrive at the NPA
early in the morning.

27
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:59,346
Fine. Let's go.

28
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,142
Let's go catch the bad guy
who's worse than this bad guy.

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,441
Let's go.

30
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,799
What's up, Sang-jae?

31
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,092
Hello, sir.

32
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:20,886
Did you check the angles?

33
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,179
We're doing that right now.

34
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,857
Darn it. I spilled.

35
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,195
Could you move your face away?
You'll break the lens.

36
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,155
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT

37
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,037
Right. Turning the volume up.

38
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:50,874
Where's Kwon Seok-joo?

39
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,508
KWON SEOK-JOO'S REAL-TIME LOCATION

40
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,843
We're getting his signal.

41
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,553
And the same location is being sent

42
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,639
to the smartwatch
Lieutenant Joo Hyun is wearing.

43
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,812
You little punk.

44
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,647
Hey, Cyber Bureau guy.

45
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,482
Hey!

46
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,099
JO-DAN: ALL SET

47
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:01,737
Hello?

48
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,155
Is everything going all right?

49
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,157
No reporters following us
or witnesses so far.

50
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,867
I think we're good.

51
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,411
Some people
might still recognize Kwon Seok-joo.

52
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,080
Stay alert until you arrive.

53
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,458
Will he spend
the next seven years in prison,

54
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,086
or will he watch the sunrise
every morning outside?

55
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,629
It'll be up to him.

56
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,135
Anyway, don't worry.

57
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,179
I'll keep a close eye on him.

58
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,106
Sang-jae.

59
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,732
Check the cameras in the corridor too.

60
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,442
Yes, sir.

61
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,409
Oh, there he is.

62
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,743
Sir.

63
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,787
I've hit the jackpot.

64
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,455
Bae Gi-chul's wife's phone.

65
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,417
We couldn't find anything
from her texts, photos, or DNA but...

66
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,543
Look.

67
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,337
RUSSIAN
SELECT LANGUAGE

68
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:44,715
KOREAN

69
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,430
SOMEONE BLACKMAILED ME
ON THE DAY MY HUSBAND DIED

70
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:05,152
He has a similar physique
to the guy I met at Kwon's house.

71
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,236
Zoom in.

72
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,242
Damn.

73
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,535
How did we miss that?

74
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,537
You've got to be joking.

75
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,584
I talked to the kids,

76
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,795
and they remember "Delivery"
was written on the kidnapper's vest.

77
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,216
But they couldn't see his face,
because he was wearing a mask.

78
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,595
Look more carefully.
Are they the same man?

79
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,934
He must be a professional martial artist.

80
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,478
How do you know that?
We can't even see his face.

81
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:43,565
His gait, for starters.
It's perfectly balanced.

82
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,860
And look. He seems agile
when he hops off the motorbike.

83
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,445
There's no doubt.

84
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,113
The guy I fought was similar.

85
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,075
Not only did he seem to know
martial arts but also ways to kill.

86
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,577
So it's safe to say they're the same man.

87
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:58,080
The national Taekwondo athlete nailed it.

88
00:08:58,664 --> 00:08:59,915
Anything from Bae's house?

89
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,500
We found a black box,

90
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,294
which was filled
with photos of some Russian boy.

91
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,712
Hold on.

92
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,006
I just got them.

93
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,640
Could he be her child?

94
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,017
Did she leave her child in her hometown?

95
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,227
He might've threatened her son

96
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,688
to make her call Bae out of the bar.

97
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,899
Then, Gaetal got him in the taxi
and murdered him.

98
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,945
It kept bothering me
that his last call was from his wife.

99
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:32,864
Wait.

100
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,450
Does this mean
we should suspect the taxi driver?

101
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,910
Hold on.

102
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,621
Ko Dong-gyu was at the funeral too.

103
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,081
We can't be sure about that yet.

104
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,710
That taxi driver has a solid alibi.

105
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,587
There's going to be
another Killing Vote soon.

106
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,381
Why can't there be one thing at a time?

107
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,718
Everyone wants them all dead. Jeez.

108
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,845
Put an APB out on the motorbike.

109
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,764
Keep an eye on deliverymen at every place
related to The Killing Vote.

110
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,101
Come on. Keep your heads up.

111
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,978
Let's put them all behind bars

112
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:04,938
and take a nice, long break.

113
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,440
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir!

114
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,164
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

115
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:35,427
Seeing as you came here yourself
so early, you must be pretty nervous.

116
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,095
Of course, I am.

117
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,681
If word gets out the police
are getting help from a criminal,

118
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:42,934
it's going to create an even bigger stir
than when you came back alive.

119
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,479
Whenever I get mixed up with you,
things never end well.

120
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,563
Whatever.

121
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,565
Since we've brought him out,

122
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,027
I might as well take him to every place
where Gaetal might show up.

123
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,111
Don't you dare!

124
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,113
No one can know about this,

125
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:58,784
so just as we originally planned,
use him only to find the next targets.

126
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,828
We know for sure Gaetal is someone
who was around Kwon Seok-joo.

127
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,414
So we must bring him with us
to see if he recognizes anyone.

128
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,127
If you're that scared,
then stay out of this.

129
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,130
Nothing scares me
except for my wife and you.

130
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:16,802
Whenever you cause trouble, I'm scared
I might lose my pension, you punk!

131
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:23,600
You should be thankful
the commissioner and I have your back.

132
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,436
Isn't it because only I do the dirty work?

133
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,562
You little...

134
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,785
Thank you, Lieutenant Joo.

135
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,586
Shouldn't we bring him out
to shake hands and take photos together?

136
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,296
You bastard. Seriously...

137
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,634
Don't mess up.

138
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,722
I'll move him to the isolation room now.

139
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,307
I'll do it.

140
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,059
You go figure out the targets first.

141
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,062
You can go in now.

142
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,398
Yes, sir.

143
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,769
It's nice to see you,

144
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:51,813
Kim Mu-chan.

145
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,792
Man, there's not much difference
from the detention center.

146
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,170
One.

147
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,713
Two.

148
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,715
Three.

149
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,387
Except for a few cameras,
it seems pretty lax here.

150
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,309
Look at all the dust.

151
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,271
Where am I supposed to stay?

152
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,438
Testing. One, two.

153
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,358
There's a room for you
right next door, Officer Park.

154
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,526
Jeez, that startled me.

155
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,237
Take his cuffs off.

156
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,739
Okay.

157
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,826
Hello, Mr. Kwon Seok-joo.

158
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,453
I'm Lieutenant Kim Jo-dan
from the Cyber Bureau.

159
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,707
I was deeply impressed
by the legal ethics lecture you once gave.

160
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,584
Because I was arrested for hacking.

161
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,504
Your room will be watched
by guards working in three shifts.

162
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,673
There are CCTV cameras
outside of the room as well,

163
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,717
so we can watch
your every move in real time.

164
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,052
So there won't be any blind spots.

165
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,221
Should you wish to leave this room,

166
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:51,474
you must be accompanied
by at least one guard or detective.

167
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,685
So I suggest you don't do anything

168
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,895
that would cause any misunderstandings.

169
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,230
The most important thing is

170
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,734
that no one can know you're here.

171
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,654
The moment people find out,
the special pardon will be canceled.

172
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,410
Fine.

173
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,455
I better go check my room.

174
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:24,883
Well...

175
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,551
For a long-term stay,

176
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,678
the decor's a bit of a shame.

177
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,097
You know what my house looks like.

178
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,896
Why didn't you add staying
in a hotel to the conditions then?

179
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:49,157
Go through all the letters
you've received, your acquaintances,

180
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,493
and everyone who was at the final trial,

181
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,745
and pick out those who may be Gaetal.

182
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,706
As he admitted himself
and as the circumstances suggest,

183
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,000
Gaetal must be one of them.

184
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,795
Shouldn't we find the next targets first?

185
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,421
Let's divide work for efficiency.

186
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,257
Finding the culprit is our top priority.

187
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,929
The next victim will be
an evil criminal anyway,

188
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,056
so letting them get killed

189
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,058
is okay?

190
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,276
Humans really don't change.

191
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,948
But then, you never even tried to change,

192
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,117
so I found you very fascinating.

193
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,914
From now on, I'll communicate
only through Lieutenant Joo.

194
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,418
Whether it's for finding Gaetal
or the next targets,

195
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,879
I won't talk or work with anyone but her.

196
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,215
That won't be possible.

197
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,511
As a criminal, I can't let you
choose a specific officer.

198
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,223
That's too bad.

199
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,391
CRIME AND FORENSIC SCIENCE

200
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,351
I guess I'll have to forfeit my pardon

201
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:01,020
and go back to prison.

202
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,407
I was going to assign Lieutenant Joo
for data analysis anyway,

203
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,950
so this isn't special treatment.

204
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,244
Let's not waste each other's time.

205
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,164
Tell us immediately if you know anything,

206
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,374
and you'll get your freedom.

207
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:24,711
Actually,

208
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,506
something Gaetal said
has been bothering me.

209
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,136
- It's Byun Woo-taek!
- It's him!

210
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,220
COURT

211
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,767
What kind of messed-up law is this?

212
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,685
What kind of law
lets a criminal walk free?

213
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,228
- You call that the law?
- But still...

214
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,065
We must follow it.

215
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,026
Because it's the law.

216
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,074
Please give us a few words.

217
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,122
Follow the law even if it's not just?

218
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,667
I can't do that.

219
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,046
My justice is...

220
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,257
extremely rational.

221
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,387
Our justice is extremely rational.

222
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,974
He said his justice was rational.

223
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,229
The person I know
who is most likely to be Gaetal...

224
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:25,814
Still to this point,

225
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,650
I can't think of anyone but Kim Mu-chan.

226
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,802
He said his justice was rational.

227
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,681
The person I know
who is most likely to be Gaetal...

228
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:01,933
Still to this point,

229
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,103
I can't think of anyone but Kim Mu-chan.

ACQUITTED

233
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:46,895
It's Jjoo. I can feel it.

234
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,521
It's Jjoo.

235
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,150
JOO HYUN

236
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,985
It's Jjoo.

237
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,407
Hey, Jjoo. Let's get some sleep.

238
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,867
Can't you just let us go to bed?

239
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,453
I sent you all the articles
published in the past five years

240
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,497
about military sex crimes
that didn't result in imprisonment

241
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,124
but were in the news.

242
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,208
Check them.

243
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,628
You know it's the middle
of the night, right?

244
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:12,962
You're so persistent.

245
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,589
Come on. Wake up.

246
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,634
There are so many.

247
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,261
I think we should narrow down
the most likely candidates

248
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,804
and call them one by one.

249
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,057
Well, that shouldn't be too hard.

250
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,476
You're the best.

251
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,560
We'll have to rush

252
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,188
to make all the phone calls
before the vote though.

253
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,398
I'm counting on you.

254
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:35,568
I'll send you the list
of military sex crimes once it's ready.

255
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,612
Please check if you find any connections.

256
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,614
Thank you.

257
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,034
But my privacy...

258
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,121
She's so aggressive.

259

NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

MILITARY SEX CRIMES
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CAMP

265
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,852
There were 1,407 cases in four years?

266
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,479
I can't believe it.

267
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,982
Is the Korean military
a haven for rapists?

268
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,317
That's a lot of sex crimes.

269
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,320
Between 2014 and 2017,

270
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:46,407
only nine people were actually sentenced
to jail for sexual assault.

271
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:49,452
If Gaetal targeted the military
to upset the entire country,

272
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,746
it was actually very smart of him.

273
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:56,417
We've gathered all of the military cases
that were reported, mentioned,

274
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:59,087
or filtered by the media
which were accessible by the public

275
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,924
using the dates when Kwon received
letters in the past five years,

276
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,717
and got this list of sex offenders.

277
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,679
Fine, let's say
we investigate all of them.

278
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:11,724
But how do we know
which one of them will be Gaetal's target?

279
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,102
We'll end up wasting our time.

280
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,394
You're right.

281
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,522
But there's no other way.

282
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,440
We should do our best
not to waste so much time.

283
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:24,403
I've made a database

284
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:27,448
based on the way Gaetal selected
his target in the first case.

285
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:30,451
First of all, to appeal to the voters,

286
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:33,704
bigger cases with victims who died
are considered first.

287
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:34,789
Mr. Park Dae-ung?

288
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:35,873
I'm with the police.

289
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:36,999
Wait.

290
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,543
PARK DAE-WOONG
MOLESTED FEMALE OFFICERS

291
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,627
Damn it!

292
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,798
Let go! Let go of me!

293
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,508
Damn it.

294
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,885
Stay still and put this on.

295
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:51,430
Acquittals, sentence reductions,
stories of the bereaved,

296
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:55,518
and when unrepentant offenders
commit the same crimes.

297
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,562
Gaetal thinks of himself
as a guardian of justice,

298
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,606
so he wouldn't punish someone
who regretted their wrongdoings.

299
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,816
RECIDIVISM

300
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:02,900
What are you doing?

301
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,944
- Come on.
- Stop.

302
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,863
- Please!
- Hey.

303
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,865
Stay still, and I'll give you good grades.

304
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,741
- It's not that hard. Don't move.
- No!

305
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:11,909
It'll be quick.

306
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:20,251
Put this on, and let's get you home.

00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,631
You can press this
in case of an emergency.

309
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,967
OH GYUN
GROPING, ASSAULT

310
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,054
Keep it on at all times.

311
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:52,909
No, we're not trying
to investigate you again.

312
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,203
We're really just trying to protect you.

313
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,079
Yes, if you consent,

314
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:01,125
we'll give you a watch
you can use in emergency situations.

315
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,252
Then... Hello?

316
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,795
Hello?

317
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,716
If you're embarrassed,
you shouldn't have done it!

318
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,344
This bastard's personal information
has been disclosed,

319
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,888
but he doesn't want the watch
because other people will notice.

320
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:14,972
What kind of logic is that?

321
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,058
He must have
the electronic ankle bracelet on.

322
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:20,770
At least we've got something on his body.
We should be grateful.

323
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,398
This is like buying lottery tickets.
Nothing is certain.

324
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,025
Hyun.

325
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:30,112
I know you worked really hard
on the analysis,

326
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,364
but is this really reliable?

327
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,742
If they don't answer calls, text them.

328
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:41,290
We have no idea
what Gaetal is going to do,

329
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:45,419
but all those cases
have one thing in common.

330
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:46,963
Hold onto that.

331
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,881
- What is it?
- Is this the delivery service?

332
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:51,801
Have you ever received a package
you didn't order or a strange one?

333
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:55,096
Or has a delivery worker
ever visited you for nothing recently?

334
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,306
My goodness, Sang-jae.

335
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,101
Our youngest officer might beat you soon.

336
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,107
How much have we covered?

337
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:09,902
Why don't we have
Jong-soo's contact information?

338
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,570
Due to your criminal history,

339
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,740
you're at risk of becoming
the next target of The Killing Vote.

340
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:18,411
Find the nearest patrol station,
get an emergency watch,

341
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,204
and ask for protection immediately.

342
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,376
Hey, Hyun.

343
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:40,057
Start narrowing down Kwon Seok-joo's
associates to those who might be Gaetal.

344
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,643
But the vote will begin soon.

345
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:46,522
When he reveals the target,
I'll bring Kwon to them.

346
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,233
Gaetal has always punished
the targets himself,

347
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,735
so he'll definitely show up.

348
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,362
We must narrow down
the target list before then.

349
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,489
What?

350
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:56,907
You'll bring Kwon there?

351
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:58,075
Is that necessary?

352
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:00,578
All right, sir.

353
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:01,704
One more thing.

354
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:05,583
Kwon Seok-joo chose you
to be his messenger.

355
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,418
Me?

356
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,211
Why?

357
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,672
We must figure that out too.

358
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:15,968
Hiding the letters from Gaetal
and asking for a special pardon.

359
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,304
That's not like the Kwon Seok-joo I know.

360
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,890
I'm sure he has an ulterior motive.

361
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,561
Play along with him
and try to establish a good rapport.

362
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,313
We must find out what he's up to.

363
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,106
But...

364
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,198
TODAY NEWS
THIRD KILLING VOTE... TODAY'S TARGET?

365
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,657
GAETAL'S APPROVAL RATING SURGES

00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,910
RESULTS SHOW SUPPORT FOR PUNISHMENTS
OPINIONS DIVIDED

367
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,662
Will the third one be similar
to the previous ones?

368
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:46,832
Yeah, that Gaetal guy is incredible.

369
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,960
THIRD KILLING VOTE TARGET?
GOVERNMENT IN DISARRAY

370
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,587
OVER 500,000 FANS ON GAETAL'S FAN SITE

371
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,339
Right. Today is the voting day.

372
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,133
I wonder who Gaetal will punish today.

373
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:59,095
The last victim
had her lower body blown to pieces.

374
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,179
Will he use a bomb again?

375
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,598
Come on. This isn't an action movie.

376
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,517
I hope Gaetal gets caught soon,

377
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,560
so everything goes back to normal again.

378
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,731
You bastard!

379
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,858
My daughter!

380
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,361
My daughter!

381
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,487
Oh, no!

382
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,324
Bring my daughter back!

383
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,576
- Sir!
- Bring her back!

384
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,453
My daughter!

385
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,205
Bring her back!

386
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,085
Let me take care of it.

387
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,129
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

388
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,966
Sir. Would you let me wash your clothes?

389
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,259
Yes. Let's go.

390
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,969
- My daughter...
- You sure drank a lot.

391
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:42,096
Come this way.

392
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,186
Refreshing, isn't it?

393
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,069
Unbelievable.

Assuming that Gaetal knows
Kwon Seok-joo very well

400
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,206
and is one of his acquaintances,

401
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,958
we're going to narrow them down

402
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,751
using keywords.

Now I get why they put you on my case.

409
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:44,492
You're good.

410
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,955
This is a skill used to track hackers.

411
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,749
I gave it a little tweak.

412
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:55,711
People tend to prefer what's familiar
to them more often than you'd think.

413
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,880
No matter how hard you rack your brain,

414
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,424
in the end, you can get more information
using keywords.

415
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,092
Number One Fan.

416
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,512
This should apply to Gaetal too.

417
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:07,473
He tried hard to hide his identity
in the letters though.

418
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:11,477
We can deduce his characteristics
by linking the content of the letters

419
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,231
and The Killing Vote stream. Is that it?

420
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,315
Yes.

421
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,694
But there's a case that seems
to be an outlier for Gaetal,

422
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,112
so it makes me uncertain.

423
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,952
This case hasn't been made public yet.

Bae Gi-chul's wife

No tips either?

- No.
- Is this even happening?

458
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:06,527
- Who do they think is the next target?
- I'd love to know.

00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:39,393
Do-hee.

467
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,561
What are you waiting for?

468
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,396

469
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,189
Come on. It's obvious.

470
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:45,858
You're waiting for a tip.

00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:49,695
Happy, now?

473
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,573
Come on, Do-hee.
Don't be so greedy and share it with me.

474
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,992
It was nice when we all screwed
the cops over together.

475
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,535
A united press.

476
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,287
How great was that?

477
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,372
It's like a beggar acting as a reporter.

478
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,124
What?

479
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,335
I let you in once,

488
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,956
I've been waiting
for over ten minutes here.

489
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,542
What?

490
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,169
Why?

491
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:49,922
I'll take full responsibility for you.

492
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,966
You got hurt because of me.

493
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,636
I'll see you through until you recover.

No, you don't need to...

00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,352
Let's hurry, or we'll miss the vote.

Are you getting treated here?

500
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,660
I can just go to a nearby clinic,

501
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,120
but I can come here after school.

502
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:24,832
Right.

503
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,709
Grandma asked me
to buy her a sandwich. I forgot.

504
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,295
She's on duty tonight.

505
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:33,006
Got it. You go ahead to her office.

506
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,258
I'll go buy one.

507
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:35,926
What does she like?

508
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,970
No ham but lots of greens and eggs.

509
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:39,888
And the money...

510
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,390
Don't. You can pay me back later.

511
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,683
I'll see you later.

CHOI JIN-SOO
ASSIGNED DETECTIVE

516
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,929
Lieutenant Choi attended every trial,

517
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,764
but he was a detective on the case.

518
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,350
And he doesn't know you personally,
so he's off the list.

519
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:27,269
And both of Byun Woo-taek's parents

520
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,230
were already deceased at the time.

521
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,070
Did you know them?

522
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:41,909
They were my neighbor's driver
and housekeeper.

523
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,370
They felt sorry for me
for raising my daughter alone,

524
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:47,873
so they would share food
with me sometimes.

525
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,042
When my daughter missed her shuttle bus,

526
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,960
they'd drive her to her school.

527
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,421
Though we didn't know
each other very well,

528
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,048
we were quite close.

529
00:36:58,342 --> 00:36:59,343
So...

530
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,596
The fact that it was their son

531
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:05,349
must've been a shock for you.

532
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,267
She would've trusted him.

533
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,813
They were nice people.

534
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,524
Their employer
was a newly-elected assemblywoman,

535
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:16,652
and since there weren't
many assemblywomen,

536
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,779
she was barely at home.

537
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,156
But the two were very diligent workers.

538
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:23,784
Hello, Professor.

539
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:24,868
Hello.

540
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,455
Na-rae, you always look so adorable.

541
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:29,915
How can you be so cute?

542
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,469
Was their employer
Assemblywoman Min Ji-young?

543
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,889
Do you know Ms. Min?

544
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:49,559
Almost too well.

545
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:53,105
I ended up seeing your trial records
while I was chasing after her.

546
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:57,025
MIN JI-YOUNG
HANMIN PARTY ASSEMBLYWOMAN

547
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,574
Son, why are you sleeping in my bed?

548
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:09,246
Byun Woo-taek's entire family was
living in Assemblywoman Min's house.

549
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,956
Her youngest son was frail,

550
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,458
so I often saw Byun Woo-taek
carry his bags for him.

551
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,293
I remember them being together.

552
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,691
You're going to sleep this early?

553
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:40,861
The new medicine is really strong.
It makes me so sleepy.

554
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,905
So you should've rested at home

555
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,407
instead of going out.

556
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,660
The hotel incident is all sorted out now.

557
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:52,205
I made sure all the records were erased.
And I took care of the girl.

558
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:55,375
And I put you on the waiting list
for the watch.

559
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:57,252
I know you like it.

560
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,132
- Mom.
- Yes?

561
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,926
You know that detective,
Kim Mu-chan.

562
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,012
He's a really fun guy.

563
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,097
It seems impossible to kill him.

564
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,183
He's like a cockroach.

565
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,269
Should I just be friends with him?

566
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,688
He must be trying to make ends meet.

567
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,275
You better stay away from those vermin.

568
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,944
If he messes with you once again,

569
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:25,572
I'll kill him for real.

570
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,700
How dare he try to get in my son's way?

571
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,745
I love you, Mom. You know that, right?

572
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:32,829
I love you too.

573
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,458
Right.

574
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,127
I have to be somewhere. I totally forgot.

575
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,545
Where are you going?

576
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,589
You should quit school too.

577
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,258
You should get in shape first.
Stop playing around.

578
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,510
Mom.

579
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,222
This is the only time I can play around.

580
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:51,807
Right?

581
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,189
I'll see you later, okay?

582
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,398
Please be careful.

583
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,242
It's okay.

584
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:12,953
I'll see you later.

585
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,349
CALLER NUMBER 0000

586
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,978
Hello, everyone.

587
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:42,149
Let the third Killing Vote begin.

588
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:44,651
I'm sure the special episode

589
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,778
made the waiting less boring.

590
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:49,781
I'm sure you're already familiar
with the voting process,

591
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:51,700
but if you don't want to watch this,

592
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,828
click on the X on the top right corner

593
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,496
to automatically abstain.

594
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,749
The person you'll be voting for today is

595
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,293
the so-called Captain Oh.

596
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,629
His habitual instances
of sexual assault in the military

597
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:07,090
led to Lieutenant Lim's suicide,

598
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:10,135
and it destroyed her family.

599
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,596
First off, I regret to inform you...

600
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:16,266
It's started.

601
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:17,851
Who is it this time?

602
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,020
- Hey, Cyber Bureau. Put it on the screen.
- Got it.

603
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,608
During the last voting,
I revealed the criminal's real name,

604
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:29,237
and it caused a lot of trouble
for the police, for me, and for everyone.

605
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,490
So today, until voting closes,

606
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:34,993
I won't reveal Captain Oh's name.

607
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,246
He won't say the name? Why?

608
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,168
There are five candidates
whose family name is Oh.

609
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,172
Here.

610
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:51,218
Call them and locate them all.

611
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:54,346
We can't locate two of them,
so we must use their ID numbers.

612
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,389
But it'll take some time.

613
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:00,685
Hello, this is Nambu Police--

614
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:03,980
I think I'm the target
of The Killing Vote.

615
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:05,148
My name's Oh Gyung-pyo.

616
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,691
Mr. Oh Gyung-pyo?

617
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,487
He's one of the people we couldn't locate.

618
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,364
Check for a package.

619
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:18,119
Sir, is there a reason why you believe so?

620
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,247
Did something suspicious happen?

621
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:21,831
A package.

622
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,335
I got a package with some photos in it.

623
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,171
The photos I took of Lieutenant Lim.

624
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,676
Once we locate him,
connect him to Sang-jae.

625
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:33,843
Let's go.

626
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:36,721
Sir. I'll connect you to a cellphone.

627
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:39,724
Our detectives are on their way
to protect you now.

628
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,768
Please stay on the line.

629
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,520
Tell us where you are.

630
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:44,729
Give us the address.

631
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:48,108
Lim lived with her widowed father
and was the breadwinner of the family.

632
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,945
She became a military officer,
dreaming of a stable job.

633
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,072
However, as soon as she was assigned,

634
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:57,325
she met an evil man
who deserves to burn in hell,

635
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,077
Captain Oh.

636
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,205
Pretending to be
a friendly senior officer,

637
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:06,918
Captain Oh started
to inappropriately touch her body.

638
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,378
What a filthy animal.

639
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,088
My fellow citizens...

640
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,798
- Really?
- You've been through a lot...

641
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,341
Catch him at all costs.

642
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,844
...so until voting closes...

643
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:18,596
They narrowed down candidates
with Kwon's help.

644
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,598
And the guy asked
the police for protection.

645
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:24,144
Kim Mu-chan might actually end up
solving this case.

646
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,520
- Is that so?
- ...a military officer,

647
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,147
dreaming of a stable job.

648
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:29,482
I got a call from Min Ji-young earlier.

649
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,319
Assemblywoman Min?

650
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:34,154
Eight years ago,

651
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,072
something similar happened, you know.

652
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:38,325
Pretending to be
a friendly senior officer...

653
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,745
Kim Mu-chan, Kwon Seok-joo, Min Ji-young,

654
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:44,039
you, and me.

655
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,043
Before Kim Mu-chan solves this case,

656
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,129
let's meet with Assemblywoman Min.

657
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:53,882
...fell prey to his disgusting hands.

658
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,970
This evil bastard molested Lieutenant Lim,

659
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,930
took photos of her naked body,

660
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:03,224
and threatened to post them online.

661
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,518
After going through this pain alone,

662
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:08,563
she told her fiancé everything

663
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,899
and reported him to the military court.

664
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:14,152
But Captain Oh claimed
she had given him consent.

665
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:16,905
Yes. Joo Hyun speaking.

666
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,866
Get moving with Kwon Seok-joo.
We located the target.

667
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,243
He's a pastor in Ansan.

668
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,704
Have Kwon spot anyone he knows.

669
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,166
Hold on.

670
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,335
This wasn't on the agreement
with the detention center.

671
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:33,546
I'm not sure about this.

672
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,050
Kwon Seok-joo is our hunting dog,
and he'll help us catch Gaetal.

673
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,551
Get him off the leash.

674
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,596
Leave with him right now.

675
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,724
Hello?

676
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:46,059
This son of a...

677
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:52,690
Even the soldiers in the same troop
gave false statements

678
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:55,944
that Captain Oh and Lieutenant Lim
were lovers.

679
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,114
Oh, my.

680
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,616
Business is booming today.

681
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,284
I WIRED THE MONEY
GIVE ME THE PASSWORD

682
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:04,536
Thank you.

683
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,538
He's so happy.

684
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,206
The military court concluded

685
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:12,961
there was no proof
of forced sexual intercourse.

686
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,088
He was only charged with sexual harassment

687
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:18,550
and sentenced to six months in prison
with one year of probation.

688
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:24,305
Then, Lieutenant Lim hung herself
in the bathroom of the medical office.

689
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,520
CAPTAIN OH'S VICTIM,
WHO IS LIEUTENANT LIM?

690
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:31,604
THE KILLING VOTE BEGINS

691
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:33,106
WHO IS THE SEX OFFENDER, CAPTAIN OH?

692
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,483
CAPTAIN OH'S NAME IS YET TO BE REVEALED...

693
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,402
Why would he not tell us his name?

694
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,320
Shit.

695
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:45,952
That's unbelievable.

696
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:01,759
This is crazy.

697
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:08,183
Could you send some cops here?

698
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:11,436
I'm the target of The Killing Vote.

699
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,687
I need protection.

700
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,737
I'm the person Gaetal is talking about.

701
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,655
So send the cops here right now.

702
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,532
This is not a prank call!

703
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:25,950
It's me.

704
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,578
I'm Captain Oh.

705
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,585
Where did he go?

706
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,010
Is he outside?

707
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:53,102
What do you think you're doing?

708
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:58,900
You can't do this.

709
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,527
Based on our agreement,

710
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:04,447
he can cooperate with you
only in the designated area!

711
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:06,824
Gaetal is definitely going to show up.

712
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:09,702
And Mr. Kwon might recognize him!

713
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:11,913
You've got to be kidding me.

714
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,041
We don't have much time.
Let's just do as they say.

715
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:18,753
If we miss him like this,
it will only get the warden in trouble.

716
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,714
You think you're a detective now?

717
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:23,424
Then, let me come with you too.

718
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:25,134
Fine!

719
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:26,469
Let's go.

720
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:29,180
Wait...

721
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:48,616
AGREE TO THE EXECUTION OF CAPTAIN OH?

722
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,582
Shocked by his daughter's death,
her father collapsed.

723
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:58,501
Her family was completely destroyed.

724
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:02,255
REVEAL THE TRUTH
OF MY DAUGHTER'S WRONGFUL DEATH

725
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,716
Guess what happened to Captain Oh.

726
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,634
Though he was dishonorably discharged,

727
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,846
he's been leading a happy life.

728
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:13,516
Recently, he even had
a reunion with the soldiers

729
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,268
who gave false statements for him

730
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:17,312
and gave them money gifts.

731
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,397
HOT GIRLS, SHARE GOOD PICTURES,
DIFFERENT LEAGUE

732
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:21,649
Shall we sentence Captain Oh,

733
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:25,069
one of the most vicious devils
who were deemed innocent,

734
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:26,613
to death?

735
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:29,324
Yes or no? What's your answer?

736
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:30,992
I'm so anxious. When are you coming?

737
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,744
The patrol officers will be there first.

738
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,246
Check their IDs before you open the door.

739
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:38,166
You cannot make contact
with any stranger other than police.

740
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,709
Cast your votes now.

741
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:41,461
And please stay on the line.

CHOI JIN-SOO

743
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:48,009
Another Captain Oh
has asked for protection.

744
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,261
Another Captain Oh?

745
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:51,554
Are you sure it's not a prank?

746
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:54,349
There was another one from the list
we failed to locate.

747
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:55,558
His name is Oh Jong-soo.

748
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:57,101
It's him. He changed his name.

749
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:58,978
Connect him to me.

750
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:02,607
This is Captain Kim Mu-chan speaking.

751
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:04,233
Are you Captain Oh?

752
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:05,943
Yes, I am!

753
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:12,075
I'm being extorted
by soldiers because of this.

754
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:13,618
And now, I'm going to get killed?

755
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:16,663
It can't allow it. It's too unfair.

756
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,348
I'm just a little worried.

757
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:41,646
Skilled hackers always leave
a couple of exits open.

758
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:44,023
Eye-catching doors are fake.

759
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:47,276
What they actually use
is the so-called "back door."

760
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:50,488
It's a path
where one's skills work the best.

761
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,074
And if it isn't discovered,

762
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,576
they sometimes just leave it there
after they're done.

763
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:58,121
From what I've observed,

764
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:01,082
Gaetal seems to have
the characteristics of a hacker.

765
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:05,002
Are you saying he's fooling us now?

766
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:10,842
What Gaetal mentioned
about Captain Oh...

767
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,552
MEDICAL OFFICE BATHROOM
FALSE STATEMENT

768
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:15,513

00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:17,724
false statement, dishonorable discharge,

770
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:20,351
medical office bathroom, reunion."

771
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,523
Bathroom?

772
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:32,196
He said she hung herself
in the bathroom of a medical office.

SEARCH WORD: MEDICAL OFFICE BATHROOM

775
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:41,998
Lieutenant Lim, a sex crime victim
who committed suicide five years ago.

776
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,207
She was a nurse officer.

777
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:49,005
Then, Captain Oh must be
in the medical field as well.

778
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:52,592
Because the bathroom in the medical office
is not for any officer.

779
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:59,557
Among the five Captain Oh candidates,
only one of them

780
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,642
is in the medical field.

00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,659
Both of you must stay on the line.

783
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:21,120
Everything you say will be
shared with the entire unit.

784
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:23,414
Hey, I'm the Captain Oh.

785
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:26,125
What do you mean "both of you"?
Come and help me!

786
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:29,128
We can't be sure
which of you is the real target yet.

787
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,215
Jo-dan, can you hear me?

788
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,841
Call the superintendent
and locate my phone.

789
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:36,260
Okay, I'm on it.

790
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:41,599
If I tell you what I did to her,
will you believe me then?

791
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:45,353
The first time I did that to her
was at her welcome party.

792
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:47,730
She seemed like a tough girl,

793
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:49,440
but she has a low tolerance to alcohol.

794
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:51,359
She didn't even drink a lot,

795
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,653
and she was completely wasted.

796
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,780
She started acting out,

797
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:59,116
so I showed her the video I'd taken.

798
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,910
I didn't mean to share it with others.

799
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,746
I didn't want any trouble,
so I tried to hush her.

800
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,749
Since she was quite cute,
I thought I could date her too.

CHOI JIN-SOO

802
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:11,379
Her name is Lim Yoo-jung.

803
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:16,259
At first, I wasn't serious.

804
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,803
But her reaction made me
want to push her harder.

805
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,805
She hit on me first, damn it.

806
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:24,016
Then, that bitch put me in such a bind
when she suddenly died!

807
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,686
She hit on me when I said I was a doctor,

808
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:30,022
but when I showed interest,
she started to play the victim!

809
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,984
- Damn gold digger.
- I can't believe this bastard!

810
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:38,739
And her boyfriend almost killed me.

811
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,826
Who knows if there's a killer
among the numerous people

812
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,452
outside my office right now?

813
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,330
I even locked the door.
I'm so damn anxious.

814
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:48,416
So come here right now and protect me.

815
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,167

If he's the real Captain Oh,
Gaetal will be there.

820
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:44,013
It's not too late
to go over to Superintendent Kim.

821
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:45,890
To let yourself off the hook.

822
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,239

00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,921
You.

You're not Oh Gyung-pyo, are you?

Who are you?

00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:55,876
What...

832
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:59,588
Darn it. That's the CMC feature.

833
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:01,424
Using two phones with one number.

834
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:03,676
Then, where's the phone's owner?

835
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,767
Superintendent Kim Mu-chan.

836
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:15,730
I'm just really curious.

837
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:19,233
Do you really want to save
a scumbag like that?

838
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,540
Oh Jung-ho is Captain Oh.

839
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:36,959
Oh Jung-ho at Saehyeon Hospital.

840
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,463
The target is Oh Jung-ho.
Everyone, head to Saehyeon Hospital!

841
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:42,882
Go to Saehyeon Hospital, now!

842
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:52,475
Superintendent!

843
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,351
Sir!

844
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:04,612
Who are you?

845
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:05,780
You stay here.

846
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,239
Be quiet.

847
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:08,491
Shit.

848
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:14,413
So why didn't you believe me?

849
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:15,915
What now?

850
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:18,584
What are you going to do
if I get killed for real?

CHOI JIN-SOO

852
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:25,174
The police will arrive soon,
so don't go anywhere.

853
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:27,551
If anyone comes while you're alone,
don't open the door.

854
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,096

- Officers are ten minutes away.

855
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:31,847
We're calling the hospital's security.

856
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,267
This is Joo Hyun speaking.

857
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:36,727
I'm at Saehyeon Hospital.

858
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:46,737
Because Gaetal mentioned
the bathroom of the medical office.

859
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:48,864
Listen carefully.

860
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:51,075
Gaetal is already there.

861
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,077
He sounded like he was watching
Oh Jung-ho.

862
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,831
Until backup arrives,
you'll have to protect him alone.

863
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,499
Can you do it?

864
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,584
I'll get there in 20 minutes.

865
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,921
And watch Kwon closely.
He'll definitely recognize Gaetal.

866
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,975
From this moment,
if you see someone who looks familiar

867
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:17,852
or you've seen them before,
tell me right away.

868
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:18,936
Okay?

869
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,981
Can we do something about this?

870
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:24,775
I can just cover it like this.

871
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,073
No one can find out about this.

872
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,168
How may I help you?

873
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:52,887
Anybody in there?

874
00:58:00,853 --> 00:58:02,396
Is Mr. Oh Jung-ho here?

875
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,107
He was here just now.

876
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,359
- Have you seen Dr. Oh?
- No.

877
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:09,486
Didn't Dr. Oh come here?

878
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,988
He's not in his office either.

879
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,489
I haven't seen him.

880
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,119
Hey, it's been a while. How have you been?

881
00:58:17,203 --> 00:58:18,370
I called because...

882
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,706
You said you knew a cop, right?

883
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:23,500
I'm in real trouble now.

884
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:24,752
What's going on?

885
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:27,296
Why won't this open?

886
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:28,923
Excuse me.

887
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:36,847
Excuse me.

888
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:40,059
I never said I was Captain Oh.

889
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:43,687
Hold on. Who the hell are you?

890
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,314
I'm here to see my grandmother.

891
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:46,857
She's waiting for me outside.

892
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:49,318
Come here, you punk.

893
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:50,402
What are you doing?

894
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:51,695
What if that bastard comes in?

895
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:56,492
You came to spy on me, didn't you?

896
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,370
Who have you been texting?

897
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,122
Give me that.

898
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,167
You bastard.

899
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,127
Have you lost your mind?

900
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:09,505
Mr. Oh Jung-ho.

901
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,590
Hyun?

902
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:12,675
Mr. Oh Jung-ho.

903
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:16,053
- Hyun.
- I'm Lieutenant Joo Hyun with the police.

904
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:19,056
Mr. Oh. I'm a police officer.

905
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:22,726
Show me your ID then.

906
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:35,281
JOO HYUN
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

907
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:38,158
Forget it.

908
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,704
Check the IDs of everyone out there.

909
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:42,871
Or I'm not coming out.

910
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:45,374
We have no time for this. Open up first.

911
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:46,667
I need to see what's going on.

912
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,130
The vote will end soon.

913
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:52,464
Mr. Oh Jung-ho.

914
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:55,217
Mr. Oh!

915
00:59:57,303 --> 00:59:59,555
JOO MIN

916
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,933
- The number you dialed...
- Why isn't he picking up?

917
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:05,769
Mr. Oh!

918
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:18,991
Excuse me. Could you...

919
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:24,413
Could we lock down the entire hospital?
Nobody should get in or get out.

920
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:25,622
Yes, ma'am.

921
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:27,791
Attention, please.

922
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:30,502
I'm Lieutenant Joo Hyun
from Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

923
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:32,421
I'm sorry to alarm you,

924
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:34,715
but I'm going to check
your IDs and bags now.

925
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,175
Check our IDs and bags?

926
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:38,802
We're in pursuit of a suspect.
I'd appreciate your cooperation.

927
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:41,805
Hey, could you help me?

928
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:42,890
Me?

929
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:44,516
What's your name?

930
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:47,686
It's not like
I'm going to get paid for this.

931
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:49,063
What is this about?

932
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:52,900
Thank you.

933
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,111
We can just show mine.

934
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:00,949
What's this?

935
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:03,202
What?

936
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:07,456
YES: 72%
EXECUTE CAPTAIN OH

937
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,918
YES: 72%
EXECUTE CAPTAIN OH

938
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:26,767
What are you going to do now?

939
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:36,735
YES: 72%
EXECUTE CAPTAIN OH

940
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:38,570
Damn it.

941
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:42,491
Voting has already ended.

942
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:45,869
The results for Captain Oh,

943
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:48,622
who completely destroyed
a woman's life are...

944
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:50,958
DO YOU VOTE "YES" OR "NO"?

945
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,252
The majority of citizens have voted "yes"

946
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:56,088
to impose the death penalty on Captain Oh.

947
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:59,425
Now, let me reveal who he is.

948
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:01,802
THE KILLING VOTE

949
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:05,097
Surprisingly, this man in the white gown,

950
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:08,392
Captain Oh Jong-su, is Captain Oh.

951
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,144
After having his sentence reduced

952
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:12,354
thanks to one of his relatives
who runs a hospital,

953
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:14,648
this shameless man even changed his name

954
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,068
and has been working as a doctor since.

955
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:21,321
He's currently a doctor
in Saehyeon Hospital's ER.

956
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:24,491
- Hey.
- No way.

957
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,577
Dr. Oh is Captain Oh?

958
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,621
- Can we broadcast this?
- If we don't, can we call

959
01:02:29,705 --> 01:02:30,831
ourselves broadcasters?

960
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,125
Go on. I'll take care of the rest.

961
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:40,340
- Isn't that Dr. Oh?
- I think so.

962
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:41,884
I can't believe he's a doctor.

963
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:43,844
He totally deserves to die.

964
01:02:46,013 --> 01:02:48,891
What's going on? Are we in trouble too?

965
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,517
We didn't do anything.

966
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:52,853
I knew he'd get caught one day.

967
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,771
We might lose our meal ticket now.

968
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:59,276
He didn't give a shit
about the Hippocratic oath.

969
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,237
A doctor who is supposed
to save people's lives

970
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:05,908
completely destroyed
the life of a woman and her family.

971
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:07,367
Can you believe that?

972
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,620
There's more. Old habits die hard.

973
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:12,456
He's been using patients under anesthesia

974
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:14,291
to appease his perverted desires.

975
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:16,460
What a rotten bastard.

976
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:21,256
Oh, right.
We have deleted all those videos,

977
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,342
so you can rest easy.

978
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,011
With his privileged background,
Oh Jong-su...

979
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:28,263
No, Oh Jung-ho.

980
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,100
Now, as your watchdog,

981
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:37,189
I will punish
that devil deemed innocent.

982
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:40,651
KILLING VOTE

983
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,778
In accordance
with the wishes of the citizens,

984
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,656
I will now execute Oh Jung-ho.

985
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:48,992
Dr. Oh?

986
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:50,410
It's him. Oh Jung-ho.

987
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:52,037
Let me check your ID.

988
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,830
This is taking forever.

989
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:58,544
Wait.

990
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:00,212
I'm so sorry,

991
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:02,005
but no one can leave right now.

992
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:04,299
Why? He's the criminal, not us. Move.

993
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:06,677
Wait. You must stay here.
You must wait here.

994
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,720
- What's happening here?
- I'm sorry.

995
01:04:08,804 --> 01:04:10,430
Your cooperation is much appreciated.

996
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:12,349
Wait.

997
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,518
- How have you been?
- Hey.

998
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:15,852
Na-rae, you got a package.

999
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,355
- Should I open it for you?
- Yes.

1000
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:19,439
All right.

1001
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:20,524
Let's see.

1002
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:22,276
Thank you.

1003
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,363
Are you suspecting us or what?

1004
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:27,447
The bad guy is in there.

1005
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:29,449
Please wait here.

1006
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:31,952
The delivery worker over there.

1007
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:33,453
He used to come to my house.

1008
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:36,206
Whenever he came to deliver packages,
he said hi to Na-rae.

1009
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:44,798
Wait, what...

1010
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,758
Stay here. Don't go anywhere.

1011
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:49,469
What... How?

1012
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:50,679
What's going on?

1013
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,890
Jeez.

1014
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:19,207
Get back!

1015
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:20,917
What? Why?

1016
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:58,330
- Stop pushing.
- There was an explosion in the ER!

1017
01:05:58,538 --> 01:05:59,581
Excuse me!

1018
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:01,750
Please calm down!

1019
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,126
We'll check what's going on!

1020
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:29,945
ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY

1021
01:06:59,975 --> 01:07:02,144
Wait, move back! I'll open it!

1022
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:04,396
What?

1023
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:05,731
Why won't it open?

1024
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:09,901
Damn it. Hey, go bring the cutter.

1025
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:18,034
The hospital's main control was hacked,
and all doors have shut down.

1026
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:20,203
It'll be hard to restore it from outside.

1027
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:23,373
Kwon Seok-joo!

1028
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,171
Kwon Seok-joo!

1029
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:35,635
Kwon Seok-joo!

1030
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:40,390
Where's the bomb squad?

1031
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:41,850
Are you serious?

1032
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,727
Just plow through the traffic jam!

1033
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,729
People could die here!

1034
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,856
Clear the path
for transporting the ER patients.

1035
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:49,649
We can't locate Kwon Seok-joo.

1036
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,234
Where's the prison guard?

1037
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:57,199
We can't locate Kwon Seok-joo.

1038
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:58,742
Where's the prison guard?

1039
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:00,911
What's my professor up to?

1040
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:02,329
Is he on an outing?

1041
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:08,460
Interesting.

1042
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:49,918
The number you have dialed is
unavailable. To leave...

1043
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:53,255
Darn it.

1044
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:58,051
Mr. Oh, we're the bomb squad.
Are you in there?

1045
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:00,512
Yes, I'm fine.

1046
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:03,557
So please remove the bomb first.

1047
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,016
You should evacuate first.

1048
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,560
Defusing the bomb takes some time.

1049
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,144
Damn it. It does?

1050
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,111
By the way,

1051
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,490
you're really from the bomb squad,

1052
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,285
right?

1053
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:25,662
We're running out of time.

1054
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,516
Please open the door!

1055
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:53,857
Move aside.

1056
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:55,567
Move aside, everyone!

1057
01:09:57,777 --> 01:09:59,237
Please stand back.

1058
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:12,083
Car 9371 on standby.

1059
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:13,585
Sir.

1060
01:10:15,337 --> 01:10:16,546
Hey! Move all that!

1061
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,634
Hyun, how's Oh Jung-ho doing?

1062
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,136
Hyun!

1063
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:25,972
Damn it.

1064
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:03,236
Mr. Oh, we're the bomb squad.

1065
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:05,739
You're really from the bomb squad, right?

1066
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:08,575
Don't come out.
If you want to live, stay there!

1067
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:13,913
I wished you were Gaetal.

1068
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:16,499
Why do you hate Kwon Seok-joo so much?

1069
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,002
Someone has died because of him.

1070
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,838
