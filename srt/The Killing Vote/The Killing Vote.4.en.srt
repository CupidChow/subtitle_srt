1
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,043
WOULD YOU LIKE TO VOTE?

2
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,977
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,312
SAFETY OF CHILD ACTORS WAS ENSURED

4
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:09,069
EIGHT YEARS AGO

5
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,253
You can't go in, sir.

6
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,008
Professor Kwon!

7
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,843
You can't go in. Please calm down.

8
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:13,944
No.

9
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:12,795
No!

10
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,238
Hi!

11
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,415
Hi, Dad.

12
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,169
Did I do a good job?

13
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,254
Look at this.

14
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,425
How is it?

15
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,822
Let's go.

16
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,323
Did you record it right?

17
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,175
You're my hero, Dad.

18
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,634
Because you always keep me safe.

19
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,887
I love you, Dad.

20
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,598
I love you.

21
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,392
Bye.

22
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,271
Are you Gaetal?

23
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,902
Should I ask you again?

24
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,071
Kwon Seok-joo.

25
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,240
Do you know anything about Gaetal

26
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,493
and the Killing Vote?

27
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,619
It's Byun Woo-taek!

28
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,662
Mr. Byun, any comments?

29
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,421
What kind of messed-up law is this?

30
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,298
What kind of law
lets a criminal walk free?

31
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,841
- You call that the law?
- But still...

32
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,428
We must follow it.

33
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,180
Because it's the law.

34
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,642
Kim Mu-chan.

35
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,146
We were very close in the past,

36
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,524
and he told me that he respected me.

37
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,400
And...

38
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,529
He also knows about the phrase
"the devils who were deemed innocent."

39
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,662
Making sure that those
who deserve to die are dead.

40
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,999
And calling the villain
on the gallows a victim.

41
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,670
- Superintendent Kim Mu-chan.
- Weren't you severely injured?

42
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,046
Please tell us what's going on.

43
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,591
Tell me,

44
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,051
Superintendent Kim Mu-chan.

45
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,555
What is justice for you?

46
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,983
KIM REPORTED TO BE IN SERIOUS CONDITION

47
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:24,361
EPISODE 4

48
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,446
Are you watching, Mom?

49
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,283
Yeah, I'm watching it.

50
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:42,379
Initially announced
as being in critical condition,

51
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,758
it was revealed that Superintendent Kim
only sustained minor injuries.

52
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:47,885
What?

53
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,220
Is this the thing
that keeps your heart beating?

54
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,890
Does that mean
that if it stops, you'll die?

55
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,767
...and sent the location
of Kim to the press...

56
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:56,935
Are you embarrassed?

57
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,396
- It's okay--
- Embarrassed?

58
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:08,947
The rotten and corrupt police are now
mocking the people with fake news.

59
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:12,075
They distorted the true intention
of The Killing Vote

60
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,287
and framed me for hurting an innocent cop.

61
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,916
What was so wrong?

62
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:20,876
Our justice is

63
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,421
extremely rational.

64
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,970
Please give us a comment.

65
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,849
What are you going to do?

66
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,732
Please give us a few words!

67
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,541
I'm going to make an official statement.

68
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,418
So please stop.

69
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,837
Whether you write articles
online or offline,

70
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,256
do whatever you want.

71
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,217
But I want you to include

72
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,221
every single word I'm about to say.

73
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,101
I'm Kim Mu-chan
from the Special Investigation Unit.

74
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,436
As the culprit just said,

75
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,981
blinded by the urge
to quickly solve the case,

76
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,151
I lied to you and pretended
to be seriously injured.

77
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,154
I deeply apologize.

78
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,034
Ridiculous.

79
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,744
Is he serious?

80
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,581
That's just nonsense.

81
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:46,086
Due to my actions,
I realize you've lost faith in the police.

82
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,755
However,

83
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,799
even if I could go back in time,

84
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,177
I would choose to do the same.

85
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:56,847
Isn't that crossing the line?

86
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,267
He surely knows
how to attract the viewers.

87
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,020
Make it a close-up.
Don't miss a word he says.

88
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:08,317
The culprit has committed murder
on the pretext of rectifying injustices,

89
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,986
and he's turned the entire nation
into accomplices.

90
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,905
Right now, as a criminal receives
more support than the police,

91
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,328
I was willing to break rules to catch
this heinous criminal as soon as possible.

92
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,954
I hope everyone understands this.

93
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,667
Also...

94
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,546
You and The Killing Vote.

95
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,092
Don't be mistaken.

96
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,637
You're not a hero.

97
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,398
You're clearly a murderer,

98
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,233
and your method is wrong.

99
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,571
I'm going to catch you no matter what.

100
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,786
- Who's behind this?
- Are you resigning?

101
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:01,870
Is the unit disbanded?

102
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,414
Don't you think you're hindering
the investigation?

103
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,297
Fire!

104
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,673
- Where?
- Over there!

105
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,384
Run!

106
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,054
Fire!

107
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,853
Superintendent Kim!

108
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,188
Superintendent Kim!

109
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,233
Blinded by the urge
to quickly solve the case,

110
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,820
I lied to you and pretended
to be seriously injured.

111
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,739
I deeply apologize.

112
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:45,122
You shouldn't think badly of him.

113
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,875
You all heard about what he did
until the explosion happened.

114
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,294
He tried to save that pathetic woman
in that bad situation

115
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,171
even though he knew
it could've killed him too.

116
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:56,341
He was just doing the best he could
to fight the Gaetal craze.

117
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,968
Oh, my God!

118
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,803
The traffic on our website is going crazy.

119
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,305
The NPA server is already
about to go down.

120
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,849
Insulting posts are flooding in,

121
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,684
adding a page per second
to the message boards.

122
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,437
The server might really go down
at this rate.

123
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,022
You think this is funny?

124
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,190
What are you talking about?

125
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,609
I'm moderating the message boards now.

126
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,904
Hateful comments create
more hateful comments.

127
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,406
Before they keep showing up,

128
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,867
we have to stop them at regular intervals.

129
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,577
Then, erase this too.

130
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,163
Who does he think he is
to call our leader a psycho?

131
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,747
Can't we track his location?

132
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,332
We're not stupid.

133
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,377
Did you think we wouldn't understand?

134
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:36,214
How could you not tell us
and keep it all to yourselves?

135
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,884
You didn't trust us.

136
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,719
Right?

137
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,472
The fewer people involved,
the higher the chances of success.

138
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,599
Hey. Stop mumbling and speak up.

139
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,226
The fewer people involved,
the higher the chances of success.

140
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,353
It's not that we didn't trust you.

141
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,272
We didn't want to drag you into this.

142
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,238
Hello, Choi Jin-soo of the SIU speaking.

143
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,952
I'm taking off now.

144
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,497
Bae Gi-chul's wife has been
found dead too.

145
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,664
- What?
- What?

146
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,253
Don't be mistaken.

147
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,715
You're not a hero.

148
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,510
You're clearly a murderer,

149
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,637
and your method is wrong.

150
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,766
I'm going to catch you no matter what.

151
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,691
As the culprit just said,

152
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:38,985
blinded by the urge to quickly solve...

153
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,904
I was worried this would happen.

154
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,615
Anyway, if people find out
why he came here,

155
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,534
both of us will be in trouble.

156
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,202
I hope they find out.

157
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,704
So we can find Gaetal.

158
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,499
What do you mean?

159
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,042
Wait, Professor Kwon.

160
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,795
Are you really connected
with the Killing Vote guy?

161
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:58,964
You're not, are you?

162
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,385
If the police hadn't had such suspicions,
they wouldn't have come to me.

163
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,680
Kim Mu-chan is not an idiot.

164
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,101
If they find out what I did
instead of performing labor,

165
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,354
they might believe
the suspicions are true.

166
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,818
Are you threatening me?

167
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,531
No way.

168
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,159
We're not in that situation yet.

169
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,708
Come in.

170
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,802
ROOKIE POLICE OFFICER
BRAVELY BLOWS THE WHISTLE

171
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,488
Inmate 0512.

172
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,906
Keep walking.

173
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,202
Inmate 0512.

174
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,542
Move.

175
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,377
Keep walking.

176
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,131
You little...

177
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,758
Motherfucker.

178
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,676
Have you lost your mind?

179
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,637
Did that tea taste good?

180
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,305
You think you're so great?

181
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,224
Look at you acting all classy
after murdering a person.

182
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,435
You're nothing more than a murderer.

183
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,104
You piece of shit.

184
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,397
Because of you scumbags,

185
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,691
this country is never going to improve.

186
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,193
You useless piece of shit.

187
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,654
- Let go. Die, you bastard.
- Stop!

188
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,496
Darn it.

189
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,465
The whole country knows your face now.

190
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,301
Taking a cab is out of the question,
let alone staying in a hotel

191
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,552
or sleeping on the street.

192
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,263
Everyone is a paparazzi these days.

193
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,475
They can instantly post
your photos online, report you, and...

194
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,394
What are you doing?

195
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,231
Hey.

196
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,024
Still, this is a bit...

197
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,110
This isn't right.
I'll just go to Jin-soo's or Sang-jae's.

198
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,153
Jo-dan called.

199
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,365
He said that the police agency
is now surrounded by reporters

200
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,741
and our unit is quite upset too,

201
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,702
so you should hide somewhere tonight.

202
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,871
Also, Lieutenant Choi and Detective Kang
are out on duty.

203
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,336
Right. This is the bathroom.

204
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:45,255
Okay.

205
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,845
So refreshing.

206
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:52,929
Hyun, you're home?

207
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:19,831
I get that you have nowhere to go
in this humiliating situation,

208
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,667
but you can't just come
to a ladies-only home like this.

209
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,377
Don't you have manners?

210
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,962
Or common sense?

211
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,297
Min.

212
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,052
Speaking of common sense,

213
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,637
I wonder why teenagers got involved

214
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,599
in a dangerous police investigation.
It's against common sense.

215
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,434
How could you even go to Kwon's house?

216
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,936
Using my common sense,
I just can't understand why.

217
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,480
And the kid you were with.

218
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,484
He significantly contributed
to our failure in catching the culprit.

219
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,651
What's your relationship?

220
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:52,989
So you're one of those people
who holds grudges for long time.

221
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,452
Well, people are condemning me
as a senseless police officer anyway.

222
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,497
So I need you to tell me only the facts.

223
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,459
How did you kids end up there?

224
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,711
- Look, mister.
- That was my mistake.

225
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,298
I was using her computer
when I first found Gaetal's test video.

226
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,133
I forgot to erase it afterward,

227
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,553
so she and her friend
found the video and analyzed it.

228
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,016
They actually did a great job
analyzing the background noises and space,

229
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,226
so I joined them.

230
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,728
Then, we found Kwon Seok-joo's place.

231
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:28,233
You found the house thanks to us,
so don't blame her. Okay?

232
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,530
Do you remember anything about him?

233
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,658
Any facial or body features?
Or any strange behaviors?

234
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,244
I was attacked from behind,

235
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,246
so I didn't really see anything.

236
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,998
Well, from the way
he was fighting with you,

237
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,668
he seemed to be
a professional martial artist.

238
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,129
I was thinking the same.

239
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,714
His smell.

240
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,343
The smell?

241
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,720
His clothes smelled strange.

242
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,514
Ji-hoon, get him.

243
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,682
Let go, Min. Just let him go.

244
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,850
Like a firecracker.

245
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,853
He had the same smell
as when you play with fireworks.

246
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,272
He smelled like metal too.

247
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,233
Firecrackers.

248
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,068
Fireworks.

249
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:16,406
Gunpowder.

250
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,035
Wait.

251
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,705
Could he be the same person
who blew up the car?

252
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,416
He might be Gaetal then.

253
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,920
Your sister's pretty quick-witted.

254
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,213
She wants to be a reporter.

255
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,756
You should try to avoid her.

256
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:37,427
If I'd held onto him longer,
we would've caught the man.

257
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,761
It's all Ji-hoon's fault.

258
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,306
Actually, no.

259
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,351
There are tons of people to be judged,
so Gaetal can't get caught just yet.

260
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,688
I thought you wanted to be a reporter.

261
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,148
Are you taking the murderer's side?

262
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,943
It is not wrong to punish
criminals who are set free

263
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,403
by incompetent authorities.

264
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,323
And who gave Gaetal
the right to do that? You?

265
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,033
The law?

266
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,204
Nobody has the right to kill a person

267
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:08,291
nor can one person change the rules
for an entire society.

268
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,126
That's what you have to criticize first.

269
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,378
I guess you've never experienced
injustice in your life.

270
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,797
- Enough.
- I bet you never had to see someone

271
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,799
live a good life
after murdering your family.

272
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,594
Because if it ever happened to you,

273
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,139
you wouldn't stick to your ideals
and blame Gaetal.

274
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,106
What if I have?

275
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,112
If I've been through the same thing,

276
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,823
do I have the right to arrest him?

277
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,202
Hey, mister.

278
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,495
People call you a smart-ass, right?

279
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,830
Right back at you.

280
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,123
He's so annoying.

281
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,125
Min, wait...

282
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,511
Darn it.

283
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:23,866
Hey.

284
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,660
I told you to give it a rest.

285
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,371
You can't be so honest all the time.
You'll get in real trouble.

286
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,664
Aren't you even scared?

287
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,795
Come to the station
as soon as school's over tomorrow.

288
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,422
We need your statement.

289
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,840
Why should I?

290
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,634
Because you and your friend
saw the culprit.

291
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,220
Don't be scared.
Just tell them what you saw.

292
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,514
Whatever!

293
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,057
The neighbors are going to gossip,

294
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,393
so kick him out early tomorrow.

295
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,062
And tell him to empty our recycle bin.

296
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,024
Fine.

297
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,818
Jeez, that temper of hers...

298
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,492
You held a press conference on a whim?

299
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,911
What are you going to do
about this disgrace?

300
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:09,996
What's more important is

301
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,498
how Gaetal got the video.

302
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,292
We must resume the investigation now.

303
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,211
Forget it.
Just lie low until I call you again.

304
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:20,089
- And don't talk to anyone.
- I'll go back to the unit.

305
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,175
You clean up the mess,
and I'll catch Gaetal.

306
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,426
That's the only way to handle

307
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,136
- this humiliation.
- Kim Mu-chan, you--

308
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,262
Good gracious!

309
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,697
Don't bother arguing with the higher-ups.

310
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,115
It won't do you any good.

311
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,786
Now, I'm reminded of someone.

312
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:50,870
And that bad breath.

313
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,103
Oh, this.

314
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,148
I got it from a car accident
when I was 20.

315
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,192
Hot shrapnel hit me.

316
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,865
Whenever I'm stressed out,

317
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,784
it starts burning.

318
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,580
Were your parents in the car

319
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,874
when you had the accident?

320
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,585
It's a common story.

321
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,755
At least I was all grown up
when they passed.

322
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,842
But my sister was still...

323
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:49,345
She saw our parents die,

324
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,348
so she's a little too protective of me.

325
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,810
She's probably afraid of ending up alone.

326
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,605
That's why she insisted
on following me yesterday.

327
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:03,860
It's all my fault.

328
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:16,205
Now it's your turn to open up.

329
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,292
Kwon Seok-joo was talking to you

330
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:23,671
as if you were Gaetal.

331
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,258
And there must've been a reason for it.

332
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,930
What happened between you two?

333
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,745
EIGHT YEARS AGO

334
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,664
I don't like this. I feel stuffy.

335
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,791
I feel so stuffy.

336
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,839
Five charges of sexual harassment.

337
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,008
Two charges each of trespassing
and sexual assault.

338
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,135
Since he was a minor
with an intellectual disability,

339
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,179
he always had his sentences reduced

340
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,889
or he settled with the victims.

341
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,349
I bet it cost a fortune too.

342
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,976
I wonder what kind of parents would pay

343
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,229
for all those settlements
for such a scumbag.

344
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,688
But the thing is...

345
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,316
He's registered at the chairman
of Samdo Steel's address.

346
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:29,278
You know his new wife
is an assemblywoman, right?

347
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:31,948
I'm not interested in politics.

348
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,075
Apparently, his father
is the chairman's driver

349
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,327
and his mother is the housekeeper there.

350
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,580
It seems the chairman paid
for his lawyer and settlement.

351
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:41,374
They're like family, I hear.

352
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,752
I bet he has money to burn,

353
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,255
but there must be a reason
why he paid the settlements

354
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,298
for his employee's son.

355
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,468
FINAL TRIAL OF BYUN WOO-TAEK

356
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,552
Your Honor.

357
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,137
We just received the DNA test results

358
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,932
from an object belonging to the victim
that was found belatedly.

359
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:00,309
Permission to submit
this as additional evidence?

360
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:04,105
What's odd is that this new evidence
the police found

361
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,190
looks very similar to... No.

362
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:09,652
It's identical to the toy.

363
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,531
Order in the court. Silence!

364
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,582
This is the plush toy
the victim always carried around.

365
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,584
A deliver worker
who'd often run into the victim

366
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:27,920
found this in front of her house
and reported it.

367
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,213
We had a DNA test done on it,

368
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:30,965
but unlike the prosecution's evidence,

369
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:34,385
neither the defendant's fingerprints
nor his DNA was found

370
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:35,803
on this plush toy.

371
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,726
Results show the only fingerprints
found on it belonged to the victim

372
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,644
and her friends and family.

373
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:47,231
Prosecution, are you sure
the toy in the photo is the victim's?

374
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,774
Prosecutor, please explain.

375
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,282
We will announce the verdict.

376
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,075
To summarize the charges,

377
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,287
the defendant Byun Woo-taek
is charged with kidnapping,

378
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,498
killing, and concealing the body
of Kwon Na-rae.

379
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:07,918
Initially, the defendant
admitted these charges to the police,

380
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:10,713
but later retracted his statement
during the court proceedings,

381
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:14,008
which led to the loss of validity
of his confession.

382
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,219
Moreover, the prosecution
claimed a plush toy

383
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:20,348
with an unidentified bloodstain
and the defendant's DNA

384
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,600
belonged to the victim.

385
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:26,062
However, it was deemed to be
a different piece of evidence

386
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,230
from the toy the defense submitted.

387
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,609
So in accordance with Article 325
of the Criminal Procedure Act,

388
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,152
I declare the defendant innocent.

389
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:35,654
Your Honor.

390
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,852
- Are we going home?
- Yes, let's go.

391
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,229
Let's go home.

392
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,276
Let's go.

393
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:16,737
Let's go home.

394
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,140
Thank you.

395
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,112
Hello.

396
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:30,603
Stop it.

397
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:33,731
Seok-joo...

398
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,156
The culprit was set free
practically because of me,

399
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,325
so he must deeply resent me.

400
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:48,245
And that led to Kwon Seok-joo killing him,

401
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,081
so in a way, it is all my fault.

402
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:55,961
We investigate and catch criminals,

403
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,880
but we don't judge them, so why?

404
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,842
If Kwon Seok-joo still resents you,

405
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:05,638
I think it just means
that he needs someone to blame.

406
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,142
Maybe.

407
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:14,730
By the way,

408
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:17,191
I wonder where Gaetal got
the video of Seorae High.

409
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:20,611
Judging by the conversation in the video,
students must've filmed it.

410
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,865
The Cyber Bureau had kept an eye online

411
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:27,576
in case someone uploaded the video,
but they didn't find anything.

412
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,454
Gaetal can't have approached
the kids first.

413
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,831
Let's find the kids who filmed it first.

414
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:34,583
Then, we might find something.

415
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,107
She was strangled to death

416
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,318
with something that's about 2 cm thick.

417
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:04,405
The bruises on her shoulders
suggest that he stepped on them

418
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,907
to strangle her more forcefully.

419
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:10,494
The killer is presumed
to be a man about 180 cm tall.

420
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:12,288
Since there's no ligature mark,

421
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,582
it seems that he used something
that's elastic.

422
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,001
I'll take a look at past cases for this.

423
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,170
The victim's heels are severely scraped

424
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:23,007
and her fingers show redness,
which shows she resisted.

425
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,720
It seems she fought hard against him.

426
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,556
Then, the perpetrator
must have been injured too, right?

427
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,267
In most cases,
victims scratch the perpetrators' hands.

428
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,020
But this time, we only found

429
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,564
a little bit of latex
from under the victim's fingernails.

430
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:41,108
I don't think
the murderer was Gaetal this time.

431
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,068
The man I fought with
at Kwon Seok-joo's place

432
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,987
was muscular and good at martial arts.

433
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,865
He would've killed her right away.

434
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:48,991
Then, who did this?

435
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,660
Who in the world
are we supposed to go after?

436
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:59,335
SELF-STUDY

437
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:01,063
- Did you make a reservation?
- Yes.

438
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,234
You'd like to resell
the Moon Night Blossom model, right?

439
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,318
Yes.

440
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,112
It seems you're a new customer.

441
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,279
Was it a gift?

442
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:12,074
Stop asking me questions.
You're annoying me.

443
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,827
You didn't bring the case
and the warranty card.

444
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,496
Then, I'm afraid we can't take this back.

445
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,248
You've got to be kidding me.

446
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,250
I know this one's a limited edition,

447
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,545
so I can resell it
without the warranty card.

448
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,879
Right.

449
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:28,132
By the way, aren't you an actress?

450
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:31,844
No, I'm not.

451
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,430
Hello, ma'am.

452
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,597
Hey.

453
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,022
- Close the store.
- Yes, ma'am.

454
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,574
Are you crazy?

455
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,201
You know I can destroy
your son's life instantly, right?

456
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:57,703
You're very loud.

457
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,956
My neck hurts. Sit down.

458
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,090
Are you crazy, lady?

459
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,718
I picked the one
that suits where you belong,

460
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,136
so just keep your mouth shut.

461
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,436
If you ever say anything
about my son to anyone,

462
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,480
it won't end like this then.

463
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:31,195
Are you kidding me?

464
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,696
A 100-million-won watch

465
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:35,866
for this?

466
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,869
You should've put in some more then.

467
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:42,873
This is the problem with kids these days.

468
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,668
They just don't know their place
and keep wanting more.

469
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,090
You'll have to change jobs
starting tomorrow.

470
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:05,479
Right. I want you to order
the jewelry you recommended.

471
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,314
I love it.

472
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:08,816
Thank you, ma'am.

473
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:28,794
Guys, look.

474
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:30,963
What is it?

475
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,216
What's happening?

476
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,889
Should we call someone?

477
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,020
Guys.

478
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,439
When you borrow money,
you need to pay back in time.

479
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:52,192
I worked hard to earn that, you know.

480
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,278
You forced me to borrow it.

481
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:57,114
Listen to this bitch.

482
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,118
The reason for that is

483
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,912
you were too proud to ask me,

484
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:06,206
so I was being considerate.

485
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,332
Aren't you grateful?

486
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,126
Hey, friend.

487
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,335
Pay the interest first.

488
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:13,255
The interest for 5,000 won is 50,000 won?
That's nonsense.

489
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,340
- I'm not paying that.
- Nonsense?

490
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:18,010
It's not like we're stealing money
from you, is it?

491
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,053
Answer me, you bastard.

492
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,851
How about we make it fair and vote on it?

493
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,605
Guys, come here.

494
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,151
Who thinks what I'm doing is wrong?

495
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:35,861
Anyone?

496
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,447
Think about it. I just want my money back.

497
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,658
Raise your hand
if you think what I'm doing is wrong.

498
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,328
If over half of us think so,
I'll admit it.

499
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,746
No one?

500
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,706
No one?

501
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,207
- Okay.
- I do.

502
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:51,627
Isn't that So-ra?

503
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,591
You know you look ridiculous, right?

504
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,761
Playing loan shark
and Killing Vote at school?

505
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,721
You think this is a game?

506
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,314
Guys, stand up.

507
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,690
Come on. Let's go.

508
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,198
That crazy little...

509
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,991
You little...

510
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,387
You think you own that air purifier?

511
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,889
I'm feeling so stuffy.

512
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:48,517
I can't breathe.

513
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,143
Don't be selfish.

514
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:51,561
You're blocking it.

515
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,814
The air isn't circulating properly.

516
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,649
Why don't you turn on the AC then?

517
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:56,733
God, just move.

518
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:58,360
Then, everything will be fine.

519
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,444
Turn up the purifier.

520
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,405
We all need to cool off.

521
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,825
WIND SPEED

522
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:05,993
Sir.

523
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:30,559
I'm sorry.

524
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:35,022
Let it slide just this once.

525
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,864
I'm not afraid of the reporters

526
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,324
or the people cussing at me,

527
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:49,578
but I was mad at myself

528
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,663
for getting all of you blamed too.

529
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,375
If you don't want me
to be your leader anymore,

530
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:56,460
I'll accept that.

531
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:58,795
So just say it.

532
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,756
This is hilarious.

533
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:05,302
Stop it. We know you'd rather die
than saying sorry.

534
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,304
This isn't like you.

535
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,097
You're alive. That's what matters.

536
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,474
Just treat us to some beef.

537
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,225
Yoon-ji.

538
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:15,520
Are you sure just some beef would do?

539
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:19,191
And beef brisket for the last course.

540
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,364
In hard times like this,
we must stick together.

541
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:27,449
Let's just move on.

542
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,826
But the superintendent's morality
has been questioned--

543
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,412
No, Jjoo. This is a limited edition...

544
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:33,663
Darn it.

545
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,503
Darn it.

546
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,715
This is where Bae Gi-chul's wife
was killed.

547
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,300
We haven't found any suspects

548
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,761
around the estimated time of death, but...

549
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,806
The culprit doesn't seem
to be a first-timer.

550
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,183
He doesn't seem to be an expert though.

551
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,352
Still, he could be a hitman.

552
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,938
We're making a list
of ex-convicts with similar MOs.

553
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:00,524
There's a good chance

554
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,776
that he pretended to be Gaetal
to confuse us.

555
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,487
Let the local precinct
take care of this case for now.

556
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:08,365
They could start
with possible enemies of the victim.

557
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,534
What about the guy from Kwon's house?

558
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,911
It might be the same culprit
for both cases.

559
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,331
He must know the area well.
He sneaked out through blind spots.

560
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,667
One camera caught his face,

561
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,377
but it's hard to identify
someone in a mask.

562
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,506
- Hyun.
- Yes?

563
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,717
Are your sister and her friend
coming to give their statements today?

564
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:29,928
I have something to ask her friend.

565
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,680
They should've been here by now.

566
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,140
I'll check what's going on.

567
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,768
MIN'S HOMEROOM TEACHER

568
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,398
Wait. There.

569
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,320
Hello, this is Min's older sister.

570
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,159
Superintendent Kim, that man...

571
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,832
I think he's that taxi driver.

572
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,001
- Ko Dong-gyu.
- Right?

573
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,378
But what was he doing there?

574
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:08,967
I'll be right back.

575
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,594
My sister is hurt.

576
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,180
What? Min...

577
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:22,355
Who will be the next one?
I'm already scared.

578
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,025
I actually kind of like Gaetal.

579
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,943
For innocent people like us,

580
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:29,279
it's quite satisfying to watch the voting,

581
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,822
like a breath of fresh air.

582
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:33,116
I agree. I like Gaetal too.

583
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,161
Dr. Oh.

584
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,121
That patient is still under anesthesia.

585
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,748
Is that so?

586
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,209
She should wake up soon.

587
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:44,336
Let me check on her again.

588
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:47,589
Ms. Lee Eun-ha?

589
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,095
You should wake up now.

590
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:21,873
Your heart rate seems stable.

591
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:24,542
Excuse me. Hello?

592
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,169
I'll be right there.

593
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:27,254
That pervert--

594
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,674
Are you okay?

595
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,010
Are you being nosy again?
You want more trouble?

596
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:36,846
You're being a total nuisance now.

597
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,933
Should I just leave him, then?
I'm sure he was taking photos of her.

598
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:46,398
Acting without solid evidence
is just being nosy.

599
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,566
You can't even catch them that way.

600
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:52,195
I know people like him pretty well.

601
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,198
You need to collect more evidence

602
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:56,658
and take them down in one swoop.

603
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:59,452
But while I do that,
there will be more victims.

604
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,372
That can't be avoided.

605
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:04,416
Now, that's a load of crap.

606
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,294
I'd rather be a complete nuisance

607
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,838
than a coward.

608
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:11,756
Being a nuisance is better.

609
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:18,972
What?

610
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,896
The offending students
are being investigated by the police now.

611
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,481
Have you decided what to do?

612
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:29,941
He's not too hurt,

613
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:32,485
so covering the hospital bill
should be enough.

614
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:34,362
- Are you sure?
- You'll see later--

615
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,031
I'm looking for a student.

616
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,825
Joo Min from Seorae High.
She's a school violence victim.

617
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,201
One moment, please.

618
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:41,953
- Are you Min's sister?
- What?

619
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,581
Hello, I'm Min's homeroom teacher.

620
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:49,169
It's just a minor scratch,
so you don't have to worry too much.

621
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:52,088
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

622
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:53,798
It's nice to meet you too.

623
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:56,176
Min's injury is minor
thanks to her friend Ji-hoon,

624
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:59,387
who got hurt more severely
trying to protect her.

625
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:01,931
The offenders are being investigated
by the police now.

626
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:04,184
I'll go check on them
once Ji-hoon is done here.

627
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,895
Is Ji-hoon badly hurt?

628
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:08,438
Hyun.

629
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,358
You!

630
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,401
Hey, I'm a patient.

631
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:15,362
You were being nosy again, weren't you?

632
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:17,030
You could die, you know.

633
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,406
I was in the pursuit of justice.

634
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,492
Justice, my foot. Shut that mouth.

635
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,705
Ji-hoon, Min owes you once again.

636
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:27,415
Thank you so much, and I'm sorry.

637
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:30,627
Well, I was in the pursuit of justice too.

638
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,754
So it's okay.

639
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,714
I'll pay for the hospital bill,

640
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:36,966
so make sure to take care
of your injuries. Okay?

641
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,010
Okay.

642
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:41,096
Right. This is Ji-hoon's grandmother.

643
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,806
She works here at the hospital.

644
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,975
You must be so worried. I'm so sorry.

645
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,436
Your grandson got hurt
because of my sister.

646
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,188
I'm terribly sorry.

647
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,774
The wound is not as serious as it seems.

648
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,818
Don't worry about it.

649
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:57,070
Still, he needs to concentrate
on his studies.

650
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,530
I'll take good care of him.

651
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,032
Ji-hoon.

652
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:03,284
I'll tell Min to take you
to the doctor regularly.

653
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:04,577
Get well soon.

654
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,414
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

655
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,417
I'm sorry.

656
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,461
I need to head to the police station now.

657
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:16,172
Ji-hoon, rest up.
I'll see you again later.

658
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:17,715
Yes, of course.

659
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:20,468
- I'm sorry.
- Get well soon.

660
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:22,011
Bye.

661
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:31,020
You better stay away from her.

662
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:34,858
Her sister is a cop, so imagine
how precarious her life is.

663
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,360
I will.

664
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:41,197
What happened today
will never happen again.

665
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:43,450
I really hope not.

666
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:46,619
You can go now.

667
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:58,339
I'm sorry we had to meet
under these circumstances.

668
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:00,425
I'll guide her better.

669
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:01,509
Don't worry about it.

670
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:03,678
I don't need your guidance.
I'm good on my own.

671
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,683
By the way, I only heard
that it was school violence.

672
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,561
Will Min have to answer questions
during the investigation?

673
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,062
Who are the offenders?

674
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:15,106
They were born evil.

675
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,691
I should've put them behind bars.

676
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,359
- Hey.
- The offenders are

677
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,404
so-called bullies from our school.

678
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:24,782
Min and Ji-hoon were trying
to stop them from bullying other kids.

679
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:26,576
Ji-hoon's grandmother says

680
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,912
that she'll settle
for paying the hospital bills,

681
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:31,539
but we don't know
what the police will say.

682
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:34,918
The police said they might call Min
to hear about what happened.

683
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,921
I'll check that
with the patrol station in charge.

684
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,590
Right. I hear you're a police officer.

685
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:43,343
Why don't you come
and give a special career lecture?

686
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,512
Sure. I'd be glad to help.

687
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:47,388
I'll see you around.

688
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:48,973
All right. Have a good night.

689
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:50,350
See you tomorrow.

690
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,645
Isn't he awesome?

691
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,274
You're such an embarrassment.

692
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:11,037
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER
RESPECTING HUMANITY

693
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,539
DEAR PROF. KWON
FROM YOUR NO. 1 FAN

694
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,708
Was this really sent to Kwon?

695
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:17,335
Yes. Look here.

696
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:22,590
The prison name, inmate name,
and inmate number were all written here.

697
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,344
You've got to be kidding me.

698
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:29,264
This is not a good time
with the Killing Vote and all.

699
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:33,184
If this gets out,
Inmate 0512 will have to be transferred.

700
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:35,895
Well...

701
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,064
I'm just worried.

702
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:41,401
They'll select a new commissioner soon,
so there might be an audit.

703
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:43,361
Everything you've done for him...

704
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,530
Some people will get the wrong idea.

705
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,866
You're right.

706
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:52,036
I've been quite nice to Inmate 0512.

707
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:54,205
Sir.

708
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:56,040
He's a murderer.

709
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:59,627
Those who got human blood on their hands

710
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:00,920
never change.

711
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,257
You should just get rid of him.

712
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,466
Hi, Hyun. It's been a while.

713
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,843
I was so surprised to see you
with Superintendent Kim.

714
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,345
Why didn't you say you joined the unit?

715
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,889
Let's skip the small talk
or we'll upset each other.

716
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:54,766
Give me Gaetal's contact.

717
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,684
Why would I have that?

718
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,479
I heard you gave it to other reporters.

719
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,190
I know you heard everything
from Gaetal in advance.

720
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:03,775
Forget it.

721
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,361
If you don't have his contact,
tell me how to reach him.

722
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:09,322
Hyun, you're still so cute.

723
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:11,991
This is why working with you
was so much fun.

724
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:13,660
Fun?

725
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:15,912
Did you say "fun"?

726
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:17,997
My gosh.

727
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:19,457
I guess scumbag reporters think

728
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,294
it's fun to make a person
look like a traitor for a scoop.

729
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:25,129
Speaking of which,

730
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:27,382
what did I do that was so wrong?

731
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,425
It's a fact that Min Ji-young

732
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:31,511
led a DDoS attack
against the election committee.

733
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:35,098
And you were the one who got mad
about your superiors covering it up.

734
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:37,350
All of my stories are based on facts.

735
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,018
You revealed my real name!

736
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:41,729
Thanks to that, my team leader was fired
and I was the scapegoat.

737
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,272
But you also got a promotion.

738
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:46,609
Shouldn't we call it even?

739
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:52,615
About the Killing Vote,

740
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:56,244
it seems to be bringing
all our enemies from the past together.

741
00:49:57,286 --> 00:50:00,039
I think there was something
between your leader and Min Ji-young too.

742
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,333
Do you know anything about it?

743
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,508
You know what?

744
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:14,011
Thanks to scumbag reporters,
my arresting skills have improved.

745
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:15,138
So let's call it even.

746
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,098
Now, tell me how you reached Gaetal.

747
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,726
Let go! I don't know anything. Let go!

748
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:23,438
Then, who sent the video of my leader
at the prison to Gaetal?

749
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,149
Do you want me to go through
your company's server?

750
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:28,526
Investigate it then
instead of assaulting me!

751
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:30,862
You.

752
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,905
You stabbed the police in the back,

753
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,824
and I will never let that slide.

754
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,327
I swear I will shake you down.

755
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:48,045
I know you're doing this
because you can't find evidence.

756
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:53,593
That psycho...

757
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,019
THE TRUTH BEHIND THE CAR EXPLOSION

758
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:07,106
DELETE

759
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,442
YOUR INBOX IS EMPTY

760
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,949
This one's good.

761
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,580
It's almost too sweet though.

762
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:27,585
This.

763
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,088
Explain it.

764
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:33,674
I took the photo myself.

765
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:35,843
It's a letter sent to Kwon Seok-joo.

766
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:38,679
What I want to know is

767
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,223
when

768
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:42,558
and where you got it.

769
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,479
Since Inmate 0512 was transferred here,

770
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:47,855
he's received tons of letters.

771
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:50,566
"What Inmate 0512 did wasn't murder."

772
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,151
"It's technically self-defense."

773
00:51:52,235 --> 00:51:53,569
Bullshit letters like that.

774
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:56,322
Since this was such a big case
and got a lot of attention,

775
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:59,158
the warden made us
inspect his mail for the first time.

776
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:01,494
Because he didn't want
to be held responsible

777
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:03,329
for any weird letter he could get.

778
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,040
That's how we found

779
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,376
his number one fan.

780
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:12,713
Number one fan?

781
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,056
NO. 1 FAN

782
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,391
One letter per month.

783
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:26,561
This person's been sending letters
for years without fail.

784
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,397
At first, I thought it was
just another psycho.

785
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,190
But since the letters kept coming in,

786
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:34,819
I started to take a closer look
at this Number One Fan's letters.

787
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:40,658
Just a nice big sum. No more, no less.

788
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:48,666
Are you suggesting a deal right now?

789
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:51,043
Between us civil servants?

790
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:53,504
Yes. And only in cash.

791
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,131
I'm sure you know how it works.

792
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,967
Did you think I'd say yes to that?

793
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:01,345
Once you read them,

794
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:03,723
you'll know why I'm doing this.

795
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:14,775
Come on.

796
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:22,825
Park Chul-min,
you're under arrest for violating

797
00:53:22,909 --> 00:53:25,703
Criminal Act, Article 316
and Postal Service Act, Article 48,

798
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:28,205
for unlawful possession
of someone else's postal mail.

799
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:30,166
You'll be charged with theft too.

800
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:33,544
I'll take the letters as evidence.

801
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:35,588
Wait. This is excessive force.
My lawyer will--

802
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,715
My bones. Fine.

803
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,217
Just buy me one more piece of cake, then.

804
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:42,178
I was going to give them to you anyway.

805
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:45,348
I'm sorry, sir.

806
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:46,432
#GAETALTV
#KIM MU-CHAN

807
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:48,100
#CHAE DO-HEE

808
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:16,796
Why are you still here?

809
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:18,089
Calling it even.

810
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:19,298
What?

811
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,676
Someone messed with me
and wants to call it even,

812
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,970
so I'm looking for a way
to mess with her too.

813
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,810
You specialize in data analysis, right?

814
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:15,438
JUSTICE, INNOCENT, DEVILS

815
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:17,690
EVE, BURN THE UTERUS, JUSTICE, TREND

816
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:18,899
SOCIETY, GROUP, SIN...

817
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:25,656
JUSTICE, INNOCENT, DEVIL,
PROFESSOR, SINNERS...

818
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,427
The letters were sent
from different places in the country.

819
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,803
Every single one of them.

820
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,766
Why do you think Number One Fan is Gaetal?

821
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:53,517
Listen to this.

822
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,021
"To Professor Kwon Seok-joo.

823
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,439
Apparently, for some people,

824
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:01,358
pleasure is what decides right from wrong.

825
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:04,195
And these people use wrongful methods

826
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,448
to maximize their pleasure,
which I find ironic."

827
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,909
"Just like the news I watched today."

828
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:11,952
These perverted criminals committed

829
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:15,081
something they shouldn't have.
It's disgusting.

830
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:17,875
I wonder what punishment
you would have given

831
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,543
to the criminals I saw...

832
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:22,755
I thought to myself you'd stuff
their dirty money into their throats.

833
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:27,426
Imagining you revealing the true colors
of those evil beings to the people

834
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,553
makes me feel better.

835
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:32,098
"I'm glad your standards of good and evil

836
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:34,266
always align with mine.

837
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,684
From your Number One Fan."

838
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:40,481
"Stuff their money into their throats."

839
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,191
"Revealing the true colors."

840
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,237
Bae Gi-chul?

841
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,656
Now, here comes the next one.

842
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:55,204
"His sin was to never doubt Eve

843
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,706
and to sow his seeds in her womb.

844
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:01,794
So I'm going to burn
the uterus of this evil Eve."

845
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:07,883
Uhm Eun-gyeong died from poisoning,

846
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:11,887
but her lower body was completely
destroyed during the explosion.

847
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,142
Does this mean this lunatic

848
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:19,520
has been sharing his murder plans
with Kwon Seok-joo in advance?

849
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:23,107
Number One Fan is, without a doubt,

850
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,191
Gaetal.

851
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:29,363
By the way,
isn't something off about his letters?

852
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,783
The first page is just a greeting.

853
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,578
On the second page,
he describes his murder plan.

854
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:37,204
But the overall flow isn't natural.

855
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:38,831
There are some words missing.

856
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:41,750
These letters are missing some pages
in the middle.

857
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:45,004
We should find out
if this was Kwon Seok-joo's doing

858
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,547
or Park Chul-min's.

859
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,426
If someone did that
knowing the letters would get out,

860
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:53,512
and if the targets were written on them,

861
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,766
it must be Kwon Seok-joo.

862
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:03,439
DEVIL

863
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,444
NO. 1 FAN

864
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:19,455
I will kill the devils who
were deemed innocent for you.

865
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,498
Kwon Seok-joo.

866
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:23,751
It seems

867
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:26,212
there's something he wants from us.

868
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:40,643
Hello.

869
00:58:41,227 --> 00:58:42,519
Hello, sir.

870
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:43,812
Hello.

871
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,255
He has asthma caused by collapsed lung.

872
00:59:09,338 --> 00:59:10,422
Has he been getting treatment?

873
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:14,301
A pretty good doctor
has been coming by regularly

874
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:16,512
to check up on him

875
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:17,805
and give him prescriptions.

876
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,100
He had a meeting with you every week.

877
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:25,145
Do other inmates get this benefit too?

878
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,898
Why do I feel like I'm being interrogated?

879
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:30,943
It's just a formality,

880
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,861
so please don't take it personally.

881
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:43,289
I think I can take it from here.

882
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:44,665
Are you asking me

883
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,418
to leave now?

884
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:48,961
This investigation is confidential.

885
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,675
Damn it.

886
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:48,729
Calm down.

887
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:51,482
And keep a neutral pose.

888
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,859
Don't stay too close or too far.

889
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:59,073
If you seem too aggressive, Kwon
will notice that and use it against you.

890
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:05,788
No need to bow down to him.

891
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:07,414
Remember. He's the one

892
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,041
who invited you here.

893
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:52,811
THE 13TH ONE WAS WRONG

894
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:33,227
It's nice to listen to it.

895
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:36,313
Thank you.

896
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:40,984
Gaetal may have scribbled
on your wall a bit,

897
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:43,153
but he didn't make a huge mess.

898
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:45,781
It had good natural lighting.

899
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:47,866
It was a very nice house.

900
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:02,548
You must be familiar

901
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:04,341
with these letters.

902
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:21,108
You've violated the Privacy Act.

903
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,694
Given the severity,
you could even get a prison sentence.

904
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:27,114
I just found them in the prison trash can.

905
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:31,910
But you just admitted

906
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,581
that they're yours.

907
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:41,461
These letters Gaetal sent
under the alias "Number One Fan"

908
01:04:41,962 --> 01:04:46,508
describe in detail how the victims
of the Killing Vote would be executed.

909
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:48,343
However,

910
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:51,263
some pages are missing.

911
01:04:53,724 --> 01:04:55,642
I'm suspecting the targets

912
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:57,644
were written on them.

913
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:02,107
You were just playing innocent, right?

914
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:04,901
You actually know Gaetal's

915
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:06,945
next target, don't you?

916
01:05:12,326 --> 01:05:14,703
There were no specific names on it.

917
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:18,540
They had the news stories
that made him angry.

918
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:21,043
If you try to guess using that,

919
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:23,211
you may be able to find his next target.

920
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:30,927
You're right.
There was information about his targets.

921
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:33,096
Where are they?

922
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,556
The missing pages.

923
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:50,822
You'll never find them.

924
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:07,589
- But why--
- That way,

925
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:11,093
the police will realize they need me,
and they'll negotiate with me.

926
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:14,346
In that case...

927
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:17,140
Detective Kim Mu-chan.

928
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:21,812
Don't just try to get
the information from me.

929
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:23,897
Get me out of here.

930
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,566
This is an official proposal.

931
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,737
On the condition of receiving
a special pardon,

932
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:33,281
I will cooperate with your investigation

933
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,325
on the Killing Vote.

934
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:48,505
Visiting time has ended.

935
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:54,553
It was a pleasure talking with you,

936
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:56,138
Lieutenant Joo Hyun.

937
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:34,676
Inmate 0512.

938
01:07:57,616 --> 01:07:59,659
I put the letters in order,

939
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:02,204
and this is the part
that describes the method in detail.

940
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:05,582
"Since the victim had to suffer
the pain of suffocation,

941
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:07,501
the best way to punish him

942
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:10,378
would be to inflict the same pain on him."

943
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:12,214
"The pain of suffocation" probably means

944
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,633
that the victim was suffocated to death.

945
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:17,761
Once again, the judiciary of this country
took the perpetrator's side,

946
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:19,554
a sex offender,

947
01:08:19,638 --> 01:08:23,266
and implicitly allowed
the systematic culture of rape.

948
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:28,772
Of course, I do realize the system
is essential in this country, but...

949
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:31,316
Systematic?

950
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:34,569
The reason why sex crimes
are often overlooked in Korea

951
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:40,158
is that most of the relationships
in this society are highly vertical.

952
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:42,661
Comparing your boss to your parents

953
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:47,040
or calling each other with your job titles
shows it's all about power.

954
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,793
"Director," "Senior," "Teacher."

955
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:52,712
Calling people by these titles

956
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:55,382
gives you the feeling
that you cannot mess with them.

957
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:17,904
There are definitely
a lot of heinous sex criminals

958
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:22,033
who cunningly get away with their crimes
thanks to legal loopholes.

959
01:09:22,117 --> 01:09:24,119
And for some groups of people,
it's even easier.

960
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:28,957
And Number One Fan
said this country needed that group.

961
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:34,129
It's the military.

962
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:55,335
It's nice to see you,

963
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:56,503
Kim Mu-chan.

964
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,797
Start narrowing down
Kwon Seok-joo's associates

965
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,923
to those who might be Gaetal.

966
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:01,383
Gaetal must be one of them.

967
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:03,885
Hello, my fellow citizens.

968
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:06,221
The person you'll be voting for today is

969
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:07,722
the so-called Captain Oh.

970
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:10,892
That bitch put me in such a bind
when she suddenly died!

971
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:14,062
Superintendent Kim Mu-chan.

972
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:15,897
Do you really want to save
a scumbag like that?

973
