1
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,002
WOULD YOU LIKE TO VOTE?

2
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:00,019
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,395
SAFETY OF CHILD ACTORS WAS ENSURED

4
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:06,484
TEN YEARS AGO

5
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,334
Hyun, we have a guest.

6
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:40,810
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,687
I'm so sorry.

8
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:47,274
My job doesn't pay much,
and I'd worked overnight for a few days.

9
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,902
I really messed up.

10
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,696
You were drunk.

11
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,408
You ran away to hide
that you were drunk driving.

12
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,244
They were trapped

13
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,080
and asked you to save them.

14
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:03,999
Look, kid.

15
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,878
I just dozed off.

16
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:14,927
I'll come back another time.

17
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,350
Liar. I smelled the alcohol.

18
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,977
I know what that stench was.

19
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,979
- Please stop!
- You were drunk driving!

20
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,689
You killed my mom and dad!

21
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,524
Say you killed them!

22
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,025
- Let go!
- Say it!

23
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,610
- Say it!
- Hurry and go.

24
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,071
Bring my mom and dad back!

25
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,117
Bring them back!

26
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,290
Mom...

27
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,712
COURT

28
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,049
PUNISH THE DRUNK DRIVER

29
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,180
How do you feel about this?

30
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,933
Please give us a word.

31
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,476
Could you give us a comment?

32
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,523
She left the car there and disappeared.
Then, she reappeared two days later.

33
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:12,985
Alcohol can't be detected
after 20 hours, so she wasn't tested.

34
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,946
There was a DUI checkpoint
near the scene that day.

35
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,782
Look. The plate numbers are the same.

36
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,786
I think she hit our car
while trying to avoid the checkpoint.

37
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,415
How did you find all of this, kid?

38
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,752
- Good job with the dashcam footage.
- Well, thanks.

39
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,255
But what's certain is
I definitely smelled alcohol.

40
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,965
After the accident,

41
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,509
she removed the memory card
from our dashcam.

42
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,845
She even checked if we were all dead.

43
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,681
And she reeked of alcohol.

44
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,853
I swear. It was drunk driving.

45
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:58,280
You worked so hard.
I hope I can bring you good news.

46
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:01,992
Thank you for listening to me though.

47
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,577
I mean it.

48
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,579
You're the only one...

49
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,999
who's heard me out.

50
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,251
Thank you.

51
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,716
REDEPLOYMENT
KIM MU-CHAN

52
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,097
Sir.

53
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,851
I got the car accident victim's statement.
Want to see?

54
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,770
Sure. I'll be waiting for it.

55
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,189
Why is Violent Crimes on a traffic case?

56
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,275
It was a waste of time.
There's no actual evidence.

57
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:41,115
Hey, this is because of your incompetence.
If you can't even listen, just quit.

58
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,534
Get your act together.

59
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,036
Bring me the statements by today.

60
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,204
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,206
Here's the beer!

62
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,375
- Here.
- Thanks.

63
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,836
Let's drink.

64
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:55,838
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

65
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,049
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up?

66
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,052
So refreshing.

67
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,096
That really hit the spot.

68
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,576
Hey, you said
you'd never play hooky again.

69
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,119
Hyun.

70
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,830
Can you be a killer instead of a cop?

71
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,541
You always ask me to do weird stuff.

72
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,835
Cops can't get revenge on her.

73
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,380
I can't stand seeing her
enjoy her life. I want to kill her.

74
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:39,757
Forget it.

75
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:43,677
The best revenge is to have happy lives.

76
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:49,016
I'll become a great cop,
so there won't be any victims like us.

77
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,852
I'll listen to people
and see investigations through.

78
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:56,523
A great cop catches criminals.
Listening isn't enough.

79
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,068
Listening to people
is very comforting to them.

80
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,986
Fine. Go ahead and be a cop.

81
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,908
Just don't do anything risky.
We weren't born at the same time,

82
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,744
but we promised to die together.
Don't forget that.

83
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,246
Well, we don't have to do that.

84
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,625
I'll pass. You live a long life,
and I'll take care of myself.

85
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,461
You scratch your scar
when you're uncomfortable.

86
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,463
We're not going to die together?

87
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,758
That's something humans can't control.

88
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,303
Let's live our own lives.

89
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,600
Hyun!

90
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,215
Kill Kwon Seok-joo.

91
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,011
We can take him alive. Give us more time.

92
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,557
There are two of them.
What if they detonate a bomb?

93
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,684
Kill them before it's too late.

94
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,147
Let me ask you one thing.

95
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,898
Is this order

96
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:23,610
coming from police executives
without the same external pressures

97
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,947
that bound Lieutenant Choi
eight years ago?

98
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:32,077
Are you certain this decision
wasn't made out of self-interest?

99
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,128
Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.

100
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,060
Change of plans.
We're negotiating with Kwon.

101
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,980
- I'll do it myself.
- What? Negotiate?

102
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,276
We found booby traps
inside the wall and at the entrance.

103
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,366
Kwon and Park. You're surrounded.

104
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,830
- Darn it.
- I'm coming to you now. I'm unarmed.

105
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,749
Let's talk it out.

106
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,669
This has gone far enough.
Let's not cause any more casualties.

107
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:23,754
They're already here.

108
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,632
Are you going to let it end like this?

109
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,843
When his daughter
was murdered eight years ago,

110
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,845
the cops knew Lee Min-soo was...

111
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,180
- Ji-hoon.
- Professor.

112
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:37,100
The police are watching
every move you make.

113
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,143
Turn yourselves in.

114
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,358
Ji-hoon's using Lee's computer
to stream through our agency's server.

115
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,110
I'll catch up with him soon,
so hang in there.

116
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,196
You said they're coming here.
What's the problem?

117
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,116
Min's offered a bounty on his head.
If they catch him, he'll be in danger.

118
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,705
Secure those two as fast as you can.

119
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,125
My father's going to take his own life.

120
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,669
But why does he have to?

121
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,465
Those who destroyed our happiness
never paid for what they did.

122
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,841
Why is it always

123
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,555
the righteous people
who are strict with themselves?

124
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,101
Please call Lieutenant Joo.
I must tell her something.

125
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:26,733
Holy cow, 200 million?

126
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,444
We could buy new motorbikes with that.

127
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,072
This sounds awesome.

128
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,699
Let's go, guys.

129
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,496
I got my GED thanks to the professor.
I'm now studying for the SATs.

130
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,791
He's a good man.
I'll support him until the end.

131
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,002
I won't cast a vote.

132
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,092
- Should we vote?
- Gaetal's been wronged.

133
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,762
- I feel bad. I won't vote.
- I'm voting. He did kill them.

134
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,848
- He wants to die.
- Still, it's not right.

135
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,433
- I'm against this.
- I'm not.

136
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,310
- I'm not voting.
- Me neither.

137
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,771
DO YOU VOTE "YES" OR "NO"?

138
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,150
These sons of...

139
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,109
Step on it!

140
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,948
I'll go alone.

141
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,742
- Take out the booby traps.
- Yes, sir.

142
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,971
I ABSTAIN

143
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,563
Ma'am, the entire nation is watching,

144
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,399
and Kim Mu-chan
won't listen to me anymore.

145
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:53,445
That criminal planted a bomb.
And you let Kim get in the way?

146
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,659
If this gets out,
you think you can handle it?

147
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:00,911
Give me some time.

148
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,788
I will deal with this.

149
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:06,792
If no one's on site to take charge,
then go there yourself.

150
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,586
Go and shoot him.
At least earn what I paid you for.

151
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,129
Shoot and kill Kwon!

152
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:15,300
I said kill him! Kill him!

153
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,844
Kill him!

154
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,064
VOTING WILL CLOSE

155
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,148
VOTING HAS CLOSED

156
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:31,108
Please.

157
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,569
MAJORITY ABSTAINS SO VOTE IS CANCELED

158
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,198
The vote has ended.

159
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,742
Most people abstained, so it's canceled.

160
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,202
VOTE IS CANCELED

161
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,751
You need to make a decision.

162
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,421
Stick to the plan.

163
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:13,275
Sang-jae!

164
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,237
Yes, we're fine.

165
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,573
An animal must have passed by.

166
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,626
How can I leave you here?

167
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,838
That doesn't change what I must do.

168
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,548
This has always been my plan.

169
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,885
Then, let me take over.

170
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,180
The Killing Vote's program.

171
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,056
Let me have it.

172
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,935
I should keep it to carry out your wishes.

173
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,858
People were moved by what you said, right?

174
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,402
I should tell Hyun about this.

175
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:01,490
I still need to go to my father
and stop him from hurting himself.

176
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,868
NUMBER THREE

177
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,954
Number Three turned off his phone.
We can't track him.

178
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,083
I know his general area, so I'm going.

179
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,514
- Ji-hoon.
- Grandma.

180
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,725
I thought you were arrested.
Where are you?

181
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,687
That's right. I'm in a cell now.
They let me call you.

182
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,316
I'm so sorry.

183
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,528
You were made to carry
this burden because of us adults.

184
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:45,283
It's okay to stop now.
Min's sister promised to protect you.

185
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:49,412
And the cops found out
where the Professor is.

186
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,164
Do you think

187
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,625
he'll be okay then?

188
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,502
Yes, he will.

189
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,632
Let's pay for our mistakes
and move on with our lives.

190
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,968
I won't ask you to go off alone again.

191
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,844
Okay.

192
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,056
I'll see you soon...

193
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,017
Grandma.

194
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,911
Let's go see Hyun.

195
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,247
I'll turn myself in.

196
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,249
Okay.

197
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,595
Ji-hoon will turn himself in.

198
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,889
Please keep your promise and protect him.

199
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:50,974
Of course.

200
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,310
I'll do my best.

201
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,896
He disconnected when the stream ended,
but I've located him.

202
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,940
It's the bus stop by Mirim Station.

203
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:17,292
Stay back. Don't come closer!

204
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,431
Darn it.

205
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,616
Darn it.

206
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,497
Kwon is calling.

207
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,166
He wants me to put you
through to him. Should I?

208
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,626
Do it.

209
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,710
Kim Mu-chan.

210
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,338
You came much sooner than I expected.

211
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,215
I almost changed my plan.

212
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,883
I know what you're thinking.

213
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,763
And that's not the best decision.
It won't make you look regretful.

214
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,932
I don't regret what I did.

215
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:18,144
I'm taking responsibility for my actions
that violated the social norms.

216
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,729
Don't run away like this!

217
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,524
It'll only make things harder
for those left behind.

218
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,276
I left evidence showing
that I threatened Ji-hoon

219
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,695
so he was forced to help me.

220
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:31,241
My college friend and lawyer, Kang,
will defend him and Ms. Yang.

221
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,910
But first, call off the APB on him.

222
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,246
If you saw what Ji-hoon did today,

223
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,874
then you'd know how much
leaving him behind would hurt him.

224
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,293
But you're still going to insist?

225
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,087
He'll get over it.

226
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,464
He's strong.

227
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,634
I wish...

228
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:53,722
we had never met.

229
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,562
You should wait to see Min
face the consequences.

230
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,313
Then, it'll really be over.

231
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,695
After calling out for justice,
you can't let this be the end.

232
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,573
So...

233
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,162
Seok-joo?

234
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,541
Are you there?

235
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,015
Na-rae.

236
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,324
Seok-joo!

237
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,123
No!

238
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,835
Seok-joo!

239
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,046
Sang-jae!

240
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,340
Seok-joo! Wake up.

241
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,655
CONNECTION FAILED

242
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,295
Jjoo.

243
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,466
He was definitely here, but...

244
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,511
Gosh, I don't feel good about this.

245
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,804
Me too.

246
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,097
Let's find them quickly.

247
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,223
Okay.

248
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,182
Hey.

249
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:03,977
Right.

250
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,981
This is Kim Jo-dan from the Cyber Bureau.

251
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,732
Bus stop number 20576.

252
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,152
Please check the CCTV footage.
It's urgent. Yes.

253
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,240
- Let's go.
- Okay.

254
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,959
What are you doing?

255
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,133
Ms. Chae, this is the police!

256
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,342
- Open it.
- Yes, sir.

257
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,002
Sir, what brings you here?

258
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:12,795
Are you okay?

259
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,341
- Are you hurt?
- Of course, not. Why would I be?

260
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,885
We saw you being abducted.

261
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,346
You signaled the superintendent
on the phone.

262
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,599
I said that because I wanted
to make up with Hyun.

263
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,394
He must've misunderstood.
I wasn't abducted.

264
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,771
It was even filmed--

265
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,690
I simply received
an unexpected invitation, okay?

266
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:42,200
Anyway, since the director came for me,

267
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:43,952
I'll get going now.

268
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:45,954
As you wish.

269
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,456
It was an interesting conversation.

270
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,627
I won't forget what you said today.

271
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,588
Next time you invite me,
give me a heads-up.

272
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,387
Wait, Ms. Chae!

273
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,243
THEY'RE BULLIES FROM SEORAE HIGH
HE'S WORTH 200 MILLION WON?

274
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,995
Nice.

275
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,123
Stop it!

276
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,751
Hello, everyone.

277
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:37,505
What you're seeing is a guy
with a handsome bounty on his head...

278
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:43,261
Ta-da! Gaetal Kim Ji-hoon
is being brutally executed.

279
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,181
If you don't want to watch, get lost.

280
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,392
Stop it!

281
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:53,146
This con artist told us
to do this and that.

282
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,691
This damn Gaetal treated us
as if we were his slaves.

283
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,402
A devil who was deemed innocent.

284
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,821
Now, I'll give you one minute.

285
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:06,075
If you're in favor of Ji-hoon's execution,
press the like button.

286
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,577
Starting now.

287
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,954
One. Two.

288
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,456
- Three.
- Three.

289
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,665
Four.

290
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,267
Stop, you crazy bastard!

291
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,773
What are you going to do, bitch?
Butt in again?

292
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,776
My sister is a cop.
You'll all go to jail--

293
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,944
Get up.

294
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,789
Hit me as much as you want. I won't move.

295
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,500
But let Min go.

296
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:59,462
You think you're still Gaetal,
you bastard?

297
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,464
No!

298
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,258
Where are you going?

299
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,552
What are you doing?

300
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:09,597
Please stop.

301
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,975
He's completely lost it.

302
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:24,362
GWANAK-GU, SEOUL
GA 2000

303
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,781
ONE MINUTE
45 METERS AWAY

304
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,034
Hey, is a gun necessary?

305
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,494
Those kids are Min's age.

306
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,997
They're not here just for the reward.
They're no ordinary kids.

307
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,249
Darn it.

308
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,434
Hey! What are you doing?

309
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,145
Min. Ji-hoon.

310
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,856
- Hyun!
- Hyun.

311
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,233
Min!

312
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,279
Die, you bastard!

313
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:22,962
No!

314
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,680
Ji-hoon!

315
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:34,932
Run!

316
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,976
Ji-hoon!

317
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:41,772
Min, are you okay?

318
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,110
Hold on.

319
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:47,862
Ji-hoon.

320
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,157
Hyun, I was going to turn myself in.

321
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,617
I know.

322
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,627
Someone's been assaulted
1 km south of Mirim Station.

323
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,713
The victim's been hit in the head
and he's bleeding a lot.

324
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,007
Please come quickly. Now!

325
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:09,759
Sir!

326
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,474
Come back.

327
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:21,187
It's not fair
if you die like this. Come back!

328
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,484
Here.

329
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,371
Ji-hoon.

330
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:42,041
The ambulance is coming.
Everything will be okay.

331
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,292
Ji-hoon!

332
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,589
Do you think my father is all right?

333
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,676
Yes. Don't talk.

334
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,971
That's a relief.

335
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,014
I'm so relieved.

336
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,328
Seok-joo.

337
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:35,928
Ji-hoon.

338
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,767
Ji-hoon?

339
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:46,605
Ji-hoon.

340
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,316
Ji-hoon!

341
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,651
You're just messing with us, right?

342
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:53,904
Kim Ji-hoon!

343
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,866
No!

344
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,161
Hyun, please do something!

345
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,040
No!

346
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,010
Damn it!

347
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:22,141
Kim Mu-chan, you bastard!

348
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,697
Sir.

349
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,366
A moment, please.

350
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:56,592
Park escaped in a car,
so we're trying to track him.

351
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,386
And...

352
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:01,931
Kim Ji-hoon...

353
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:05,476
is dead.

354
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,191
Ji-hoon?

355
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,152
Mu-chan.

356
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,030
Where's Ji-hoon?

357
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,828
- Where's my Ji-hoon?
- It's all your fault.

358
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,538
He worried about you until the end.

359
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,917
He put himself out there to save you,
knowing he'd be in danger!

360
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,211
You said he's your son.

361
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,756
What did you even gain
from dragging that poor boy into this?

362
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,885
What happened to my son?

363
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:44,473
Mu-chan, what happened to Ji-hoon?

364
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,772
A bounty was put on him,

365
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,360
and it led to an incident.

366
00:28:58,696 --> 00:28:59,697
Is he...

367
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,408
Is he hurt badly?

368
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:04,660
Is Ji-hoon...

369
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,037
Is Ji-hoon hurt badly?

370
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:08,998
My son, Ji-hoon...

371
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:10,916
Mu-chan.

372
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,003
No, right?

373
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,923
Mu-chan. I should've died, not him!

374
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,759
Mu-chan, why did he...

375
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:43,782
Ji-hoon...

376
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,142
Can I say goodbye one last time?

377
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,105
That's where I let Na-rae go.

378
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:42,883
Min...

379
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:49,515
How's Min?

380
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:54,937
She hasn't said
or done anything for hours.

381
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,856
I've never seen her like this. I'm scared.

382
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:02,695
By the way, we caught the perpetrators.
They're bullies at Min's school.

383
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:05,656
They wanted the reward.
They also supported Gaetal.

384
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,200
Keep an eye on Min.

385
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:09,827
And inform the superintendent.

386
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,831
- I'm heading there now.
- Okay. Stay safe.

387
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:49,491
If I had just accepted Na-rae's death,

388
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,453
I wouldn't have lost Ji-hoon too.

389
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,665
I've made everyone miserable.

390
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,588
We should've caught Lee back then.

391
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,883
I knew my method was wrong,

392
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,302
but I was so desperate to catch him.

393
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,555
You went down the wrong path,

394
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,141
because I fabricated the evidence.

395
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,272
I'm sorry.

396
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,109
I pretended like I wasn't,

397
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:26,987
but I was always sorry.

398
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,032
I know.

399
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,705
There were times
when I resented you the most,

400
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,668
but I actually hated
our society and country.

401
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,630
I just wanted to show people

402
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:48,759
how strict and proper punishment
could be so comforting to the victims.

403
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,086
There is something

404
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,964
I want you to keep for me.

405
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:29,299
Professor!

406
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:31,719
Professor Kwon!

407
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,138
Don't move, Kim Mu-chan.

408
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,853
Let's not shed more blood.

409
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,771
If you let me and him go,

410
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,107
no one will get hurt.

411
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,443
He took my gun.

412
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,611
I already shot one bullet.

413
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:53,407
Did you hear me?

414
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:56,785
I said let's not shed any more blood.

415
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,496
Professor, come over here.

416
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:04,710
There won't be any hostage exchange.
Drop the gun or you'll die!

417
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:12,092
Everything's ruined anyway.
Let's all die here then.

418
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,178
You think I'm joking?

419
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:16,221
Drop the gun, Kim Mu-chan.

420
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,890
I said drop the gun, bastard!

421
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,267
Drop it!

422
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:26,356
Move. Get away from him.

423
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,993
Let's not risk any lives here.

424
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,078
He's not here to save me.

425
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,875
Right?

426
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,134
Why did you break your promise?

427
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:56,553
You had to sacrifice yourself at the end.

428
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:59,556
We agreed your blood
would change the world.

429
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,474
So why?

430
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:04,186
- Why spare your life?
- I won't make excuses.

431
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,148
I'll help you.

432
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:10,359
I'll help you become a martyr.

433
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:12,736
- So come here.
- Don't go.

434
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:14,863
You're right.

435
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,032
Stop!

436
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,535
My only successor...

437
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:24,498
is you, Chul-min.

438
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:33,507
Now, use this to make
the world you dream of.

439
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,027
Sir!

440
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:36,904
Hyun, what happened?

441
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,388
Spread out!

442
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:09,269
- Check that side too.
- Have you seen this person?

443
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:12,439
Have you seen him?

444
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:13,440
- No.
- No.

445
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,293
NAMBU POLICE AGENCY

446
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:34,378
The Killing Vote case,

447
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:37,464
which had shaken the nation
for the past six months,

448
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,926
has been closed due to the deaths
of the main suspects.

449
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,721
The developer
of the Killing Vote program, Kim Ji-hoon,

450
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:49,643
was killed by members
of a criminal organization

451
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,561
hired by Kwon, the mastermind,

452
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:56,149
as revealed by his last stream,
CCTV footage, and video clips.

453
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,154
The motive was to stop Kim Ji-hoon
from surrendering and to conceal evidence.

454
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:05,242
In addition to the main suspect,
Jung and Park were also killed.

455
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,202
And Yang is under investigation.

456
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,372
We're still investigating
those who aided and abetted

457
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,665
with their votes.

458
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:15,085
We acknowledge that this case
is in the spotlight,

459
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:18,755
and we'll do our best
to investigate the suspects. Thank you.

460
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,257
You're not taking questions?

461
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,843
- Sir!
- Excuse me, sir!

462
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,720
Please answer our questions!

463
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,014
What in the world?

464
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:33,937
You're not covering this?

465
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,814
The case was wrapped perfectly.

466
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:39,526
What he said is so far from the truth
that it's not worth covering.

467
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,570
I'm killing it.

468
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,905
Says the one who blew this up the most.

469
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,368
What deal did you make with Min?
Why lie about the abduction?

470
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,287
What was the bribe?

471
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,917
Be careful with the internet.

472
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,544
Be it emails or comments.

473
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:02,174
Think carefully before you post
an article, because I'll dig it all up.

474
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,551
Bringing down the corrupt media

475
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,345
- will be my mission.
- Lieutenant Joo,

476
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,848
I've never chased money or power.

477
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,558
Believe it or not,

478
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:14,269
I became a reporter
to help create a better world.

479
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,147
But without money or power,

480
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,525
no one will listen
to your calls for justice.

481
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:23,111
A lesser evil will create that world.

482
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,490
One day, you'll grow up and realize that.

483
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,702
I doubt that will ever happen.

484
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,413
I'll always be an immature cop

485
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:37,834
who listens and stands up for the victims.

486
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:39,336
Change the world

487
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,671
all you want.

488
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:49,096
As if you could
actually make a difference.

489
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,640
Jump here.

490
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,142
Jump, jump.

491
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,353
Are you okay?

492
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,816
- Why are the cops here?
- I'll find out.

493
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,617
You can't go in.

494
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,035
- Move.
- Move.

495
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,792
Move!

496
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:43,919
I said move!

497
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:45,754
What do you think you're doing?

498
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,135
- Keep going.
- Yes, sir.

499
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,848
My subordinate forgot
to give you a notice.

500
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:58,892
Sang-jae.

501
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,185
I'm sorry, ma'am.

502
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,855
The warrant is
in your living room. Go check it.

503
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,401
- Let's move. It's getting late.
- Yes, sir.

504
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:12,155
Tell me why you're destroying
my house without permission.

505
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,699
You filed a lawsuit against the police.

506
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,285
We're trying to gather all we can

507
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,330
to defend ourselves.

508
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,831
If that's the reason...

509
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:25,627
I'll drop the charges.

510
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,004
It'll cost more to fix the house.

511
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,967
The commissioner's visiting a temple.
I doubt you'll reach him.

512
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,471
And no lawyer in this country
will come to help.

513
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,515
Your husband

514
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,767
just dumped you.

515
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,358
CHAIRMAN LEE FILES FOR DIVORCE

516
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,821
Last time I was here...

517
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,783
I missed something.

518
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,607
There's another column inside.

519
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:30,942
Break it down now!

520
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,509
Get the reagent and the lights.

521
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:52,774
Looks like we just got our trump card.

522
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:57,070
Also, Detective Choi is conscious again.

523
00:44:57,153 --> 00:45:03,743
He'll testify that you bribed him to forge
and destroy evidence and aid in murder.

524
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:08,581
I think that's enough
to arrest you without a warrant.

525
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:13,253
Fine.

526
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:15,505
Now,

527
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:17,632
I've become tired of this.

528
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:22,303
Save the handcuffs.

529
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:04,804
That was the passcode for the vote.

530
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:07,182
You sure that was okay?

531
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,684
It was the only thing Ji-hoon left us.

532
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:13,646
It's also why he died.

533
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:17,734
I'm sure he would've wanted me to do it.

534
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:23,198
At the press conference,

535
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,451
Min Ji-young and Lee Min-soo
weren't even mentioned.

536
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:27,911
And Kwon Seok-joo...

537
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,290
became a murderer
who killed his adopted son.

538
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,213
You saw this coming.

539
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:47,013
It had to be done so we could arrest
Min Ji-young without a warrant.

540
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:51,184
Showing our weakness
didn't help with the investigation.

541
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:55,897
I had to compromise with the higher-ups
to bring my team to the RIU.

542
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,108
Once again,

543
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,028
you screwed Kwon Seok-joo over.

544
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,949
Like when you fabricated the evidence.

545
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,371
I'm trying to give him what he wanted.

546
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:14,374
We got the evidence to arrest Min.

547
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:17,335
With Jin-soo's testimony,
that's conspiracy for sure.

548
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,506
You're wrong.

549
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:25,093
Kwon Seok-joo didn't just want
to bring Min Ji-young down.

550
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,723
You still don't get it.

551
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:37,730
I appreciate your offer to join the RIU,

552
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:39,524
but I'll go back to HQ.

553
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,861
Thank you for everything.

554
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:54,163
Didn't you want
to work cases like a real cop?

555
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:25,445
ONE YEAR LATER

556
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:36,080
How could you let
your work pile up like this?

557
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,043
How many times
have I told you? Am I wrong?

558
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,878
Should I go on? Because I can.

559
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,631
- Will you please do your job?
- Come on.

560
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:46,507
You said you wanted to work.

561
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:51,012
One year ago, you said you weren't sure
if you were a cop or a contractor.

562
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:54,807
Now, look at you!
You're not an outsider anymore.

563
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:58,770
You're the ace of our team.
Look at you shine.

564
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:01,689
People will get the wrong idea.

565
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:05,568
They'll think I'm the captain now,
because I work here all the time.

566
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:10,114
Come on, Jjoo.
What can we do? You're just too good.

567
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:15,203
So many people come to me these days
asking me to set them up with you.

568
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:19,332
There will be information sharing events
in Japan and Singapore,

569
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:23,086
and the commissioner wants to send you--

570
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,588
Gosh, is there
a loud bird here? I can't work.

571
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:28,257
Somebody is distracting me.

572
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:32,345
You're a bird, I'm a bird

573
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:35,181
Distracting, distracting

574
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:39,102
Rear entrances
intentionally made for computers

575
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:40,436
are called backdoors.

576
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,022
Since they're hard to detect,

577
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:46,192
we often don't realize
how common they are.

578
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:50,863
But they can be found in dashcams
and home security cameras,

579
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:53,574
which seem trivial
but are found everywhere.

580
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:57,787
Gaetal used this method
to transmit his videos to everyone.

581
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,372
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

582
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,457
Since you mentioned Gaetal,

583
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:05,837
both hidden apps and backdoors
sound illegal to me.

584
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,423
So was Gaetal's justice in the right?

585
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:14,554
That case is closed,
so I have nothing to say about it.

586
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,068
Look who I found. Kim Jo-dan.

587
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:33,614
Goodness, my poor eyes.
What a huge transformation.

588
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:38,786
I grew up without a father,

589
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:44,250
so Lieutenant Choi is like a dad,
an uncle, and a brother to me.

590
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,754
I heard my innocent
and hard-working Yoon-ji was seeing you,

591
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,839
so I haven't been able to sleep.

592
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:54,844
You almost took the big sleep,
so maybe you can cut back on it--

593
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:55,762
Hey, you brat.

594
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,265
I'm going to give you a test.

595
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,895
- Do you think it's enough?
- Thank you.

596
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:13,279
I love the way you eat.

597
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:16,157
You added the spicy sauce.

598
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:19,744
- Extra spicy sauce?
- Yes.

599
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,997
I hear you can't handle spice.
Yoon-ji loves it.

600
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,125
If you really love her,
you can adapt to her tastes. Go on.

601
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:28,461
Sure.

602
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:30,129
Can we order extra cheese?

603
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:32,715
- Break up.
- No, I can do this.

604
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:33,841
I can eat it.

605
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,344
- Jjoo is here!
- Hello, Lieutenant.

606
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:41,432
I'll eat the spicy food for him.
Please give them your blessing.

607
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:43,309
- Give it.
- Okay.

608
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:50,358
This is amazing.
It's so good, I could eat it every day.

609
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:51,442
That's cheating.

610
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,822
If you're like a father to Yoon-ji,
he's like my family.

611
00:51:55,905 --> 00:52:00,409
I played a significant role
in turning him into a decent person.

612
00:52:00,493 --> 00:52:02,203
- Mom.
- I'm not your mom.

613
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,538
No?

614
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:06,415
And we can order half spicy and half mild.

615
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,793
You like him that much?

616
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:13,381
He passed.

617
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:16,592
I'll hug her for a moment.

618
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:19,220
Thank you!

619
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,516
What's this?

620
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,232
SALE AT JAESANG MART

621
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:34,527
They're having a sale.

622
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,028
- Right.
- They are.

623
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:38,030
Mine's spam too.

624
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:39,198
Right.

625
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,829
I had no idea dating a human
would be so hard.

626
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:49,834
But I passed thanks to you.
I love you, my colleague.

627
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:50,751
Right.

628
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:54,630
What is it?

629
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:56,674
- Explain this.
- What on earth?

630
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,594
If I'd met you then,
I wouldn't be your friend now.

631
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,137
I must've been pretty sick.

632
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,098
I asked them several times to remove that.

633
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,516
I'll send it to Yoon-ji.

634
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:10,062
What's wrong with you? That's violating
my privacy and likeness rights.

635
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:12,732
You never won first place though.

636
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:15,860
- Who won first place?
- I don't know. I never saw them.

637
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:19,697
Mystery X. A hacker loved by hackers.

638
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:23,367
The skilled ones leave
their signature file when they hack.

639
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:26,495
I haven't seen them in a while though.

640
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:29,248
I do remember their file name.

641
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:35,254
It started with L-R-A-E...

642
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,632
Why is this text file so big?

643
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,551
- Na-rae?
- What?

644
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:42,595
What?

645
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,559
Why did they make it unreadable?

646
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:50,019
I know, right?

647
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:21,884
Happy birthday, Ji-hoon.

648
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,553
I tried serving justice again
and Hyun got so mad.

649
00:54:24,637 --> 00:54:26,097
I got into college!

650
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,766
I saw someone who looked like you.

651
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:29,934
I turned 20 today.

652
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:33,145
We promised to have
our first drink together.

653
00:54:34,522 --> 00:54:36,440
KIM JI-HOON: HI, MIN

654
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:38,067
KIM JI-HOON

655
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,780
Hi, Min.

656
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,782
Where did he learn to do this?

657
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,493
I bet you said,
"Where did he learn to do this?"

658
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:48,744
I saw that coming.

659
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,498
Happy 20th birthday, Min.

660
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:59,422
Seeing you kept making me smile,
so I didn't like it, but I was happy.

661
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:03,676
If I'm next to you right now,

662
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,929
could you smile and tell me
you got my message?

663
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:13,144
I probably won't be able to
keep my promise

664
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,021
- for the first drink.
- Cheers!

665
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:16,772
I've done some bad things in life.

666
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:21,402
But Min, with you...

667
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:23,195
I want to be honest.

668
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:25,531
I'm actually

669
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:27,408
very scared.

670
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:33,581
Rather than change the world,
I'd just wanted to say I loved my sister.

671
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,208
I don't know how it came to this.

672
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,173
If there ever was
a bright moment in my 19 years,

673
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,633
it was because I was with you.

674
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:47,136
I'm sorry,

675
00:55:48,137 --> 00:55:49,180
and thank you.

676
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,309
P.S. Don't date a guy
who leaves you on read.

677
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:25,382
JI-HOON

678
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:27,468
GAETAL SUSPECT MISSING FOR SIXTH DAY

679
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,431
SEARCH AREA EXPANDED

680
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:33,432
TETRAPODS OF DEATH

681
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:34,809
BODY OF MAN IN 30S FOUND

682
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,494
It was you.

683
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:21,021
Are you sure you want to quit like this?

684
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:23,732
I'm too ashamed to continue as a cop.

685
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:26,193
I should be thankful
I didn't lose my pension

686
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:28,279
since you let my betrayal slide.

687
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:33,159
You saved my life. We're even now.

688
00:57:37,705 --> 00:57:39,415
Forget about Min Ji-young.

689
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:42,168
She got away with it
even after I testified.

690
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:46,046
I heard the secretary
who took the fall for her died in jail.

691
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:51,385
Stop wasting your life on that
and go after someone worse.

692
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,595
Someone big.

693
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:57,766
Why must I fight against my own people
to catch the big ones?

694
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:01,729
The closer I get to the core,
the more I ask myself,

695
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:03,689
"Is this right?"

696
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,524
Organizations are like that.

697
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,068
This may sound funny,

698
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:10,487
but I understand Kwon Seok-joo better now.

699
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:14,491
Once you realize
your beliefs can fall apart,

700
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:16,035
you can't live the same life.

701
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:19,538
But I believe in you.

702
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:22,333
You can change things.
Gradually, step by step.

703
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:43,479
You should eat a lot to grow taller.

704
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:45,105
Can you eat spicy food?

705
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:46,899
Good.

706
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:49,401
Sir, it's okay to eat slowly.

707
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:51,487
With every bite, what was it?

708
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:52,571
"Let's be healthy."

709
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:54,073
Let's be healthy.

710
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:56,033
The same goes for you.

711
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,451
What will you do for us?

712
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:03,207
Well, to send you doctors
immediately when you're ill,

713
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,042
I'll make the government pay up.

714
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,877
That sounds great!

715
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:08,712
You should become the president.

716
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,714
Goodness, sir.

717
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,718
I have a fear of heights,
so I can't climb that high!

718
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,346
Thank you.

719
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:28,983
Thank you.

720
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,193
Whenever I volunteer, you're always there.

721
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:35,489
It's been almost nine years,
but you've changed so much

722
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,074
I didn't recognize you at first.

723
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:40,286
Have we met before?

724
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:41,996
I was a lawyer before.

725
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,541
I often saw you at court
during your son's trial.

726
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:48,252
I'm sure you didn't know me, but--

727
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,045
Wait.

728
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:52,423
I don't want to talk about him.

729
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:55,217
I have only one regret
regarding that incident.

730
00:59:55,801 --> 01:00:00,806
As his mother, I should've made him
turn himself in sooner, but I hesitated.

731
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,353
I'm sorry. I wanted to ask

732
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:08,981
why you supported rights
for the culprit's family.

733
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:15,237
I'm sharing my sadness
with those in the same situation.

734
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:16,572
That's all.

735
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:20,492
"Devils who were deemed innocent."

736
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:25,247
I was Professor Kwon's public defender
nine years ago.

737
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:32,671
All I wanted to say was

738
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:34,965
that you should be considerate

739
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:40,137
to the victims and their families
while you share their sadness.

740
01:00:41,055 --> 01:00:42,056
That's all.

741
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:46,518
If you forgot why he had to
wear that mask...

742
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,356
it would be a shame.

743
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:18,068
Interesting.

744
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,115
We need a new hire.

745
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:31,373
So far, I've only made
a code to start the program.

746
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,336
Most hackers failed to do this.

747
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,255
You're different.

748
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:39,715
I like you.

749
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:41,925
We can move to the next step.

750
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:46,638
Can you find a way to connect
with every citizen in this country?

751
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:55,147
You must be mistaken.

752
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:59,067
I'm the one who decides
the rules of the game.

753
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:04,281
If it's boring and pointless,
I won't even start it.

754
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:12,164
I heard even those who conquer
the world don't get much support.

755
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:17,878
I think if we help each other a bit,
we could take over the country.

756
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:20,923
Does that sound boring?

757
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:25,802
Why don't we test our skills
before we team up?

758
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:29,014
- Fine, then.
- And who's the target?

759
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:32,768
First, I want my position back.

760
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:34,811
Go to the next screen.

761
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:41,818
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JI-SEOK

762
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:50,994
What do you think is the worst thing
that can happen to a man with a daughter?

763
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:58,502
Whatever it is, it won't be boring.

764
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:10,264
LIGHTING PATTERN

765
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:15,644
DOWNLOADING PURCHASED APP
LIGHTING PATTERN

766
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:20,816
I love this. I'm going with this one.

767
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:27,155
Awesome. I like this.

768
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,199
What?

769
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,536
That little...

770
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,538
Min.

771
01:04:36,832 --> 01:04:40,043
Who said you can change the lights?
What about my preferences?

772
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:44,089
What? We have the same tastes.
I never pick bad patterns.

773
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:47,092
Anyway, you can drive after 100 days.

774
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,220
This car is brand-new,
and you're inexperienced.

775
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:53,307
You said we could share.
You can't go back on your word.

776
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,309
There's somewhere I need to be.

777
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,603
- Come on out.
- No.

778
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,021
- Come on.
- I was here first.

779
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:01,189
Get out. It's raining.

780
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:06,153
But I told my friend I'd come in this car.

781
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:10,616
Students should ride bigger vehicles.
I see many buses and trains there. Bye.

782
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:13,201
Hey!

783
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:14,286
Hyun!

784
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:17,789
Give me money!

785
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:22,628
Darn it.

786
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,715
3 HA 1 0887

787
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:29,760
How have you been?

788
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:34,765
I couldn't die, so I'm alive.
I'm just surviving.

789
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,228
Joking around like this
helps me get through each day

790
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:42,856
and not think too much about Ji-hoon.

791
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,067
Do you really believe

792
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:48,153
that Kwon Seok-joo is dead?

793
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:51,740
He hasn't shown signs of life,
but his body wasn't found.

794
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:54,284
So sometimes, I think

795
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:57,204
he may still be alive.

796
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:00,332
As long as there are loopholes in our law,

797
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:03,543
there will always be someone
to replace Professor Kwon.

798
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,171
In that case,

799
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:09,841
we can say he's still alive.

800
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,555
I really owe you big time.

801
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:19,601
It's been a while since I've been out,
so I never heard of bail bonds.

802
01:06:19,685 --> 01:06:22,688
You got yourself into trouble
as soon as you got out.

803
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:25,148
Posting bail won't reduce the sentence.

804
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:30,237
You have to make the judge believe
that you're deeply regretful.

805
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,988
So don't feel reassured yet.

806
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:34,825
I'll take care of all the paperwork.

807
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:38,620
You just stay away from the victim
and keep writing letters.

808
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,957
If you listen to me,
I'll get you probation.

809
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:56,138
I'll read the Bible and pray every day.

810
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,973
You're doing well enough.

811
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:02,644
- You traveled a long way, right?
- Yes.

812
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,733
KIM MU-CHAN

813
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:52,569
It's been a while.

814
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:56,865
Yeah, I needed to get
some forensic analysis done.

815
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,578
Jo-dan told me you were doing well.

816
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,872
I'm the ace of our team now.

817
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:08,168
In addition to working
cases like a real cop,

818
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:12,088
I do all kinds of chores,
like lecturing and entertaining guests.

819
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,091
And still a whistleblower.

820
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:16,551
I heard you cracked the case

821
01:08:16,635 --> 01:08:20,430
that the narcotics team
had been working on for a year.

822
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:22,140
You even caught all the dealers.

823
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:23,934
Right.

824
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:26,061
So what's the problem?

825
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,273
You really haven't changed at all.

826
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:34,820
I wanted to ask you something.

827
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:40,742
Kwon said he filed a petition
for Ji-hoon, but I couldn't find anything.

828
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:42,285
You know anything about it?

829
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,664
I don't know. I've never heard about it.

830
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,416
I see.

831
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,170
Please let me know
if you hear anything about this.

832
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:54,297
Okay.

833
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:57,425
I'll get going.

834
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,138
Sir.

835
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,518
Do you think

836
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:09,187
Kwon Seok-joo is still alive?

837
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:14,776
No.

838
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:16,778
I hope not.

839
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:20,782
He could use some rest now.

840
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:32,544
NATIONAL OFFICE OF INVESTIGATION

841
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,395
DEAR LIEUTENANT JOO HYUN

842
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:51,479
In a kindergarten,

843
01:09:52,898 --> 01:09:56,109
students from one class
beat another child.

844
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,154
The child cried out loud,

845
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:03,366
but the teacher didn't tell
the principal about it.

846
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:06,786
The principal says
their kindergarten is always peaceful.

847
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:12,792
I think the principal
is the worst person in this kindergarten.

848
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:18,256
I was once the principal,
and now, I'm the beaten child.

849
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:23,511
All Ji-hoon did was report
that I'd been beaten.

850
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:27,641
Not once has he committed a crime.

851
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:30,769
He's just a poor boy
brainwashed into believing

852
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:32,562
that I'd become his family.

853
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:35,023
I sincerely plead for leniency.

854
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,149
You can't, sir.

855
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,238
No...

856
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,380
You sold out
your colleagues to avoid jail.

857
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:02,384
And now you're doing crime consulting?

858
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:05,887
If you want to talk,
do it during the day at the station.

859
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:24,906
I have committed crimes,
and I'd kill them again if I could.

860
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:27,283
But I've never thought I was innocent.

861
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:31,371
I don't want my actions
to be seen as irrational either.

862
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:37,669
Because what I've done was not revenge.

863
01:11:38,253 --> 01:11:39,462
It was punishment.

864
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:44,801
NEW MAIL

865
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,727
UNIDENTIFIED MAN RESCUED BY FISHING SHIP

866
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:13,830
It's me.

867
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:17,333
About that event in Japan...

868
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:22,797
Their Police Information Division
is participating too, right?

869
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:28,887
THERE'S AN UPDATE ABOUT THE MAN YOU...

870
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,138
I'll go.

871
01:12:31,056 --> 01:12:33,058
I have a reason to go now.

872
01:12:57,499 --> 01:13:01,044
I don't know who it will be,

873
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,671
but there will definitely be
another Gaetal.

874
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:10,512
To bring down the hell
we're living in by even an inch...

875
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:19,354
To catch the devils
who were deemed innocent.

876
01:13:54,973 --> 01:14:01,271
Hello, my fellow citizens.
Let the Killing Vote begin.
