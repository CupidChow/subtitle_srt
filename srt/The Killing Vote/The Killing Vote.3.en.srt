1
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,085
WOULD YOU LIKE TO VOTE?

2
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,349
THE KILLING VOTE

3
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,977
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,353
SAFETY OF CHILD ACTORS WAS ENSURED

5
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:04,815
EPISODE 3

6
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,364
Step on it. Do it!

7
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,866
- I can't!
- Get yourself together.

8
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,076
We need to get there fast
if you want to live.

9
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,000
Step on it!

10
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,223
What was that?

11
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,017
Hyun...

12
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:55,991
Step on it! Come on!

13
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,277
Hurry.

14
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:32,778
Excuse us.

15
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,142
UHM EUN-GYEONG KILLED HUSBANDS
FOR DEATH BENEFIT

16
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,226
What?

17
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,978
What's wrong with the timer?

18
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,355
I really could die in here.

19
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,149
Do something, will you?

20
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,692
Do something!

21
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,113
Hey, you.

22
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,281
I know you're listening.

23
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,617
If she is guilty just as you claimed,

24
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,077
we can put her on trial again.

25
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,537
BLOCKED NUMBER

26
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,205
Put her on trial again?

27
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,374
You think that's possible?

28
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,751
In the Republic of Korea?

29
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:29,835
It is possible.

30
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,420
I can make it possible.

31
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,261
You want to seek justice, right?

32
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:41,430
Didn't you tell the people to trust you?

33
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,141
But if I die in here along with her,

34
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,392
what would they say then?

35
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,562
Think about it.

36
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,814
I will not take one step out of this car

37
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,442
and I will not go alone.

38
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,578
So...

39
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,379
Stop the bomb, you bastard!

40
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,285
No.

41
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,959
Mu-chan?

42
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,421
Hyun.

43
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,214
Hey, kid. It's dangerous, so get out.

44
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:00,968
Hey, kid!

45
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,080
No, Hyun...

46
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,087
I'll take a picture of the scene.
How's 100,000 won?

47
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,006
I risked my life for these.

48
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,257
A little bit more please.

49
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,051
One million won.

50
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,343
One million?

51
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,596
You little rats...

52
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,931
You're asking for a lot.

53
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,225
We almost died.

54
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:51,560
Did we?

55
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,315
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

56
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,484
Thank you.

57
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,486
- We admire you so much.
- One million won?

58
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,862
- Thank you.
- We love you, sir.

59
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,030
Sure.

60
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,540
Thank you.

61
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:14,708
You can check the memory card.

62
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:15,876
Here's my ID.

63
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,400
We'll call you if we need
additional statements from you.

64
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:41,985
All right.

65
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,489
But what about her funeral?

66
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,242
Her body will be released to you
once the autopsy is done.

67
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,202
You can make arrangements then.

68
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,787
Right.

69
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,539
If you refuse to take her body,

70
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,833
she'll be considered deceased
with no next of kin.

71
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,001
I see.

72
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,086
Let's go.

73
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,590
So she's gone now?

74
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,342
We won't get beaten anymore?

75
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:06,802
No.

76
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,346
Ha-young, no one will beat us now.

77
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,765
- We're okay.
- That's her family, right?

78
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,142
The one from last night's Killing Vote?

79
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,227
She should've been imprisoned years ago.

80
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,437
The police are useless.

81
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,690
No. I said no.

82
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,650
Don't you understand me?

83
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,194
She deserved to die.

84
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,571
So what's the problem?

85
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:27,698
The biggest problem is

86
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,743
that Gaetal is doing
what you should be doing!

87
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,579
- That's right!
- That's right.

88
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,831
And you call yourselves the police?

89
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:36,915
Sir.

90
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,043
Please calm down.

91
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,837
You could be charged
with obstruction of justice

92
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,380
and assaulting an officer.

93
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,340
You'll need a lawyer.

94
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,050
A lawyer?

95
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,094
So what if I keep doing this?

96
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,598
- What are you going to do?
- Sir.

97
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,349
Keep your hands off him

98
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,768
and please calm down.

99
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,189
Who the hell are you?

100
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,776
Unbelievable. You...

101
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,861
Hey!

102
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,864
What are you doing?

103
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,588
The second target of The Killing Vote
was murdered last night.

104
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,841
This time, 87% voted "yes"
for Uhm's execution...

105
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,927
A bombing at a school?

106
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,222
- ...higher than the first vote's 84%.
- I'm glad the kids weren't hurt.

107
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,807
The majority of the people voted
for her execution.

108
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,852
But due to the fact
an innocent person was injured,

109
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,854
public opinion against The Killing Vote

110
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,106
- is growing stronger.
- What if the kids got hurt?

111
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,317
Gaetal turned out to be a bad person.

112
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,653
Gaetal is a bad person, Mom?

113
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,197
- You don't need to know.
- Who's Gaetal?

114
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,449
I don't know. He used to be a good person,

115
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,034
but they say now he's bad.

116
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,411
ONE MINUTE AWAY

117
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,390
Now that two Killing Votes
have taken place,

118
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,393
what should be our biggest concern?

119
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,938
We agreed to the idea
of carrying out justice.

120
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,732
But the consequences were disastrous.

121
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,444
The bombing was nearly a major disaster,

122
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,530
and with news that a police officer
was seriously injured,

123
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,824
the people are appalled.

124
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,369
Through the statements
of the people who were at the scene,

125
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,579
we were able to report
on the tense situation.

126
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,747
KIM MU-CHAN

127
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,624
Let's take a look.

128
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,711
I thought a war had broken out.

129
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,714
I thought we were being attacked
with missiles, so I was terrified.

130
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,757
The police suddenly told us to leave.

131
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:51,842
Don't get me started.

132
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,760
You wouldn't believe how loud it was.

133
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,971
The windows all the way here
started shaking.

134
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,557
Thanks to the police's quick judgment,

135
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,476
innocent people were not hurt or killed.

136
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,812
But Uhm, The Killing Vote's target,
was killed.

137
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:07,441
And the officer who performed his duties
is fighting for his life.

138
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,651
When did you get home?

139
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,903
Why didn't you pick up?
I was waiting all night!

140
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,197
Early this morning.

141
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,118
You should've washed up and gone to bed.

142
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,871
You're not hurt, are you?

143
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,997
Are you?

144
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,666
For showing the previous disturbing video
without warning,

145
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,751
we sincerely apologize.

146
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,759
But there is a reason
why you had to watch this clip.

147
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:38,597
People, what we must note
from this clip is

148
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,432
that the culprit, Gaetal,

149
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,560
knew an innocent police officer
could've been harmed,

150
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,771
but he did not stop the bomb.

151
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,441
His claim to do justice for our society

152
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:53,111
has caused an exemplary police officer
to fight for his life.

153
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,698
Isn't this the true face of justice
that Gaetal was referring to?

154
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,075
In the end,

155
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,785
- who did the votes serve?
- See?

156
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,371
That could've been you.

157
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:03,872
Do you still...

158
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,834
think Gaetal is right?

159
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,588
What?

160
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,633
You said that your friends

161
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,719
likened Gaetal to Batman.

162
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:19,971
A hero.

163
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,352
You should all wake up.

164
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,897
That bastard is a criminal.

165
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,568
Someone who wouldn't hesitate to kill cops

166
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,655
and even people like you and me.

167
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,491
A dangerous scoundrel.

168
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,879
What's wrong with her?

169
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:09,855
KIM MU-CHAN

170
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,877
NATIONAL POLICE HOSPITAL

171
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,086
Here comes the director.

172
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,172
- Sir.
- How's Superintendent Kim doing?

173
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,426
Have you found any evidence?

174
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,221
Please tell us something.

175
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,893
How's Superintendent Kim doing?

176
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:48,977
Who's Gaetal?

177
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,313
Will the unit's leader be replaced?

178
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,273
Rumors are going around
about his condition.

179
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,733
How is he doing?

180
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,359
Is he conscious?

181
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,070
Do you know who Gaetal is?

182
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:05,076
Superintendent Kim Mu-chan
risked his life and carried out his duty

183
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,579
to protect civilians
from a merciless terrorist.

184
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,624
The police denounces all violent acts

185
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,835
committed by the criminal
calling himself Gaetal.

186
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,255
We shall arrest him as soon as possible
and punish him by law.

187
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,302
Everyone, Superintendent Kim is hovering
between life and death at this moment.

188
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,055
I ask that you pray for his recovery.

189
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,404
Sir.

190
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:52,082
VIP
PATIENT: KIM

191
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,215
DO NOT ENTER

192
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,094
Hello.

193
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,263
We're here to check the crime scene.

194
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,472
- Thanks.
- You can't go in.

195
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,977
- We have to look at the scene--
- Please leave.

196
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,688
Let us go in.

197
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,817
It's not at all due to
poor management of the school.

198
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,654
The police asked for our cooperation.
They said it was really urgent.

199
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,072
Yes, of course.

200
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,449
We made sure to evacuate
the students safely first.

201
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,119
And we'll make sure
it doesn't affect their classes.

202
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,788
If parents find out we went out
for dinner last night, they'll go nuts.

203
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,331
The students weren't unattended.

204
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,916
There was a teacher on call.

205
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,626
They should've let him kill her.

206
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,211
Why did they have to bring her here?

207
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,879
The police are the biggest problem.

208
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,091
Sir, please go talk to them for us.

209
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,175
We need to look for evidence,

210
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,885
but the guys from headquarters
won't let us in.

211
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,846
Just give it a rest.

212
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,598
I already have too much on my mind.

213
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:51,891
Why are they doing this?

214
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,768
Is it because the case got out of hand?

215
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:54,894
Don't tell me...

216
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,607
Potential murder of a police officer?

217
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,901
He's in really serious condition,
isn't he?

218
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,032
Everyone's talking about him.

219
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,158
"He's alive." "He's dead."

220
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,368
"Will he be buried
in the National Cemetery?"

221
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,912
And that guy over there. I hate him.

222
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,497
Do you know what he said to me?

223
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,208
"Is your uniform ready for the funeral?"

224
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,294
No, I didn't.

225
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,215
Sir, tell me the truth.
It's just between us.

226
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,092
It can't be...

227
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,220
Is he dead?

228
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:30,430
You little...

229
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,682
What are you talking about?

230
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:33,767
He's just...

231
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,269
Injured. That's all.

232
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,229
So, how serious is it?

233
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:46,696
Excuse me.

234
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,531
Sir.

235
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,034
You can't take pictures.

236
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,078
I see. I'm sorry.

237
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,039
It's an ongoing investigation.
Please delete them.

238
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:09,803
Sir.

239
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,140
Sure. I will.

240
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,351
DELETE

241
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,356
Are you Lee Yun-seong by any chance?

242
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,860
You were that student, right?

243
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,865
Mr. Lee Min-soo, wait up.

244
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,534
I need to talk to you.

245
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,620
He's a teacher?

246
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,960
So how serious is his injury?

247
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,253
- Come on.
- Tell me.

248
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,421
Damn it.

249
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,760
Me too. I'm frustrated too.

250
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,221
Where are you going?

251
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,974
Everyone is so diligent.

252
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,982
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

253
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,525
We don't even know how he's doing,

254
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,068
but we're just going to sit here?

255
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,278
God damn it!

256
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,530
The police's reputation is ruined,

257
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,907
and our team leader is
in critical condition.

258
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,122
Yes, it is definitely strange.

259
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,504
Something's really fishy
with the crime scene.

260
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,006
What is it now?

261
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,966
Before we could search for evidence,

262
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,010
headquarters put up barricades

263
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,429
and treated us like nobodies.

264
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,555
Headquarters?

265
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,558
But they weren't detectives.
I've never seen them before.

266
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,144
Could they be from Internal Affairs?

267
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,397
The IA at a crime scene? Why?

268
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,150
Maybe they want to form
another special unit at HQ.

269
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,028
Since the case got bigger,
they might want a bigger team.

270
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,239
They do like to take credit
from the cases we work on.

271
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,074
Right. What about Lieutenant Choi?

272
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,160
He went straight to the autopsy room.

273
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,496
But I think he saw Superintendent Kim.

274
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,997
Yes, he did.

275
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,665
He seemed to know how he was doing.

276
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes, he knows.

277
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,711
Jjoo.

278
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,213
Where is she?

279
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,840
Her goal was always to burn out
from working too hard.

280
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,801
Did her wish come true? Where did she go?

281
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,309
Officer Kim Mu-chan.

282
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,811
There's a rumor that he is dead.

283
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:26,397
He might be. One already died
in the explosion.

284
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,024
Even if he survived,
he might not have long.

285
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,610
Why won't they announce it?

286
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:31,694
I have an appointment.

287
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,378
The culprit, Gaetal,

288
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,089
knew an innocent police officer
could've been harmed,

289
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,883
but he did not stop the bomb.

290
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,136
His claim to do justice for our society

291
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,890
has caused an exemplary police officer
to fight for his life.

292
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:26,833
Hey.

293
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,306
Isn't this the true face of justice
that Gaetal was referring to?

294
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,558
In the end,

295
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,351
who did the votes serve?

296
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,521
"Now, that's more like the police."

297
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,231
"We're rooting for Korea's police."

298
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,858
"Gaetal is just a murderer."

299
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,235
"Let's pay for
Superintendent Kim's medical bills."

300
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,780
Based on these comments,
I'd say we got what we wanted.

301
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,282
What do you think?

302
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:03,244
You're an expert, Ms. Chae,
so I'll trust you and go with it.

303
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,747
But did we have to lie?

304
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,166
Doing this changed
the public opinion. Otherwise...

305
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,922
This is why the commissioner
gave his permission too.

306
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,006
So stop worrying.

307
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,300
You're right.

308
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,886
He stayed in the car
with a strong sense of responsibility,

309
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,054
and he did nearly died.

310
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,514
You're dealing with a criminal
who's stirring up the system,

311
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,141
so a ruse like this is nothing.

312
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,559
Entrapment is fine too.

313
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:30,063
The police have to do marketing
to survive these days too.

314
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:31,773
Isn't that right?

315
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,904
Make sure to control public opinion, sir.

316
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,656
And open up a hotline.

317
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,658
We failed to get any information.

318
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,117
Let's at least receive tips.

319
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,453
All right. Just make sure
this doesn't get out.

320
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,039
If people find out we were faking this,

321
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,291
we'll both be hung out to dry.

322
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,818
LINEN CLOSET

323
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:36,045
So I have exclusive
access to entry now, right?

324
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,589
They'll say we're colluding.

325
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,884
I'll open an official press room instead,
so make good use of that.

326
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,012
I'll make sure you get exclusive access.

327
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,305
If you wrap this case up well,

328
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,141
people will ask you to run for office.

329
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,737
Superintendent Kim!

330
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,822
Superintendent Kim!

331
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,657
Please!

332
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:06,743
Superintendent Kim!

333
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,706
Please change the sheets in Room 301.

334
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,791
Okay.

335
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:12,141
The direct cause of death
is cardiac arrest due to poisoning.

336
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,143
And post-mortem burns from the explosion

337
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,187
has made her face unrecognizable.

338
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,148
That means she'd already been poisoned
when she was kidnapped.

339
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,027
I thought she was panting
because of the bomb.

340
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,987
She had asthma.

341
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,572
And he poisoned her knowing that.

342
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:29,408
Her pulse was racing from anxiety,

343
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:30,993
so the poison took effect quicker.

344
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,621
What about the bombs?

345
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,291
Both of them were detonated remotely.

346
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,794
Whether she got out of the car or not

347
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,462
didn't matter from the start.

348
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,297
I told you he was a lunatic.

349
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,676
We won't find any evidence
because the trunk was blown up.

350
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,180
You collected all CCTV footage, right?

351
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,851
Students could've recorded it
on their phones, so collect all of them.

352
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,603
I think Bae Gi-chul's body
was just released to his family.

353
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,021
I bet his funeral will be held soon.

354
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:01,941
Let's send some more men there.

355
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,861
The killer is a vain lunatic,
so he might show up there too.

356
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,614
What about Joo Hyun?

357
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,074
Is she at the station?

358
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,784
We have to keep her quiet...

359
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:17,915
We have to...

360
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:23,087
Actually, I'll take care of that.

361
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:27,717
Hey.

362
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,595
What do you think you're doing?

363
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:32,638
Hey.

364
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,349
Hello?

365
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:36,434
What's going on?

366
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,394
You need to look at this, sir.

367
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,478
Okay.

368
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,323
- What? What do you want?
- You're totally fine.

369
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,116
Get your hands off me.

370
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,203
Did you just con the entire nation?

371
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,164
Wow. I am just speechless.

372
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,708
It's not a con. It's media manipulation.

373
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:01,792
Media manipulation?

374
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,463
So Gaetal made fools of you,

375
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,465
and in order to restore
the police's reputation,

376
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,383
you manipulated the media?

377
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:12,053
Wow. I didn't expect this.
You're such a loser.

378
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,890
Nambu Police Agency's jerk. Wipeout.

379
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,725
You're called these for a reason, right?

380
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,769
Yeah, that's the kind of guy I am.

381
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,605
That loser who never reveals
his identity, Gaetal?

382
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,023
He wouldn't have been caught anyway.

383
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,192
Everyone thinks he's a hero.

384
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,860
You saw how they changed their minds

385
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,570
as soon as a cop was hurt, right?

386
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:33,366
To Gaetal, the reason for murder
is most important thing.

387
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,533
If we change public opinion,

388
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,661
we can stop The Killing Vote.

389
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:40,164
If the police aren't
on the straight and narrow,

390
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:42,124
what grounds will we have
to catch criminals?

391
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,752
If word gets out, will you take
the fall for this humiliation?

392
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,546
All of Korea's police
are going to be screwed!

393
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,465
So let's get him.

394
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,759
Isn't it more humiliating
if we fail to arrest him?

395
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,036
I have an interesting video clip.

396
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,539
EXECUTOR:
PROVE THAT IT'S AUTHENTIC

397
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,667
I TOOK IT MYSELF

398
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:30,089
What are you so busy with?

399
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,257
School work?

400
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,635
The board of directors is talking
about closing the school for a while.

401
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,888
How unnecessary. Parents don't want
their kids to fall behind.

402
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,937
The Killing Vote was
also gaining momentum,

403
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:47,398
but that one detective ruined it.

404
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:51,068
That Kim Mu-chan.
Why doesn't he ever change?

405
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:53,404
You've been following
The Killing Vote too, Mom?

406
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:59,285
In this country,
only 16% of those in their twenties

407
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,787
vote in the presidential elections.

408
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,289
But in order to catch a criminal,

409
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:06,876
more than 40% of all citizens

410
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,878
had already voted within one hour.

411
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:14,258
He's the first public speaker in Korea
with this much trust, so I do follow it.

412
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,011
Gaetal.

413
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,263
No matter what happens,

414
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:21,849
I'll make him join me.

415
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,354
You know I will, right?

416
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,956
You're keeping close tabs
on Min-soo these days, right?

417
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,041
Yes, ma'am.

418
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,378
Make sure his feelings don't get hurt.

419
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,004
Yes, ma'am.

420
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,567
Don't push it.

421
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,280
Am I mistaken?

422
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,491
Your screen hasn't changed
for the past 10 minutes.

423
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,537
Mr. Lee, maybe the world
became too digitalized

424
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,664
so it lost its humanity.

425
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,875
They thought
they could kill people by voting

426
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:31,836
but then blew up a bomb at school.

427
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,920
Min.

428
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,631
You're not in the computer club,
so why are you here?

429
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,717
Either study in class or focus on...

430
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,678
I need a break too, you know.

431
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,473
Look at Kim Ji-hoon.

432
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,100
He's not in the computer club either.

433
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,978
He wants to major in computer science.
You want to become a reporter.

434
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,646
And what's needed to write articles?

435
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,814
A computer.

436
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,399
Well, look at you.

437
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,401
So if you could help me...

438
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,195
Work hard. Okay.

439
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,491
Mr. Lee.

440
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,327
What?

441
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,413
What?

442
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,873
What's wrong with this?

443
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,833
Mr. Lee.

444
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:12,710
Mr. Lee.

445
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,760
Don't touch it.

446
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,390
Hey, this is my seat.

447
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:34,482
SAFE MODE IN PROGRESS

448
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,610
Wow, the future computer major.

449
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:42,490
So, did this turn into a zombie PC?

450
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:45,493
You know about that?

451
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,577
"You know about that?"

452
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,123
But no.

453
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,625
It's just a virus.

454
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:53,751
VIRUS HAS BEEN REMOVED

455
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,462
My laptop became a zombie before.

456
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:57,546
- So my sister--
- It's done.

457
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,263
Are you two dating?

458
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,348
Shut up.

459
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,517
That's not possible.

460
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,149
Follow me! Bye, Mr. Lee.

461
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,194
- Don't make any trouble.
- Okay.

462
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:44,677
Hey.

463
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:48,138
Do you like mystery novels?

464
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,140
Sherlock Holmes?

465
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:51,267
Moriarty?

466
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:56,730
You...

467
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,732
Hang out with me today.

468
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,987
- He recorded it all.
- Must be nice, pal.

469
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,490
Hey, where are you going?

470
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:07,783
I said let's hang out.

471
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:08,993
You're so lucky.

472
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,536
- I'm jealous.
- Where are you going?

473
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,586
I don't expect a full recovery.

474
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:20,296
I've had it for years now,

475
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,047
so it feels like a friend.

476
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,466
I'll just have to get along with it.

477
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,802
Inmate 0512. Are you done?

478
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,887
Yes, sir.

479
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,058
I'll see you soon, doctor.

480
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,733
Have you heard?

481
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:44,653
The detective in charge
of The Killing Vote case

482
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,780
was severely hurt
while pursuing the culprit.

483
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,534
You know. Detective Kim Mu-chan.

484
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,416
Inmate 0512. Eyes forward.

485
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:05,257
So you know

486
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,343
the woman Gaetal targeted?

487
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,804
The woman killed three of her husbands
for their insurance money,

488
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,514
and while trying to save her,

489
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,558
and he was blown up in the explosion too.

490
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,853
It's a relief

491
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,147
that he wasn't killed.

492
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,153
The news said his injuries
are so serious, he's barely hanging on.

493
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:31,408
I mean, why did he try to save a criminal
who deserved to die?

494
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:34,620
How foolish, right?

495
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:40,250
I believe that anyone who kills
deserves to be punished the same way.

496
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:45,047
A murderer will always be a murderer.

497
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,347
There are so many of those
who deserve to die.

498
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,183
How did you find this?

499
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,268
My laptop.

500
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:03,732
I told you that it was a zombie.

501
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,734
My sister found a malicious code

502
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,778
that was hidden.

503
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:10,489
She said we can catch Gaetal
if we get to the video source.

504
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:14,535
How come you have such crucial information
to the investigation?

505
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:17,913
A reporter's...

506
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:19,623
intuition?

507
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,931
Your sister might take the fall for this.

508
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,560
Right.

509
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,354
Are you...

510
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:25,814
a scaredy...

511
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:29,902
- "Scaredy"?
- Scaredy-cat.

512
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:30,986
Don't you get it?

513
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,781
Fine, stay out of it if you're scared.

514
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:38,952
What do you want to do?

515
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,458
I've watched this video
over a hundred times.

516
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,376
But while Gaetal is talking,

517
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,754
I swear I can hear a siren wailing
in the background.

518
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,297
Listen.

519
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,882
...are walking around alive.

520
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:52,966
I can't stand the...

521
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,636
You can see lights
coming in from the window too.

522
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,888
Maybe we can find out
where this was recorded.

523
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,642
Then, I'll try to turn up
the background noise.

524
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:09,775
I did notice the end
of the recording wasn't clear.

525
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:14,238
But interference from the other noises...

526
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,572
Listen to it.

527
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:18,867
The devils who were deemed innocent
are walking around alive.

528
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,161
I can't stand the thought of it!

529
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:22,246
I want to rip them...

530
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,039
I was right. The siren.

531
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,874
It's not from a police car.

532
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,417
A fire engine.

533
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:28,794
Yeah, a fire engine.

534
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,046
You can tell the difference?

535
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,173
Of course, my sister's a cop.

536
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,425
The siren of a fire engine...

537
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,344
I know it for sure.

538
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,101
Right?

539
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:46,228
You're right.

540
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,735
Was the place burned?

541
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,363
But the room looks too intact for that.

542
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,199
I can't exactly see how it looks,

543
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,743
but I think it's been exposed
to weak light for a long time.

544
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:05,998
Right.

545
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,876
I heard that a cop was injured
from the explosion.

546
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:09,960
How's your sister?

547
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,712
Luckily, she's fine.

548
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:14,631
Anyways, I've left
the Gaetal fan club as of yesterday.

549
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,675
He'd only go after those
who deserved to die

550
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,552
to punish the evil, so I trusted him.

551
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,554
But how could he hurt a cop too?

552
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,306
I'm so disappointed.

553
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,766
I'm suspicious of the police too.

554
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:26,727
That injured cop...

555
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:28,520
You think he's actually hurt?

556
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:30,397
The woman in the driver's seat died.

557
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,024
So how can the cop be okay?

558
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,818
My sister came back frightened
and shocked.

559
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,320
Hey!

560
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,822
You...

561
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:40,282
You little brats.

562
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,951
Didn't you say you'd be home late?

563
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,830
We were just trying
to help you catch Gaetal.

564
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:50,208
Hey, I'm a cop and you're just students.

565
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:51,460
Are you crazy?

566
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,296
When did you copy this?

567
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,089
You're unbelievable.

568
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:01,386
There are rotten people
like you everywhere.

569
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,348
Korea is a complete mess.
There's no room for improvement.

570
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,684
And what made it like this are me

571
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:09,353
and you.

572
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,605
- Right here.
- We're all at fault.

573
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:14,024
A light is coming in through the window.

574
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:15,692
Right?

575
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:17,861
We can hear the siren first

576
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,072
and then see the light.

577
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,324
So they must be
the fire engine's headlights.

578
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:23,909
No.

579
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:28,288
Unless it's a semi-basement room
by a street,

580
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:32,501
a vehicle's headlights
wouldn't light a room like this.

581
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,211
This light...

582
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:38,966
They're probably emergency lights
on a fire engine.

583
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:40,968
For emergency lights to be this visible...

584
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:42,094
A two-story house.

585
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,014
Then, it's probably a two-story house.

586
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,143
And by the sound of the sirens,

587
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,437
at least three fire engines
were dispatched.

588
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:56,525
For something that big,
the police are dispatched too.

589
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,360
So...

590
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,821
Let's find a case of a fire

591
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:04,658
within the past six months
where firefighters and the police

592
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,744
were dispatched together

593
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,664
through the NPA database.

594
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,544
These are the most likely candidates.

595
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,797
Multi-family residential area
in Gijeong-dong, Jungrang-gu.

596
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,967
An apartment complex
in Shinseok-dong, Mapo-gu.

597
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,969
And Gaonro, Seowon-gu...

598
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,141
Wait.

599
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,893
What is it?

600
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,061
You figured it out?

601
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,980
PROFILE
NAME: KWON SEOK-JOO

602
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,648
ADDRESS: 177 GAONRO-4GA, SEOWON-GU, SEOUL

603
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:38,608
I'll be back soon.

604
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,944
- I want to come with you.
- No.

605
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,279
I helped you find it.

606
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:43,363
Hey, Joo Min!

607
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:46,116
Then, call another cop at least.

608
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,201
She's just worried about you.

609
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:50,871
We don't have enough manpower
to ask for help on this.

610
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:51,955
We're on high alert.

611
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:54,332
Then, we should join you at least.

612
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:58,128
If something happens,
you need someone to call for help.

613
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,131
Your name is Ji-hoon, right?

614
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:04,968
I like you.

615
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,428
You're pretty smart.

616
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,351
Wait up. I'm coming too!

617
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,568
The number you have dialed...

618
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:24,488
Are you sure this is his house?

619
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,616
"Kwon Seok-joo."

620
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,326
Who is he?

621
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:30,744
Isn't it him?

622
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:34,998
FATHER WHO KILLED DAUGHTER'S KILLER...

623
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,124
A MISGUIDED FATHER'S LOVE

624
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,209
A murderer?

625
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,253
That's unsettling.

626
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:41,546
KIM MU-CHAN

627
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,179
- The number you have dialed...
- Damn it.

628
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,889
I found evidence showing

629
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,809
that Gaetal's test video was filmed
at Kwon Seok-joo's place.

630
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,185
I'm going in right now.

631
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:57,813
Hey.

632
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,315
Wait in front of that camera over there

633
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,650
so the camera can catch you.

634
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,110
Don't come in no matter what.

635
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,445
No matter what you hear,
don't get involved.

636
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:07,614
Call it in and go to the nearest station.
Okay?

637
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,492
Keep your GPS on.

638
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:11,618
Let us go in with you.

639
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,036
Don't you even think about it.

640
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,038
Same goes for you.

641
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:16,623
Don't worry.

642
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,583
I'll stay with Min.

643
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,418
Be careful.

644
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:23,713
I'm relieved that one of you is sane.

645
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,383
What is that?

646
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,719
A location tracker Hyun and I use.

647
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:16,057
She told us to stay in a safe place.

648
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,007
There's so much data.

649
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,843
The team asked so many questions
while I gathered these.

650
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,845
It was hard coming up with excuses.

651
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,348
I brought your personal laptop too.

652
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,725
Right. Your phone didn't break.

653
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,435
It just needed to be charged, so I did.

654
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,189
It doesn't feel right
to lie to the public like this,

655
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,317
but Sang-jae and Yoon-ji
were beat up pretty well this morning.

656
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,818
Uhm Eun-gyeong's neighbors said,

657
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,029
"And you call yourselves the police?"

658
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,240
When I heard it, I got so angry.

659
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:14,824
JOO HYUN: I'M GOING IN RIGHT NOW

660
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,660
And I understood why you're doing this.

661
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,119
- So you should take...
- Jin-soo.

662
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,329
...this chance to rest.

663
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,872
I have to go out right now.

664
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:23,959
Unbelievable.

665
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,796
- Give me your clothes.
- My clothes?

666
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:29,214
Take them off now.

667
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:30,966
Why?

668
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:32,926
God damn it.

669
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,683
Where are you going?

670
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,142
If the director finds out, I'm dead.

671
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,435
Did you ride your scooter here?

672
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:43,561
Where did you park it?

673
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,063
By the tree in the back.

674
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,356
Why are you making me lie down?

675
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:47,983
Why would you press that?

676
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,859
Superintendent Kim, wake up!

677
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,028
A man's dying over here!

678
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,116
Are you okay? Nurse!

679
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,200
Are you okay?

680
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:58,285
Nurse!

681
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:01,454
- Mr. Kim!
- Mr. Kim.

682
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:02,914
- Are you okay?
- Sir.

683
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,457
- Mr. Kim.
- Mr. Kim.

684
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,376
What?

685
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:07,836
Hello.

686
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:04,554
THE 13TH ONE WAS WRONG

687
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:25,325
8-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER MISSING

688
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,827
KWON CHARGED WITH REVENGE MURDER

689
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:43,092
Something's wrong.

690
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,845
It's been about 20 minutes.

691
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:46,930
You're right.

692
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:49,140
It's past the time we agreed on.

693
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,727
But we're not going inside.
Let's call the police.

694
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,687
That's what she told us to do.

695
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:57,190
You do that. I'm going inside.

696
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:58,566
Hey.

697
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,776
What are you doing?

698
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:01,861
- She told us to wait.
- Let go of me.

699
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:03,696
- Let go of me.
- She told us to wait.

700
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:14,249
What?

701
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:16,000
Who are you two?

702
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:17,168
What are you doing here?

703
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:19,295
Mister.

704
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,089
How come you aren't dead?

705
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,467
Are you here to see my sister?

706
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:26,094
Your sister?

707
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,640
You're Joo Hyun's sister?

708
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:36,062
She brought high schoolers here?
She's crazy.

709
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,692
Please find my sister, sir.

710
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,528
She went in a while ago,
and I haven't heard from her since.

711
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:44,612
How long has it been?

712
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:46,531
Exactly 22 minutes.

713
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:48,741
By the way, are you really all right?

714
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:50,952
I thought you were dying.

715
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,622
The police are coming,
so get to the nearest station.

716
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,843
My sister should be fine.

717
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,513
She'll be okay, right?

718
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:13,016
Right?

719
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,556
Hey, Hyun. Joo Hyun!

720
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:37,392
Hey.

721
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:43,648
What happened?

722
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:44,857
I was looking at that and someone...

723
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,737
THE 13TH ONE WAS WRONG

724
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:34,907
Are you okay?

725
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:37,034
Are you all right?

726
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:40,204
Wait!

727
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:43,958
Hyun.

728
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:47,503
Min!

729
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:51,507
Ji-hoon, get him.

730
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,468
Let go, Min. Just let him go.

731
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,056
Are you okay?

732
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,144
That way.

733
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:09,525
We lost him because of you.

734
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,068
He was so suspicious.

735
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:12,570
Do you have a death wish?

736
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,239
Forget it.
What matters is that you're okay.

737
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:26,584
Min.

738
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:27,877
Hyun.

739
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,129
I told you to stay far away from here.

740
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:31,798
What took you so long?

741
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,549
I thought something had happened to you.

742
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:34,967
What happened to you?

743
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,230
Are you okay?

744
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:11,838
Hey, you.

745
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,965
- Me?
- Yeah.

746
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,093
Lock their front door.

747
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:20,847
Make sure you hear the lock click
and then go home. Understood?

748
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:23,850
Okay.

749
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:26,060
And you.

750
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,479
Don't let him into your house.

751
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:30,731
Be sure to say goodbye at the door.

752
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,067
Got it?

753
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,402
- Whatever.
- Hey.

754
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,280
That's what I was about to tell you.

755
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,531
Call me when you get home.

756
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:41,200
"How come you aren't dead?"

757
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:43,578
Stop overworking my sister.

758
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,329
She's injured and you're making her drive.

759
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,291
Darn it.

760
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:55,882
I think he took it too far this time.

761
00:52:57,884 --> 00:52:58,885
Hey.

762
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:00,595
What are you doing?

763
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:02,638
Coming.

764
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:28,205
VIEWERS' MESSAGE BOARD

765
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:29,457
HE'S SATISFYING HIS OWN GREED

766
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,125
NOW, THAT'S MORE LIKE THE POLICE

767
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,793
GAETAL IS JUST A MURDERER

768
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,420
GAETAL IS JUST A CRIMINAL

769
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:18,673
Why did Joo Hyun
have to come in here alone?

770
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,007
What's all this mess?

771
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:21,384
Did she really fight on her own?

772
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:22,593
Was she always this athletic?

773
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:25,388
You think she fought back
because she knew how to?

774
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:29,100
You know her temper. I'm sure
she fought back with all her might.

775
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,020
Sir.

776
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:34,605
Are you upstairs?

777
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:45,700
Don't miss anything. Look carefully.

778
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,159
Hello.

779
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,206
Isn't this blood?

780
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,125
It smells like paint, but...

781
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,251
Collect all of these.

782
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,927
What?

783
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:14,729
I need a chair.

784
00:55:15,855 --> 00:55:17,523
- Jeez.
- Goodness.

785
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,233
I'll do it.

786
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,152
Okay, let's put it here.

787
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,346
Nice. Wait a minute.

788
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:51,849
Yes, sir.

789
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:53,517
Where is that bastard Kim Mu-chan?

790
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:55,519
Hello? Director.

791
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:57,688
I'm not getting a good signal here.

792
00:55:57,772 --> 00:55:58,856
Hello?

793
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,858
Hello?

794
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,762
No matter how hard I think about it,

795
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:33,182
I don't think Gaetal
is close to Kwon Seok-joo.

796
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,142
If they are related somehow,

797
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:37,019
he would've avoided Kwon Seok-joo's house.

798
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:38,938
And the writing on the wall...

799
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:40,189
Kwon Seok-joo

800
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,691
killed his daughter's murderer himself.

801
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,528
He had all of Korea
on his side at one point,

802
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,780
and he had numerous followers
supporting him.

803
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,324
The guy called Gaetal

804
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:51,867
could be one of them.

805
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:57,832
By the way, when I saw you
at Kwon's house,

806
00:56:58,207 --> 00:56:59,708
I suddenly remembered.

807
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,293
For Kwon Seok-joo's case...

808
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:06,298
You were in charge from the moment
his daughter was kidnapped, right?

809
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,806
- So?
- Gaetal's test video...

810
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:17,393
You knew where it was filmed, didn't you?

811
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:22,857
You knew it was Kwon Seok-joo's house.

812
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:31,949
You'd been there before.

813
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:22,333
Keep your heads down.

814
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,253
Inmate 9141. Keep your head down.

815
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:28,631
Turn your heads.

816
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:29,882
Keep your heads down.

817
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,718
Eight years ago, Kwon Seok-joo
voluntarily went to prison.

818
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,596
He said he felt absolutely no shame

819
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,306
about having punished
his daughter's killer.

820
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:46,982
Gaetal is just like Kwon Seok-joo.

821
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:49,818
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

822
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:53,489
They're both arrogant and dare to take
the law into their own hands

823
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:54,990
if it can't solve the problem.

824
00:58:59,328 --> 00:59:00,621
Gaetal

825
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,790
is definitely close to Kwon Seok-joo.

826
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,501
Very close.

827
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:14,301
We've found traces of Gaetal

828
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:17,137
in Bae Gi-chul's hideout
and Kwon Seok-joo's house.

829
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:18,305
These two places.

830
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:22,476
If there's no record of anyone logging
onto the internet from either location

831
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,769
while the voting took place,

832
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,813
Gaetal must have a hideout elsewhere.

833
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:29,525
Even so, he wouldn't have gone that far.

834
00:59:30,526 --> 00:59:31,735
If we look for places

835
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:35,364
that used more electricity than usual
around the voting periods

836
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:37,533
or housed a larger server

837
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:39,368
in the vicinity of these two places...

838
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,580
Fussing over it won't change anything.

839
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:46,458
Don't underestimate Kwon Seok-joo.

840
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:49,420
Don't show him anything
he could use to read you.

841
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:47,686
He used your place as his hideout

842
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:50,105
and to prepare for The Killing Vote.

843
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:54,610
We could see how interested he is in you
from the sheer amount

844
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:56,945
of information he collected about you.

845
01:00:57,363 --> 01:00:59,823
- And...
- The rabbit is all worn out.

846
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:05,329
It was my daughter's favorite.

847
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,999
I didn't store it properly.

848
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:12,586
Are you...

849
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:15,339
Gaetal?

850
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,269
THE 13TH ONE WAS WRONG

851
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,815
Should I ask you again?

852
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:34,983
Kwon Seok-joo.

853
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:38,153
Do you know anything about Gaetal

854
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:40,364
and The Killing Vote?

855
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:53,252
Two people will be killed every month.

856
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:54,795
So please think carefully.

857
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:57,798
What does the writing on the wall mean?

858
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,055
My daughter Na-rae

859
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,933
was stabbed with a knife 22 times.

860
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:13,772
I did the same thing to her murderer.

861
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:18,277
Seven.

862
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:20,821
Eight.

863
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:22,239
Nine.

864
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,120
He was already dead, but I couldn't stop.

865
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:30,289
He was the son of a bitch who dared

866
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:32,708
to lay his hands on my daughter.

867
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:35,210
Ten.

868
01:02:35,711 --> 01:02:36,712
Eleven.

869
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,297
Twelve.

870
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,842
And then the 13th thrust...

871
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:47,181
The knife slipped in the rain,
so the 13th stab wound was different

872
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:50,100
from the one my daughter sustained.

873
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:55,355
That's probably what it means.

874
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,234
The 13th one
was subtly but clearly different.

875
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:00,611
And wrong.

876
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,030
Did anyone know about that?

877
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,615
It wasn't in the autopsy report.

878
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:06,116
Do you remember who you told this to?

879
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:09,495
I just realized it too. So no.

880
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,875
I'm sure someone who was very interested
in this case found out.

881
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:19,213
Who would be
this interested in you or this case?

882
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:20,923
Your friends, relatives,

883
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,467
or someone who liked or respected you.

884
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,844
Did anyone approach you as a fan?

885
01:03:25,928 --> 01:03:28,889
Was there anyone
who particularly doted on your daughter?

886
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:33,435
Kim Mu-chan.

887
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:38,065
Pardon?

888
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,281
We were very close in the past,

889
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:50,035
and he told me that he respected me.

890
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:56,750
He also knows about the phrase
"the devils who were deemed innocent."

891
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:05,175
The only one who fits the description

892
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:06,927
would be Kim Mu-chan.

893
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:12,891
Don't trust him too much.

894
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:17,354
That's all I have to say to you.

895
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,481
You've changed a lot
during your stay here.

896
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,277
Talking nonsense to a cop.

897
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:32,077
Inmate 0512. I've finished
talking with them.

898
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,621
Wait. I still have more questions to ask.

899
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:53,640
YOUR WATCHDOG, CHAE DO-HEE'S
THE KILLING VOTE SPECIAL

900
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:55,475
BEGINS MARCH 2023

901
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:05,152
NEW MESSAGE

902
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:12,993
Get your camera.

903
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:14,077
Hurry.

904
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:19,458
THE LATE BAE

905
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,460
MAY HE REST IN PEACE

906
01:05:33,472 --> 01:05:34,931
KIM MU-CHAN

907
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:04,586
THE DAY

908
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:08,340
MY HUSBAND DIED

909
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,315
How can it be so empty?

910
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:27,192
Seriously. I hope more mourners come.

911
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:32,114
Money.

912
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:34,574
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.

913
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:40,706
Please call 911!

914
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:50,215
Is what Kwon Seok-joo said true?

915
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:51,633
Were you two that close?

916
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:53,719
The list of people
who read Kwon Seok-joo's case file,

917
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:56,596
those who were present to hear him
address the court, and acquaintances.

918
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,848
Put them together for me.

919
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:00,559
Don't avoid the question and tell me.

920
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:03,019
There's something more
between you and him, right?

921
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:05,397
That's what it seemed like.

922
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:07,649
Wait. Superintendent Kim!

923
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,209
CALLER NUMBER 0000

924
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:30,046
THE KILLING VOTE

925
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,090
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

926
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:33,550
Today was on short notice,

927
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,136
but I'm here with a special episode.

928
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:39,973
It's because I heard tragic news
of an innocent cop getting injured.

929
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:45,312
Shall we check

930
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,272
if the police has told us the truth?

931
01:07:49,191 --> 01:07:50,734
Take the video properly.

932
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,154
Somebody's moving.

933
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:56,031
Where?

934
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:58,241
That's crazy. He survived it.

935
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:00,952
That is crazy.

936
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:03,789
Jackpot! We're going to get so many views.

937
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:07,459
Who's that woman?

938
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:09,461
His girlfriend?

939
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:14,591
Ouch! It's hot!

940
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:17,219
Damn, that scared me!

941
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:18,720
Hey, we should go!

942
01:08:30,232 --> 01:08:32,192
- There they are!
- They're coming out.

943
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:33,276
Superintendent Kim Mu-chan.

944
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,737
Please tell us what's going on.

945
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:47,958
The rotten and corrupt police are now
mocking the people with fake news.

946
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:51,294
They distorted the true intention
of The Killing Vote

947
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:54,881
and framed me for hurting an innocent cop.

948
01:08:58,218 --> 01:08:59,886
Are you watching, Mom?

949
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:02,722
Yeah, I'm watching it.

950
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:06,059
What was so wrong?

951
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:08,144
Our justice is

952
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:11,439
extremely rational.

953
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:16,862
Making sure that those
who deserve to die are dead.

954
01:09:16,945 --> 01:09:20,782
And calling the villain
on the gallows a victim.

955
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:30,208
Tell me,

956
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,168
Superintendent Kim Mu-chan.

957
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,839
What is justice for you?

958
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,269
Please give us a comment.

959
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,449
You and The Killing Vote.

960
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:06,494
Don't be mistaken.

961
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,165
You're not a hero.

962
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:13,126
KIM REPORTED TO BE IN SERIOUS CONDITION

963
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:15,086
I'm going to catch you no matter what.

964
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:10,266
Do you remember anything about that guy?

965
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:11,434
His smell.

966
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:13,770
He had the same smell
as when you play with fireworks.

967
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:16,356
It might be the same culprit
for both cases.

968
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:17,649
Superintendent Kim, that man...

969
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:19,192
I think he's that taxi driver.

970
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:21,611
Who in the world
are we supposed to go after?

971
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:23,530
Number one fan?

972
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,907
This person's been sending letters
for years without fail.

973
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,201
You actually know Gaetal's

974
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,203
next target, don't you?

975
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:34,958
