So when do we head out to rescue Muyu?

178
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,180
Don't rush.

179
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,850
Su Muyu's in the Shadow Prison for now.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,090
He's in no immediate danger.

181
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,300
When the time is right,

182
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,900
you'll get your chance to fight.

183
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,020
For now,

184
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:20,970
just stay here

185
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,970
and wait for my signal.

186
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,570
What's the Patriarch's take?

187
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,500
What I'm saying

188
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,020
is exactly the Patriarch's will.

189
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,700
He hasn't assigned

190
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,380
any task to you.

191
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,420
Only this:

192
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,930
You all slipped into the city under cover,

193
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,140
so keep it that way.

194
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,260
Don't let anyone

195
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,210
spot you.

196
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,610
Also,

197
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,570
when you go out,

198
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,180
remember your veil.

199
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,420
Otherwise...

200
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,500
you'll blow your cover too easily.

201
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,330
Got it.

202
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,090
How's the matter

203
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,090
I asked you to check?

204
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,800
The Xuanwu Guardian still hasn't returned.

205
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,810
You likely

206
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,420
won't see him this trip.

207
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,900
I'm off now.

208
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,020
Cold as ever.

209
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,180
Oh...

210
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,330
Had I known,

211
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,020
I wouldn't have come.

212
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,780
Everyone,

213
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,450
today's topic

214
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,090
is the founding emperor, Xiao Yi.

215
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,300
- Great! - Great!

216
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,380
He's eight chi tall,

217
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,020
bold and fearless.

218
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,210
He trained from age five,

219
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,780
with a booklet bought for three coppers...

220
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,570
Uncle Qidao!

221
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,380
Oh, you're here.

222
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,450
Have a seat.

223
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,850
Uncle Qidao,

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,300
did you move

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,330
the whole Xie family here?

226
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,610
It's the imperial capital.

227
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,780
Men like us

228
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,570
only get one chance in life

229
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,570
to visit a place like this.

230
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,420
So I brought them to broaden their horizons.

231
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,780
That may be unwise.

232
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,610
Relax.

233
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,660
I borrowed someone else's identity.

234
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,660
For now,

235
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,450
we're the Five Tigers Sect.

236
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,870
We're here

237
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,500
to join the martial tournament.

238
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,300
No one will question us.

239
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,780
Blood River sent Su Zhe and Xie Qidao,

240
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,300
with eighteen elite killers.

241
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,210
Only twenty men

242
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,060
to kill the Prince of Langya...

243
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,900
nowhere near enough.

244
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,690
Su Changhe also sent news:

245
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,500
the time is set.

246
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,330
In three days,

247
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,730
the Prince of Langya will pray at Fengxiao Temple.

248
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,120
With him

249
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,780
only Li Xinyue and Ji Ruofeng.

250
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,210
It's the best chance to remove him.

251
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,370
I've heard

252
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,690
he keeps that habit.

253
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,810
It is a good opening.

254
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,090
Then let's strike that day.

255
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,570
Lead the Hawkeye unit

256
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,020
and hold the Shadow Prison.

257
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,330
Until Blood River finishes,

258
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,780
no one approaches...

259
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,420
including me.

260
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,690
Including you?

261
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,730
Yes,

262
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,140
including me.

263
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,380
Sir,

264
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,420
you suspect them?

265
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,300
Just a precaution.

266
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,180
Su Changhe's been

267
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,140
far too cooperative.

268
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,090
It unsettles me.

269
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,170
As you command!

270
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,020
- As you command! - As you command!

271
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,060
Sir,

272
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,450
this is a gamble.

273
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,450
It is.

274
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,500
So this time I'm betting

275
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,090
His Majesty

276
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,850
also wants the Prince of Langya dead!

277
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,060
They're brothers,

278
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,090
and the throne

279
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,450
was even ceded to him

280
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,540
by the Prince of Langya.

281
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,090
Precisely because

282
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,730
that throne was given by him.

283
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,660
Three days later,

284
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,810
at Fengxiao Temple...

285
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,330
Day to day you'd never guess

286
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,850
the Prince of Langya is that devout.

287
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,780
He isn't going there to worship.

288
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,450
He's going to meet someone.

289
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,930
How many came?

290
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,020
Uncle Qidao brought a dozen or so.

291
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,210
Plus Uncle Zhe,

292
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,970
twenty elites on the surface

293
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,140
to ambush the Prince of Langya.

294
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,930
In the shadows,

295
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,020
Xuewei,

296
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,900
Changli,

297
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,090
they're already in place.

298
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,210
Count you and me,

299
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,300
seven in all.

300
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,540
The Shadow Sect

301
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,900
has no clue.

302
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,260
Eight in all!

303
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,500
You're not of Blood River.

304
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,900
This has nothing to do with you.

305
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,970
But I'm Su Muyu's friend.

306
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,180
He's with the Nan'an City Medicine Hall's,

307
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,730
my partner.

308
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,180
Fine.

309
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,730
Then don't you die on me,

310
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,210
or he'll blame me.

311
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,090
I'm Su Zhe's daughter, you know.

312
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,450
By the way,

313
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,260
where's my father?

314
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,090
This time,

315
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,380
what's his assignment?

316
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,020
His task

317
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,660
is the most important.

318
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,180
Someone from the Shadow Sect is here.

319
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,180
Not Crow?

320
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,090
Crow has other business.

321
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,690
I am the Shadow Sect's Left Shadow Guard,

322
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,730
Luo Tianxiang.

323
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,930
I hear your Right Shadow Guard

324
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,140
is the Lone Sword Deity.

325
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,450
He has a name close to mine,

326
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,660
both "Qingyang."

327
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,260
Since you're the Left Shadow Guard

328
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,090
and your surname is Luo,

329
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:02,970
you must be

330
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,090
quite formidable as well.

331
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,420
Senior Luo's swordwork is peerless.

332
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,930
In the Shadow Sect, for decades,

333
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,450
only this one Sword Deity has emerged.

334
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,970
I'm far beneath him.

335
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,730
Then, Left Shadow Guard,

336
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,450
what brings you

337
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,380
here today?

338
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,210
Crow delivered the Patriarch's message.

339
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,420
The Sect Leader has decided:

340
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,660
three days from now,

341
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,810
at Fengxiao Temple,

342
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,540
we ambush the Prince of Langya.

343
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,540
Go tell your Sect Leader Yi Bu:

344
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,850
within three days,

345
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,420
we need more intel.

346
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,780
Killing the Prince of Langya

347
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,970
isn't something decided

348
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:37,970
with a single sentence.

349
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,210
Of course.

350
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,380
In this fight,

351
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,850
none of us has a way back.

352
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,020
The Sect Leader will send Tianqi City's "shadow"

353
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,850
to move with you.

354
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,260
At the critical moment,

355
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,140
he'll act himself.

356
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,330
Sir.

357
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,780
Elders,

358
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,610
you're here.

359
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,890
Looks like you've

360
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,740
run into trouble.

361
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,850
You summoned all three of us at once.

362
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,370
However...

363
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,300
I understand.

364
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,740
You three have retired from the jianghu

365
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,740
and don't wish to meddle in Tianqi's affairs.

366
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:28,780
But,

367
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,220
this matter is grave.

368
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,410
We may have to mobilize

369
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,300
over half the Shadow Sect's forces,

370
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,300
so I ask the three of you

371
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,170
to help guard one place.

372
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,810
All three of us,

373
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,940
to guard a single place?

374
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,740
You mean

375
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,610
the Wanjuan Tower?

376
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,850
Yes.

377
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,460
Master?

378
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,500
Master.

379
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:18,980
Master.

380
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,330
Don't nod off.

381
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,220
Master.

382
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,090
Your Highness?

383
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,060
Apologies.

384
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,330
The road was long.

385
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,740
I got a bit tired

386
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,130
and dozed off.

387
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,170
Master Forget-Joy

388
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,780
and Master Forget-Worry

389
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,330
are quite the pair.

390
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,060
My senior

391
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,890
is named "Forget-Worry,"

392
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,540
yet these days

393
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,570
he worries nonstop.

394
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,300
I'm "Forget-Joy,"

395
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,740
and live free and easy.

396
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,780
Truly fate toys with us.

397
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,650
Just now in meditation,

398
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,650
I dreamed

399
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,540
the Buddha spoke with me

400
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,460
on the path of joy and sorrow.

401
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,090
Master,

402
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,300
we've known each other for years.

403
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,500
Why put on the sage act

404
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,060
in front of me?

405
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,150
You actually dreamed

406
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,940
of Tianxiang Restaurant's

407
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,740
All-Vegetable Banquet,

408
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,980
from dawn

409
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,710
all the way to sunset.

410
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,260
How did you know?

411
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,740
You drool

412
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,260
was dripping.

413
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,500
Amitabha.

414
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,460
My fault.

415
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,260
Master,

416
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,410
how are Master Forget-Worry

417
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,890
and the boy lately?

418
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,890
Are they doing well?

419
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,370
That child,

420
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,130
like his father Ye Dingzhi,

421
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,260
is a martial genius.

422
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,700
Thank you.

423
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,460
I'd rather

424
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,220
he be ordinary.

425
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,060
The stronger he is,

426
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,810
the greater the risk.

427
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,020
Mr. Su,

428
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,130
I thought the last time we met

429
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,650
would be

430
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,020
our final meeting.

431
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,370
So did I.

432
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,020
Then,

433
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,330
what changed your mind?

434
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,060
That cursed thing called fate.

435
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,330
The Demon-Taming Staff.

436
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,810
Sharp eye, Master.

437
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,940
It is the Demon-Taming Staff.

438
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,090
I'm the demon in your heart, Su Zhe.

439
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,330
I'm here to help Your Highness

440
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,130
cast it out.

441
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,610
Who are those bandits

442
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,610
to dare assassinate the Prince of Langya?

443
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,850
If you ask me,

444
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,780
[Ji Ruofeng, Guardian White Tiger] they're likely acquaintances.

445
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,700
Blood River,

446
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,060
show yourselves!

447
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,500
Kill!

448
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,260
What's this?

449
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,410
So few men?

450
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,890
Why didn't your squad

451
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,980
bring more along?

452
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,510
The Patriarch was badly wounded

453
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,930
in the last attempt

454
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,020
on the Prince of Langya.

455
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,700
We must keep enough hands

456
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,410
to guard him!

457
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,300
You knew

458
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,600
I'd come here

459
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,850
with few guards,

460
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,350
so you thought

461
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,410
it was the perfect time to kill me.

462
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,940
We never believed we could kill you.

463
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,090
The price is too high.

464
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,940
Blood River can't afford it.

465
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,500
Then why

466
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,700
are we meeting here?

467
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,700
Didn't I just say?

468
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,780
Blame it on cursed fate.

469
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,980
Amitabha...

470
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,570
My Prajna Bell

471
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,410
isn't as good as my senior's.

472
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,740
Your Highness...

473
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,700
my inner force

474
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,570
is spent.

475
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,300
If blood is shed at Fengxiao Temple,

476
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,370
the blame is mine.

477
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,720
Let me witness

478
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,650
the fabled Realm-Rending Sword Art.

479
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,300
Heaven-Demon Sixteen Dances!

480
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,300
Few have ever seen

481
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,540
the true Demon dance.

482
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,700
Those who did

483
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,060
are already dead.

484
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,940
You might survive,

485
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,370
but this Demon

486
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,410
will walk with you forever!

487
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,740
Hold on.

488
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,650
I'm calling for reinforcements.

489
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,540
Got it!

490
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,460
"Stage a fine play with me.

491
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,090
Draw the Shadow Sect away,

492
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,220
and level the Wanjuan Tower.

493
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,980
By Muyu"

494
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,540
All right.

495
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,650
I'm heading to Tianqi City now

496
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,810
to see how "fine" this play really is.

497
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,170
Come in.

498
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,330
Uncle Zhe has struck.

499
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,500
At Fengxiao Temple,

500
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,650
the killing's begun.

501
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,890
Uncle Zhe said

502
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,940
it'll shake the heavens and earth.

503
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,940
He guarantees it.

504
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,850
Send the heaven-rank killing order.

505
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,850
Time the real blade

506
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,740
showed itself.

507
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,740
I have waited

508
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,060
for this day

509
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,090
a long time.

510
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,740
Fight, then go home.

511
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,370
Tianqi City bores you?

512
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,740
I'd bet even Su Muyu,

513
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,260
locked in the Shadow Prison,

514
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,410
finds it interesting.

515
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,330
Dull, actually.

516
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,740
Always feels like

517
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,460
a string is pulling me.

518
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,170
And today,

519
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,610
we'll cut that string.

520
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,060
A fresh-carved peachwood sword?

521
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,220
It's blessed at Mount Wangcheng.

522
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,780
You like playing the diviner that much?

523
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,330
I even dreamed of soaring off

524
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,460
as an immortal.

525
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,700
Sir.

526
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,460
Su Zhe and Xie Qidao

527
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,500
led killers to ambush Xiao Ruofeng

528
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,130
at Fengxiao Temple.

529
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,170
But it seems

530
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,500
they can't best the prince's men.

531
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,330
We received

532
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,130
our men's distress signal.

533
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,740
Send more to Fengxiao Temple.

534
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,980
Dispatch the Shadow Guards

535
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,810
from the Wanjuan Tower too.

536
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,700
No more standing by.

537
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,890
Move in!

538
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,300
What... what if we're exposed?

539

540
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,850
the one commanding Tianqi's defenses

541

won't be him anymore.

542
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,570

546

we'd meet again?

547
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,220
I'm glad to see you again,

548
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,410
Beauty Mu.

549
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,370
Here.

550
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,940
Will this little thing

551
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,700
find Su Muyu shortly?

552
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,570
That depends on the tacit bond between Muyu and me.

553
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,940
After all,

554
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,300
we've cheated death together so many times.

555
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,170
If there's no bond,

556
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,410
then everything

557
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,540
falls apart.

558
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,980
If our bond

559
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,810
is proven,

560
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,410
will you start overthinking it?

561
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,410
Beauty Mu,

562
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,810
why tease me

563
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,650
like the Patriarch?

564
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,410
We're not

565
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,700
what you think.

566
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,260
I understand.

567
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,540
Just friends.

568
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,740
Good friends.

569
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,220
Sir!

570
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,020
Sir.

571
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,570
Any trouble here?

572
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,300
No trouble.

573
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,540
Rest easy, Sir.

574
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,090
Good.

575
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,610
You did well.

576
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,570
Thank you for the praise.

577
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,890
All right.

578
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,170
Sir.

579
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,330
What are you doing?

580
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,540
What,

581
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,940
can't I enter either?

582
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,700
I wouldn't...

583
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,060
dare stop you!

584
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,460
How dare you!

585
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,060
Drop the act.

586
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,650
How did you know?

587
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,540
The Sect Leader and I made an agreement:

588
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,090
even he

589
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,700
can't enter the Shadow Prison.

590
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,610
If he truly had to

591
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,610
he'd first remind me

592
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,260
of that agreement

593
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,460
before stepping in.

594
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,850
But you came

595
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,500
as if no such agreement

596
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,540
existed.

597
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,890
So you must be an impostor!

598
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,610
Didn't expect

599
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,540
Yi Bu

600
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,130
to be clever sometimes.

601
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,590
The Shadow Prison's guard

602
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,740
is now the Hawkeye unit.

603
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,370
Even we Three Officials

604
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,920
don't have the rank

605
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,260
to bypass them.

606
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,810
Then I'll change my face.

607
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,410
Yi Bu would never imagine

608
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,540
someone bold enough

609
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,850
to use his identity

610
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,060
to slip inside.

611
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,780
Traitor!

612
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,310
I don't know what Yi Bu's thinking.

613
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,220
Blood River's strength

614
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,810
already dwarfs the Shadow Sect's,

615
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,500
yet he clings to stale rules

616
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,810
to keep Blood River in check.

617
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,740
I'm not like my two foolish partners.

618
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,850
You betrayed us?

619
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,500
I told you

620
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,460
I admire Su Changhe.

621
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,940
After that Yellow Springs Pawnshop affair,

622
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,780
I started contacting them.

623
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,560
He's smarter than you all.

624
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,570
He chooses

625
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,610
the right side.

626
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,460
You can't win.

627
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,940
Ever consider this:

628
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,540
even if Su Muyu's caught,

629
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,000
it may just be

630
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,940
a trap to bottle you.

631
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,660
And the one in the jar

632
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,740
won't be Su Muyu,

633
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,890
but...

634
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,240
the Shadow Sect.

635
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,410
What do you mean?

636
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,960
Even if we seize Su Muyu,

637
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,230
how many men to guard him?

638
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,260
If he breaks out,

639
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,570
how many more

640
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,460
to stop him?

641
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,130
By then,

642
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,330
the Shadow Sect is meat on the block.

643
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,500
Enough talk.

644
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:05,890
Mu Ying.

645
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,940
Did you get his face?

646
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,020
Not much

647
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,410
worth remembering.

648
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,540
About nine-tenths.

649
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,780
Good.

650
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,410
Then the real Heaven Official

651
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,370
needn't exist.

652
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:39,940
I...

653
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,940
only choose the strong side.

654
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,780
What's this array?

655
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,570
The Dipper Array.

656
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,170
Its killing power is average.

657
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,890
But at trapping,

658
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,740
it's among the best under heaven.

659
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,220

660
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,170
break it!

661
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,650
Looks like they're exposed.

662
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,780

666
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,940
got any more tracking spiders?

667
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,810
This one's unique to Muyu.

668
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,370
It takes a long time

669

to raise one like it.

670
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,500
Still,

671
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,740
It's Muyu.

672

Even with a single drop,

673
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,740
