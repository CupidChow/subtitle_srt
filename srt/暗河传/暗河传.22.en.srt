[Episode 22]

5
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,980
Keep your dirty dealings hidden.

6
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,100
If you expose yourself

7
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,820
in Wushuang City,

8
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,380
I won't be able to keep you safe.

9
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,130
I...

10
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,930
Haoyue,

11
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,100
mind your manners!

12
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,920
I, Haoyue,

13
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,100
offer my greetings, sir.

14
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,220
So, you're the head of Tianxia House?

15
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,100
Yes,

16
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,060
I am.

17
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,680
I know all about the deals

18
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,220
you made with my foolish disciple.

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,780
The reason I didn't interfere

20
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,890
is not because I approved of them,

21
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,800
but because the matter

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,850
was too trivial

23
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,610
to be worth a fuss.

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,980
Master...

25
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,260
I know full well that you're useless.

26
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,730
Even though you can't protect

27
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,780
this city with martial skill,

28
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,570
you can still serve it

29
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,820
in other ways.

30
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,240
But don't waste

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,660
what little wit you have

32
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,690
on greed and profit.

33
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,540
Do you understand?

34
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,660
Yes, Master.

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,100
Do you still remember

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,610
how you became my disciple?

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,060
Of course.

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,730
That year, a flood struck my hometown.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,780
Everyone died

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,560
except me.

41
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,730
I clung to a tree and survived.

42
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,760
It was you who passed by and saved me.

43
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,940
Though I

44
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,290
was slow to learn martial arts,

45
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,170
you kept me

46
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,980
by your side,

47
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,220
and I've followed you

48
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,010
ever since.

49
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,450
I know

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,500
you grew up in the wild

51
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,450
and never took to life in Wushuang City.

52
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,380
But I saved your life,

53
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,100
so you must repay me

54
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,890
and serve Wushuang City.

55
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,450
Yes, Master.

56
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,540
Rise.

57
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,410
Little Wushuang.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,540
Master.

59
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,780
Come here.

60
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,130
From now on,

61
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,610
you must take good care of your junior brother.

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,290
I've always

63
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,890
treated him well.

64
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,260
When he becomes the City Lord,

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,810
you must be loyal to him.

66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,850
Yes, Master.

67
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,250
Serve him with your life.

68
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,700
I will, Master.

69
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,290
Send word:

70
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,660
for the upcoming sword duel,

71
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,730
Wushuang City

72
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,050
welcomes heroes from all lands to witness it.

73
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,780
Have every visitor

74
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,290
registered by name

75
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,220
and make this clear to them:

76
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,050
a sword shows no mercy;

77
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,900
life or death is their own to bear.

78
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,930
But

79
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,460
there's never been

80
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,220
such a precedent before.

81
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,100
I know

82
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,340
they all want to see Wushuang City fall,

83
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,980
so I will let them come and see.

84
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,610
They will learn

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,220
soon enough that it will never happen.

86
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,490
Wushuang City

87
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,930
may not rival Xueyue City,

88
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,780
but

89
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,900
it is not to be taken lightly.

90
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,340
Not to be

91
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,290
taken lightly?

92
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,980
Master!

93
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,100
Master!

94
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,140
Why is Master in such a temper today?

95
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,540
Did he take the wrong medicine?

96
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,220
Could the City Lord just be bluffing?

97
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,980
How could he have chosen

98
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,120
the next City Lord already?

99
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,050
And it's a child?

100
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,610
Don't underestimate that child.

101
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,750
Master is already the finest martial artist

102
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,220
Wushuang City has seen in generations.

103
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,620
But that boy's

104
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,730
gift for swordsmanship

105
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,850
surpasses even his.

106
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,170
By contrast,

107
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,580
I was never suited for martial arts.

108
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,100
Yes, I am the chief disciple,

109
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,580
but that title means nothing at all.

110
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,770
If that child

111
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,460
really becomes the City Lord,

112
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,850
then we only need to get rid of him,

113
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,850
and the whole city will be...

114
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,370
Useless wretch!

115
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,730
At least I know I am useless.

116
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,780
You don't even know your own place.

117
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,660
People like us

118
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,720
must rely on the strong.

119
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,660
We cannot command them.

120
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,900
We belong in the shadows.

121
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,850
If you can't even understand that,

122
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,610
Tianxia House does not need you.

123
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,370
Understood.

124
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,340
Understood.

125
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,290
Useless.

126
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,460
If even you know we must rely on the strong,

127
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,050
do you really think I see you as my backer?

128
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,340
I will wait

129
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,610
for the day you and Wushuang City

130
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,340
fall together.

131
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,980
Master, look!

132
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,370
It's so lively here!

133
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:01,930
Are you happy?

134
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,780
Yes, I am!

135
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,220
Little Wushuang,

136
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,930
what do you

137
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,250
think of Senior Brother Lu?

138
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,170
He is a bit slow.

139
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,410
Indeed.

140
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,610
He is slow in martial arts.

141
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,930
But remember,

142
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,580
everyone has their strengths.

143
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,410
Though he's not a good fighter,

144
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,020
he is very smooth

145
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,050
at getting by in the world.

146
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,580
In some ways, he even

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,660
outshines me.

148
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,810
Master,

149
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,250
why are you acting so strangely today?

150
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,700
Tanghulu!
[*candied fruit]

151
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,700
Big and sweet tanghulu!

152
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,020
Master.

153
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,660
Would you like a stick?

154
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,530
It'll be one wen.

155
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,220
Thank you.

156
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,900
Do you want this one?

157
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,980
This one?

158
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,220
Thank you.

159
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,420
Did you think I acted strangely

160
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,940
because I didn't buy you

161
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,050
tanghulu today?

162
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,140
Here.

163
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,660
Thank you, Master.

164
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,700
Though I'm only 30 years old,

165
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,140
compared to Baili Dongjun and the others,

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,540
I'm more like one from their elders' generation.

167
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,290
I lack their pride

168
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,580
and their drive.

169
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,460
That's not how it should be.

170
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,100
Do you understand?

171
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,890
If I die one day,

172
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,980
you must trust

173
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,820
Senior Brother Lu.

174
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,010
He may be greedy for small gains,

175
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,280
but

176
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,370
he is an honest and kind boy.

177
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,310
He will take care of you

178
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,060
just as I have,

179
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,460
and he'll buy you

180
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,610
sweet tanghulu too.

181
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,650
In the days to come,

182
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,650
if you love sword practice,

183
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,180
train as much as you wish.

184
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,530
With your talent,

185
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,610
you can surely become known as a sword deity.

186
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,730
But if you don't wish to train, that's fine too.

187
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,370
Travel the world,

188
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,810
and see

189
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,250
its mountains and rivers.

190
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,250
As for me,

191
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,980
I will not have that chance in this life.

192
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,850
Master.

193
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,650
Master, you can't die yet!

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,820
You still have to

195
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,850
buy me more tanghulu!

196
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,460
All right.

197
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,700
I will buy you tanghulu,

198
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,890
and your senior brother will too.

199
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,890
All right?

200
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,820
All right!

201
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,300
Let's go.

202
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,130
Miss Bai.

203
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,770
Mr. Su.

204
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,610
Mr. Su.

205
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,250
Miss Bai.

206
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,370
Mr. Su.

207
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,060
Mr. Su, please take this tobacco.

208
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,100
Miss Bai.

209
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,940
The medicine you prescribed for my mother

210
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,700
worked wonders.

211
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,010
She's much better now.

212
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,980
Don't mention it.

213
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,300
The clinic is closed today.

214
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,080
Bring her back

215
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,530
for a return visit in a few days.

216
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,580
All right.

217
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,250
I won't keep you any longer. See you.

218
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,420
Before we left,

219
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,580
didn't you tell the maid

220
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,420
you wouldn't return

221
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,220
without buying a carriage full of things?

222
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,700
Why haven't you bought anything?

223
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,980
Nothing has caught my eye.

224
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,730
Sir.

225
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,650
Coming!

226
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,220
It's you, Miss Bai.

227
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,490
What would you like?

228
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,770
A pot of Longjing tea

229
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,770
and a plate of mung bean cakes.

230
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,820
Coming right up.

231
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,060
Waiter,

232
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,820
bring the tea.

233
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,770
Here, Miss Bai.

234
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,530
Our finest tea

235
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,650
and freshly baked mung bean cakes.

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,610
Please enjoy.

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,730
What's wrong, Miss Bai?

238
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,650
Is our tea or our dessert

239
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,370
not to your liking?

240
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,250
It's not that.

241
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,460
It's just me.

242
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,130
I set out today

243
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,890
hoping for a pleasant outing.

244
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,340
I felt cheerful at first,

245
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,940
but after walking half the day,

246
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,340
everything felt dull.

247
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,340
But Nan'an City is famous far and wide

248
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,250
for its curious

249
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,340
and delightful trinkets.

250
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,700
That said, you've been here

251
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,530
for some time now.

252
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,940
Even the most exciting place

253
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,940
grows dull

254
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,370
after a while,

255
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,220
don't you think?

256
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,650
Maybe

257
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,220
you can try seeing it as your home.

258
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,130
Then

259
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,820
you may view

260
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,100
this city differently

261
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,220
and feel different about it.

262
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,820
That makes sense.

263
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,300
But maybe I should travel farther

264
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,490
and see more of the world.

265
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,370
That might be a good idea.

266
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,460
Please enjoy.

267
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,820
You find it boring

268
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,500
because you think

269
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,940
the person beside you is boring.

270
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,610
Just eat your food.

271
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:28,890
Have you heard?

272
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,010
Something big

273
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,130
happened recently.

274
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,370
What big thing?

275
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,370
Do you mean the orphan from No-Sword City,

276
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,180
Zhuo Yue'an,

277
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,100
challenging Wushuang City?

278
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,890
That's right.

279
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,370
I heard he defeated

280
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,300
several elders

281
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,700
and even the old City Lord.

282
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,530
Father,

283
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,300
did you hear that?

284
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,060
It sounds like they're talking about Su Muyu.

285
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,490
Be quiet.

286
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,110
Let me hear how Su Muyu is doing.

287
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,850
Everyone's talking about it.

288
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,340
This news has probably spread

289
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,300
throughout the martial world.

290
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,770
Sir,

291
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,580
check, please.

292
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:01,980
Take care.

293
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,570
Please.

294
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,680
You can rest easy now.

295
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,890
He came out of his duels in Wushuang City unscathed.

296
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,940
He'll probably be back

297
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,420
in a few days.

298
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,220
Father!

299
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,820
Don't be rash.

300
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,770
How many days will it take to reach Wushuang City?

301
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,060
Half a month.

302
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,650
If you run into storms

303
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,610
or snow,

304
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,060
it could take at least a month.

305
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,130
What if I ride hard and change horses

306
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,060
along the way?

307
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,340
It will take at least seven days.

308
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,610
Heading to Wushuang City?

309
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,730
There's a ship docked at the east pier today.

310
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,700
It will sail east and reach

311
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,010
Luoyang tomorrow.

312
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,460
From Luoyang, Wushuang City

313
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,250
is only 100 li away.

314
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,700
Mind your own business!

315
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,250
Master Ji,

316
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,890
the news has already spread.

317
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,340
Except for Zhao Yuzhen, the Profound Sword Deity,

318
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,650
all the other sword deities

319
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,340
will go to Wushuang City.

320
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,010
Do you really need

321
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,570
to come report something like that

322
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,650
to me in person?

323
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,650
There is another piece of news.

324
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,820
It is related to the rule

325
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,940
you set before.

326
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,180
Blood River's Spider Woman

327
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,700
has been hiring agents

328
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,220
to search for a certain person.

329
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,530
She's looking for Lianyue, isn't she?

330
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,100
He has been missing for quite some time.

331
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,880
Since he visited the Tang Clan,

332
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,940
there's been no word from him.

333
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,660
Most of our agents in Shuzhong

334
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,960
have also been discovered

335
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,930
by the Tang Clan.

336
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,540
Since that's the case,

337
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,090
let's see

338
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,900
whether this beauty from Blood River

339
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,500
will make a move

340
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,540
and what

341
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,420
new information

342
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,660
she might bring us.

343
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,810
But

344
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,970
our own people must not relax.

345
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,380
Keep investigating.

346
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,140
Then should I give her

347
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,780
information about the Xuanwu Guardian?

348
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,140
Give it to her if she asks for it.

349
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,330
Remember,

350
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,450
take no payment.

351
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:13,970
Understood.

352
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:26,740
[Tianxia House]

353
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,300
It seems

354
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,690
not many people have faith

355
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,610
in our City Lord.

356
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,580
- This is mine. - Song Yanhui can split

357
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,250
a droplet with his sword.

358
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,450
Do you realize how good he is?

359
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,660
I'm betting on Song Yanhui!

360
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,500
[Song Yanhui]
No-Sword City has long been in decline.

361
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,920
This orphan came out of nowhere.

362
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,140
[Zhuo Yue'an]
How could he possibly beat Song Yanhui?

363
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,140
Not a chance!

364
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,300
What do you mean by that?

365
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,690
Age brings wisdom!

366
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,610
Even the previous old City Lord

367
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,780
was wounded by him.

368
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,850
Really?

369
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,900
You can tell he's no ordinary man.

370
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,300
What is he doing here?

371
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,850
Sir, I haven't seen you before.

372
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,300
Is this your first time

373
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,810
at Tianxia House?

374
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,210
I suppose it's my second time.

375
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,260
Pardon my poor eyesight.

376
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,900
What brings you here this time?

377
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,810
Poor eyesight?

378
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,570
Sir,

379
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,260
these people

380
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,060
have noses like hounds.

381
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,200
As soon as someone

382
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,810
with even a hint of money walks in,

383
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,660
they'll act

384
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,020
like they've found their prey.

385
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,900
They'll fix on that person,

386
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,780
and within two hours,

387
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,850
they'll have uncovered his identity, his background,

388
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,140
and exactly how much

389
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,210
he can afford to lose.

390
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,970
Then they'll plan carefully

391
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,660
to drain every coin from him

392
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,700
before he leaves Tianxia House,

393
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,090
down to the last scrap of his wealth.

394
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,740
Isn't this

395
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,570
how you all cheated me

396
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,810
out of everything back then?

397
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,130
Ding,

398
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,090
what nonsense are you spouting?

399
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,370
Sir,

400
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,540
please don't

401
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,700
listen to him.

402
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,980
Who do you plan to bet on this time?

403
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,020
I have no interest

404
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,260
in gambling.

405
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,410
I'm just curious

406
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,700
about what

407
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,650
all this means.

408
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,130
Ah,

409
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,540
it's

410
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,570
about a major event in the martial world.

411
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,170
Zhuo Yue'an, an orphan from No-Sword City,

412
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,650
is challenging Song Yanhui,

413
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,780
the Lord of Wushuang City.

414
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,890
You can bet on Zhuo Yue'an to win

415
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,220
at odds of one to one.

416
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,890
If you wager 100 liang

417
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,220
and he wins,

418
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,260
you'll get 200 liang.

419
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,300
You can also bet on Song Yanhui to win.

420
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,090
If he does,

421
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,220
100 liang

422
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,020
will get you 300 liang.

423
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,410
Of course,

424
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,300
you can also bet

425
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,460
on a draw.

426
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,650
If you guess right,

427
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,610
you'll get 200 liang.

428
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,780
Why does Song Yanhui's win

429
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,740
pay more?

430
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,850
Young man,

431
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,410
you are too naive and clueless.

432
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,220
You'd best go home now.

433
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,200
This casino

434
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,460
is no place

435
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,370
for lambs like you.

436
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,010
You...!

437
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,260
Sir,

438
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,260
it's because

439
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,740
fewer people

440
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,460
are betting on him.

441
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,540
After all, the former Lord of Wushuang City

442
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,240
was already defeated

443
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,810
by Zhuo Yue'an,

444
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,960
and Song Yanhui's reputation

445
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,320
isn't much bigger

446
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,360
than Liu Yunqi's.

447
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,520
I see.

448
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,300
But

449
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,410
more importantly,

450
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,890
everyone loves a good story.

451
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,570
From a sect nearly forgotten by the world

452
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,130
emerges a swordsman unknown to all.

453
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,020
He defeats the chief disciple of Wushuang City,

454
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,500
the Four Swordsman of Lunwu Hall,

455
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,080
Elder Jian Shanyue,

456
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,300
and the former City Lord, Liu Yunqi.

457
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,580
Isn't that

458
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,220
an inspiring tale?

459
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,980
And if he

460
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,780
goes on to defeat the current City Lord,

461
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,930
Song Yanhui,

462
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,940
won't that make

463
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,810
the perfect ending?

464
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,740
How does one place a bet?

465
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,060
The minimum bet is three liang of silver,

466
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,220
and the maximum is an entire city.

467
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,330
All right,

468
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,260
then I'll bet three liang of silver.

469
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,780
After all that talk,

470
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,540
you're only betting three liang?

471
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,060
Then who are you betting on?

472
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,100
[Zhuo Yue'an]

473
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,410
Myself.

474
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,060
I'll bet on him.

475
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,260
Really?

476
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,260
I've never heard of him before.

477
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,780
I've trained in swordsmanship for years,

478
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,890
and I'm still no match for Song Yanhui.

479
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,020
The old City Lord is already formidable,

480
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,810
so this Zhuo Yue'an

481
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,410
must be even greater.

482
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,650
Fine, I'll bet on him then.

483
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,460
He knew I was watching him all along.

484
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,260
No,

485
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,780
not only that.

486
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,650
He also recognized me.

487
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,370
You made the right choice.

488
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,650
Take it.

489
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,890
Master Ji specifically instructed

490
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,410
that this lead be given free of charge.

491
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,410
But it's top secret.

492
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,570
You mustn't share it with anyone.

493
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,220
Would your master really be so generous?

494
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,620
[No new leads]

495
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,850
What does this mean?

496
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,890
So your lead is

497
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,200
that even you

498
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,410
have no new leads on Tang Lianyue?

499
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,940
And you call yourselves all-knowing under heaven?

500
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,610
Get lost!

501
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,820
[No new leads]

502
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,340
- Sir. - Buns!

503
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,530
- Here's your pancake with bone broth. - Fresh...

504
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,500
- Please enjoy. - Meat buns!

505
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,940
Pancakes with bone broth!

506
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,060
Pancakes with bone broth!

507
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,150
Scented sachets and trinkets!

508
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,570
Pancakes with bone broth! One copper coin each!

509
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,740
Yes, sir.

510
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,740
Wushuang City

511
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,780
is a city that never sleeps.

512
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,940
If you get hungry at night,

513
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,850
eat right here.

514
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,700
Sir,

515
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,500
would you like to try our pancake with bone broth?

516
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,650
Only one copper coin each.

517
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,780
No,

518
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,500
thank you.

519
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,680
[Grilled Meat Pancakes with Bone Broth]

520
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,260
All right then.

521
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,410
Night has fallen,

522
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,130
yet it's getting even livelier.

523
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,460
Naturally.

524
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,700
Our main city

525
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,940
is Wushuang City.

526
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,130
Its first City Lord

527
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,540
helped Emperor Tianwu found his empire

528
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,330
and was granted

529
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,940
great autonomy.

530
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,260
Even Sihuai City

531
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,370
has never had a curfew.

532
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,300
So of course,

533
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,650
the nights here are lively.

534
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,890
Sir,

535
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,740
you must be here to watch the duel, right?

536
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,940
Have you found a place to stay?

537
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,220
My home is just nearby.

538
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,090
Three copper coins a night.

539
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,090
Someone's been killed!

540
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,410

- Hurry. - What?

- Run! - What happened?

543
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,240
Someone's been killed!

544
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,810
What...

545
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,620
what's going on?

546
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,940
- Why is everyone running? - Sir.

547
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,850
What happened?

548
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,460
Wushuang City has sent out hundreds of Sword Bearers

549
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,490
to hunt for Zhuo Yue'an.

550
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,130
They're killing anyone they see.

551
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,220
Run!

552
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,330
Sword Bearers?

553
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,890
I came just in time.

554
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,300
But it seems I won't get to watch

555
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,540
the duel tomorrow.

556
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,170
Hurry up...

557
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,810
I don't think they're really after me.

558
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,490
Since Song Yanhui agreed

559
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,400
to the duel,

560
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,780
he won't go back on his word.

561
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,300
If these people are stirring up chaos

562
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,980
and killing people,

563
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,540
it must be to tarnish Song Yanhui's name.

564
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,740
It seems there are traitors

565
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,740
within Wushuang City.

566
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,810
They are trying to use this chance

567
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,300
to take the City Lord's seat from him.

568
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,190
Keep up!

569
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,550
Run!

570
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,330
Hurry!

571
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,850
Are you Zhuo Yue'an?

572
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,260
I am.

573
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,330
He never thought he'd actually

574
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,850
run into Zhuo Yue'an himself.

575
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,980
What are you doing here?

576
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,980
I came to watch the commotion,

577
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,780
but it seems

578
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,780
I've become part of it now.

579
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,020
Should we go straight to the duel tomorrow,

580
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,020
or find Su Muyu

581
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,220
tonight?

582
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,300
There's no rush.

583
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,700
Let's find an inn to stay at.

584
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,410
Then we'll go watch the duel tomorrow.

585
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,330
Trying to give Su Muyu

586
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,460
a surprise, are you?

587
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,540
Father, you...!

588
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,220
Wait.

589
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,060
What's that smell?

590
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,780
What's wrong?

591
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,740
Stop the carriage. We're getting off.

592
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,810
The inn is still some distance ahead.

593
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,500
Why get off now?

594
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,650
Father, lend me a light.

595
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,610
All right.

596
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,570
Are you here to burn incense

597
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,700
for someone who passed away?

598
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,130
You look so serious all of a sudden.

599
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,610
Is there something wrong with Sihuai City?

600
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,220
If there really is a problem,

601
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,500
then it's

602
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,700
a grave one.

603
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,780
People who come to Sihuai City

604
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,500
always act in ways I can't make sense of.

605
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,500
But since you've been generous with your silver,

606
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,370
I'll

607
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,330
wait here a while longer.

608
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,500
Take this pill.

609
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,480
Then drive the carriage

610
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,500
and leave at once.

611
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,260
- What? - You and I have shared

612
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,220
a journey together.

613
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,540
I don't wish to see you die here.

614
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,220
If you can't get out of the city,

615
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,300
find a safe place

616
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,020
to hide.

617
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,540
Huh?

618
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,220
Do as she says,

619
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,570
and you'll live.

620
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,740
Yes.

621
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,020
I understand, madam.

622
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,410
What exactly has gone wrong?

623
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,780
This city

624
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,220
has been poisoned.

625
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,370
Poisoned?

626
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,540
This entire city?

627
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,090
What kind of poison could be so powerful?

628
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,570
It's Blossom Ash.

629
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,890
Its toxicity is mild,

630
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,020
but if one stays long in air

631
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,370
tainted with Blossom Ash,

632
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,780
an ordinary person

633
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,090
will fall unconscious,

634
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,540
while a martial artist

635
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,810
will temporarily lose inner force

636
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,020
and be as good as crippled.

637
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,810
Blossom Ash

638
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,300
spreads widely,

639
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,980
but to poison an entire city

640
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,330
takes years of preparation.

641
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,650
When we first entered the city,

642
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,700
I did not smell

643
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,740
its scent.

644
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,220
Now, halfway through our route,

645
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,170
it's everywhere.

646
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,370
All those years of planning

647
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,810
were leading to this day.

648
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,060
Sihuai City is

649
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,260
about to change.

650
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,500
You're wrong.

651
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,610
Wushuang City

652
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,700
houses only smiths and sect disciples.

653
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,060
Most people

654
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,300
live in Sihuai City.

655
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,780
To seize Wushuang,

656
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,170
one must first take Sihuai.

657
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,260
So,

658
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,940
it is Wushuang City that faces the real upheaval.

659
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,170
Father,

660
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,610
is there any way you can

661
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,130
find Su Muyu quickly?

662
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,780
No problem.

663
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,980
There are others from Blood River here?

664
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,460
Could it be...?

665
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,220
Didn't you say only you came?

666
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,330
I said I came alone from Blood River,

667
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,310
but as for those in Nan'an City,

668
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,130
I can't be sure.

669
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,020
Find a deserted place

670
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,460
and meet up with them.

671
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,940
Will taking this make me all right?

672
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,020
It will only ease the effects for now.

673
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,650
The scent of Blossom Ash

674
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,540
is getting stronger.

675
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,370
We need to find a place

676
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,090
where I can set up an Array of Death in Thirty Feet

677
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,890
to block out the poison.

678
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,610
All right.

679
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,810
Let's go.

680
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,090
Someone's poisoned the city.

681
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,540
Who could it be?

682
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,850
Why is it so quiet today?

683
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,340
You find that strange?

684
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:06,680
Sihuai City

685
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,090
has never had a curfew.

686
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,500
It's the most famous sleepless city around.

687
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,570
Interesting.

688
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,570
There should be more people

689
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,060
from the martial world here recently.

690
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,410
What's happening?

691
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,130
Don't go.

692
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,460
Sir...

693
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,300
Blossom Ash.

694
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,180
[Floral Poison: Blossom Ash]

695
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,780
Sir,

696
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,370
at a time like this,

697
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,170
you still have the heart to read?

698
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,980
I need to find a way

699
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,810
to break the Blossom Ash Array.

700
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,090
Isn't it a bit late

701
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,610
to start reading now?

702
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,700
No, it's not.

703
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,500
Not until the flame of this candle

704
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,890
burns out completely.

705
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,410
Did they really think they could

706
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,890
harm me with such a petty trick?

707
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,890
Sihuai City has been sealed off.

708
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,650
Did you know about this?

709
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,610
Master,

710
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,260
this has nothing to do with me.

711
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,890
I know it doesn't.

712
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,170
You're bold,

713
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,330
but not that bold.

714
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,780
Who did it?

715
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,170
I don't know.

716
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,300
I received two carrier pigeons,

717
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,370
both sent in haste.

718
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,350
One message said

719
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,540
someone was hunting for Zhuo Yue'an

720
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,570
in Wushuang City's name,

721
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,220
which was clearly an attempt to smear

722
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,500
both the city and you, Master.

723
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,330
The other said

724
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,130
a strange poison had appeared in Sihuai.

725
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,540
Ordinary people have fallen unconscious,

726
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,850
while martial artists

727
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,780
have lost their inner force.

728
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,980
They can't summon any strength at all

729
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,090
and can only send word through carrier pigeons.

730
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,460
Blossom Ash?

731
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,370
Summon Jian Shanyue.

732
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,650
Elder Jian

733
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,170
has announced his retirement.

734
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,810
The one truly in charge of Lunwu Hall

735
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,260
was never Jian Shanyue,

736
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,700
but Jian Wudi.

737
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,460
Jian Wudi has been in seclusion for years,

738
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,260
so he handed most of his authority

739
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,850
to Jian Shanyue.

740
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,020
But Jian Wudi's place of seclusion

741
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,500
is not in Wushuang City.

742
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,540
It's

743
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,980
in Sihuai City.

744
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,540
Master,

745
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,850
what should we do?

746
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,460
I'll go to Sihuai City myself.

747
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,060
Master,

748
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,330
let me go with you!

749
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,980
Jian Wudi has been in seclusion for many years.

750
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,540
If Lunwu Hall is trying to extend its reach into Sihuai City,

751
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,890
it won't be easy.

752
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,130
Tianxia House

753
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,700
is involved in this, isn't it?

754
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,290
My dear disciple,

755
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,340
you thought Tianxia House was loyal to you,

756
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,060
but it seems they had

757
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,820
other plans all along.

758
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,030
I'll go find Lord Haoyue

759
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,770
and get some answers.

760
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,690
If this spear

761
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,940
were thrust into my back,

762
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,690
it wouldn't be so bad.

763
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:38,770
Master,

764
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,250
I may be useless,

765
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,500
but I'm not a monster!

766
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,610
That's exactly why

767
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,610
I can't bring myself to cast you out.

768
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,820
Do you understand?

769
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,900
Wushuang City is not so lofty

770
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,380
as to stand apart from the world.

771
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,610
But even if it is

772
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,130
no longer peerless under heaven,

773
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,420
the spirit of our forebears still endures.

774
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,210
Do you think what's happening here

775
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,540
is spontaneous

776
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,090
or the result of someone's careful design?

777
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,940
The papers I took from the Wanjuan Tower

778
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,460
had been switched beforehand,

779
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,540
but their contents were genuine.

780
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,130
So my coming here

781
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,690
is something someone wanted to happen.

782
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,860
And you're willing to be used like that?

783
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,170
Since the contents were true,

784
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,730
this is something I must do.

785
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,380
If someone wants to use me,

786
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,860
they'll just have to pay the price.

787
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,940
Fair enough.

788
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,280
And since it's irritating

789
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,460
that so many eyes

790
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,940
are watching us in the dark,

791
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,570
let's use this chance to see

792
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,170
who's really behind it.

793
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,090
Miss Bai?

794
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,690
Your beloved umbrella.

795
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,610
You brought it?

796
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,900
Thank you.

797
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,340
Of course.

798
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,460
I figured you'd need it.

799
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,090
Even if it's not for fighting,

800
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,540
it can at least keep off the rain.

801
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,690
Then take this for protection,

802
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:41,980
Miss Bai.

803
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,130
All right.

804
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,380
Mr. Zhuo,

805
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,340
you've gained quite a reputation lately.

806
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,190
I thought I was the only one who came

807
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,020
to watch the show.

808
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,170
Watch the show? We're all

809
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,060
about to lose our lives.

810
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,060
Fortunately, before I set out,

811
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,690
my eyelid kept twitching,

812
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,380
so I made extra preparations.

813
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,420
It's only

814
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,500
a few minions.

815
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,340
We've been through much worse.

816
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,610
A bit of internal chaos in Wushuang City...

817
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,500
I can't believe the Patriarch of Blood River

818
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,820
is actually so careless.

819
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,980
Take a careful breath.

820
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,250
Do you notice anything strange?

821
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,820
There's a faint floral scent.

822
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,860
In this season,

823
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,130
what flowers could still be blooming in Sihuai City?

824
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,290
Sihuai City

825
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,340
is not Xueyue City.

826
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,980
We don't have that kind of romance here.

827
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,420
Floral scent?

828
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,130
All I've smelled on the way here

829
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,020
is wine and meat.

830
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,460
It's poison.

831
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,650
It is poison indeed.

832
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,860
It just hasn't fully taken hold yet.

833
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,770
Once the scent thickens

834
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,460
and it feels as if you're standing in a sea of blossoms,

835
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,820
that will be the perfect time

836
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,420
for them to carve you up.

837
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,380
The Five Poisons?

838
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,170
Yes, and they're the supreme kind that only a direct heir

839
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,540
of the Wen clan

840
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,690
can raise.

841
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,900
Go.

842
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,980
I've heard

843
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,480
they're even stronger than those

844
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,290
of the Five Poisons Sect.

845
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,610
I've seen

846
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,900
Wen Hujiu's Five Poisons.

847
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,460
His centipedes

848
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,690
had two heads.
