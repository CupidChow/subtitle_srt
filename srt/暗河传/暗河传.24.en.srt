00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,980
[Episode 24]

5
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,980
Why is this happening?

6
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,210
His poisonous blood

7
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,740
has entered my body.

8
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,690
This is bad.

9
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,260
Su Muyu,

10
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,690
there's a jade vial at my waist.

11
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,850
Take a pill

12
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,820
for me.

13
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,020
Will you be all right after taking it?

14
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,660
The drugged-puppet poison

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,930
isn't ordinary.

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,930
Father,

17
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,460
send word back to Nan'an City at once.

18
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,410
Tell Zhaoyan

19
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,980
to release the carrier pigeon.

20
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,780
The pigeon will

21
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,570
fly straight back to Medicine King Valley.

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,890
If Xin Baicao sees it,

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,570
he'll come to Nan'an City for me.

24
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,130
Only he

25
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,130
can save me.

26
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,820
All right.

27
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,540
All right.

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,690
We'll leave for Nan'an City immediately.

29
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,170
Who's there?

30
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,610
Don't you enjoy this?

31
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,290
Sitting there sipping tea,

32
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,500
telling everyone

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,380
what they should do.

34
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,220
It must feel

35
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,980
like everything's under your control.

36
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,850
Who are you?

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,660
You don't know who I am,

38
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,890
but I know who you are.

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,780
Xiao Yong, the First Prince.

40
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,450
How dare you call my name directly?

41
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,260
I've found you people of Tianqi City

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,450
very interesting.

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Always judging others

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,220
by your own rules.

45
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,540
You think

46
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,290
that even if someone sees through your identity,

47
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,130
they won't dare say it out loud?

48
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,010
You shouldn't look at me that way.

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,210
There will always be people

50
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,090
who couldn't care less about your rules.

51
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,690
Whether it's Tianqi City,

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,810
the Xiao imperial line,

53
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,770
or even your emperor,

54
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,250
they're worthless to me.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,490
Who on earth are you?

56
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,340
You want to know my name

57
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,690
and get payback?

58
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,090
Fine.

59
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,770
I'm Li Hanyi.

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,620
I live in Xueyue City.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,020
My senior brother

62
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,460
once fought your father

63
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,530
and left him powerless

64
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,250
in front of all the masters of Tianqi.

65
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,020
We've stayed in Xueyue City all this time,

66
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,980
yet you never dared

67
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,180
seek us for revenge.

68
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,130
You made such a fuss

69
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,570
to take down Wushuang City

70
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,860
only because

71
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,540
you feared us, right?

72
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,250
Sword Deity Xueyue,

73
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,060
Li Hanyi.

74
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,060
What are you doing here?

75
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,180
Where's your elegance?

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,060
Where's your composure?

77
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:57,930
Come on.

78
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,490
Summon your men

79
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,980
and kill me.

80
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,330
Your mother

81
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,330
is head of the Four Guardians of Tianqi,

82
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,220
yet you act so treasonously

83
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,660
by attacking a prince.

84
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,220
Can you bear

85
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,490
such a crime?

86
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,180
A prince shouldn't leave Tianqi without cause.

87
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,980
You appear here in Sihuai City,

88
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,250
and accuse me of treason?

89
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,100
My mother guards Tianqi,

90
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,740
not you scheming princes.

91
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,180
Fine.

92
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,860
City Lord Li,

93
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,540
I believe

94
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,130
today's matter

95
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,740
has nothing to do with Xueyue City.

96
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,690
Why must you keep pushing?

97
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,180
If I ran into it,

98
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,180
then I'm involved.

99
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,860
That's enough.

100
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,330
Don't frighten him.

101
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,690
Chancellor Xie?

102
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,810
You still remember me, Your Highness.

103
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,740
Are you also here to stop me?

104
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,540
That depends on how you see it.

105
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,180
You think I'm trying to stop you,

106
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,930
but in fact I'm helping you.

107
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,130
If you seize Wushuang City,

108
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,780
it won't be good.

109
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,370
Flying Tiger General

110
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,250
has a troop at my disposal

111
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,420
outside the city.

112
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,450
Once I give the order,

113
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,330
the entire Sihuai City

114
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,100
could be flattened.

115
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,250
With City Lord Li and me

116
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,130
defending the city,

117
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,010
even twice that number

118
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,780
couldn't breach our defense

119
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,100
by a zhang.

120
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,570
It's rare to hear you speak so boldly.

121
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,180
No.

122
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,810
That was modest.

123
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,220
Without you,

124
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,300
I

125
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,810
and my three-chi sword
[*Chi: Chinese unit of length, about 33 cm]

126
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,930
could keep them three chi away.

127
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,010
I'll remember

128
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,130
what happened today.

129
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,420
Annoying.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,780
I'll just kill him once and for all.

131
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,420
No.

132
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,810
He's a prince, after all.

133
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,930
If you kill him,

134
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,330
you'll put your mother at risk.

135
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,370
I'll kill him quietly.

136
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,570
This fellow

137
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,620
looks no good.

138
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,100
Who knows how many innocent lives he's taken?

139
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,620
Killing him

140
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,620
is not wrong.

141
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,330
You deserve a place

142
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,780
among the four great fiends of the martial world.

143
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,860
Let's go.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,900
You weren't serious about

145
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,930
killing him just now, were you?

146
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,210
I'm not that stupid.

147
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,060
Why bring trouble on myself?

148
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,570
I was only scaring him.

149
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,060
Well then, we...

150
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,210
Since the duel is canceled,

151
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,060
I'll return to Xueyue City.

152
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,780
It's rare for you to leave Xueyue City.

153
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,730
Why not go somewhere else?

154
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,180
You talk too much.

155
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,690
Your temper is too big.

156
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,500
After all, I'm on par with your senior brother.

157
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,730
By seniority,

158
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,690
I'm the Eighth Young Master.

159
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,540
He's the Ninth Young Master.

160
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,610
I'm his senior.

161
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,540
But when you speak to me,

162
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,780
I always feel threatened.

163
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,630
Because you always refuse

164
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,730
to spar with me.

165
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,690
I'd love to challenge

166
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,380
the sword of the Scholarly Sword Deity.

167
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,730
If you duel me,

168
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,420
I'll invite you to Xueyue City

169
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,090
to taste my senior brother's

170
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,810
freshly brewed Beauty of Four Seasons.

171
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,060
That brew is superb.

172
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,930
But dueling you

173
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,780
isn't.

174
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,730
Bookworm!

175
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,090
Shrew.

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,090
Su Changhe?

177
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,790
He didn't stop by for a chat

178
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,300
when he saw two sword deities.

179
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,330
Looks like they're in big trouble.

180
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,180
Soon,

181
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,780
I'll fall asleep.

182
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,670
I might not wake

183
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,570
for ten days or longer.

184
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,330
Don't worry.

185
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,540
Once we reach Nan'an City

186
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,060
and Baicao arrives,

187
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,140
everything will be fine.

188
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,450
All right.

189
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,260
Don't worry, Miss Bai.

190
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,810
But if

191
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,780
he doesn't get there in time,

192
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,180
I'll turn into a drugged puppet.

193
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,810
Before I become something ugly,

194
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,420
use your sword

195
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,660
and kill me.

196
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,930
Do you hear me?

197
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,060
He doesn't.

198
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,540
He can't hear you.

199
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,610
The King of Medicine will surely come.

200
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,090
But there's always a chance

201
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,330
it goes wrong.

202
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,330
Promise me.

203
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,780
Kill me.

204
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,930
Father,

205
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,540
you're not to stop him.

206
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,830
Buns for sale!

207
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,130
Meat buns, fresh from the steamer!

208
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,450
Yu and Uncle Zhe

209
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,570
are inside with Master.

210
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,380
I'm not sure when Master will wake.

211
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,610
Changhe,

212
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,730
what has happened?

213
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,640
I asked you to release the carrier pigeon.

214
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,210
Did you release it?

215
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,970
Of course.

216
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,970
But your letter didn't say why.

217
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,730
Your master was struck by a strange poison.

218
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,610
Only the King of Medicine Xin Baicao can cure it.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,690
The carrier pigeon was meant to send to the Medicine King Valley.

220
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,900
But the King of Medicine hasn't arrived yet.

221
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,140
I fear it may be too late.

222
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,210
No.

223
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,090
Fate is on Master's side.

224
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,420
She'll pull through safely.

226
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,570

The "He" is Senior,

228
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,690
then who is this "Yu"?

[He-Yu Clinic]

230
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,420
Mister, are you here for a consultation?

231
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,210
Are you Yu?

232
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,020
Rain?

233
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,690
What rain?

234
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,090
Oh, nothing.

235
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,380
It must be a mistake.

236
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,850
I came here

237
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,060
looking for my senior.

238
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,450
Please announce me.

239
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,730
Senior?

240
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,780
We have no one

00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,180
that old here.

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,540
Medicine King Valley Xin Baicao.

243
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:43,970
Zhaoyan,

244
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,020
by seniority,

245
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,780
you may call him

246
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,780
Senior Brother.

247
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,380
You finally came!

248
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,330
Please come in.

[He-Yu Clinic]

250
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,090
Master.

251
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,180
Baicao,

252
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,690
you're here.

253
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,540
The first thing you do

254
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,690
when we meet

255
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,090
is to take advantage of me.

256
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,330
Yes, I'm here,

257
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,900
Senior.

258
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,140
How lovely.

259
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,850
I heard Xin Baicao, the King of Medicine, had arrived.

260
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,690
I didn't know the Medicine King Valley's rules

261
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,970
were so strict.

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,850
If I were him,

263
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,090
I couldn't stand it.

264
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,420
She's my senior after all.

265
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,420
The Grandmaster loved talent

266
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,500
and couldn't help

267
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,690
but take in promising disciples.

268
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,210
As expected of the King of Medicine.

269
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,260
A few needles

270
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,210
and the illness is cured.

271
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,850
Cured?

272
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,970
Hasn't she been cured yet?

273
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,450
Uh...

274
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,420
Please leave.

275
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,060
I need a moment

276
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,090
to change

277
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,020
before speaking with Baicao.

278
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,930
Are you a swordsman?

279
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,260
Maybe.

280
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,810
May I ask,

281
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,450
what's your relation to Senior?

282
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,140
I happened

283
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,260
to look for her to treat my elder,

284
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,730
and over time,

285
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,970
we became friends.

286
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,380
Later, my friend

287
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,780
bought

288
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,730
this place

289
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,690
and opened this clinic

290
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,300
for Miss Bai and me.

291
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,970
The "Yu" in the sign

292
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,540
is me.

293
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,540
So it is.

294
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,690
May I ask,

295
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,090
what's your name?

296
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,780
Su Muyu.

297
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,660
That's a good name.

298
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,420
May I ask,

299
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,450
are you the Su Muyu

300
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,730
I've heard of?

301
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,420
Maybe.

302
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,210
I knew

303
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,020
she'd surprise me

304
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,450
when we met again,

305
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,450
but I didn't expect

306
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,180
it to be this shocking.

307
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,570
She actually opened a clinic

308
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,180
with Blood River.

309
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,020
We kill,

310
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,300
and she saves lives.

311
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,610
People who seem to belong to completely different paths

312
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,900
running a clinic together

313
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,060
is truly baffling.

314
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,180
I see now.

315
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,930
It must be love.

316
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,300
It must be love!

317
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,570
Why are you laughing?

318
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,930
It's certainly not you.

319
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,330
You don't look

320
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,730
like a good man.

321
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,970
That's you, then.

322
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,420
So Senior likes

323
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,380
the cold, elegant type?

324
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,380
I didn't expect that.

325
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,610
I really didn't.

326
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,330
What about you?

327
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,540
You're Su Muyu,

328
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,690
then who is he to the Su family?

329
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,810
Me?

330
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,690
I'm Su Changhe.

331
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,380
The Undertaker Su Changhe?

332
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,020
King of Medicine,

333
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,330
that used to be

334
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,890
my title.

335
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,260
Now,

336
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,700
I'm the Patriarch of Blood River.

337
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,260
And who are you to the Su family?

338
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,500
I'm Su Zhe.

339
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,980
I'll take my leave.

340
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,170
Sir.

341
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,810
Baicao,

342
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,300
where are you going?

343
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,540
Senior,

344
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,410
you look rosy

345
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,260
and lively again.

346
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,300
You must be fine now.

347
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,780
There's no such thing as drugged puppets.

348
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,850
Nonsense.

349
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,260
I only gave a few needles,

350
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,540
and you're cured.

351
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,260
No need to keep me for dinner.

352
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,810
I'll take my leave.

353
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,890
Don't worry, sir.

354
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,780
Dark River

355
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,370
is not what it used to be.

356
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,020
But is the Undertaker

357
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,370
any different from before?

358
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,610
You hesitated.

359
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,890
You faltered.

360
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,170
Baicao,

361
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,060
stop teasing Su Muyu.

362
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,090
Su Zhe

363
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,260
is the father I've searched for all these years.

364
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,780
Greetings, King of Medicine.

365
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,540
This is complicated.

366
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,500
In any case,

367
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,890
we won't hurt you.

368
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,780
Please check Miss Bai quickly.

369
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,090
Su Muyu,

370
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,700
before reforming Blood River,

371
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,930
shouldn't Uncle Zhe and I

372
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,060
do some good deeds

373
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,980
in the martial world,

374
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,090
so that people think differently of us?

375
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,570
It's confirmed

376
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,500
to be Night Crow's drugged puppet craft.

377
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,460
Her mastery

378
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,940
has deepened

379
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,460
far beyond

380
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,410
when she left

381
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,780
the valley.

382
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,700
That's why I called you.

383
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,980
Miss Bai,

384
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,260
I'm curious.

385
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,700
Compared to the King of Medicine,

386
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,570
who's the better physician?

387
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,020
Am I the King of Medicine,

388
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,780
or is he?

389
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,940
If my skill surpasses his

390
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,090
and my seniority is higher,

391
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,610
he wouldn't be called

392
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,020
King of Medicine.

393
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,650
You flattered me, Senior.

394
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,260
Tell me plainly.

395
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,540
Can the drugged-puppet poison

396
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,540
in my body

397
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,700
be removed?

398
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,130
You took

399
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,610
the Heart-Reviving Pill in time,

400
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,500
and with acupuncture,

401
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,700
the poisonous worms are dead.

402
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,170
Only the residual toxin

403
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,220
remains.

404
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,850
Those poisonous worms can be killed,

405
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,330
but the residue is hard to get rid of?

406
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,260
The record says

407
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,700
that those with poisonous worms

408
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,330
become uncontrollable drugged puppets.

409
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,410
Become a drugged puppet?

410
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,850
How can that not be a problem?

411
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,850
By then,

412
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,220
Senior may already be dead.

413
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,610
Let's be realistic.

414
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,980
It has nothing to do

415
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,300
with her.

416
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,570
But if someone dies

417
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,890
and they won't rest in peace,

418
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,890
thinking about it now,

419
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,740
it feels

420
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,130
awful.

421
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,980
Can you remove it?

422
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,090
If you can't,

423
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,890
once I find Night Crow,

424
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,700
I'll bring her here.

425
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,020
Don't worry.

426
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,740
It'll certainly be removed.

427
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,740
It's just that

428
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,260
I need a bit of help.

429
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,570
What help?

430
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,890
I'll do whatever is required.

431
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,610
This isn't ordinary acupuncture.

432
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,700
I'll insert

433
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,330
thirteen silver needles into Senior's body.

434
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,650
When that's done,

435
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,980
her qi and blood will surge,

436
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,570
as if she's fallen into a volcano.

437
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,650
At that moment,

438
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,030
the fewer obstructions

439
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,610
to the flow of her zhenqi,

440
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,020
the better.

441
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,330
I'm not a physician. I don't quite follow.

442
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,890
Idiot.

443
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,460
It means that during the procedure,

444
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,890
Miss Bai should wear only a single inner garment.

445
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,540
Rude.

446
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,650
A true healer only cares for their patient.

447
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,070
I do this only to save her life.

448
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,500
I have a clear conscience.

449
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,300
But

450
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,260
Mr. Su, you...

451
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,220
No problem.

452
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,700
If he can't do it,

453
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,500
I can.

454
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,650
I have a clear conscience too.

455
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,300
I swear.

456
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,500
I'll kill you.

457
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,090
Easy, easy.

458
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,060
Let's talk nicely.

459
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,700
You're even launching the Purple Qi from the East?

460
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,850
Just smelling that

461
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,850
could kill them.

462
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,980
If it can't be cured, forget it.

463
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,700
It's your call.

464
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,610
We're fine with that.

465
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,650
Uncle Zhe,

466
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,410
you're her father.

467
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,170
You decide for her.

468
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,740
I could decide to kill you instead.

469
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,220
Well...

470
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,940
I have an idea.

471
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,100
[He-Yu Clinic]

472
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,060
Uncle Zhe,

473
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,700
aren't you worried about your daughter's condition?

474
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,220
The King of Medicine is here.

475
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,700
There's nothing to worry about.

476
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,410
Uncle Zhe,

477
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,370
have you attended

478
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,650
a wedding banquet in your life?

479
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,460
People like us

480
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,890
only send others to their graves.

481
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,220
I've been to plenty of funerals.

482
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,850
But as for weddings,

483
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,980
I've only had my own.

484
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,780
Back then, I was on the run

485
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,170
with Hehuai's mother.

486
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,540
We passed by an abandoned temple

487
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,650
and were married there.

488
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,060
We had the wedding ritual

489
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,890
and drank the last jar of liquor

490
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,810
we had.

491
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,850
I suppose that counts.

492
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,090
What did the liquor taste like?

493
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,090
Sweet.

494
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,810
I thought you only drank sorghum liquor.

495
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,460
I've heard the only fruit liquor in the South is sweet.

496
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,020
It was sorghum liquor.

497
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,890
But that day,

498
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,130
it tasted sweet.

499
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,700
I'm a good drinker,

500
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,610
but I got drunk that day,

501
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,540
and...

502
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,060
And?

503
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,810
And then my daughter was born.

504
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,170
I've never attended a wedding banquet before,

505
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,700
but if I ever get the chance,

506
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,610
I'd like to.

507
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,780
Changhe,

508
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,980
that sounds like

509
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,220
you're hinting at something.

510
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,260
You know what I'm saying.

511
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,090
There's no need to be impatient.

512
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,300
Senior.

513
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,610
Please pardon me.

514
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,890
Uncle Zhe,

515
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,980
do you think

516
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,650
it'd be nice

517
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,170
to settle down in Nan'an City?

518
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,090
Are you possessed by Su Muyu?

519
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,200
I just suddenly understand

520
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,460
how Muyu felt.

521
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,540
You're the Patriarch now.

522
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,020
Where there's one Nan'an City,

523
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,000
there could be ten

524
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,850
or a hundred.

525
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,300
If we find our Nan'an City,

526
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,810
they can find theirs too.

527
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,740
With one command,

528
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,130
everyone scatters across the land,

529
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,610
each living their own life.

530
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,220
Wouldn't that be nice?

531
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,810
Not everyone

532
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,170
wants that kind of life.

533
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,650
We come from the martial world.

534
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,090
Who doesn't dream

535
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,220
of ruling

536
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,700
and conquering?

537
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,330
We've stood at the top before.

538
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,780
We know the view from above isn't everything.

539
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,850
But in Blood River,

540
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,260
there are many who don't.

541
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,890
They have ambition.

542
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,940
If you disband the group,

543
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,460
they'll just die

544
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,650
on some other battlefield.

545
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,980
I overlooked that.

546
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,780
I could choose this path.

547
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,130
Su Muyu could also choose it.

548
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,890
But you have no choice.

549
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,220
Because you're the Patriarch.

550
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,610
Senior,

551
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,740
now,

552
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,610
I'll insert the last needle.

553
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,260
I suppose

554
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,780
you know the pain.

555
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,330
Please endure a little.

556
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,500
Rise, drop.

557
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,330
Mr. Su.

558
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,130
Yes.

559
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,030
Right here.

560
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,940
Now.

561
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:45,980
Got it.

562
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,890
I'm tired.

563
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,220
Miss Bai has fallen asleep.

564
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,540
She's all right.

565
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,570
I knew

566
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,700
everything would be fine.

567
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,130
I'm hungry.

568
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,570
Do you want to try

569
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,540
fried egg with green pepper?

570
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,010
Yu.

571
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,060
Since the King of Medicine is here,

572
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,500
can we go out for something better?

573
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:02,850
Come on.

574
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,850
Say

575
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,130
what's in your heart.

576
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,700
I want to go to Fushou Restaurant

577
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,370
for a feast of thirteen fine dishes

578
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,850
and a jar of Luobai liquor.

579
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,610
Be honest.

580
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,570
I've had enough of Yu's cooking.

581
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,220
Uh...

582
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,020
Good one.

583
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,740
Zhaoyan,

584
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,940
go to Fushou Restaurant

585
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,980
and book the best private room.

586
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,500
We'll treat the King of Medicine,

587
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,220
who came from afar,

588
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,120
to a feast of thirteen fine dishes.

589
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,090
My treat.

590
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:37,980
Yes, sir!

591
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,540
[Fushou Restaurant]

592
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,850
I can't believe this.

593
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,330
I didn't expect falling ill

594
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,130
would have this upside.

595
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,980
We get to eat at Fushou Restaurant.

596
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,220
Right.

597
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,090
It's on me.

598
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,400
The grandest feast

599
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,650
and the finest Luobai liquor.

600
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,850
Eat to your fill.

601
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,540
Great.

602
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,500
I didn't know you scoundrel

603
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,650
had a kind heart.

604
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,810
You look

605
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,330
almost benevolent.

606
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,700
I promise.

607
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,650
I won't cross you

608
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,610
for three days.

609
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,500
Did you conscience suddenly wake up,

610
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,570
or did they mistreat you?

611
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,890
It's just a meal.

612
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,170
You've just recovered.

613
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,980
Why push yourself

614
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,330
to get out of bed

615
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:22,940
and come all the way here?

616
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,810
That's because

617
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,740
I usually prepare meals

618
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,460
at the clinic.

619
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,550
So it must be your cooking

620
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,610
that's terrible,

621
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,330
right?

622
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,650
You haven't tried it.

623
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,260
How do you know it's bad?

624
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,090
Well...

625
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,890
My apologies.

626
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,330
I was being rude.

627
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,780
You can have a try.

628
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,850
This is the osmanthus cake Muyu made.

629
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,130
Try it.

630
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,410
Isn't osmanthus cake

631
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,130
supposed to be white?

632
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
I added

633
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,300
tea foam to it.

634
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,540
Now it has both osmanthus fragrance

635
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,740
and tea aroma.

636
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,060
You're so thoughtful.

637
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,780
He's really thoughtful.

638
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,300
Ew!

639
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,570
This...

640
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:45,940
This...

641
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,540
Gosh!

642
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,020
This...

643
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,060
Looks like

644
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,810
I still need to improve my cooking.

645
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,060
I didn't know

646
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,740
someone as mischievous

647
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,570
as Senior

648
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,940
would fall so low.

649
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,740
Excuse me.

650
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,850
Yes, sir.

651
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,850
How may I help you, sir?

652
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,780
We'll have another feast.

653
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,980
Served in an hour.

654
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:48,710
Sure.

655
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,300
Hold on.

656
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,330
Yes, sir?

657
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,810
This yam cake is good.

658
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,300
How do you make it?

659
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,260
I'm just a waiter, sir.

660
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,170
I can't cook.

661
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,810
If you like,

662
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,570
I can bring you to see our cook.

663
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,060
You may ask him yourself.

664
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,130
No need.

665
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:05,980
You can go.

666
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,610
Enjoy your meal.

667
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,700
Cooking

668
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,940
has levels.

669
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,370
You think

670
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,170
you're at level two,

671
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,890
but you're actually

672
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:19,890
at level one.

673
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,780
The dishes here

674
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,940
are level five.

675
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,650
So

676
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,830
you can try

677
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,700
level-one dishes.

678
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,060
Master,

679
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,020
what are level-one dishes?

680
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,980
For instance,

681
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,940
this one.

682
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,810
Fried egg with green pepper.

683
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,370
This is way too simple.

684
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,330
Su Muyu,

685
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,650
there was once a swordsman

686
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,410
who practiced only nineteen Embroidered-Sword moves

687
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,090
and eventually became a sword deity.

688
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,810
Start with simple dishes,

689
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,940
and one day you'll make imperial feasts.

690
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,610
That's too much.

691
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,840
At least

692
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,060
you could run a small restaurant.

693
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,130
When that happens,

694
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,570
we call it

695
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,940
Blood River

696
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:09,850
Palace.

697
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,570
Blood River Palace?

698
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,780
It sounds

699
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,500
a little improper.

700
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,650
Fushou Restaurant's pastries are average.

701
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,780
I'll go

702
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,440
to Jinyue Pastry

703
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,410
to buy some.

704
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,650
Su Changhe,

705
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,540
why do you look

706
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,020
so nice today?

707
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,570
Nice choice of words.

708
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,060
You eat first. I'll wait for the second round.

709
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:41,940
Don't worry.

710
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,850
Hurry back.

711
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,890
Stop hiding.

712
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,850
Come out.

713
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,330
Changhe,

714
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,700
you seem to be enjoying life

715
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,500
in Nan'an City.

716
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,650
When the mission's done,

717
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,810
let's all live comfortably together.

718
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,570
Have you found them?

719
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,000
We sent out good trackers

720
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,420
in Blood River.

721
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,350
After leaving Wushuang City,

722
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,170
they split into two groups.

723
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,290
One went to Tianqi City.

724
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,610
It's reasonable

725
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,250
that the First Prince would return to Tianqi.

726
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,900
We followed the trail Yu left

727
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,980
and found that the other group

728
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,860
had gone to Shuzhong.

729
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:25,770
Shuzhong?

730
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,610
There's only one place worth going to there.

731
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,900
The Tang Clan.

732
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,690
The First Prince is colluding with the Tang Clan?

733
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,540
Isn't that the Tang Clan allied with the Prince of Langya?

734
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,630
Not long ago,

735
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,770
Yumo sent back a message,

736
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,800
saying that after Tang Lianyue returned to the Tang Clan,

737
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,820
he vanished.

738
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,730
She questioned Baixiao Hall,

739
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
but none of them

740
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,820
knew anything.

741
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,820
Changhe,

742
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,090
we...

743
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,250
Let's go

744
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,020
to Jinyue Pastry.

745
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,460
They sell nice osmanthus cake.

746
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,130
I'll buy each of you a jin.

747
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,540
Let's go.

748
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,020
What's on your mind?

749
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,250
Thinking about your Yu again?

750
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,840
My Yu?

751
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,650
Don't talk nonsense.

752
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,210
If I'm making it up,

753
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,380
why are your ears red?

754
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,900
Since returning from Tianqi City,

755
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,570
you've been completely out of it.

756
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,730
People might think

757
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,980
your soul

758
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,980
flew away with Su Muyu.

759
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:47,730
You!

760
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:48,980
Don't hit me.

761
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,170
I value my life.

762
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,540
Yes, I like Yu.

763
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,690
He's like the moon

764
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,020
in Blood River.

765
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,420
Clear, cold,

766
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,090
different from others.

767
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,610
I've always thought that,

768
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,170
of all here in Blood River,

769
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,420
aside from Yumo,

770
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,820
I'm the best match for him.

771
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,340
So when I first saw Bai Hehuai

772
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,650
in Jiuxiao City,

773
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,980
I really wanted to kill her.

774
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,210
Not just for the mission,

775
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,690
I had personal reasons.

776
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,820
She's

777
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,570
dazzling.

778
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,540
Is she?

779
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,060
But when I met Yu

780
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,290
in Tianqi City,

781
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,250
he seemed

782
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,340
different.

783
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,690
I realized

784
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,380
he could be so lively.

785
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,900
So I watched them from afar

786
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,170
and felt happy for them.

787
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,940
So...

788
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,020
are you moping

789
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,420
because you gave up on unrequited love?

790
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,210
- Can you ever stop talking? - Ow!
