[Episode 3]

5
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,980
This is the first

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,540
of those three hidden weapons,

7
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,820
Cries of 1,000 Birds!

8
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,340
Yu.

9
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,660
What are you up to again?

10
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,570
Do you truly intend to kill me?

11
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,570
The same bewitching spell

12
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,940
won't work

13
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,820
on me again.

14
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,780
Tell me the motive

15
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,660
of your Patriarch,

16
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,010
and I'll spare you.

17
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,410
I told you before.

18
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,100
I don't know any bewitching spells.

19
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,340
If you actually had feelings for me,

20
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,290
that means you've fallen for me.

21
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,130
Demoness,

22
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,500
do not spout such nonsense!

23
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,570
Wait!

24
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,820
Can you use another hidden weapon instead?

25
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,010
What do you mean?

26
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,570
I'll be pricked by all these needles.

27
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,260
I'll meet an ugly end, you know?

28
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,570
Can you use something else

29
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,220
that won't let me meet an ugly end?

30
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,130
Or use something

31
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,450
that can let me die while preserving my looks?

32
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,780
What is this?

33
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,380
This is the Blood Rose.

34
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,570
Although

35
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,660
it might look silver to you,

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,130
once it penetrates

37
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,130
your body,

38
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,380
your blood will flow into its petals,

39
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,290
dyeing it red.

40
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,690
It'll form a beautiful rose.

41
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,010
So, you're the leader of the Blood River Spider Shadow Sect,

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,890
Kui.

43
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,100
How's your injury?

44
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,890
I would've died for real

45
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,380
had you come a few moments later.

46
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,890
Trap him with the 1000-Spider Array.

47
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,850
I suppose I have to see

48
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,850
the rest of your hidden weapons next time.

49
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,100
Yu,

50
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,140
the Tracking Spider that you owned

51
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,220
started getting excited all of a sudden.

52
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,100
I knew that you would be near.

53
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,410
Luckily, you made it in time.

54
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,410
Is your injury okay?

55
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,100
It's nothing too serious.

56
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,170
Tang Lianyue

57
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,410
went easy on me.

58
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,490
If not,

59
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,490
I might've been dead.

60
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,850
After all,

61
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,460
he's one of the Four Guardians of Tianqi City.

62
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,460
He's a top martial arts expert.

63
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,490
Luckily, he's the one you encountered.

64
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,850
Tang Lianyue, the Xuanwu Guardian,

65
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,370
always hated killing.

66
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,050
Nonsense.

67
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,490
He spared me

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,730
because

69
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,610
he fell for me at first glance.

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,290
Your blind confidence

71
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,540
is actually growing stronger.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,580
I'm serious.

73
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,810
Just now, he said

74
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,610
that I cast a bewitching spell on him.

75
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,730
Yu,

76
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,580
do you think I know any bewitching spells?

77
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,250
Most of the women in the Mu family excel at bewitching spells.

78
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,780
However, I suppose you don't know any.

79
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,610
The Xuanwu Guardian targeted me because he fell for me.

80
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,660
I must be charming, then.

81
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,410
Let's drop the topic for now.

82
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,140
Changhe sent many people

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,410
to obstruct me while I was on my way here.

84
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,980
He knew all about

85
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,780
our movements.

86
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,660
He even delivered a message to Tang Lianyue.

87
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,340
That means he has planted a mole

88
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,050
within Spider Shadow.

89
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,170
We have to return to the Patriarch

90
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,980
as soon as possible.

91
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,930
Yu.

92
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,580
Has it never occurred to you

93
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,980
that I might be

94
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,660
the mole?

95
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,050
That's not funny.

96
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,930
I'm not joking.

97
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,810
I did hesitate before.

98
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,540
Although

99
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,900
I haven't managed

100
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,290
to do something

101
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,900
that will go against the vow I made back then,

102
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,930
Yu,

103
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,610
I hesitated.

104
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,220
I'm starting to doubt

105
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,220
the meaning of our existence.

106
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,700
Yu.

107
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,290
You grew up together

108
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,700
with Changhe.

109
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,980
But this time,

110
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,050
do you two have to

111
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,660
fight each other?

112
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,140
I swore a vow when I joined Spider Shadow.

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,460
I won't let anyone

114
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,340
threaten the Patriarch's safety

115
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,900
until the day I die.

116
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,170
Of course I remember that.

117
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,490
Joining the Spider Shadow

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,290
is the biggest honor for a member of Blood River.

119
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,730
Once the Patriarch's poison is neutralized,

120
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,410
and he rules over the Three Families again,

121
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,050
the head of the Su family will rescind his order.

122
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,930
By then,

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,730
we won't need to

124
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,660
go against each other.

125
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,610
Who's there?

126
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,900
I'm Su Muyu

127
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,140
of the Su family.

128
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,410
Why are you here?

129
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,290
I cannot

130
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,730
accept this mission.

131
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,290
It's been many years

132
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,250
since anyone dared

133
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,540
to reject the mission

134
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,370
the Soul Reapers' Hall had assigned.

135
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,610
Even the Patriarch

136
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,340
cannot change our decision.

137
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,780
What's your excuse

138
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,730
for rejecting us?

139
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,250
I don't feel like accepting it.

140
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,610
That's not your decision to make.

141
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,100
But I know why you're doing so.

142
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,140
Zhang Taicheng, the Governor of Luonan,

143
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,610
was rumored

144
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,100
to be an excellent official who loved his people.

145
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,980
When the south was struck by a flood,

146
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,610
every prefecture

147
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,980
lined their pockets.

148
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,610
He was the only one who opened the granaries

149
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,980
to aid the people.

150
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,290
Not only that,

151
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,020
but he also reported their corruption

152
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,100
to Tianqi City,

153
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,140
forcing Tianqi City

154
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,220
to send their inspectors here.

155
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,780
That's how the people were able to survive.

156
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,220
He's a good person.

157
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,250
Therefore,

158
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,340
you don't wish to kill him.

159
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:20,980
Such audacity!

160
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,700
Once you receive the writ of the Soul Reapers' Hall,

161
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,850
you have to kill your target, even if he's the emperor.

162
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,100
Whether he's good or bad doesn't matter.

163
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,580
You're an assassin.

164
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,810
You aren't a saint.

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,730
I won't accept it.

166
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,610
Relay a message to the head of the Su family.

167
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,010
Deem him a traitor.

168
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,340
Kill him.

169
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,130
Kill him!

170
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,340
If the old fool of the Su family isn't willing to kill him,

171
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,650
I'll do it.

172
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,490
Calm down.

173
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,180
Look.

174
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,650
One of his friends has arrived.

175
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,890
Greetings, Three Officials.

176
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,580
Su Changhe,

177
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,770
also known as the Undertaker.

178
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,060
The rising prodigy of the Su family.

179
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,300
You stand shoulder to shoulder with Su Muyu.

180
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,300
Shoulder to shoulder?

181
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,650
That means I'm inferior to him.

182
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,220
What are you doing here?

183
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,980
Su Muyu is a great buddy of mine.

184
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,940
He wanted to set a rule

185
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,610
for the Soul Reapers' Hall about how he would accept missions.

186
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,370
My buddy has a set of rules called the Three Refusals.

187
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,460
He refuses to accept missions of massacre,

188
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,580
missions without cause,

189
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,460
and missions against his will.

190
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,580
And I, Su Changhe,

191
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,730
wish to set a rule too.

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,650
You two

193
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,250
are still green.

194
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,890
You think you can set up a rule here?

195
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,340
Even the Patriarch doesn't have the right to do so.

196
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,650
It seems

197
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,340
the Soul Reapers' Hall

198
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,130
must keep you guys in check today.

199
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,650
The other two officials, please wait.

200
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,940
I wish to hear about

201
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,370
the kind of rule

202
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,340
you wish to set.

203
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,460
This is the rule I wish to set.

204
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,300
For the missions that Su Muyu wouldn't accept,

205
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,060
I'll accept them all.

206
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,130
You went to the Soul Reapers' Hall a few days ago.

207
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,100
Why did you go there?

208
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,610
Of course I went there to negotiate a deal on your behalf.

209
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,980
You're bad with your words.

210
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,100
The Soul Reapers' Hall isn't the Patriarch.

211
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,250
They only acknowledge the rules.

212
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,850
They don't care about the sword you wield.

213
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,700
No wonder it's as if they've acknowledged

214
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,730
the three rules I set.

215
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,580
Naturally.

216
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,010
I've always been eloquent, you know?

217
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,300
If they don't yield, you'll beat them until they do.

218
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,530
If that's the case,

219
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,580
I suppose you're eloquent in your own way.

220
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,490
Don't tell me

221
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,180
you actually fought them.

222
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,770
I merely analyzed

223
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,250
the pros and cons for them.

224
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,580
The Soul Reapers' Hall keeps tabs too, you know?

225
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,580
Killing you

226
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,770
doesn't benefit them in any way.

227
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,490
Be honest with me.

228
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,610
Did you agree

229
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,300
to some of their conditions?

230
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,980
You have your own means.

231
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,850
I have my own means as well.

232
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,300
Just trust me.

233
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:39,300
[Jiuxiao City]

234
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,460
[Jiuxiao City]

235
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,770
"My sword shatters the nine heavens,

236
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,150
[Li Hanyi, Xueyue City]

237

240
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,530
and strikes down every injustice,

241
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,770
so that I can soar with you beyond the mortal sky."

242
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,370
Is this the city

243
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,850
where the Sword Poet Deity made a name for himself?

244
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,130
His strike pierces through the nine heavens, huh?

245
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,980
That's just a rumor.

246
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,180
Sir.

247
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,010
You're a swordsman too.

248
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,770
Haven't you thought of visiting Jiuxiao City

249
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,770
when you were young?

250
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,420
Ordinary people see swords as mere swords.

251
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,180
For Blood River, swords

252
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,980
are weapons for murder.

253
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,530
Moreover,

254
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,130
I wasn't a swordsman

255
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,010
when I was young.

256
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,770
I picked up swordsmanship

257
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,530
after that.

258
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,580
Sir,

259
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,250
what did people call you

260
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,010
when you were young?

261
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,010
Do you know

262
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,100
that the question you asked just now

263
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,180
was a taboo in Blood River?

264
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,980
However,

265
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,940
I think it won't matter even if I tell you my name.

266
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,530
My surname is Mu.

267
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,010
They called me Mu Mingce

268
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,250
before I became the Patriarch.

269
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,300
Mu Mingce?

270
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,650
Is this the so-called Spider's Nest?

271
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,650
The Spider Shadow Sect

272
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,220
has set up such bases

273
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,580
in both Beili and Nanjue.

274
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,940
Each base

275
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,890
is a fortress that's easy to defend and hard to invade.

276
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,530
Therefore, many people

277
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,610
don't want us

278
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,460
to return to our nest.

279
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,340
That's all you got, huh?

280
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,460
You think that you can deal with me?

281
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,650
It's from the Xie family.

282
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,530
Chou the Ox,

283
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,220
there's no need to expose them.

284
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,460
Sir,

285
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,010
since they were bold enough to attack us,

286
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,100
there's no need

287
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,340
for us to spare them.

288
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,420
Let's kill them all.

289
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,610
The Xie family and the Mu family actually joined hands?

290
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,460
They actually set up the Heavenly Web Array!

291
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,010
Heavenly Web Array?

292
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,850
Don't look!

293
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,890
Hai the Swine!

294
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,700
Chou the Ox?

295
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,130
I'm not dead yet.

296
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,370
Sir,

297
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,460
didn't you say

298
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,890
that this carriage was impenetrable?

299
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,820
Why aren't we using it?

300
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,100
It's too late.

301
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,220
He has already infiltrated it.

302
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,180
He?

303
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,460
Fanhua, it's you.

304
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,030
[Xie Fanhua, young master of the Xie family]

305
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,420
[Xie Fanhua, young master of the Xie family]
Long time no see.

306
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,340
Sir,

307
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,820
please pardon me for not being able to greet you

308
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,530
as I'm quite sick.

309
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,250
Sickly Ghost?

310
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,700
You're terminally ill.

311
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,770
Even the deities can't save you.

312
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,370
Indeed.

313
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,340
I'm destined to die soon.

314
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,130
That's why I'm daring enough

315
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,940
to intercept the Patriarch's carriage and see him personally.

316
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,850
I'm not afraid of

317
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,460
the punishment that awaits me.

318
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,890
So,

319
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,580
what are you trying to tell me here?

320
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,610
Sir,

321
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,610
you've been in this position

322
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,530
for a long time.

323
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,180
And now,

324
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,770
you're seriously wounded.

325
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,340
Why don't you use this opportunity to retire

326
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,850
and enjoy the rest of your years?

327
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,980
Isn't it better to leave this vexing position

328
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,850
to those who are in the prime
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

329
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,700
of their youth?

330
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,130
In the prime of their youth?

331
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,580
Are you referring

332
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,490
to Xie Ba?

333
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,300
The head of the Xie family

334
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,370
has served Blood River faithfully

335
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,060
all these years.

336
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,130
Naturally,

337
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,100
he's the best candidate for the position.

338
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,730
What if I reject your request?

339
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,300
If so,

340
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,580
I have no choice but to offend you.

341
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,420
You guys merely

342
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,220
desire

343
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,180
the Dormant Dragon Sword

344
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,380
that I possess.

345
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,010
The one who wields the Dormant Dragon Sword

346
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,490
is the true leader of Blood River.

347
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,620
So, you know about that, huh?

348
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,090
If so, I suppose you can see

349
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,330
who the current wielder

350
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,220
of the sword is.

351
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,380
Since I still wield

352
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,770
the sword,

353
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,330
I'm still the leader

354
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,090
of Blood River.

355
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,620
The Soul-Calling Incense?

356
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,730
Senior Brother!

357
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:07,700
This is bad.

358
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,860
He protected the incense with his inner force.

359
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,620
Sir!

360
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,900
The Patriarch is fine.

361
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,180
Let's leave.

362
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,770
It's impossible for Xie Fanhua

363
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,980
to get his hands on the Soul-Calling Incense.

364
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,420
The Mu family must've given it to him.

365
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,180
The Soul-Calling Incense

366
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,420
isn't that difficult to neutralize.

367
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,490
But this is truly unexpected.

368
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,250
Sir, you came from the Mu family.

369
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,050
But now,

370
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,490
even the Mu family is disregarding their past ties with you.

371
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,810
Once a person becomes the Patriarch,

372
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,220
they will cease to be a member of the Three Families.

373
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,980
Sir,

374
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,330
I never expected

375
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,460
your inner force to be this powerful.

376
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,250
You actually expelled the poison

377
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,900
by force.

378
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,330
That's the easy part.

379
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,940
However, I can't utilize my power

380
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,290
for the next 24 hours.

381
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,070
[Mu Kewen, Spider's Nest]

382
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,180
[Mu Kewen, Spider's Nest]
Sir.

383
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,700
Ke.

384
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,180
How long

385
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,660
have you served the sect?

386
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,460
It's been 30 years.

387
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,140
I never thought I'd live to see the day

388
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,530
when the Patriarch himself would come.

389
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,380
I have no regrets in life now.

390
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,330
You should've spent your retirement years here in peace.

391
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,570
I've caused trouble for you

392
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,860
by coming here.

393
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,290
Sorry for bothering you.

394
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,860
Sir, you must be joking.

395
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,940
People like us

396
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,140
have no right

397
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,010
to retire.

398
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,860
All of you, listen up.

399
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,050
Utter no word the moment

400
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,010
you step through the gate.

401
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,490
Understood.

402
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,620
Sir,

403
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,180
the key.

404
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,810
You all may speak now.

405
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,010
Is that the Soundless Array?

406
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,980
Indeed.

407
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,250
That's the Soundless Array.

408
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,220
Sir,

409
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,460
let me take you to your room.

410
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,140
Sir,

411
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,660
who's this lady?

412
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,180
I'm Bai Hehuai.

413
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,940
I could've treated your hunched back

414
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,460
had you encountered me 50 years earlier.

415
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,250
This lady

416
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,460
is the miracle physician of the Medicine King Valley.

417
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,050
She might not be bragging

418
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,620
with what she said.

419
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,490
I never brag.

420
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,810
He wasn't born

421
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,810
with a hunched back.

422
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,860
It was because someone poisoned him.

423
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,810
His bones turned soft because of it.

424
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,730
That's why his back is hunched.

425
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,250
If the poison was neutralized in time,

426
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,220
and if he received some chiropractic treatments,

427
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,180
his condition could've been cured.

428
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,010
It's a shame

429
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,290
that it's been too long since then.

430
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,090
Thank you, miracle physician.

431
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,570
I'm already

432
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,250
used to it.

433
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,180
It's not that I cannot cure your condition.

434
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,420
But the price

435
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,700
will be steep.

436
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,010
How steep?

437
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,330
Why don't you give me the entire residence?

438
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,730
Sir,

439
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,140
the miracle physician must be joking.

440
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,900
Miracle physician,

441
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,980
you're quite greedy, aren't you?

442
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,140
That's why I left the Medicine King Valley.

443
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,050
Sir,

444
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,490
we've arrived at your room.

445
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,420
Miracle physician,

446
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,770
if you encounter any issues,

447
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,050
just tug this rope.

448
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,570
The wooden bird will relay the sound through vibration.

449
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,050
And,

450
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,330
I'll rush to your side

451
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,490
as fast as I can.

452
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,700
The wooden bird?

453
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:53,660
That's right.

454
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,420
Wooden birds can be found

455
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,420
in every corner of the Spider's Nest.

456
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,010
Sir,

457
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,220
I shall take my leave first.

458
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:39,810
Sir.

459
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,220
You're a stubborn old man.

460
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,420
I haven't fainted yet.

461
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,380
Miracle physician, you don't need to mock me first.

462
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,010
I just think

463
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,530
that the old man

464
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,570
was loyal to you.

465
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,530
If so, why did you still pretend

466
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,290
to be tough

467
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,420
and acted as if

468
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,570
you were still normal?

469
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,660
You would understand why

470
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,090
if you saw the face he had when he killed people.

471
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,660
I do trust him.

472
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,570
But it's been 30 years

473
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,900
since we met after all.

474
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,290
It's truly exhausting

475
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,180
to be the Patriarch.

476
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,050
He's on our tails.

477
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,010
I'll stop him.

478
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,050
You can head to Jiuxiao City.

479
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,380
We're talking about Tang Lianyue here.

480
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,940
He might have spared you last time.

481
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,420
But he might not this time.

482
00:26:59,550 --> 00:26:59,980
Yu,

483
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,090
I don't want to choose

484
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,380
between you and Changhe.

485
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,180
Go and end this once and for all.

486
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,420
You can decide for me.

487
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,530
As for him...

488
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,460
Just trust me.

489
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,980
He can't bear to kill me.

490
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,460
I'll give you some of my Life-Protecting zhenqi.

491
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,090
Escape if you can't stop him.

492
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,770
Please be careful.

493
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,980
You're hot on our tails, aren't you?

494
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,940
We've been traveling

495
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,940
day and night without rest.

496
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,980
Even so, you still caught up to us.

497
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,220
What's wrong?

498
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,570
Do you wish to see me

499
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,290
that badly?

500
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,050
You two can't travel fast due to the carriage.

501
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,700
Of course I can catch up to you two.

502
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,180
Did Umbrella Ghost

503
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,660
leave you behind?

504
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,090
That's right.

505
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,620
You see, other people

506
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,940
don't treat me that nicely.

507
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,810
Unlike you, Xuanwu Guardian.

508
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,420
I still remember

509
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,090
your warm embrace last night.

510
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,140
You have a warm body.

511
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,530
Why are you pretending

512
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,660
to be a cold person?

513
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,090
You!

514
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,770
Do you actually think that I won't kill you?

515
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,900
Of course not.

516
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,180
The martial world is never short of passionate men.

517
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,250
However,

518

soon after.

Although

you may have fallen for me that night,

522
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,620
you might have forgotten about me the next day.

523

Or perhaps,

524
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,140
seeking vengeance is more important to you.

525
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,420
Perhaps a relationship isn't as important to you.

I wonder who's flustered here.

It's a transient love affair.

You might think that you have fallen for me at first glance,

but you're just after my body.

In the end, you have no deep feelings

I'm not killing you
