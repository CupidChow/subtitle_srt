5
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,930
It's you?

6
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,410
You are here.

7
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,930
Who brought you inside?

8
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,380
You handpicked everyone

9
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,690
in the Spider Shadow Sect.

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,410
Don't you trust them?

11
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,050
I believe in the results more.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,620
All of them have been loyal to you.

13
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,220
You shouldn't suspect them.

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,570
However,

15
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,690
you made a mistake.

16
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,850
What?

17
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,410
They are loyal to you

18
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,100
but it doesn't mean they are loyal to the Patriarch.

19
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,100
If they think

20
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,260
you made the wrong choice,

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,340
they will also think of a way

22
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,100
to guide you on the right path.

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,820
Let's leave it here for today,

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,290
Su Muyu.

25
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,170
You have many surprises around you.

26
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,010
More than I can imagine.

27
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,450
Miracle physician,

28
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,010
I beg you.

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,660
Don't pull it.

30
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,290
I almost forgot

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,450
that both of you were close friends.

32
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,890
However,

33
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,010
I was almost killed by him just now.

34
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,170
Sorry.

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,410
Didn't you say the Spider's Nest

36
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,410
was impenetrable?

37
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,450
How did he

38
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,610
sneak in so easily?

39
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,500
There must be a spy.

40
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,890
Don't worry, miracle physician.

41
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,290
I will deal with it.

42
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,010
You saw it just now.

43
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,780
Phantom Step

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,940
and Three-Needle Thread.

45
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,260
I only saw Three-Needle Thread.

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,340
I didn't expect you to know the move, Phantom Step.

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,820
That move...

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,570
What about it?

49
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,940
It's quite hard to master.

50
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,290
Do you

51
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,690
not have any questions for me?

52
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,130
Miracle physician, you know more

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,380
about Blood River than ordinary people.

54
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,850
I think

55
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,940
there must be something else apart from the grudge between the Patriarch

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,380
and the former Medicine King.

57
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,170
However, they are not related to today's matter.

58
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,380
I only want to confirm one thing.

59
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,450
What is it?

60
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,820
You are indeed doing your utmost to find a way

61
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,130
to treat the Patriarch,

62
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,060
right?

63
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,170
Yes.

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,500
I will do all I can

65
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,500
to treat the Patriarch.

66
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,290
I'll also make you a promise then.

67
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,290
From today onward,

68
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,780
until the Patriarch is treated,

69
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,660
I, Su Muyu, will not let anyone hurt you

70
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,940
as long as I'm alive.

71
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,540
Unless I die before you.

72
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,980
Can I trust the words of someone from Blood River?

73
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,940
I heard you were a nameless person.

74
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,940
Before you joined Blood River,

75
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,340
where were you?

76
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,730
No-sword City.

77
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:12,850
No-sword City?

78
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,220
The city of swords that was unmatched in swordsmanship

79
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,930
yet got wiped out in one night?

80
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,930
Didn't they say

81
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,340
no one from the city survived?

82
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,460
I heard you loved listening to stories.

83
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,170
If we are lucky enough to overcome this hurdle this time,

84
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,730
I'll tell you

85
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,850
my story.

[Shuying Villa]

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,100
Boss,

88
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,810
when did you come inside?

89
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,340
I didn't even realize.

90
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,140
I've been to the Spider's Nest a few times.

91
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,460
Of course, I know

92
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,930
how to sneak inside.

93
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,780
I forgot about it.

94
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,370
There are 36 traps here.

95
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,100
It'll be difficult even for a formidable martial artist

96
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,900
to leave here alive.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,540
Unless

98
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,700
the infiltrator knows this place's structure

99
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,490
very well.

100
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,610
For example, me.

101
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,730
However, even someone like me

102
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,780
has no choice

103
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,490
but to go through one place.

104
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,250
Where is it?

105
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,050
Here.

106
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,540
This is the core of the Spider's Nest.

107
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,850
There are

108
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,250
a total of four ways

109
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,370
to avoid the 36 traps,

110
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,460
but every way

111
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,900
passes through this place.

112
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,020
When I came here last night,

113
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,540
there was no one here

114
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,170
and you

115
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,340
were the one in charge of guarding this place.

116
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,610
You should die.

117
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,410
Tell me why you betray me.

118
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,170
Boss,

119
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,250
you know more than anyone

120
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,540
that the Patriarch's poison

121
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,370
cannot be cured.

122
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,540
Even if it can be cured,

123
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,730
he'll only live for a few more years.

124
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,050
He should abdicate his position.

125
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,140
You may leave.

126
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,930
Don't appear here anymore.

127
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:33,900
Boss!

128
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,340
Just kill the Patriarch

129
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,250
and take the Dormant Dragon Sword.

130
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,810
Then, everything will be over!

131
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,020
I will kill you if I must.

132
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,050
You will never protect everyone.

133
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,730
You

134
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,900
shouldn't have spared him.

135
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,050
You are the Kui of Blood River.

136
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,700
In terms of our rank in Blood River,

137
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,140
you are many ranks higher than I am.

138
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,490
There's no need to show me respect.

139
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,900
Betraying the Spider Shadow Sect

140
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,410
is the greatest crime in Blood River.

141
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,540
But we can

142
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,340
only punish someone when they are alive, right?

143
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,980
In the current situation,

144
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,700
the Patriarch of Blood River

145
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,460
can even be pursued by the Three Families.

146
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,340
Do the rules

147
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,020
still mean anything?

148
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,850
I met you a few times

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,020
and heard some of your rumors.

150
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,220
Apparently, you have a title

151
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,050
in Soul Reapers' Hall

152
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,290
called Three Refusals.

153
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,770
You don't annihilate families.

154
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,220
You don't accept jobs without knowing the reason.

155
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,730
You don't accept jobs you don't want to.

156
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,650
I've been a part of Blood River my whole life

157
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,420
and you are the only one

158
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,130
who can negotiate with Soul Reapers' Hall.

159
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,460
Because I have a friend

160
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,100
who also had a similar story.

161
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,220
For the missions that Su Muyu wouldn't accept,

162
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,010
I'll accept them all.

163
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,370
He hid this from me for many years.

164
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,940
He must be Su Changhe.

165
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,250
The Undertaker, Su Changhe.

166
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,770
Apparently,

167
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,130
his swordsmanship isn't as good as yours

168
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,530
but his title of the Undertaker

169
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,250
terrorizes people

170
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,100
more than your title of Umbrella Ghost.

171
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,700
It's good of you

172
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,850
to have a friend like him.

173
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,180
I know.

174
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,300
However, members of Blood River

175
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,850
need no friends.

176
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,530
Friends

177
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,530
will only make you hesitate while wielding your sword.

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,730
Su Muyu,

179
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,180
you are a genius

180
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,770
who used an incomplete manual

181
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,700
to restore the Eighteen-Sword Array.

182
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,300
I didn't expect you

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,820
to be

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,530
an extremely foolish person.

185
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,250
What do you mean, Elder?

186
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,530
You want to be a good person.

187
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,220
However, you want to do that

188
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,220
as an assassin.

189
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,980
Isn't that the funniest

190
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,730
and most foolish thing in the world?

191
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,540
[Seven Years Ago]
Do you know?

192
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,420
[Wailing Abyss]
No matter who comes out alive,

193
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,700
[Seven Years Ago, Wailing Abyss]
one of you will join the Su family.

194
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,340
However,

195
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,700
if both of you come out alive,

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,580
you'll break

197
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,490
the rules of Blood River

198
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,650
and must die.

199
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,530
I know.

200
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,220
No. 17,

201
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,700
kill the person beside you.

202
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,130
I won't kill him.

203
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,060
Both of us

204
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,650
must survive.

205
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,100
Sure.

206
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,300
Wonderful.

207
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,300
In a dire situation,

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,730
you still care about the person beside you.

209
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,250
Both of you

210
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,300
are such close friends.

211
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,490
We are not friends.

212
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,940
Assassins shouldn't have friends.

213
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,010
But if we both join Blood River,

214
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,370
we will be family.

215
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,060
If we are family,

216
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,130
how can I abandon him?

217
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,420
Do you know what you are saying?

218
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,730
Just kill me, quick.

219
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,700
Don't be foolish.

220
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,700
You are no match for him.

221
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,940
If you are going to kill him,

222
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,490
I will kill you.

223
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,130
Stop.

224
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,610
Sir.

225
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,460
Sir.

226
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,010
Kid,

227
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,100
your actions today

228
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,250
are a challenge to Blood River's authority.

229
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,340
You are also challenging my authority.

230
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,980
Do you think

231
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,580
it is worth it for Blood River

232
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,940
to break its rules once

233
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,220
for both of you?

234
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,530
Yes.

235
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,460
Both of us

236
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,980
will surely become

237
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,060
the best assassins of Blood River in this century

238
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,370
within three years.

239
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,460
Blood River will transform because of us.

240
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,820
Kid,

241
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,530
I'll remember

242
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,060
what you said.

243
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,370
Fool.

244
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,850
We will

245
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,650
die together now.

246
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,060
The rules exist

247
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,980
to be broken.

248
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,730
Blood River has broken many rules

249
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,130
in the last century

250
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,460
but the rules

251
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,060
were only broken

252
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,700
when the offenders

253
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,130
were powerful enough.

254
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,580
Today,

255
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,770
I will

256
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,580
break the rules once for you.

257
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,980
I will also give you a name.

258
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,340
However,

259
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,180
you need to prove your ability

260
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,340
to me.

261
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,650
I'm willing to take a sword strike from you, Sir.

262
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:47,890
If I die,

263
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,890
he will be the only one

264
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,060
leaving the Wailing Abyss.

265
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,940
Please spare his life.

266
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,820
If I'm still alive,

267
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,700
I hope

268
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,220
you give us a chance.

269
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,980
You are loyal.

270
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,980
Sir, please

271
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,940
attack me.

272
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:15,820
All right.

273
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,890
Remember.

274
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,460
What I'm granting you

275
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,700
isn't the strike

276
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,180
but also the fate of your future.

277
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,340
Are you

278
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,580
going to accept my grace?

279
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,180
Thank you, Sir.

280
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,730
Among the three families,

281
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,580
which family do you want to go to?

282
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,940
He and I

283
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,130
are going to the Su family.

284
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,460
Great.

285
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,490
From now on,

286
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,610
both of you are family members of the Su family.

287
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,300
A fool like you

288
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,060
actually did it.

289
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,370
I have to do my best

290
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,850
for some things.

291
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,850
[Luojiuxiao Inn]
Before you leave, I gave you the token

292
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,130
to deploy

293
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,180
all the elite members of the Su family.

294
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,180
However,

295
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,980
it seemed like you didn't cherish this power.

296
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,420
Even Su Zhe

297
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,420
was someone I helped you deploy.

298
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,340
I don't want the Su family

299
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,940
to confront Spider Shadow Sect head-on.

300
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,180
Doing that

301
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,180
will ruin your reputation

302
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,180
and hurt the elite members

303
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,130
of the Su family.

304
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,580
However,

305
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,460
I almost retrieved it just now

306
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,370
without lifting a finger.

307
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,890
So, Old Man,

308
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,140
[Su Family's Head, Su Jinhui]
please believe in me.

309
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,940
[Su Family's Head, Su Jinhui]
Within ten days,

310
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,610
I'll help you retrieve the Dormant Dragon Sword.

311
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,130
Nonsense!

312
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,580
Old Man, let's talk this out.

313
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,460
Why did you unsheathe your sword?

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,820
Did I say I was going to kill him?

315
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,130
You might not believe me

316
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,650
but the sword

317
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,420
actually came out on its own.

318
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,370
Right?

319
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,650
Yes.

320
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,940
You have

321
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,300
never disappointed me.

322
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,490
I hope

323
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,010
you don't disappoint me again this time.

324
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,530
Where did you go last night?

325
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,420
I asked Su Zhe.

326
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,900
He said he fell asleep

327
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,490
and knew nothing.

328
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,620
I went to scout the Spider's Nest.

329
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,810
Did you do that alone?

330
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,180
Many elite members of the Su family

331
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,140
were hiding in Jiuxiao City.

332
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,220
Why didn't you use them?

333
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,900
Did you not trust them

334
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,050
or

335
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,940
were you worried that they might expose you?

336
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,530
What are you saying, Old Man?

337
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,220
I went to scout the place

338
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,380
and not to kill someone.

339
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,730
Although you are just a nobody,

340
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,490
the only person in the Su family

341
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,700
who has the highest chance of succeeding this task

342
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,380
is you.

343
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,770
I will give you more time.

344
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,420
Get the job done

345
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,010
and do it nicely.

346
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,700
Don't let me down.

347
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,980
That's right.

348
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,700
I peeled the apple for you.

349
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,660
Eat.

350
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,140
Farewell, Old Man.

351
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,620
Isn't this Chou the Ox?

352
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,420
One of the Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow

353
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,700
isn't protecting the Patriarch in the Spider's Nest

354
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,050
but strolling around the city

355
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,050
sneakily.

356
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,770
Are you trying to escape?

357
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,530
Are you two from the Xie family?

358
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,250
Yes.

359
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,810
You've never seen us before

360
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,770
but

361
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,140
I have.

362
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,090
When you became

363
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,730
the Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow,

364
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,620
I went to the ceremony.

365
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,730
I remember

366
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,050
you swore an oath on stage

367
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,180
to stay loyal to the Patriarch for life.

368
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,570
Your expression

369
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,330
was firm and confident.

370
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,250
I never expected you

371
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,490
to escape the Spider's Nest now.

372
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,770
So,

373
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,980
have you betrayed the Patriarch?

374
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,290
It has nothing to do with you.

375
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,050
Don't move.

376
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,980
He asked you not to move

377
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,490
because it's a good advice.

378
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,900
You should hand over

379
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,940
the map of the traps inside Spider's Nest.

380
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,290
Then, I'll spare you.

381
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,660
Dream on.

382
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,460
Who are you?

383
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,490
I've never heard of

384
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,980
such a good Dragonfang Saber

385
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,940
in the Xie family.

386
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,620
Of course, you've never heard about it.

387
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,180
To defeat the Spider Shadow Sect,

388
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,730
Every family has nurtured

389
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,490
a group of experts.

390
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,460
Every one of us

391
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,700
is no worse than Su Muyu.

392
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,620
How dare you

393
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,460
compare yourself with the Boss?

394
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,220
How do

395
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,250
my saber techniques fare against

396
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,140
his sword techniques?

397
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,980
The Boss's sword techniques

398
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,980
are so much stronger than yours.

399
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,660
I hope you are not lying.

400
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,940
Why did you kill him?

401
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,090
He won't tell us.

402
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,090
I could see it.

403
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,730
Besides,

404
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,490
the young master of the Mu family

405
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,010
has already poisoned him with his Paper Butterflies.

406
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,810
It's better

407
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,570
to kill him immediately.

408
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,940
What is your name?
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

409
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,220
Buxie.

410
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,060
[Xie Family, Xie Buxie]
I mean

411
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,020
[Xie Family, Xie Buxie]
my name

412
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,020
[Xie Family, Xie Buxie]
is Buxie.

413
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,140
I'm unlucky to team up with you for a mission.

414
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,330
Move.

415
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,180
Let's go.

416
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,290
Trying to leave?

417
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,980
I finally found

418
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,900
a spider who was left alone.

419
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,180
If you hadn't killed him,

420
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,140
I might be able

421
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,330
to extract more information out of him with my poison.

422
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,420
Who are you?

423
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,290
She is Mu Xuewei from the Mu family.

424
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,420
Her codename is Poisonous Blossom.

425
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,180
Dodge it.

426
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,420
Your saber techniques are not bad.

427
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,700
[Mu Family, Mu Xuewei]
Unfortunately...

428
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,700
What about it?

429
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,980
He is Xie Qianji from the Xie family.

430
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,250
Among the disciples of the Xie family,

431
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,330
he is the best

432
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,380
at setting up traps and arrays.

433
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,490
We are all here

434
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,660
for the same goal.

435
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,620
There's no need to go against each other.

436
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,940
If I remember correctly,

437
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,900
you should be the one from the Mu family

438
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,940
who knows fortune-telling,

439
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,810
Mu Qingyang.

440
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,180
That's right.

441
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,490
Come.

442
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,060
[Mu Family, Mu Qingyang]
Let me take a look at our fortune

443
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,620
[Mu Family, Mu Qingyang]
and see if we are lucky.

444
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,250
Peach blossom is a good omen.

445
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,660
Mahogany sword is a bad omen.

446
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,900
What do you think?

447
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,660
Is that fortune-telling?

448
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,730
The way is simple.

449
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,010
There's someone else here!

450
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,730
Acting mysterious.

451
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,010
Stop.

452
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,660
He is Mu Bai from the Mu family.

453
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,860
Mu Bai?

454
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,810
However, the Xie family

455
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,730
lacks sincerity.

456
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,380
They actually sent

457
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,810
a dying person,

458
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,010
Xie Fanhua.

459
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,220
Since I'm dying,

460
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,810
I'm no longer afraid of death.

461
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,730
The six of us

462
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,050
will be in charge

463
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,490
of tearing down the webs that protect the Spider's Nest tomorrow.

464
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,900
Miracle physician.

465
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,180
Do you have something on your mind?

466
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,900
Are you worried about Ms. Yumo?

467
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,490
Yes.

468
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,090
Do you

469
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,490
like her?

470
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,860
I do.

471
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,940
But it's not the kind

472
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,730
that you are thinking of.

473
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,250
I like her as a family member.

474
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,770
Muyu.

475
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,380
Sir.

476
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,090
Sir, you are finally awake.

477
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,730
It seems like

478
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,090
I've been sleeping for a long time.

479
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,980
Since you are awake,

480
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:34,860
I will

481
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,570
use the Soul-Swap Technique on you

482
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,770
to find a way

483
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,460
of curing Snow Falls on a Plum Blossom

484
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,090
for good.

485
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,010
Thank you, miracle physician.

486
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,730
Before that,

487
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,810
I have something to say to Muyu.

488
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,940
In that case, I'll leave you two alone.

489
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,090
Muyu,

490
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,250
you've worked hard

491
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,490
up to this point.

492
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,860
You must have

493
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,380
met

494
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,700
many troublesome opponents.

495
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,290
I did meet

496
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,090
some troublesome opponents.

497
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,530
Thankfully,

498
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,810
I made it to Jiuxiao City

499
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,460
before you are cured of your poison, Sir.

500
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,940
The Three Families will not stop attacking.

501
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,250
Their next step

502
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,730
will probably be thinking about

503
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,290
capturing the Spider's Nest.

504
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,420
The Xie and Mu families have united.

505
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,380
I heard about it.

506
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,180
The Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow

507
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,050
will be prepared

508
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,860
for their arrival.

509
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,730
The Su family

510
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,900
won't stand idly and do nothing.

511
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,460
Who is

512
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,220
commanding them?

513
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,010
It's Changhe.

514
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,530
It's your buddy.

515
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,050
Sir,

516
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,090
Changhe has no choice

517
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,460
after taking orders from the Su family.

518
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,290
He is here to take my life.

519
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,380
As the Kui...

520
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:14,940
I will

521
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,980
still complete my mission

522
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,010
to stop the rebellion of the Three Families

523
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,050
and cure your illness.

524
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,250
Muyu.

525
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,660
Su Muyu!

526
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,770
You are the most conflicted

527
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,570
and firm person I've seen.

528
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,010
However, the sword technique of this buddy of yours

529
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,900
seems to be stronger than mine.

530
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,810
The gentle spring breeze is nice.

531
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,700
What a comfortable season.

532
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,770
Outside the Spider's Nest that day,

533
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,940
it was the Xie family's blade that killed the man

534
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,770
but the one who set up the Heavenly Web Array

535
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,860
was the Mu family's ghost?

536
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:12,980
Yes.

537
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,860
The Xie and Mu families are working together now.

538
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,620
We, the Su family,

539
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,380
are alone now.

540
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,010
Look how bad the Old Man

541
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,180
is getting along with others.

542
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,660
However, there will

543
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,900
only be one winner in this battle.

544
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,140
Even if they are working together now,

545
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:29,860
they will still

546
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,770
fight each other in the future.

547
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,620
What do you think?

548
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,250
Me?

549
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,900
I'll just sit, stand,

550
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,770
or even lie down

551
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,090
to watch them fight.

552
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,420
Owner, one suite.

553
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,660
One?

554
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:50,860
Sure.

555
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,980
The most expensive and best suite!

556
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,730
Laifu!

557
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,700
Bring the guests upstairs!

558
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,570
Sure!

559
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:00,980
This way, please.

560
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,620
Take care.

561
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,330
This man is lucky with women.

562
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,010
As expected, you still can't get over me.

563
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,010
I have nothing against you.

564
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,810
There's no reason to kill you.

565
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,250
Before I passed out,

566
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,050
I fell into your arms

567
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,090
and heard

568
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,660
your heart beating.

569
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,180
Your heart was beating very quickly.

570
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,050
Were you afraid that I'd die?

571
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,010
No.

572
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,620
If you are not worried that I might die,

573
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,220
you must have felt shy.

574
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,570
I told you I wasn't.

575
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,940
You weren't?

576
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,010
Perhaps I heard wrongly.

577
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,330
Xuanwu Guardian,

578
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,050
why don't you come here

579
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,980
and let me hear your heartbeat again?

580
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,900
Let me see if it's still the same as that time?

581
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,460
Yue,

582
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,810
it's late now.

583
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,420
Do you want to rest with me?

584
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,770
You are still injured.

585
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,860
Don't waste your energy talking.

586
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,010
When I wake up tomorrow,

587
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,010
you'll leave, right?

588
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,810
Actually,

589
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,380
I might behave like this

590
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,250
but I only like

591
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,810
to tease people with words.

592
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,460
If you don't like it, I won't tease you anymore.

593
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,730
However, you are obviously enjoying this.

594
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,810
Forget it.

595
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,940
I'm tired.

596
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,940
I can't speak too much.

597
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,730
If you want to sleep on the bed,

598
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,940
come over yourself.

599
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,530
I won't be

600
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,940
begging you.

601
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,620
In the last twenty years,

602
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,860
people have been pursuing me.

603
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,730
I've never had

604
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,380
a chance to pursue someone.

605
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,620
I'm going out.

606
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,140
What's wrong?

607
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,050
I drank too much water.

608
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,250
Half lost in the river wind, half hidden in the clouds.

609
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,530
When you first entered the inn,

610
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,140
I thought

611
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,460
your back looked familiar.

612
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,900
It's you, indeed.

613
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,460
Why didn't you dare confront me just now

614
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,460
yet you come and see me now?

615
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,860
I avoided you when I didn't feel like meeting you.

616
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,490
Now that I feel like it, I've come to meet you.

617
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,770
The person inside the room

618
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,010
is from Blood River.

619
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,140
Since you are here,

620
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,770
I'll leave her to you.

621
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,530
I want to kill the Patriarch.

622
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,730
I'm not interested in other members of Blood River.

623
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,900
The person inside the room

624
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,090
is the Patriarch's guardian.

625
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,010
The reason why I come here

626
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,810
is to kill the Patriarch.

627
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,940
If you leave her to me,

628
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,900
I will

629
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,420
kill her.

630
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,490
Back so soon?

631
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,460
Did you relieve yourself in front of the door?

632
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,420
Changhe?

633
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,140
It's me.

634
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,730
Have you gone mad?

635
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,460
It seems like

636
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,860
you still care about

637
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,050
the prettiest woman of Blood River.

638
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,180
You were testing me?

639
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:35,900
Not at all.

640
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,420
I just wanted to see

641
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,940
if my Inch Sword is better

642
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,660
or your Fingertip Blade is deadlier.

643
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,180
However,

644
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,490
today is not the right time.

645
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,700
Yumo,

646
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,290
have you decided

647
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,050
to side with Su Muyu?

648
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,380
I'm not siding with anyone.

649
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,860
I'll be sleeping here.

650
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,050
I hope

651
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,700
you don't disturb me.

652
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,140
It seems like

653
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,940
Su Muyu is more important to you.

654
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,770
Otherwise,

655
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,940
you wouldn't help him buy time

656
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,980
from the most dangerous guy in the Tang Clan.

657
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,420
Don't say such nonsense.

658
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,090
I'm clinging to Young Master Tang

659
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,090
because I like him.

660
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,290
Is that so?

661
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,530
A few years ago,

662
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,700
you even said you wanted to marry Su Muyu.

663
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,860
Women are so fickle.

664
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,420
Xuanwu Guardian,

665
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,140
if you do care

666
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,010
about my younger sister,

667
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,770
you should protect her for a few more days.

668
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,860
The tides are turning in Jiuxiao City.

669
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,980
I'll help you

670
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,980
get the Patriarch's head.

671
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,820
Yu.

672
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,740
They left Chou's body

673
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,820
outside of Spider's Nest.

674
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,980
They are trying to assert their dominance.

675
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,010
We examined the body.

676
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,980
He died from a blade injury

677
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,650
but he was already poisoned

678
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,900
by the Mu family's young master with his butterfly poison.

679
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,570
The blade strike

680
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,090
actually gave him an easier death.

681
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,170
Boss,

682
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,460
why did you let Chou go?

683
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,260
This is no longer important.

684
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,420
The Three Families

685
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,170
are not going

686
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,570
to let any one of us live.

687
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,740
Even if it's just

688
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,490
an uninvolved person who wants to stay out of this conflict.

689
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,780
In that case,

690
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,460
we'll let the Three Families

691
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,780
pay for this.

692
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,780
Everyone,
