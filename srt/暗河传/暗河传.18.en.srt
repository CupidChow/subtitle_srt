Don't worry.

9
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,200
We came here
with no goals in mind.

Xiao Zhaoyan is my younger sister.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
She's here

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,850
because I requested the Patriarch

13
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,380
to send her here back then.

14
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,180
I see.

15

If so, I shall not bother you all.

17

That guy is kind of interesting.

18
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,980
He was a little surprised

19
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,800
when he found out about our identities.

20
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,820
However,

21
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,850
he wants to

22

keep a distance from us after that.

The people here

Therefore, after he found
out about your identities,

31

38

Where's the meat?
Where's the liquor?

This is our homemade rice wine.

40

Indeed.

49

Since young,

58

that the Shadow Guards

60
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,100
could come and go at will

61
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,050
while the Three Families

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,660

Until the day I saw Su Muyu.

66
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,460
That's when I understood

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,320
why I had to endure
defiance and unwillingness

all these years

69
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,490
Su Muyu was unhappy about

70
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,950
being the shadow of the Shadow Sect.

71
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,160
Does he think that I'm happy about that?

72
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,136
Grandfather and the rest may have been old,

73
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,340
but I'm still young.

74
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,850
The younger generations

75
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,990
are brave enough to carve
a new world out of the old.

76
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,190
Your Highness,

77
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,140
I'm willing to be your arrow.

78
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,340
On the day you release it,

79
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,700
once you help me make a name for myself,

80
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,410
by then, we can see

81
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,030
whether or not Su Muyu of
the martial world is stronger

82
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,290
than our forces

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
in the imperial palace.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Excellent.

85
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,270
Very good.

86
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,310
By the way,

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,700
on that night,

88
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,600
I assume they've retrieved the letter

89
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,410
that belonged

90
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,630
to their own compartments, right?

91
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,630
They have.

92
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Excellent.

93
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,910
After Blood River selected a new leader,

94
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,810
Yi Bu ordered his men

95
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,510
to retrieve everything in the compartment.

96
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,490
Your Highness, did you feed them

97
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,510
with false information?

98
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
No.

99
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,490
Of course they're true.

100
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,390
It might even be

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,540
more detailed

102
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,460
than the original document.

103
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,810
It's because I bought the information

104
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,540
from Baixiao Hall many years ago.

105
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,220
Back then, Baixiao Hall

106
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,050
was still untainted

107
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,780
by the forces of Prince of Langya.

108
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,950
Your Highness, why are
you helping them out?

109
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,140
It's because it'll be their turn

110
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,580
to help me out soon.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Ms. Yumo.

112
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,166
Please help me keep an eye on

113
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,870
the movements of Tianqi's Xuanwu Guardian.

114
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,730
We had a promise.

115
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,926
But when I visited the Inner
Security Division yesterday,

116
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,950
their men said

117
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,150
that they hadn't seen
him around for a long time.

118
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,680
If you receive any news of him

119
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,070
returning to Tianqi,

120
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,350
please notify me immediately.

121
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,250
He has never gotten drunk?

123
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,100
He fell unconscious just after one bowl.

124
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,340
Changhe has a mystical ability.

125
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,696
When he wants to get
drunk, one cup is enough.

126
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,000
But when he wants to stay sober,

127
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,490
he won't get drunk

128
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,510
no matter

129
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,980
how much liquor he drinks.

130
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,520
If so, why did he choose

131
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,980
to get drunk so early tonight?

132
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
It's because he knows

133
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,350
that I have some private matters

134
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,720
to tell you.

135
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,070
What is it?

136
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,490
I found some past secrets

137
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,810
in Tianqi City's Wanjuan Tower.

138
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,680
I also found out
about the identity of the culprit

139
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,100
who wiped out No-Sword City back then.

140
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,190
Who was it?

141
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,680
It was Blood River.

142
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,850
Is that true?

143
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,390
Back then,

144
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,050
Blood River sent out 93 of their members

145
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,070
as per the order.

146
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,410
Together with

147
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,150
several of Zhou Yuluo's personal disciples,

148
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,630
they caused The Uprising of No-Sword City.

149
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,490
Zhou Yuluo's family

150
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,550
had a total of 67 members.

151
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,070
Only their young lord, who
was still a child, survived.

152
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,470
He escaped along the river.

153
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,160
He was captured by Blood River.

154
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,441
The young lord of No-Sword City
was born with an affinity for swords.

155
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,220
The head of the Su
family coveted his talent.

156
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,630
Thus, he arranged for
him to enter the Furnace.

157
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,660
He nurtured him as a Nameless

158
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,520
so that he could serve
the Su family in the future.

159
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,340
Blood River?

160
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,150
Indeed.

161
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,100
The culprit that I've been searching for,

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,610
it's actually the place

163
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,820
I grew up in.

164
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,820
There were 93 assassins

165
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,750
dispatched for duty.

166
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,580
18 of them survived.

167
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,650
I reviewed the name list.

168
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,340
I know none of them.

169
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,580
It's because they were murdered

170
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,700
in the middle of their missions

171
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
after the incident.

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You can take a look.

173
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,980
[Blood River members involved in
the Wushuang City attack: Su Xiemo]

174
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Su...

175
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,420
Su Xiemo?

176
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,390
Continue reading.

177
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,770
Su Xiaoyan.

178
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,220
Xie Shuitao.

179
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,270
Mu Tianze.

180
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,150
These names...

181
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,820
Do you know them?

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
All these people,

183
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
they're

184
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,460
in the Homeland.

185
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,790
Understood.

186
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,180
Yu, what are you up to?

187
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,800
I'm just going to ask them some questions.

188
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Wait here for me.

189
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,770
If the guy inside is awake,

190
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,530
tell him to stay put.

191
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Yu!

192
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Don't worry.

193
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,390
I can't just slaughter
the entire village

194
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,750
just after I said that
this was my home yesterday.

195
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Where does Su Xiemo live?

196
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,000
The third house
from the village entrance.

197
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,030
All right.

198
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Please be careful.

199
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,880
Senior, you're in a great mood, huh?

200
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,390
It's been a habit of mine for many years.

201
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,130
Enjoying a vat of wine

202
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,770
and a plate of peanuts

203
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,650
is the only

204
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
enjoyable moment

205
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,890
of my day.

206
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
I understand.

207
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,250
I figured out who you were

208
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,580
after our first encounter.

209
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,770
You resemble

210
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,840
the younger version of your father

211
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,060
a lot.

212
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,220
My swordsmanship

213
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
is also

214
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,890
on par with his.

215
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Is your umbrella

216
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,390
your sword?

217
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,130
I keep 18 swords in my umbrella.

218
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,130
And, there are a total of

219
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,150
18 people here.

220
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,130
Just nice. One sword

221
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,010
for each of you.

222
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,680
I can tell why the head of the Su family

223
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,010
took a liking to you immediately.

224
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,400
I can't believe that someone
picked up the Eighteen-Sword Array.

225
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,360
All of you
were supposed to be dead.

226
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,650
Why are all of you in the Homeland?

227
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,220
Back then, Soul Reapers' Hall

228
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
gave us this mission.

229
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,430
At first, the Patriarch
refused to accept it.

230
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,690
The eradication of No-Sword City

231
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,330
would bring a huge impact.

232
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,430
It would shake the
foundation of Blood River.

233
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,520
However, the Soul Reapers'
Hall was very adamant about it.

234
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,830
Due to that, Blood River
suffered heavy casualties.

235
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,430
Out of 93 expert assassins
who were dispatched,

236
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,220
only 18 of them survived.

237
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,220
And, these 18 survivors

238
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,580
were hunted and pursued

239
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,060
during

240
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
their missions.

241
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,010
No one could find out about the mission

242
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,700
Blood River would accept in advance.

243
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,390
Except for

244
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
the Soul Reapers' Hall.

245
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,910
Indeed.

246
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,250
The Patriarch also suspected

247
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,220
that Soul Reapers' Hall and
the one who placed the order

248
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,730
wanted to silence us.

249
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,460
The art of silencing people

250
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,490
never existed in Blood River.

251
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,250
It's because you guys have no information

252
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,300
about your employers.

253
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,940
There's no need to silence them.

254
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
But that time

255
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
was different.

256
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,130
The employer desired

257
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,580
the precious sword manuals

258
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,700
of No-Sword City.

259
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,100
On the night our men

260
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,370
charged into the city,

261
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,710
some of their men who
had infiltrated the city

262
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,980
were fighting for

263
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,890
the sword manuals.

264
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,570
And for a brief moment,

265
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,460
our two forces

266
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,700
clashed by mistake.

267
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,850
It was during the clash

268
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,580
that I figured out

269
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,960
the sword techniques they were using.

270
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,920
Riding the sword to the Ninth Heaven...

271
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,510
As the dragon falls
into the Yellow Springs.

272
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
That's right.

273
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,270
It was the Ninth Heaven Sword Technique.

274
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,510
Wushuang City?

275
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,910
Calm down.

276
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,870
Once this technique is used,

277
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,710
every other sword technique
will pale in comparison.

278
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,980
However, the strongest city in the world

279
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,280
with an unparalleled reputation,

280
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,720
also made a name for itself
due to its sword techniques.

281
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
Wushuang City, huh?

282
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,100
That answer chills my heart.

283
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Why do you say so?

284
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,580
It's because my father

285
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,580
once complimented the swordsmanship

286
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,480
of Liu Yunqi, the former
lord of Wushuang City.

287
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,150
He felt a faint sense
of kinship toward him.

288
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,270
What a shame.

289
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Mr. Su,

290
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
I've already told you

291
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,420
everything I know.

292
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,060
But there are certain things

293
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
I wish to tell you.

294
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,670
There's no emotional bond

295
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,770
between you and us.

296
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,060
We don't feel any guilt at all.

297
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,030
Blood River was just following orders.

298
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
It's the same for you.

299
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,510
Therefore,

300
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,250
if you wish to seek revenge,

301
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,770
we'll surely kill you.

302
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,910
Even if I wish to seek revenge,

303
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,790
I should seek the
culprit behind everything.

304
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,750
I understand that.

305
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
Moreover,

306
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,750
after joining the Homeland,

307
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,370
all of your honors and
sins will be washed away.

308
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,370
That will never change.

309
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Master Su.

310
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Thank you.

311
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,900
It's been many years

312
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,490
since

313
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,660
we wielded a sword.

314
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,050
Now, we're better at using hoes

315
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,070
compared to

316
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
swords.

317
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Farewell.

318
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,310
Sir.

319
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,480
Why are you scared of him?

320
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,530
We have plenty of people here.

321
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,270
I'm sure we can kill a brat like him.

322
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,810
I'm afraid we can't.

323
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,250
The Eighteen-Sword Array

324
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,220
is no joke, you know?

325
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Moreover...

326
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,030
Sir.

327
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Since when was he here?

328
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,070
He's been here for a long time.

329
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,010
Just now, when we showed up,

330
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,030
that guy outside
has already released his killing intent.

331
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,350
If we attack him,

332
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,950
he would surely rush into the room.

333
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,630
He's the current Patriarch of Blood River,

334
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,550
Su Changhe.

335
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,030
Su Changhe, huh?

336
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Interesting.

337
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,950
So, what's the aura surrounding him?

338
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,810
He cultivated Hell Palm.

339
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,860
- Hell Palm? - Hell Palm?

340
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,830
I heard

341
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,620
that it was a cursed art.

342
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,250
Patriarchs who cultivated the art

343
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
would have a tragic end.

344
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,070
I don't believe in that type of saying.

345
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,480
It's because most people like us

346
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,300
have a tragic end.

347
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,060
That's why it's making it

348
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,850
as if

349
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,490
every Patriarch who cultivated the art

350
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,480
would have a tragic end.

351
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
What are you doing here?

352
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,120
Didn't I tell you not to come?

353
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,590
I was drunk.

354
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,560
I didn't hear what you said.

355
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,030
Didn't I tell Zhaoyan to
relay the message to you?

356
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,570
Why should I listen to a lass like her?

357
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,670
But since you don't intend to kill them,

358
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,270
let's head to Nan'an tomorrow.

359
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,040
What's with the sudden trip

360
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
to Nan'an?

361
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,660
I just received some news.

362
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,040
Your beloved told us to
go there and have some fun.

363
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,560
Tell me the original message.

364
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,700
[To Su Muyu]

365
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,350
Su,
may this letter find you well.

366
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,570
I've returned to Nan'an City recently,

367
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,856
and I wish to reopen my apothecary.

368
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,220
Now, we have enough physicians.

369
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,046
But we lack an apprentice to grind
the herbs or tend to our guests.

370
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,900
Muyu, I wonder if you're in the mood

371
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,010
to work for us temporarily.

372
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,200
It's fine even if you're busy.

373
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
But remember this.

374
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,420
Do not bring Changhe with you?

375
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,710
I'm the only one he invited.

376
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Who said it was us?

377
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,830
You!

378
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,830
Just tell me.

379
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,150
Will you head there or not?

380
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
I guess.

381
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,510
As for you,

382
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,510
you should join me too.

383
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,376
Could it be that you haven't received

384
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,050
any useful news from them

385
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,090
as of yet?

386
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,590
What do you think?

387
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,060
[Heyu Apothecary]

388
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,940
A life like this

389
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,900
is wonderful indeed.

390
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,670
The incident with Blood
River has been resolved.

391
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,940
Don't you think you should think about

392
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,140
your marriage now?

393
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,700
Fadog!

394
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,560
You're starting to spout nonsense again.

395
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,460
I think Su Muyu

396
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,900
is a great candidate.

397
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,590
Among the people of Blood River,

398
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,770
I like him the most.

399
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,290
But you see,

400
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,770
I don't like his type.

401
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,940
He's too cold.

402
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,220
He feels

403
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,660
boring.

404
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,420
Perhaps most of the women out there

405
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,830
would like a guy like him.

406
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,570
He has a gentle personality.

407
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,490
And,

408
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,380
he's good-looking.

409
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,570
But...

410
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
But what?

411
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,730
But I prefer

412
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,830
people who are interesting.

413
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,350
For example,

414
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,530
a person like Su Changhe.

415
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,980
He's the Patriarch of Blood River.

416
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,779
He's as strong as you can get.

417
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,090
He has all the power he wants.

418
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,830
And,

419
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,660
he is

420
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,110
very interesting.

421
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
His manner of speech

422
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,010
is very unique.

423
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,010
He's a special man.

424
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,730
That brat...

425
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,310
You brat...

426
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,310
Fadog.

427
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,380
Where are you going?

428
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
I cannot kill you.

429
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,510
You're my daughter.

430
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,656
However, I can choose to kill
that brat, Su Changhe.

431
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,760
Wait here.
I'll return soon.

432
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,960
He's the Patriarch of
Blood River, you know?

433
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,140
Su Muyu

434
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,420
is just the head of the Su family.

435
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,830
Fadog,

436
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,360
why do you like Su Muyu that much?

437
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,620
And, why do you hate Su Changhe that much?

438
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,180
I know Su Changhe

439
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
is powerful.

440
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,840
But he's full of sinister thoughts.

441
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
If you do marry him,

442
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,770
it's fine if he bullies you.

443
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,420
But I don't want you to be a widow.

444
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,290
You see, heroes

445
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,490
are often misunderstood

446
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,700
by commoners like you.

447
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,490
You see,

448
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,010
Changhe is...

449
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
Miss Bai,

450
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:32,810
I never expected you

451
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,980
to like me that much.

452
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,810
You must be kidding me.

453
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,050
Miss Bai, I fancy you as well.

454
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,530
Why are you here instead?

455
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,280
Who is it you wish to see, then?

456
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,330
Who is this?

457
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,940
She's the woman

458
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,380
Su Muyu cares for the most.

459
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,660
She's Su Muyu's

460
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,330
childhood sweetheart.

461
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
She's Xiao Zhaoyan.

462
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,290
She comes from Blood River's Homeland.

463
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,830
We're heading to Nan'an.

464
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,760
There's a miracle physician there.

465
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,280
And, she lacks an apprentice
to grind her medicine for her.

466
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,050
So,

467
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,380
the person Su Muyu misses often,

468
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,730
the member from the Homeland,

469
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,330
it's you, Ms. Xiao.

470
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,380
Greetings, Miss Bai.
I'm Younger Sister Xiao.

471
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,830
Younger sister?

472
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,900
Does that mean

473
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,180
she's younger than me?

474
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,270
Someone's feeling a little sensitive.

475
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,640
Someone's feeling a little sensitive, huh?

476
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,730
Lass, you're not eloquent at all.

477
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,900
Miss Bai is merely 30 years old.

478
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,560
How could you address her as such?

479
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,040
You should address her as...
Fadog!

480
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,050
Yes, my girl.

481
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Kill him!

482
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Roger that!

483
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
No escape for you!

484
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,070
Uncle Zhe!

485
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,240
Calm down!
You can't hit me!

486
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,480
Ms. Xiao,

487
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
since you're here,

488
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,590
where's Su Muyu?

489
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,090
Muyu said

490
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,490
that he had to visit someone.

491
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,870
Therefore, he didn't come with us.

492
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,190
But he'll arrive soon after.

493
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
Visit someone?

494
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,670
You've been following me the entire way.

495
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,490
I'm not that free.

496
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,640
My subordinate was the one following you.

497
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Master Su.

498
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,310
Master Ji.

499
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,380
Why did you

500
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,070
arrange for this meeting?

501
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,046
Master Su, did you take
anything related to Baixiao Hall

502
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,050
away from

503
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,730
Imperial Father-in-Law's Residence?

504
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,240
If you did,

505
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,330
that'd prove

506
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,420
that my long trip

507
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,750
wasn't in vain.

508
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,770
Master Ji,

509
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,510
your words are still as profound as always.

510
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Is it profound?

511
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
I thought

512
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,330
I'd already made it obvious enough.

513
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,460
Did that young archer

514
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,090
of the Xie family tell you about that?

515

Master Ji, have you been
to Wanjuan Tower before?

517
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,980
I've heard about it.

518
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
Within Wanjuan Tower

519
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,420
contains Blood River,

Our Baixiao Hall is known as
the All-Knowing under Heaven.

524

We've never held Wanjuan
Tower in high regard.

525
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,380
However, for some reason, Wanjuan Tower

contains information
related to Baixiao Hall.

527

It would've been fine if the
document had been burned down.

Among all the shelves,

Baixiao Hall has the
fewest books and scrolls.

that the paper of the letter
contained in the compartment

was new.

I once intended to buy
some intel from Baixiao Hall.

556

According to them,

557
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,110
that piece of intel would cause
an uproar in the martial world.

558
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,760
Therefore, they couldn't sell it to me.

Perhaps

577

it's because the version we recorded

In addition, Uncle Zhe is here as well.

682
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,480
Zhaoyan will surely be safe

683
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
staying with you.

684
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,110
Judging from what you said,

685
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,010
it seems you're entrusting her to me.

686
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,810
Could it be

687
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,250
that you still have other matters

688
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,270
to deal with?

689
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,660
Is it related to No-Sword City?

690
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,520
I won't leave for the time being.

691
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,430
I'll live in Nan'an City for now.

692
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,090
After all, I own half of this apothecary.

693
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,530
I have to do my best to manage it.

694
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Come inside.

695
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
Leave them here for now.

696
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,510
I'll think of a way to arrange them.

697
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,890
Put all of the food into the kitchen.

698
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,030
All right.

699
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,340
As for the beds and blankets,

700
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:17,940
Uncle Zhe,

701
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,230
you can lead them to the
rooms and settle down first.

702
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,710
Follow me.

703
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,460
As for the rest,

704
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,980
just leave them here.

705
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,590
I'll think of a way to arrange them.

706
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,460
What did I say again?

707
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,740
What is that?

708
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,530
You see, we encountered a fish seller.

709
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,780
This green jade basin
was his family treasure.

710
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,170
In the end,

711
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,530
Changhe wanted to buy it.

712
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,050
The seller sold it to him reluctantly

713
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,090
upon seeing a gold ingot.

714
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,030
After that, he requested this
mister to transport it here.

715
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,030
Here's 500 taels.

716
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,640
Share them with your buddies.

717
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,900
Thank you, mister!

718
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,050
Let's go.

719
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,090
This is an apothecary.

720
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,480
It's not a general store.

721
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,980
It's not like I'm decorating the place

722
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,090
like an apothecary.

723
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,130
You see,

724
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,320
this is our house.

725
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,160
From now on, we have to stay here.

726
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,880
Naturally, it shouldn't be too boring.

727
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,150
We have to decorate it

728
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,710
with things we like.

729
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,050
I think you're the only one who likes this.

730
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,160
How come I never knew
you liked watching fish?

731
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,990
I never knew you liked
watching birds either.

732
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,720
Everyone
has their own preferences.

733
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,610
You like to grind herbs, cook,

734
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,630
and be a good man.

735
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,150
But me?

736
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,820
I like to watch birds, fish, enjoy music,

737
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,260
and live my life as a shameless womanizer.

738
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,230
To each his own.

739
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,660
[Heyu Apothecary]
That's right.

740
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,710
Dear folks of Nan'an City,

741
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
now, I hereby announce

742
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,740
that Heyu Apothecary

743
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,130
is officially open!

744
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,210
Excellent!

745
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
I thought our apothecary

746
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,010
was already open long ago.

747
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,420
Changhe said that our business

748
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
wouldn't last long

749
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,950
as we waited for patients to come.

750
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,206
We have to use this opportunity

751
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,050
to show the folks

752
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,420
your true capabilities.

753
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,330
It's so lively.

754
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,820
What a lively atmosphere.

755
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,230
It's like a festive occasion.

756
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
Yeah.

757
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,230
Apothecary?

758
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,720
If my memory serves me correctly,

759
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,010
this was a place

760
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,570
that depended on good-looking men

761
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,820
to sell expensive medicine.

762
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,300
In Nan'an City,

763
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,480
there are a total of 63
apothecaries of varying sizes.

764
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,686
We also have the Four Famed Physicians

765
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,860
and 30 Sacred Healers here.

766
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,530
You said that this was
an apothecary, right?

767
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,610
I wonder who the owner is.

768
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
It's me.

769
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,510
