00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,430
Miracle physician,

7
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,120
you must have been hungry.
I'll cook.

8
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Well...

9
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,710
No need.

10
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,790
I...

11
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,070
I'm not hungry.

12
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,840
You worked all day. How could you not be?

13
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,810
Today,

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,540
I even asked Miss Wang next door.

15
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,336
Turns out the dish I made yesterday

16
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,410
was missing one spice.

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,960
Fix that will improve the taste.

18
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
Su Muyu,

19
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,750
you go out every day,

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,700
walk around,

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
pick up groceries,

22
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,699
help me choose herbs,

23
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,400
and decoct them.

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,730
That's already a lot.

25
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,690
You don't need to cook as well.

26
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,060
You work harder every day.

27
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,170
As for the chores,

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
just leave them to me.

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
Su Muyu.

30
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,450
How can you

31
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,870
master the sword...

32
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Because...
yet fail

33
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,380
at cooking noodles?

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
I'm not eating.

35
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
Fine.

36
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,600
It's your effort, after all.

37
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,170
When I go out tomorrow,

38
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,030
I'll buy flower cakes to make it up to you.

39
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,230
And ask Miss Wang again...

40
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,030
Su Muyu,

41
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:28,730
can you

42
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,340
promise me one thing?

43
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,410
All right. What is it?

44
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,630
Promise me

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,100
to spare Miss Wang and spare me.

46
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,150
Try a few more times,

47
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,590
I'll get it right.

48
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,380
Same with sword practice.

49
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,550
As for this bowl of noodles,

50
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,640
you'd better not eat it yet.

51
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,430
Wait till tomorrow.

52
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,006
Everyone in the martial world

53
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,030
trains with a sword,

54
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,730
yet only a few become Sword Deities.

55
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,540
There are so many physicians,

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,220
why am I the miracle physician?

57
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,290
Because of talent.

58
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,110
Everyone's born with different gifts.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,170
Su Muyu,

60
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,170
some things

61
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,630
can't be forced.

62
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,780
When I first learned the sword,

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
I was clumsy too.

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,930
I can't talk you out of it, huh?

65
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,830
What's that?

66
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,850
They're chickens Mrs. Chen sent over.

67
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,320
She knows I'm learning
to cook from Miss Wang,

68
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
so she sent them for practice.

69
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,580
Since fate points the way,

70
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,730
allow me to show a little skill.

71
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,150
I learned this from my master,

72
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,570
Herbal Chicken Stew.

73
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
How is it?

74
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,190
Smells amazing!

75
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,730
It tastes even better.

76
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,270
Go on, try.

77
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,750
Okay.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,720
I didn't expect you to be such a good cook.

79
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
These days,

80
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,310
I've really made a fool of myself.

81
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,290
You flatter me.

82
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,100
I'm only good

83
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,730
at this one dish.

84
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,480
When I was little,
my master taught it to me.

85
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,140
But later, every time I made it,

86
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
I'd think of him.

87
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,100
And every time I did,

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,730
I felt so sad,

89
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,980
so I stopped making it.

90
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Never thought

91
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,680
after all these years,

92
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,590
my cooking

93
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,860
would still be this good.

94
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,560
Sorry about that, miracle physician.

95
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,660
That was all when I was a kid.

96
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,370
I'm grown now.

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,930
I'm not hung up on something so small.

98
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
Besides, death

99
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
is just part of life.

100
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,460
Even a miracle physician

101
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,630
can't prevent it.

102
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,780
While I was cooking just now,

103
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I realized

104
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,460
I wasn't sad anymore.

105
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,340
Thinking of him again,

106
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
my heart

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
felt warm.

108
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,410
So this is the famous Flower Cake.

109
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,390

00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,570
You're Mr. Xin's senior?

176
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,930
Right.

177
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Fair and square!

178
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,096
I'm of the same generation
as Sikong Changfeng.

179
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,329
He's half a disciple

180
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,330
of Mr. Xin.

181
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,210
So you're two ranks above me.

182
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,060
I should call you grand-master.

183
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,390
My apologies.

184
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,030
Greetings, Physician Bai.

185
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
So...

186
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,660
I'm that remarkable?

187
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,729
Didn't expect to meet you

188
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,730
in Nan'an City.

189
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,790
Did you visit here

190
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,970
just to meet me?

191
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,040
I wanted to know why you're in Nan'an City.

192
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,750
It's not to kill.

193
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,120
That's all I needed to know.

194
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,790
Since we've met,

195
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,610
why not stay for a meal?

196
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,350
Nice to see you smile at last.

197
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Sir,

198
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,510
enjoy your meal.

199
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Miss,

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,400
try these fresh-baked flower cakes.

201
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,850
You look new around here.

202
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,210
Are you here to sightsee?

203
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,910
No.

204
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
I'm looking for someone.

205
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,670
Oh, looking for someone?

206
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Enjoy your meal.

207
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,646
They say, "I pick fresh every day;

208
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,870
good cooking has its secrets."

209
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Cooking's like swordwork:

210
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
miss one move,

211
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,510
and nothing flows.

212
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,750
What you make

213
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,910
won't look good,

214
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
smell good,

215
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
or taste good.

216
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,690
Smells amazing!

217
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,140
Didn't expect you

218
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,660
to be a kitchen deity too!

219
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
I'm no kitchen deity.

220
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,850
I just read many recipes,

221
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,300
traveled many lands,

222
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
and tasted many dishes,

223
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,550
so I learned to cook plenty too.

224
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,510
The way of cooking

225
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,870
runs deep.

226
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,790
I'd like to hear more.

227
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Su Muyu,

228
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
Xie Xuan...

229
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
You two changed careers?

230
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,910
City Lord Li.

231
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,510
City Lord?

232
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,570
City Lord...

233
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,900
This young lady

234
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,510
is Xueyue City's Second City Lord,

235
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Li Hanyi,

236
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,660
You're Sword Deity Xueyue?

237
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,330
You must be

238
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,570
the miracle physician

239
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,380
who treated Blood River's Patriarch.

240
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,920
Didn't expect you to be so young.

241
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,260
And you're the one

242
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,140
who created the Floral Sword Art,

243
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,139
calling flowers with a single stroke,

244
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,140
Sword Deity Xueyue?

245
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,030
I am.

246
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,190
And the sword in your hand

247
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,660
is the one kept in Kunlun

248
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,729
that can freeze the
sunset with a single slash,

249
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,020
the coldest sword under heaven,

250
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,090
Froststeel?

251
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,970
How good a sword is

252
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,090
depends on who holds it.

253
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,900
Why does this scene feel familiar?

254
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,810
The legendary Floral Sword Art

255
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,090
must be a stunning sight.

256
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,610
Care to let me see it?

257
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,670
Miracle physician,

258
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,420
Sword Deities don't draw lightly.

259
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
When they do,

260
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,060
the city's swept in snow.

261
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,150
True.

262
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,850
I don't draw lightly.

263
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,900
But meeting you...

264
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,210
I might draw at any time.

265
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Aren't you two

266
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,300
friends?

267
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,970
We once fought side by side

268
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,696
against the Demonic
Sect's leader, Ye Dingzhi.

269
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
But we're hardly friends.

270
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
In the jianghu,

271
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,600
no one wants
to be Blood River's enemy,

272
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
nor does anyone

273
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,500
want to be Blood River's friend.

274
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,780
City Lord Li and I

275
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
are quite close.

276
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,850
I'm senior to Xin Baicao
of Medicine King Valley.

277
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,300
Your Third City Lord,

278
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,420
Sikong Changfeng,

279
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,470
was once trained at
the Medicine King Valley.

280
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,420
He counts as half a disciple of Baicao.

281
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,780
So,

282
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,230
Sikong Changfeng

283
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,610
should call me grand-master.

284
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,730
You really put it to use.

285
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,330
Didn't expect someone so young

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,330
to be Medicine King's senior.

287
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
The real deal!

288
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
My apologies.

289
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,750
Not at all.

290
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,180
My rank's just too high,

291
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,630
so everyone thinks

292
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,810
I'm ancient.

293
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Truth is, my mother

294
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,300
is the blood sister of Wen Luoyu,

295
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,280
the Heir Consort of the Marquis of Zhenxi.

296
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,970
Your First City Lord,

297
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,260
Baili Dongjun,

298
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,670
is my cousin!

299
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,300
My senior is your cousin?

300
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,210
We're family.

301
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,160
Stay here and eat with us.

302
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Come!

303
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,270
Smells great.

304
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,260
You hold your liquor, miracle physician.

305
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,270
Naturally, bottomless.

306
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,600
And this wine is really good,

307
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,500
with a hint of peach blossom,

308
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
and a touch of sweetness.

309
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,090
The peach note...

310
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
A friend from Wangchengshan Sect left it

311
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,970
after a consult.

312
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,140
It was brewed by his
junior, the sect leader.

313
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,420
That junior's swordwork

314
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,260
is now legendary

315
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:10,380
across the jianghu nowadays.

316
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,999
True,

317
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,610
I haven't seen his swordplay.

318
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,090
But his wine

319
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,260
is indeed superb.

320
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
How's the wine?

321
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Taste good?

322
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,670
It's great.

323
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,610
Miss Li,

324
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,180
you're stunning,

325
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,930
yet cold as frost.

326
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,140
Nothing seems

327
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:37,450
to move you.

328
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
I thought

329
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,500
you'd simply say "not bad,"

330
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,090
didn't expect outright praise.

331
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Looks like this wine

332
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:45,760
really is good.

333
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,270
Dishes are all here.

334
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,420
Let's eat.

335
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,380
[Healing Hands]

336
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,300
I know why you're here, Miss Li.

337
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,550
Rest easy.

338
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,130
Blood River has no agenda in Nan'an.

339
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,220
But the miracle physician's
place in Qiantang City

340
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
was exposed,

341
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,980
so she moved to Nan'an,

342
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,310
As for me,

343
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,700
I needed treatment,

344
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
so I came along.

345
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,650
That day in Jiuxiao City,

346
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
I thought

347
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,850
even if you couldn't disband Blood River,

348
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,370
you'd be

349
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
the new Patriarch.

350
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,260
But in the end,

351
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,460
Su Changhe became Patriarch,

352
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
and you

353
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,980
came to Nan'an,

354
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,270
far from Blood River.

355
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,299
That's not the ending

356
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,330
Su Changhe promised me,

357
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,740
and it's a very, very bad one.

358
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,219
Your bias against Changhe

359
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,300
still runs deep.

360
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Bias?

361
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,330
Xie Xuan said

362
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,220
your dear brother

363
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,940
may not be the worst man alive,

364
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,700
but he's surely

365
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,170
the most annoying.

366
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,270
His thick skin

367
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,890
is rare in this world,

368
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,940
a "classic" for the ages.

369
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,780
A "classic" for the ages? Seriously?

370
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,370
You're a bit drunk.

371
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,330
Those were Xie Xuan's exact words.

372
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
I only repeated them.

373
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,610
Didn't expect Sword Deity Xueyue

374
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,410
to speak ill behind someone's back.

375
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,940
Worse,

376
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,220
the other one badmouthing me

377
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,610
seems to be here too.

378
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
A brief spar

379
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,740
is more than enough.

380
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,750
We meet again.

381
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,940
I should call you Patriarch now.

382
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,980
You flatter me.

383
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,850
Just call me Changhe,

384
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,550
much friendlier.

385
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,790
You deceived me.

386
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,330
I've decided to kill you here.

387
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,570
I never liked Changfeng's choice.

388
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,540
An outfit like Blood River

389
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,020
has no place in the jianghu.

390
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,130
With Su Muyu as Patriarch, it could stand.

391
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,880
If I took over, you'd
tear it out by the roots?

392
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,700
Looks like my reputation

393
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,780
really is that bad.

394
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,890
Your codename is your reputation:

395
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,890
the Undertaker.

396
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,849
Does the word

397
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,850
sound lucky to you?

398
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,510
The old Blood River

399
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,810
might not have needed to exist,

400
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,260
but we want to build a new Blood River.

401
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
A new Blood River?

402
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,430
One that doesn't live by killing,

403
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,330
no longer in the shadows,

404
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,740
yet walks beneath the jianghu.

405
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,460
How do you plan to change?

406
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,060
That's our affair.

407
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,350
What,

408
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,430
Xueyue City, the foremost
city of the jianghu,

409
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,070
has grown so overbearing
it won't allow

410
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,460
any other sects to exist?

411
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,560
I couldn't be bothered to meddle,

412
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
nor do I want to.

413
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,300
I only promised Changfeng.

414
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
Alright.

415
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,330
Take it as your promise to me.

416
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,310
If the Blood River to come

417
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,020
is the same as before...

418
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Su Changhe,

419
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,310
keep your head safe,

420
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
and I'll come take it.

421
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,790
What about Su Muyu's head?

422
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
You won't take his?

423
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,260
Why only mine?

424
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
I'll take his too.

425
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,980
Since you bookworm are here,

426
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,780
no need for me to linger.

427
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,220
Some person is an eyesore.

428
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,670
I'll come fight you another time.

429
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,460
Oh, she came to fight me?

430
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,350
Then let's not meet again.

431
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,310
What a fierce woman!

432
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,176
I've heard Blood River's Umbrella Ghost

433
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,130
and the Undertaker are close friends.

434
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,780
I never quite understood it.

435
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,350
You and he

436
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,980
seem to walk different paths.

437
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
But seeing you today,

438
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,170
a passage came to mind,

439
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,030
and I understand a little now.

440
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,830
What passage?

441
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,000
"Hearing snow outside the window,

442
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,650
so near, yet so far."

443
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,399
You mean the two of us

444
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,610
are close in distance,

445
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,780
yet worlds apart?

446
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,030
No.

447
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,330
The nearness and distance between you

448
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,830
depend on a single thought.

449
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,700
I hope your nearness this time

450
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
lasts till the end.

451
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
The meal's over.

452
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,830
The wine's gone.

453
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,650
She's said what needed saying.

454
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,310
I should go too.

455
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,260
Do you know why?

456
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:08,501
Back then, several family heads

457
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,570
ignored Blood River's rules,

458
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,499
yet had to seize the Dormant Dragon Sword

459
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,300
before daring to claim
the Patriarch's title.

460
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,440
There must be something
odd about the sword.

461
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,980
Something hidden in the hilt.

462
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,460
Yellow Springs Pawnshop...

463
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,300
The world's most secret bank,

464
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,370
and the most secret assassin guild...

465
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,540
What binds them?

466
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,939
All I know is,

467
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,006
the pawnshop keeps good things,

468
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,330
very, very good things,

469
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,130
worth a look.

470
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,020
We'll lead Blood River to the other shore

471
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,740
and erase its bloody reputation.

472
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,410
Stop living by the kill,

473
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,980
and found a sect in the light.

474
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,500
And the most basic, most important thing...

475
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,310
do you know what it is?

476
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,220
What?

477
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,940
Money, Su Muyu!

478
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,259
All the years of Blood River's funds

479
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,460
aren't at our base.
Then where?

480
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,520
Naturally, at Yellow Springs Pawnshop.

481
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
Then let's move.

482
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,130
Your days in Nan'an City

483
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,700
end tonight.

484
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,700
It was but a dream.

485
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,850
Dreams end.

486
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,330
I'll take the miracle physician

487
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,030
back to her room.

488
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,070
Sleeping here, she will catch a chill.

489
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
Boo!

490
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,170
So you were faking sleep.

491
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,780
I... I was asleep,

492
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,979
but something

493
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,090
reeking

494
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,890
walked in,

495
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,220
and the stench woke me.

496
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Miracle physician,

497
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
I have to go.

498
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:27,980
♪ Blades have stained my youth... ♪

499
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,510
Go on, go.

500
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,170
You've always had unfinished business.

501
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,330
This day

502
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,540
was bound to come.

503
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,850
But this place

504
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,130
is no dream.

505
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,260
It's your journey's end.

506
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,350
When you return in triumph,

507
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
this medicine shop

508
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,960
will still be here for you.

509
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,540
And all the pretty girls

510
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,460
in Nan'an City

511
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,700
will be here for you too.

512
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,590
Much obliged.

513
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,060
Come back soon...

514
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,570
and make me a proper bowl

515
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
of noodles.

516
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,070
All right.

517
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,540
♪ I'm lucky to meet you ♪

518
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,370
Reapers clear the way

519
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,700
as we reach Yellow Springs.

520
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,130
We've reached Yellow Springs,

521
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,130
so where are the Reapers?

522
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,230
Paper umbrellas ward off the yang energy.

523
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,159
The Yellow Springs reapers

524
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,460
do carry a chill,

525
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,300
creepier than Blood River.

526
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,170
Our Master sent us

527
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,860
to wait here a long time,

528
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,560
Patriarch of Blood River.

529
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,849
We've heard your Master

530
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:03,850
is most capable.

531
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,299
He even foresaw

532
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,300
we'd come here.

533
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,220
Then please, Sir,

534
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,980
and Master Su Muyu,

535
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
board the boat.

536
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,300
You must be the current Su family head,

537
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,500
Su Muyu?

538
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,780
Young master,

539
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,170
you're quite handsome.

540
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,850
Why so cold, young master?

541
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,370
Is it because

542
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,130
we're not acquainted?

543
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,650
Will you talk to me now?

544
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,850
All right, I'll stop teasing you.

545
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,430
You can change faces, Miss?

546
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,980
You sure I'm a "girl"?

547
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,090
Now I'm really confused.

548
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,310
What's your name?

549
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
They call me

550
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,809
Hongying.

[Hongying]

552

Unbelievable.

553
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,330
The Mu family can disguise too,

554
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,570
but compared to Hongying,

555
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,020
they're far behind.

556
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,220
We're the Umbrella Ghost

557
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,330
and the Undertaker.

558
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,610
Putting on spooks before us?

559
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,590
That's rich.

560
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,590
Let's go in.

561
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,640
You're the master

562
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,940
of Yellow Springs Pawnshop?

563
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,060

Forget it!

567
