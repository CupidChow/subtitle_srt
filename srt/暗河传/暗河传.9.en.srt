[Blood River]

2
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,979
[Based on the novel of the same name
from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,980
[Episode 9]

4
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,230
Sir.

5
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,230
The Dormant Dragon Sword!

6
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,040
Why is the Dormant Dragon Sword here?

7
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,020
Each Patriarch of Blood River

8
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,690
holds two Dormant Dragon Swords.

9
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,430
The two blades

10
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,940
were forged from the same meteoric iron.

11
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
The only difference is,

12
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,100
the one in my hand

13
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,170
hides Blood River's secret.

14
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,220
The other one is in your hand.

15
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,060
If Su Jinhui can truly wield it,

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,170
we'll wait until he quells

17
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,320
the turmoil in Blood River.

18
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,710
Then,

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,010
I will hand this blade

20
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
to him as well.

21
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,260
If he cannot,

22
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,820
then that sword

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,340
will fully ignite

24
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,540
the three family heads' ambitions.

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
And those men

26
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,060
will in the end

27
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,260
be consumed by their own ambition!

28
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,060
Only when they step back

29
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,610
will the more promising young

30
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,660
have a chance to rise,

31
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,870
a chance

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,220
to break free.

[Luojiuxiao Inn]

34
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,630
Given he's that smart,

35
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,940
he must know this
Fingertip Blade is missing,

36
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,290
and that I took it.

37
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
But...

38
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,190
he didn't ask for it back.

39
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
That's tacit approval.

40
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,390
Then...

41
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,700
does that make it a token of love?

42
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,390
You're awake.

43
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,990
What took you so long to get back?

44
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,690
You were gone forever.

45
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,810
I'm starving.

46
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,590
If you're fine, go down and eat.

47
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Who says I'm fine?

48
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,640
I still need someone to look after me.

49
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,220
I haven't fully recovered.

50
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
How about...

51
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,510
you feed me?

52
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,700
Why are you so nice to me today?

53
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,410
Eat properly.

54
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,830
No talking.

55
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Got it.

56
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
You...

57
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,830
you're leaving?

58
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,040
I was always going to leave.

59
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Besides,

60
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,900
you're almost healed.

61
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,250
You're here.

62
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,250
You knew I'd come?

63
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,930
You're a lot like me when I was young.

64
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,540
When you were young,

65
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,120
were you already such a piece of work?

66
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
You seem

67
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,700
to hate showing

68
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,220
your truest self.

69
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,170
Afraid of being seen through?

70
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,850
Before,

71
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,540
I kept you down,

72
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,560
and you didn't dare raise your head.

73
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,850
Now that my edge is gone,

74
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,730
do you feel

75
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,930
your chance has come?

76
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,779
Since you so enjoy

77
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,470
reading people's minds,

78
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:49,580
why not take a guess

79
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
why I came

80
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,910
and what's my plan?

81
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
You want

82
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,460
the head of the Su family.

83
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,830
Su Changhe,

84
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,700
you're merely the Nameless.

85
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,810
Nameless Su Muyu

86
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,850
has no right to inherit the Patriarch.

87
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,170
You as well

88
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,610
have no right to inherit

89
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,220
the head of the Su family.

90
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,250
So you did look down on me.

91
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,540
The title of Su family head

92
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,060
doesn't interest me.

93
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,390
What I want is something

94
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,060
Blood River has never seen done

95
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,010
in past centuries.

96
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,510
What I aim to achieve

97
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,370
is a vow

98
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,100
no one in Blood River could even imagine.

99
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
I...

100
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,300
will change Blood River.

101
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
Good.

102
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,390
Changhe,

103
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,340
your Inch Sword

104
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,940
is impressive.

105
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,530
But beating me

106
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,670
won't be easy.

107
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,010
My sword may be broken,

108
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
but I

109
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,910
am still

110
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,300
Su Jinhui.

111
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Just a declawed tiger,

112
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,750
a blind dragon,

113
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,670
nothing to worry about.

114
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Nice moves.

115
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Back then,

116
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,820
if not for the Su family's help,

117
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,340
you two would've been dead.

118
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,390
At Wailing Abyss,

119
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,720
Muyu carried me out on his back.

120
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,120
Patriarch took the strike,

121
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
and that was his choice.

122
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,180
We had no choice

123
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
entering Blood River.

124
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,940
But we'll step onto the
other shore ourselves.

125
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,270
And you...

126
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,300
is a relic of the old era.

127
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,910
You're wounded inside,

128
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
no match for us.

129
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,450
Su Changli...

130
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
The tide in Blood River

131
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,510
is turning.

132
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,010
Uncle Qiu, are you thinking

133
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,770
it'd be better if the master showed up?

134
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,399
You've run

135
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,680
so many celestial-rank missions.

136
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,220
You never move

137
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,100
without a sure win.

138
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,490
I bet

139
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,730
you've waited long for this.

140
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,490
And this time,

141
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,770
the result will be the same as always.

142
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,890
You really do know me.

143
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,420
How touching.

144
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,429
I spent six full years

145
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,000
gathering this organization.

146
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Its name...

147
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,000
is The Other Shore.

148
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,550
The Other Shore?

149
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,220
You want to change Blood River?

150
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,510
That's right.

151
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,389
Cross Blood River

152
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,590
and you reach the Other Shore.

153
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,650
There should be no endless night,

154
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,890
but light.

155
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,700
Stirring, isn't it?

156
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,200
You're one of this family,

157
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,260
raised from birth

158
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,630
as an assassin.

159
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,390
Would anyone truly choose

160
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,340
to be born

161
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,940
a tool for killing?

162
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,490
Why do others bask in sunlight

163
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,490
while our three families

164
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,730
must live in darkness?

165
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,159
Have you really never wanted

166
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
to change that?

167
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,459
When I was forced as a child

168
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,640
to learn the killing arts,

169
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,610
of course I asked those things.

170
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,980
But after all these years,

171
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,820
our hands,

172
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,340
are soaked in blood.

173
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,940
What right do we have

174
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,410
to talk of change?

175
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Exactly.

176
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,359
Though I see you

177
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,760
as a fellow traveler,

178
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,180
I didn't give you this ring.

179
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,180
Because though you're awake to it,

180
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,840
you've long lost your nerve.

181
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,390
We're different.

182
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,630
We're still young.

183
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,100
As the storybooks say,

184
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,910
we're in our prime.

185
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,560
We haven't strayed far

186
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:57,819
from the age

187
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,820
when blood runs hot.

188
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,400
We still remember

189
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:01,829
that undimmed youth's heart,

190
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,830
youth's will.

191
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,370
So long as a young heart

192
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,580
still beats in our chest,

193
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,630
we know no fear,

194
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
no regret,

195
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
no surrender.

196
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,420
Did you kill Master Su?

197
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
Uncle Qiu,

198
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,150
you're a good man.

199
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,399
In this filthy, stained

200
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,720
Blood River,
you're one of the few

201
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,700
worthy of respect.

202
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,150
The new Blood River

203
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,650
has no place for Su Jinhui.

204
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
He isn't dead.

205
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Take him and leave.

206
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,670
Live well.

207
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Maybe one day,

208
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,060
out in the jianghu,

209
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,420
you'll hear "Blood River"

210
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,030
and be surprised.

211
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
All right.

212
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,820
I'll be waiting.

213
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,150
Farewell, Uncle Qiu.

214

[Sword Qi Soars]

215
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,130
Changhe,

216
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,030
the rest of the Su disciples are secured.

217
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,980
Why not kill him?

218
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
Yeah.

219
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
Why not?

220
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,820
What's our next move?

221
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Head to the Mu family,

222
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,820
and strike when we can?

223
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,670
Where did Su Muyu go?

224
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,710
He returned to the Spider's Nest.

225
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,910
Then we'll go to the Spider's Nest.

226
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,040
Mu Ciling took the Dormant Dragon Sword.

227
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,530
It's in Mu hands now.

228
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,590
What good is the Spider's Nest then?

229
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
The Xie family

230
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,840
has already ringed the Mu compound.

231
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,280
Why don't we wait
until they bleed each other,

232
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,840
and snatch the Dormant Dragon Sword?

233
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,580
Since The Other Shore formed,

234
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,460
we've prepped for this day.

235
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,940
As our leader,

236
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,650
you shouldn't play favorites now,

237
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,650
saving your brother's life.

238
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,870
What did you say?

239
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
War is upon us.
Stay calm!

240
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,340
If you kill me,

241
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,490
what "new Blood River" is left?

242
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,100
Do you plan

243
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,139
to leave the Patriarch's position

244
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,140
to him?

245
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,130
Listen closely.

246
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,980
With Su Muyu's nature,

247
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,250
unless he's dead,

248
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,460
he'll stop at nothing

249
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,100
to run that sword down.

250
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,056
Since he chose
to return to the Spider's Nest

251
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,240
instead of chasing Mu Ciling,

252
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,500
that means

253
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:22,870
there's a problem with that sword.

254
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,730
Only a fool like Xie Ba

255
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
will fight the Mus

256
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,250
to the bitter end.

257
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,700
If you're that stupid,

258
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,870
then go and join him in death.

259
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,950
Since that's so,
the air's clear now.

260
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,270
Why make a scene?

but not him.

No means no, unless...

268
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,030
I die.

269
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,376
Wait for me at the Spider's Nest gate.

270
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400

Sir,

278
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,520
do you think

279
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,569
Su Muyu can't handle

280
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,570
the ones outside?

281

With his sword,

282

Su Muyu is unstoppable.

283
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,500
But in this world,

one man and one sword

285
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,940

call me

296

ask me, Blood River's Patriarch,

Who hired you?

Assassins don't name clients.

That's the rule.

in the Tang Clan.

318
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,699
They summoned you to Shuzhong,

319
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,700
but you refused.

320
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,420
Among the elders,

321
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,110
only he

322
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,180
stood with you.

323
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,310
I see.

324
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,700
Thanks for the reminder.

325
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,900
But I'm still here to kill you

326
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,550
to avenge him.

327
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,050
Then by all means,

328
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,700
take my life.

329
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,210
Sir,

330
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,420
you're in no shape to fight.

331
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,010
If it's Blood River business,

332
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,510
so be it.

333
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,460
But this one

334
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,490
is only my enemy.

335
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,460
So I must answer personally.

336
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,620
Besides,

337

the Twelve Zodiacs aren't his match.

Even a tiger near death

339
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,250
has its pride,

340
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,380
and a Patriarch

341
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,380
his duty.

342
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,750
No one move!

343
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,790
Stand down.

344
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,530
Show me your skill,

345
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Blossom...

346
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,830
Shower!

Someone acted before us.

348
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,750
Do we go in now?

349
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Watch and wait.

350
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,160
We'll move when Changhe returns.

351
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,720
Truly my good brother.

00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,020
You do know me.

353
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,409
Right before I do

354
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,760
the most important thing,

355
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,960
you asked to meet.

356
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
I have something for you.

357
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,250
If I may choose,

358
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,880
I hope it's the Dormant Dragon Sword.

359
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,330
Go to Tianqi City.

360
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,960
Set foot there

361
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,610
and someone will come for you.

362
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,280
With your skill,

363
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,810
you can slip past them

364
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,880
and reach where your secret lies.

365
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,910
Give these keys

366
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,250
to the one who guards your secret.

367
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,090
He will open the boxes

368
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,650
meant for you

369
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,410
and Su Changhe.

370
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,030
From then on,

371
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,330
your names

372
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,980
within Blood River

373
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,050
will be erased forever.

374
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Also,

375
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,420
the secret you seek,

376
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,570
the fall of No-Sword City,

377
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,860
is inside.

378
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,530
Is that truly what you want?

379
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,830
To leave Blood River

380
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,270
and claim real freedom.

381
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,750
You fought so hard
to shield the Patriarch

382
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,940
just for these two keys?

383
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,090
The three families' chaos is beyond repair.

384
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,640
We can dissolve Blood River in the turmoil.

385
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,700
Then we gain freedom

386
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,679
and everyone

387
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
gets a choice.

388
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,770
So that was your plan.

389
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,140
Use their infighting

390
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,700
to drain the power-seekers,

391
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
and finally,

392
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:16,980
leave Blood River

393
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:18,640
with those who think like you.

394
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,450
Su Muyu.

395
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,530
You're sharper than I thought.

396
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
But...

397
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,860
I have a gift

398
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,350
for you too.

399
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,350
The Other Shore?

400
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,750
Cross Blood River

401
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,230
and you reach the Other Shore.

402
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
There should be

403
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
no endless night,

404
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,860
but light.

405
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,470
Remember back then,

406
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,530
when we finished a mission

407
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,290
and passed the Canglan River,

408
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,569
you stared at the water

409
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,570
and asked me

410
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,590
a question:

411
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,010
when would we reach the Other Shore?

412
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,050
I want to tell you now:

413
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,790
it's tonight.

414
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
But this night

415
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,570
will be Blood River's night of blood.

416
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,180
Blood is where change begins.

417
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Su Muyu,

418
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,900
you're too kind.

419
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,620
Everyone has a bottom line.

420
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,010
Yours is even higher than my ceiling.

421
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,120
It vexes me,

422
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,180
and has for years.

423
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,070
If you still mean to stop me,

424
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,660
then let's fight.

425
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,640
Winner calls it.

426
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
If you win,

427
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,120
I'll dissolve Blood River with you.

428
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,830
If I win,

429
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,326
you'll walk with me to the other shore.

430
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,350
Changhe,

431
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,770
no one knows you better than I do.

432
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,140
You may lead Blood River to the light,

433
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,730
but your ambition

434
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,090
will also drive many into the abyss.

435
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,600
And Blood River

436
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:24,180
is not as simple as you think.

437
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,360
Behind the Patriarch and
the Soul Reapers' Hall,

438
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,980
there's a stronger hand.

439
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,350
Stronger?

440
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Yes.

441
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,240
Even if we become

442
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,250
Patriarch and head of the Su family,

443
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,700
we won't rule it all.

444
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,570
Even the Patriarch

445
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,700
is just a blade in someone else's hand.

446
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,440
If we can found a new Blood River,

447
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,070
then that Blood River

448
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,400
belongs only to the two of us.

449
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,790
That hidden hand

450
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,860
and those stubborn family heads

451
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,840
will be cut down in the end.

452
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,550
Su Muyu,

453
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,380
when did you grow so timid?

454
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,110
To stand against them,

455
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,830
many will die,

456
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,050
and the price will be heavy.

457
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I want them

458
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,290
to survive.

459
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
As you said,

460
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,810
I'm an ambitious man.

461
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
Unlike you,

462
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,570
a free spirit.

463
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Su Muyu,

464
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,490
we've always walked

465
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,550
different paths!

466
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,400
You say you'll be a good man
in Blood River.

467
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
That's naive.

468
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,810
Those you won't kill, I'll kill.

469
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,889
The sins you won't bear,

470
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,890
I'll bear.

471
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,270
Even if you want to leave Blood River,

472
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,860
I'll pave the road for you.

473
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,570
But if you die,

474
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,220
I won't see you off,

475
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,230
even if they call me the Undertaker.

476
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,180
Do you remember

477
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,490
what I told you

478
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,270
when we escaped Wailing Abyss?

479
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,050
If you're strong enough,

480
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,310
you earn the right to be naive.

481
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,310
And now,

482
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,860
aren't I naive in my own way?

483
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Sword Deity Xueyue,

484
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,360
what do you think?

485
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
City Lord Li.

486
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,990
Long time no see,

487
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,110
Su Muyu.

488
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,590
My junior says

489
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,940
a new Patriarch in Blood River

490
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,140
will shake the jianghu,

491
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,530
so he invited me to judge.

492
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
He says

493
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,200
you're the best choice

494
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,290
for Patriarch.

495
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,240
Once I kill Mu Mingce,

496
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,550
take the Dormant Dragon Sword,

497
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,120
and unite the three families,

498
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,680
he'll take it, want it or not.

499
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
I believe you.

500
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,360
Cruel as you can be,

501
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,140
you keep your word.

502
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
You've got a good eye.

503
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,510
Hold him off for me.

504
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,830
I'll handle business.

505
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,140
But now I see

506
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,250
an even better end.

507
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,830
What?

508
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,760
What Su Muyu said:

509
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,480
dissolve Blood River.

510
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,990
A jianghu without Blood River

511
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,570
is truly best.

512
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
Excellent.

513
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Trouble at the Nest.

514
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,350
Changhe,

515
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
your men acted?

516
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,020
Without me,

517
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,310
they wouldn't dare.

518
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,110
It was Tang Lianyue.

519
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,090
He's got his own vendetta.

520
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,620
Skywrath Thunder!

521
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,810
Shame the sky's clear tonight,

522
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,570
or I'd call lightning down,

523
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,550
and Sir,

524
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,220
you'd already be dead.

525
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,310
Sir.

526
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,940
A blade is forged by grinding,

527
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,010
and plum scent by bitter cold.

528
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,140
That poison

529
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,420
has one distinct trait:

530
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,530
a resilience

531
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,810
like the plum blossom.

532
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,680
Even with antidote,

533
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,860
if you stir inner force too soon,

534
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,290
it'll surge back.

535
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,710
Looks like
the poison has relapsed.

536
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
No need for me to strike,

537
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,380
you'll die soon anyway.

538
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,330
Freshly cured,

539
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
after this fight,

540
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,470
not even deities can save you.

541
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,110
In that case,

542
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,730
I'll take my leave.

543
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,270
Sir, fare well

544
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,570
on your way to the Underworld.

545
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,250
Sir,

546
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,660
we must treat it now.

547
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
No need.

548
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,040
I can feel

549
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,180
my end is near.

550
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,160
Even an immortal

551
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,090
can't reverse it.

552
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,510
Miracle physician,

553
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,380
is there any other way?

554
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,870
Freshly cleared of poison,

555
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,640
he shouldn't have stirred the inner force.

556
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,470
He could've lived a few more years.

557
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
But just now...

558
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,580
No need to blame yourself.

559
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,810
My sins run deep.

560
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,460
Even in the Underworld,

561
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,660
before Yama,

562
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,380
he'd judge me

563
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,810
beyond saving.

564
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,110
Sir...

565
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,510
Muyu,

566
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,030
Changhe,

567
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,570
come with me.

568
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,140
I have words for you.

569
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
The rest of you,

570
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,970
wait here.

571
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Understood.

572
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,510
Muyu,

573
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,800
I always thought

574
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,980
you risked everything to protect me

575
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,530
because of the Life-Death Contract.

576
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,270
What contract?

577
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,310
No matter.

578
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
It's already undone.

579
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,620
I used to think

580
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,260
the world had cast me aside,

581
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,950
until the day I learned

582
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,400
you'd already cured
the Life-Death Contract.

583
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,420
I suddenly realized

584
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,330
I'd underestimated you

585
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,250
and myself.

586
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,050
These years, I stayed by you

587
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,030
because I believed

588
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,860
you were worth guarding.

589
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Good.

590
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Very good.

591
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,940
When I was young,

592
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,810
Kewen and I were like brothers,

593
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,700
like you and Changhe.

594
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,510
Later, fighting for
the Patriarch's position,

595
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,570
I lost much.

596
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,900
And Kewen alone

597
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,000
came to this Spider's Nest.

598
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,940
I thought

599
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,940
he'd abandoned me too,

600
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,160
yet in the end

601
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,550
he gave his life

602
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,430
to save me.

603
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,590
Sadly,

604
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
some things

605
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,550
don't change,

606
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,270
ever.

607
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Muyu,

608
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,210
you have your own plan, don't you?

609
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,290
Your ultimate aim

610
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,290
is to dissolve Blood River,

611
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,310
right?

612
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,110
Yes.

613
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,220
If I leave alone,

614
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,680
those of the Spider Shadow
won't meet a good end.

615
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,710
I don't want them

616
00:33:38,711 --> 00:33:39,980
living in killing every day.

617
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,030
Only by disbanding Blood River

618
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,420
can they gain real freedom,

619
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,130
live like ordinary folk

620
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,460
and walk in the sun.

621
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,460
If Blood River scatters like rain,

622
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,090
no matter how strong those powers are,

623
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,380
it won't matter.

624
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,110
And you,

625
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
Changhe?

626
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,490
You want to command Blood River

627
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
to change it,

628
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
right?

629
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,740
There's much I want to change.

630
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,820
This is only a start.

631
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,380
I can hand you this sword,

632
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,130
though I'd rather

633
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,530
give it to Muyu.

634
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,300
When I was young,

635
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,650
I thought as you do.

636
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,570
But for now,

637
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,340
you don't yet know.

638
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,160
The cause you seek to achieve

639
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,490
will be far harder

640
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,300
than you imagine.

641
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,690
The ones you must defeat

642
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,490
aren't just Su Jinhui,

643
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,130
nor only me,

644
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,110
but ones stronger than us

645
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,190
and many times more fearsome.

646
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,090
Together, Su Muyu and I

647
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,370
have yet to lose.

648
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,940
The Soul Reapers' Hall

649
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,070
isn't worth a mention.

650
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,870
The Soul Reapers' Hall

651
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,610
is only a puppet

652
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,050
they planted in Blood River.

653
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,050
For centuries,

654
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,710
all know

655
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,439
Blood River is the most fearsome

656
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,330
under heaven.

657
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,540
But the truth of it

658
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,010
is hid even from its

659
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,030
own killers

660
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,940
Then what is the true face

661
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
of Blood River?

662
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,310
The truth

663
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,840
can't be told in a few words.

664
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,190
The secret hides

665
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,740
in the secret passage in my room.

666
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,380
After I'm gone,

667
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,860
you're free to see it.

668
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,780
But even if you don't,

669
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,440
when you finally wield

670
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,110
this Dormant Dragon Sword,

671
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,420
they'll come for you.

672
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,230
The sword's here.

673
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,610
I leave it to you two.

674
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Sir...

675
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,030
Muyu,

676
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,270
I've always felt this way.

677
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,650
Since I became Patriarch,

678
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,710
I held

679
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:51,520
Blood River's highest power

680
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,120
and glory.

681
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,509
But I was like a ghost

682
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,690
cast aside by the three families.

683
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,300
Only days ago,

684
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,420
seeing Kewen die for me,

685
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,190
seeing you

686
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,090
choose to shield me

687
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,090
even after my poison was cleared,

688
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,230
did I realize

689
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,300
I was never alone.

690
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
Muyu,

691
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,530
thanks for staying by my side

692
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,320
all these years.

693
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,430
If not for your kindness back then,

694
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,420
the two of us

695
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,030
would never have left Wailing Abyss.

696
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,550
Back then,

697
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,340
I only meant to use

698
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,010
the strength you two had.

699
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Your original aim,

700
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,880
our ending,

701
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,400
and the final choice,

702
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,460
they're not the same thing.

703
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,870
I learned skills in Blood River,

704
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,030
and how to be a man from my father.

705
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,550
My father taught me

706
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,090
loyalty comes first.

707
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,740
Loyalty...

708
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,980
When I was young,

709
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,860
I also wanted to found

710
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,300
a different Blood River.

711
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,530
But later I found

712
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,860
I was turning

713
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,300
into one of them.

714
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,320
And you,

715
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,510
Su Muyu,

716
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,050
you're someone

717
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,090
who never changes.

718
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,190
Leave.

719
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
Leave.

720
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Once you're gone,

721
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,380
I'll set a great fire

722
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,980
and burn myself and this Nest

723
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,690
to ash.

724
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,110
Say no more.

725
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,980
This is my choice.

726
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
Sir...

727
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,190
may you find bliss beyond.

728
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,260
I thought you'd urge me

729
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,130
to seek the miracle physician again.

730
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,170
Everyone has

731
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
their choice.

732
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,230
And every choice

733
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,380
has its meaning.

734
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,900
I'll surely fall into hell,

735
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,130
so I hope

736
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,380
we never meet again.

737
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,260
It's been a while. No action yet?

738
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,030
Could the boss have...

739
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,260
Someone's heading in.

740
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,900
Changhe said, wait for his word.

741
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,940
Then whatever happens,

742
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,050
we don't act on our own.

743
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
In this world,

744
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,130
you're the only one

745
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,510
I'll give this sword to.

746
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
Honestly, I think

747
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,570
you'll find it easier

748
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,590
to win support.

749
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,570
The Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow

750
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,670
can die for you, after all.

751
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,900
While The Other Shore lot

752
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,420
only draw steel on me.

753
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,570
As we agreed:

754
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
you be Patriarch,

755
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,270
and I'll head the Su family.

756
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Figures.

757
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,840
Even if I yield to you,
you still won't take it.

758
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,980
Every moment

759
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,300
you want to leave this place,

760
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,730
cut ties with Blood River.

761
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,040
Why do you insist on staying?

762
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,570
Because not everyone

763
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,160
is wantless like you.

764
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,740
Some want to be heroes,

765
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,170
some, knights-errant.

766
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,490
Some want

767
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:42,930
great wealth,

768
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,340
some want a famous name.

769
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,400
Blood River is strong.

770
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,950
Together,

771
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,940
we can make and change so much.

772
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I have ambition,

773
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,650
and they have desires.

774
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,990
Better than wandering the world,

775
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,300
grip the sword in your hand

776
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:00,980
and fight to the end

777
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,340
against those bad guys

778
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,260
who'd rule our fate.

779
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,940
Well said!

780
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,610
Kill them all,

781
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,940
and you'll purge this poison for me?

782
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,630
Yes.

783
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,340
They're the Su family's

784
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,570
two strongest:

785
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,900
Su Muyu

786
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,980
and Su Changhe.

787
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
You're Water Official

788
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,360
of the Soul Reapers' Hall?

789
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,420
Your speech just now was well put.

790
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,420
Only a pity.

791
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,190
What's the pity?

792
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
A pity...

793
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,380
you aren't the one we chose.

794
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
Don't worry.

795
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,710
I won't step in.

796
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,480
As one of the Three Officials,

797
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,420
I prefer to watch

798
00:42:45,421 --> 00:42:47,440
from the sidelines.

799
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,260
Strong as you are,

800
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,570
you still won't

801
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,860
be a match for Mu Ciling.

802
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,690
I disagree with much

803
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,900
of what Changhe said,

804
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,380
but one thing

805
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
was no empty talk:

806
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,010
together, the two of us

807
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,860
have never lost.

808
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,040
