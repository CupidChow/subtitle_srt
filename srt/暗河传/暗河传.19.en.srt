5
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,130
So this is a pharmacy too?

6
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,210
Which master is in charge here?

7
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,070
Me.

8
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
Who is she?

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
You?

10
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,390
Young lady,

11
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,286
get inside and help your
master grind the herbs.

12
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,470
Stop making trouble out here.

13
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,540
May I ask, sir,

14
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,320
if your Fengmen point aches faintly

15
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,740
around 3 to 5 a.m. each day?

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
How did you know?

17
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,570
It must be from hard labor

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,690
when I was young,

19
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,060
so now I suffer.

20
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,430
That makes sense.

21
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,710
Then why does your Baihui point

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,170
throb without stopping

23
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,780
from 9 to 11 p.m.?

24
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,820
You did farm work back then,

25
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,910
but surely

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,440
you didn't damage your head doing it.

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,610
Hey...

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,130
If you leave this untreated,

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,010
I'm afraid

30
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,520
you'll be meeting the King of Hell.

31
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,910
Every word is spot-on!

32
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Spot-on!

33
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,630
This physician is amazing!
You're a real miracle physician!

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,446
I've sought help for years,

35
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,670
spent so much time and effort,

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,610
all to cure

37
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,660
this body of mine.

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,450
But,

39
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,216
though I've had plenty of prescriptions,

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,340
nothing has helped.

41
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,990
Miracle physician, save me!

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,340
Please, save me!

43
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,450
You said you did manual work

44
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,630
when you were young.

45
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,820
After that,

46
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,030
did you rinse off?

47
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,590
Of course.

48
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,330
The well water there

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
is ice-cool.

50
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,750
After the heavy work,

51
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,890
I'd pour it over my head.

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,060
That felt great.

53
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,450
There it is.

54
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,290
Hot and cold colliding,

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,820
yin and yang clashing.

56

It's not an external illness,

57
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,560
but you hurt your insides.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,500
I'll write you a prescription.

59
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,630

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,410

76

Can you charge me less?

80

No consult fee.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Half off the medicine.

Muyu, you're a sword deity!

How's that comparable?

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,310
Would a sword deity

179
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,160
use his blade to slice watermelon?

180
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,410
I'll go cook for you.

181
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Su Muyu.

182
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
Miracle physician,

183
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,870
I've made a decision.

184
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,430
I'm taking a long trip.

185
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,390
Some things

186
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,890
need to be settled.

187
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
If not,

188
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,700
they'll be a knot in the heart.

189
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,730
Even if

190
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,340
you're happy

191
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
most days,

192
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,630
once you think of that hurdle,

193
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,900
your smile just vanishes.

194
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,430
Go!

195
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,730
As long as

196
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,460
you don't risk your life,

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
it's fine.

198
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,270
Thank you.

199
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,550
Since I've learned the hidden past,

200
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,300
I should do something for my family.

201
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,850
Yours isn't a killer's sword.

202
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,600
It's a sword that seeks justice.

203
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,100
Think it through.

204
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,220
From now on, be a swordsman,

205
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,820
not a killer.

206
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,670
At least...

207
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,890
for the time being,

208
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,580
I want a new role

209
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,910
to seek an answer.

210
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
What role?

211
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,870
Young master

212
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
of No-Sword City.

213
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,250
And what answer?

214
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,950
Wushuang City is peerless under heaven.

215
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,980
But in the Way of the Sword,

216
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,940
it can't claim "peerless"

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
before No-Sword City.

218
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,270
I see.

219
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,750
You want to...

220
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,630
challenge

221
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,390

[Song Yanhui of Wushuang City]

Yushu.

224
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,490
Are seeds really that tasty?

225
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Master,

226
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,580
is sword practice that fun?

227
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,890
Sword practice isn't fun.

228
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,340
But I've trained since I was little.

229
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
If one day

230
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,180
I'm not allowed to train,

231
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,130
I'll feel

232
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,340
life has no meaning.

233
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,390
Master,

234
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,580
when will you start teaching me?

235
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,400
You're dropping the seeds?

236
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,670
No rush.

237
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,010
You're born gifted.

238
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,670
Every bit of carving

239
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
is critical.

240
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,650
My master once told me,

241
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,490
I was born for the sword.

242
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,340
I've trained hard for decades,

243
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,390
yet...

244
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,650
Li Hanyi, who came after me,

245
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,820
has become the Xueyue Sword Deity,

246
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,300
while I'm still stuck.

247
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,650
I'm running out of time.

248
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Master,

249
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,490
you come to the lake every day

250
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,460
but do nothing.

251
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
Is there

252
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,980
some treasure in the lake?

253
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Yes.

254
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,750
Master,

255
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,030
what's this?

256
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,910
This is the most precious treasure

257
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,060
of our Wushuang City,

258
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
the Peerless Sword Coffer.

259
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,100
Inside this case

260
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,240
are thirteen famed swords.

261
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,700
One is called Daming Vermilion Bird.

262
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,560
In the Register of Famous Swords,

263
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,750
it ranks second.

264
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
If it's "peerless",

265
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,630
why isn't it first?

266
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,300
First is the Emperor's sword.

267
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,160
Daming Vermilion Bird is
the martial world's sword,

268
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,190
so it dares to claim "peerless".

269
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,870
Master.

270
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,150
Master,

271
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
where's the sword?

272
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
So it is.

273
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,560
I've trained for thirty years.

274
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,510
Today,

275
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,010
I tried opening it for the first time.

276
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,460
But in the end,

277
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,550
I wasn't the one it chose.

278
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Heaven wills it.

279
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Can't we

280
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,420
just open the coffer?

281
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
The coffer has a spirit.

282
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,670
Only when it meets the one it accepts

283
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,870
will it open and yield a blade.

284
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,670
Let me try.

285
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,880
But you've never trained with a sword.

286
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,850
Precisely because I haven't.

287
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,010
Maybe this coffer

288
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,340
likes a blank slate.

289
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,270
All right.

290
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Master,

291
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
this sword...

292
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
is so beautiful!

293
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,340
This is the Peerless Coffer's

296
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,510
just now, the coffer

297
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,700
really opened for me!

Yushu!

299
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,419

[Liu Yunqi of Wushuang City]
Wushuang City

301
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,340
can still be peerless.

304
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,410
Did the coffer open earlier?

305
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,690
Was it me who opened it?

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,370
Let me tell you a story.

307
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,790
Come.

308
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,100
When I was young,

309
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,710
I once loosed a sword strike.

310
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
That stroke

311
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,580
pierced the clouds

312
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,490
and burned red like dusk.

313
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,250
Even the southbound swallows

314
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,770
turned to look back.

After that, my master

316

to Song Yanhui.

Today,

319
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,730
I'll give you a new name too, okay?

320

321
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,420
What will you name me?

322
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,910
From now on,

323
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,880
you'll be called Wushuang.

324

Wushuang?

325
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
What about my surname?

326
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
No need for one.

327

Just Wushuang.

328
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,420
Hereafter when people
think of the Peerless Coffer,

329

and speak of Wushuang City,

330
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,650
it will be because of you.

331

Because

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
you are Wushuang.

You will achieve

335
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,340
what I could not.

336
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,010
All right.
Master.

337
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,950
I'll be Wushuang from now on!

338
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
Good.

339
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,770
I won't be gone long.

340
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,670
I'll be back soon.

341
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,250
You made so much food.

342
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,030
I really can't take it on the road.

343
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,180

I'll take care of them.

346
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,130
I'd go with you,

347
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,220
but,

348
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,390

my identity at your side

351

would spoil the scene.

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
If he can't carry,

353
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
I'll handle.

354
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,950
Like you'd get the chance!

355
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
What's this?

356
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,589
I sent people to fetch it

357
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,990
from Villa of Famed Swords.

358
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,800
If you're challenging Wushuang City,

359
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,250
you'll need a fine blade.

360
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
She's right.

361
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,900
To keep your cover,

362
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,560
you can't use your umbrella sword,

363
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,090
nor a cheap iron one

364
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,900
you can buy anywhere.

365
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,620
This blade is called Crane Feather.

366
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Crane as in white crane.

367
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Feather as in plume.

368
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,140
Win at Wushuang City with it,

369
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,830
and your name will spread.

370
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Consider it

371
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,900
as also making a name for me.

372
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,390
This must be pricey, right?

373
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,790
You bet.

374
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,620
It cost our clinic

375
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,050
three months' earnings.

376
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,550
This pricey gift

377
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,030
truly says a lot about your feelings.

378
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,490
Not bad.

379
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,290
I've got great taste.

380
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,510
A fine sword

381
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,830
and a beauty,

382
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,110
what a pair!

383
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,090
Besides,

384
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,290
one more item for you.

385
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,510
What's this?

386
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,940
It's my little pet.

387
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,310
Lend it to you for protection.

388
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,940
Take good care of it.

389
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,510
All right.

390
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,070
I won't let you down.

391
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,660
Looking at you now,

392
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,420
you do seem a roaming hero!

393
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,350
Maybe

394
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,420
he was meant to be one.

395
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
He's leaving.

396
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,290
So shouldn't you

397
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
head home too?

398
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,980
You're kicking me out already?

399
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,880
Well, it can't be helped.
I do need to go.

400
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,566
Those so-called "family"
back in Blood River

401
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,710
are nothing compared to you.

402
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,670
They're not reliable at all.

403
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,900
Enough talk.

404
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,810
While everyone's still here,

405
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,246
let's polish off these pastries

406
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,270
together.

407
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,750
You can't finish them anyway.

408
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,290
Stake more!

409
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,010
Rest easy.

410
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,700
You'll all come out ahead.

411
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,780
[Tianxia House]

412
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Sir, right this way.

413
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,110
Boy, take the horse.

414
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Coming!

415
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
This way, honored guest.

416
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,570
Our Tianxia House

417
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,999
can't match the fame

418
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,010
of Thousand-Gold Tower in Tianqi City,

419
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,810
Beauty Manor in Sangu City,

420
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,590
or Xiaoyao City of
Qingzhou's Hundred Cities.

421
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,770
We rank last of the Four Great Casinos.

422
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,670
Besides,

423
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,700
unlike the other three

424
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,860
that serve

425
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,770
nobles and merchants,

426
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,270
our Tianxia House

427
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,220
mostly hosts

428
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,720
folk of the martial world.

429
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,810
That's the biggest difference.

430
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,140
Because

431
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,330
behind Tianxia House

432
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,810
stands

433
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,290
the famed city of arms,

434
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,090
the peerless Wushuang City.

435
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,270
Wushuang City...

436
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,380
You wish to reach Wushuang City?

437
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Yes.

438
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,770
But to enter,

439
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,700
you need a Wushuang Token.

440
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Right.

441
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,180
Ten li from here,

442
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,380
there's only one road

443
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,730
with a dozen checkpoints.

444
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,900
Each one checks your token

445
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,180
before you pass.

446
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
But...

447
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,770
that token's hard to get.

448
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
A friend said

449
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,570
there's a way here.

450
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,490
Naturally.

451
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,860
Name your price.

452
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,250
This is Tianxia House.

453
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,900
Nothing here

454
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,350
is sold.

455
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,860
Only...

456
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,570
gambled.

457
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,180
You need to wager

458
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,090
something valuable you have.

459
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,140
Win,

460
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:25,180
you take the token.

461
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,830
Lose,

462
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,010
your stake stays behind.

463
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,810
I'll bet.

464
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,090
- Big! - Small!

465
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,630
Very well!

466
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
This way, sir.

467
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,550
Here

468
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,250
is your table.

469
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,490
I'm no gambler.

470
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,460
But since I'm here,

471
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,140
I'll follow the house rules.

472
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,290
I have a 1,000-tael note.

473
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,070
Will that do?

474
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,050
As I said,

475
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,810
you must stake

476
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,980
something precious.

477
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,110
A banknote

478
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,290
plainly isn't it.

479
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,490
What we want is...

480
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
that stuff.

481
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,070
Sorry.

482
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,840
This sword means a lot to me.

483
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,680
I do have a Dragon's Tear Pearl.

484
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,490
Would that count as rare?

485
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,700
Dragon's Tear Pearl...

486
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,810
It's said

487
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,810
this bead holds great power.

488
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,460
If one cultivates inner skill

489
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,940
wearing it day and night,

490
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,900
in half a year,

491
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,860
his body will undergo

492
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,810
marvelous changes.

493
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
Good eye, sir.

494
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,290
It is a fine piece.

495
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,750
Worth the wager.

496
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,980
How do you want to bet?

497
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,660
Tianxia House rules:

498
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,730
the guest decides.

499
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,530
We offer table games and beast bouts.

500
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,330
Which will you choose?

501
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
Are table games

502
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,090
the ones downstairs?

503
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,110
Yes.

504
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,620
Dominoes, Madiao Cards,
Big/Small, and Cover-and-Guess.

505
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,530
And beast bouts

506
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,770
are our house's

507
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,140
signature specialty:

508
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,900
cockfights, dogfights, cricketfights,

509
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,180
and horse, pigeon, and dog races.

510
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,660
Take your pick.

511
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,430
Do you offer spider fights?

512
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,330
Eight-eyed wolf spiders.

513
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,770
Well informed, sir.

514
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,510
Then,

515
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,900
which one will you back?

516
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,420
Must I choose one from them?

517
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
Unless

518
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,530
there's another option.

519
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I have a spider too.

520
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,050
I'll pit it against both.

521
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,030
If it wins,

522
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,510
I win.

523
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,070
How about it?

524
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,140
Eight-eyed wolf spider

525
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,810
is no common spider.

526
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,010
Your box

527
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,770
is barely half the size

528
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,940
of a wolf spider's.

529
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,810
How can one beat two?

530
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,180
Sir,

531
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,290
aren't you overconfident?

532
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
Then let's try.

533
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,290
Settled.

534
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,380
Hey, out.

535
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
What's this?

536
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,590
Go.

537
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,830
Oh...

538
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,090
This is a White-Ghost Spider!

539
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,980
The very one of legend

540
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,980
that can take on a hundred!

541
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
Then I won

542
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,810
the Wushuang Token, right?

543
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,040
You carry a peerless sword,

544
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,370
bear a Dragon's Tear Pearl,

545
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,780
and casually produce

546
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,350
a rare White-Ghost Spider.

547
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,050
Your birth must be uncommon.

548
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,980
With such standing,

549
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,050
why come to my house

550
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,720
for a Wushuang Token?

551
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
What's your aim

552
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
visiting here today?

553
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,510
I won.

554
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,900
Give me the token.

555
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,660
I followed your rules,

556
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,900
so please

557
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,570
follow yours.

558
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,859
Fine...

559
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,530
I'll take you to it.

560
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,070
Much obliged.

561
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,220
[Lord Haoyue of Tianxia House]

562
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
This way.

563
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Master.

564
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,050
It's been ages

565
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,330
since anyone came in here.

566
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,810
I won at Tianxia House,

567
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,660
so I should get the token.

568
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,110
Yes.

569
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,010
The token is already yours.

570
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,390
But guests of your skill
are rare indeed.

571
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,490
Our house wishes

572
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,940
to know you better.

573
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Do those behind the wall

574
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,620
wish to know me too?

575
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,490
As I expected,

576
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,620
you were really

577
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
extraordinary.

578
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,790
As I said,

579
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,590
the token

580
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,180
is already yours.

581
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,350
I'll take my leave.

582
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
As you wish.

583
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,310
Hero, wait!

584
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Please wait!

585
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,510
Please wait!

586
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,240
What is it?

587
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,460
If someone stops you on the way,

588
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
just say

589
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,376
you ordered a Soul-Chasing Crossbow

590
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,700
from Yuexia Smithy in Wushuang City,

591
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,660
and you're here to pick it up.

592
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,790
Got it.

593
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,070
Poison on it.

594
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
What do you mean?

595
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,050
Planning a mutiny, are you?

596
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,420
I'm your Patriarch.

597
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,440
Careful.
He isn't poisoned.

598
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,360
What about Yumo and Changli?

599
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
Those who back you

600
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
have all been poisoned

601
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,420
and are now confined.

602
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,660
Su Luandan did this, didn't he?

603
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,140
I really underestimated him.

604
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
Eat your fill!

605
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,530
Okay!

606
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,380
In this heat, watermelon hits the spot!

607
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
Come share some!

608
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
But we have to...

609
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,310
No one is coming.

610
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,480
Get over here.
Eat with us.

611
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,750
Quick!

612
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Today, eat all you want.

613
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,050
As much as you like, hear me?

614
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,080
Get me another slice.
So sweet.

615
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,310
Misters.

616
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,030
Misters!

617
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,190
This melon's really sweet!

618
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Yeah.

619
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,510
Sure is!

620
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,460
This watermelon

621
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,570
was brought all the way

622
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,770
from Nan'an City.

623
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
So, eat up.

624
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,790
Halt!

625
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Who are you?

626
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,660
Daring breach Wushuang City's checkpoint?

627
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,440
Apologies.

628
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,490
You looked too busy to notice me just now,

629
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,750
so I took the liberty.

630
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,680
I have a Wushuang Token.

631
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,570
[Wushuang] I'm here

632
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,006
because I ordered a Soul-Chasing Crossbow

633
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,470
from Yuexia Smithy in Wushuang City.

634
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,050
I came to pick it up.

635
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,750
Not right.

636
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,350
What's not right?

637
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,030
Show the token first,

638
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,610
then step forward.

639
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,010
As it stands,

640
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,529
you passed three horse-lengths

641
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,530
before showing the token.

642
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,010
Out of order.

643
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
My apologies.

644
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
I'd like to pass now.

645
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,110
May I?

646
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,510
Can a dead man

647
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
still stand up?

648
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,590
Can a tree made into a boat

649
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,830
be planted back?

650
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,120
Can rice boiled to porridge

651
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
turn back to fried rice?

652
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,839
- No! - No!

653
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,490
Exactly!

654
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,840
No good!

655
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,460
Then, mister,

656
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,480
how should it be?

657
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,620
These three horse-lengths,

658
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,570
one thousand taels each.

659
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,180
Three horse-lengths,

660
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,040
that's three thousand total.

661
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
You're joking.

662
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,870
That Soul-Chasing Crossbow

663
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,860
isn't worth three thousand taels.

664
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,090
Even if I need it,

665
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,250
I wouldn't make

666
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,490
such a losing deal.

667
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,290
Wushuang City's famous across the land.

668
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,870
It's surely not short
of three thousand taels.

669
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Wushuang City isn't,

670
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
but I am!

671
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,250
Besides, you're veiled,

672
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,220
and won't even show your real face.

673
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
How do I know

674
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,050
what intent hides under that veil?

675
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Sorry.

676
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,200
I've had a strange illness since childhood.

677
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,250
My face can't be in sunlight,

678
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,470
or it breaks out in red sores.

679
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,460
So I travel veiled.

680
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,350
Please understand.

681
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
All right then.

682
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
Out of pity,

683
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
three hundred taels.

684
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,980
Not a coin less!

685
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,550
Hand it over!

686
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Move along.

687
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,290
We've struck gold this time.

688
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,709
- Sure have, look at that. - Come on.

689
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,710
Split it with me.

690
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Wait!

691
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
What now?

692
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,900
You sighed just now.

693
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,960
What was that about?

694
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,840
I just felt sorry for you.

695
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,250
Wushuang City, once No.1 under heaven,

696
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,750
sets up all these checkpoints

697
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,940
just to squeeze travelers.

698
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,730
I've long admired

699
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,790
Wushuang City's renown.

700
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
But this experience today

701
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
really disappointed me.

702
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,110
"Once"?

703
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,550
Kid,

704
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,069
Wushuang City has always

705
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,210
been the top power.

706
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,900
Spouting nonsense here,

707
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,200
you're not afraid to die?

708
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,050
These days in the jianghu,

709
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,980
No.1 is Xueyue City.

710
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,780
That's not just

711
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
my opinion.

712
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,260
If you think Wushuang City is stronger,

713
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
then tell me,

714
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,740
who beat Ye Dingzhi by half a palm

715
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,010
and saved the realm?

716
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,740
Which of today's Five Sword Deities

717
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,610
is named after a city?

718
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,300
Who is the No.1 Spear Deity?

719
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,320
None of them hail from Wushuang City.

720
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,420
So why call Wushuang City No.1?

721
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
You brat...

722
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Sitong,

723
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,670
return his banknote.

724
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Senior...

725
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
Return it!
But...

726
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
Here.

727
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,230
Take it!

728
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
You're right.

729
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,100
Doing this is shameful.

730
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,550
However,

731
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,820
you insulted Wushuang City.

732
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,980
I can't let it slide.

733
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,460
Dare face me in a bout?

734
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,820
From Tianxia House to here,

735
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,130
Wushuang City has let me down.

736
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,860
So much I'd rather leave now.

737
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,740
Looks like without a lesson,

738
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,490
you'll never learn!

739
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,740
Heavenly Pass Spear!

740
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,030
Senior, no!

741
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,720
