[Episode 23]

5
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:39,850
Go.

6
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,980
I heard

7
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,460
they're even stronger than those

8
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,210
of the Five Poisons Sect.

9
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,770
I've seen Wen Hujiu's Five Poisons.

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,330
His centipedes

11
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,730
had two heads.

12
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,050
What array is this?

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,660
The Five-Poison Array.

14
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,300
Ordinarily,

15
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,380
it's used to trap people,

16
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,570
penning them inside,

17
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,360
then unleashing the venoms.

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,220
It's our Wen clan's secret art,

19
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,450
not taught outside.

20
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,540
You're flipping it now

21
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,690
to isolate this floral poison?

22
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,820
That's right.

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,980
A toxin spread across the whole city...

24
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,340
I've never heard of it.

25
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,850
To pull off poisoning technique like this,

26
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,940
only three people alive could.

27
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,100
First that comes to mind

28
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,890
is the Wen clan head,

29
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,220
Wen Hujiu.

30
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,660
My uncle's poisons

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,780
truly top the world.

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,670
Three generations up,

33
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,020
three down,

34
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,940
you won't find his equal,

35
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,170
a genius of poisoning technique.

36
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,910
But he's allied

37
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,770
with Xueyue City,

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,060
and would never meddle

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,380
in Wushuang City's mess.

40
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,100
Besides,

41
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,130
this poison

42
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,260
was clearly laid years in advance.

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,010
My uncle's far too lazy for that.

44
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,100
The second

45
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,220
is likely from the Tang clan.

46
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,340
Right.

47
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,610
Their top poisoner,

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,820
Tang Linghuang.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,730
But the Tang clan

50
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,570
is also allied with Xueyue City.

51
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,690
And besides,

52
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,100
Tang Linghuang

53
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,170
only favors

54
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,660
poisons that kill.

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,100
He even said,

56
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,500
"If a poison

57
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,450
can't kill the target,

58
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,380
it doesn't deserve the name".

59
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,820
On that point, his fixation

60
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,380
is practically

61
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,130
an obsession.

62
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,780
Then the third?

63
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,730
The Five Poisons Sect master,

64
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,100
the Poison Enchantress,

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,410
Luo Yandie.

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,940
Only she likes

67
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,690
floral-scented toxins.

68
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,690
She prefers people

69
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,890
to drift off in warmth and perfume,

70
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,450
dying without knowing it.

71
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,660
Poisoners like that

72
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,450
have twisted tastes.

73
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,970
Twisted or not,

74
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,450
don't you already know?

75
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,100
This Blossom Ash

76
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,650
only suppresses inner power for a while.

77
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,850
It doesn't kill.

78
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,220
Which means

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,890
they're holding a backup move.

80
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,980
Right now in Sihuai City,

81
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,610
quite a few top fighters have slipped in,

82
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,380
including...

83
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,290
Sword Deities.

84
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,410
So, Lu Yuzhai

85
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,570
refuses to work with us?

86
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,850
He says

87
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,380
his red line

88
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,690
is not harming his master.

89
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,660
[Night Crow, the Ghost Physician]
So after he gets those two letters,

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,810
he'll report to his master.

91
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,850
I failed.

92
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,780
I couldn't intercept those two letters in time.

93
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,020
Sihuai's survival is at stake.

94
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,490
Lu Yuzhai

95
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,580
will surely tell Song Yanhui.

96
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,900
Liu Yunqi is dead.

97
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,250
Jian Shanyue has retired.

98
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,930
And Wushuang City now

99
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,340
has only Song Yanhui left.

100
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,810
Looks like

101
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,850
the City Lord's seat

102
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,410
needs a new occupant.

103
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,730
Your Highness means

104
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,460
the new City Lord of Wushuang City

105
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,780
should be...

106
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,780
Naturally, the Lunwu Hall chief,

107
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,410
Jian Wudi.

108
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,540
I've told you

109
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,170
I have no interest

110
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,040
[Jian Wudi of Wushuang City]

111
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,140
in the City Lord's seat.

112
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,170
Of course.

113
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,810
You can devote yourself to the sword.

114
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,580
The Peerless Sword Coffer I promised

115
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,140
will be delivered to you.

116
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,250
Much obliged, Your Highness.

117
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,660
You're a man

118
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,580
obsessed with the sword.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,700
All who are obsessed,

120
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,170
if they never awaken,

121
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,250
their lives are ruined.

122
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,220
If they do awaken,

123
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,220
they soar through the clouds.

124
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,370
For you to come out of seclusion now,

125
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,980
you must have realized something.

126
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,170
I need a fine swordsman to test it.

127
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,850
It's long been prepared for you.

128
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,050
I'll track down Zhuo Yue'an

129
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,540
and have him

130
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,250
test your blade.

131
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,220
May you

132
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,810
ascend to the top

133
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,490
with one strike.

134
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,810
Go with him.

135
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,020
Perhaps

136
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,930
he will have use for you.

137
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:01,730
As you command.

138
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,900
What's wrong, Sir?

139
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,300
[Luoyang Tavern]

140
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,980
This guy lives for the sword.

141
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,970
Yet when it's time to cross blades,

142
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:39,690
he hesitates.

143
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,120
[Luoyang Tavern]
Maybe...

144
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,540
he's scared of Zhuo Yue'an?

145
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,020
Luoyang Tavern...

146
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,170
Sir,

147
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,250
do you want a drink here?

148
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,140
To the west lies Muliang City,

149
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,050
home to the Lone Sword Deity.

150
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,850
He's said to be the strongest

151
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,310
of the Five Sword Deities.

152
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,610
His name

153
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,050
is Luo Qingyang.

154
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,900
Luo Qingyang

155
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,780
sealed his city long ago.

156
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,140
All these years,

157
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,900
he's never crossed swords with another Sword Deity.

158
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,170
How can you call him number one?

159
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,020
There's someone inside!

160
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,010
What a fearsome sword energy!

161
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,650
Not just fearsome,

162
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,250
what's most distinctive in it

163
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,420
is the killing intent.

164
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,820
It's so heavy,

165
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,530
and so dense.

166
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,010
Within that killing intent

167
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,580
surges a wrathful sword intent.

168
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,730
It's the strongest sword energy

169
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,100
I've ever seen.

170
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,940
You've seen that many?

171
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,340
A fair few.

172
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,730
I'm Chief of Wushuang City's Lunwu Hall,

173
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,850
Jian Wudi.

174
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,770
Pleasure to meet you.

175
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,940
Wushuang City?

176
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,730
Is it that impressive?

177
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,460
Still, your name

178
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,850
is quite something.

179
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,850
Jian Wudi...

180
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,820
Before me,

181
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,220
you dare claim you're unrivaled (wudi)?

182
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:33,850
Sir,

183
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,770
who on earth is he?

184
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,610
Among the Five Sword Deities,

185
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,940
he alone bears the word "fury".

186
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,250
He's the Furious Sword Deity, Yan Zhantian.

187
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,180
He wields the famed blade Breaker of Armies.

188
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,610
Of the five,

189
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,130
his slaughter aura is the heaviest.

190
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,890
A worthy opponent.

191
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,580
But it seems

192
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,770
he's trapped by the floral poison.

193
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,010
He's using his sword energy

194
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,300
to barely carve out

195
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,220
a pocket of space.

196
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,300
But he still can't leave this inn!

197
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,700
You think

198
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,420
such petty tricks can hold me?

199
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,460
In four hours,

200
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,250
this floral poison

201
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,940
will lose all effect.

202
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,650
Then I'll stride out, blade in hand,

203
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,940
and none of you will live!

204
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,490
Oh, right,

205
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,030
do you carry

206
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,490
the antidote to Blossom Ash?

207
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:37,820
I...

208
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,580
No!

209
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,580
Sir,

210
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,460
don't lose sight of the big picture.

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,060
If you let him out,

212
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,940
our plan could go up in smoke.

213
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,180
Let's find Zhuo Yue'an first.

214
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,850
Jian Wudi

215
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,100
really isn't right in the head.

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,300
Just to face a Sword Deity,

217
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,060
he'd hand Yan Zhantian the antidote.

218
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,730
What a crazy idea.

219
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,490
Forget it.

220
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,370
If you're not fighting,

221
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,100
then get lost!

222
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,010
No need to regret it.

223
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,820
I'll cross blades with him one day.

224
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,700
Why is that archfiend

225
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,490
in Sihuai City?

226
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,530
You think only one came?

227
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,250
You mean...

228
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,850
there's more than one master?

229
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,610
No.

230
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,850
I mean

231
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,220
more than one Sword Deity came.

232
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,420
Sword...

233
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,460
Set the Sword Deities aside for now.

234
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,010
Zhuo Yue'an

235
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,820
is in the courtyard up ahead.

236
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,940
You experts can fight it out.

237
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,850
No need for me to watch.

238
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,700
After you.

239
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,420
Come here!

240
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,340
Who is it this time?

241
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,940
Only two people alive

242
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,490
could wield a sword energy this freezing.

243
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,770
The Blizzard Blade won't come here,

244
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,580
so you must be...

245
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,300
Don't tell me my luck is that bad.

246
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,250
Why aren't you poisoned?

247
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,890
I don't know.

248
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,180
Because you and the poisoner

249
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,490
are in it together.

250
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,220
Hand over the antidote, now!

251
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,650
I...

252
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,420
I don't have it.

253
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,350
Then die now!

254
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,060
Wait!

255
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,460
I do...

256
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,730
I do!

257
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,530
My girl,

258
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,220
give me a pill.

259
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,300
I'll go see what's happening outside.

260
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,610
The Poison Enchantress told me

261
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,820
only a few can resist

262
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,980
this floral poison array.

263
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,220
Young lady,

264
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,420
though you look young,

265
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,650
you have quite the backing.

266
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,980
Who are you?

267
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,530
Dian Ye, the Flying Tiger General.

268
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,330
[Dian Ye, the Flying Tiger General]
Not counting the Prince of Langya,

269
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,770
his standing in the Beili Army

270
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,250
is second only to Commander-in-Chief Ye Xiaoying.

271
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,610
A general...

272
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,770
what's he doing here?

273
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,730
Good question.

274
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,890
Why indeed?

275
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,420
Su Changhe,

276
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,340
Su Muyu,

277
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,220
Blood River's current leaders,

278
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,250
I'm here

279
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,890
for you, of course.

280
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,650
As a court general,

281
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,530
you're interested in Blood River?

282
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,580
What are you after?

283
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,770
You want this?

284
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,300
And this too?

285
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,850
Patriarch of Blood River,

286
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,300
you're clever.

287
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,460
How did the dragon-head hilt

288
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,700
of the Dormant Dragon Sword end up on your dagger?

289
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,650
I had Xie Qianji refit it.

290
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,060
I don't use a longsword,

291
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,610
and lugging the Dormant Dragon Sword around

292
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,340
is a pain.

293
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,220
Dian Ye

294
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,340
is First Prince Xiao Yong's uncle.

295
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,100
And Xiao Yong is a leading contender

296
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,250
for the throne.

297
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,580
Looks like they've planned this day

298
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,530
for a long time.

299
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,770
They want to take Wushuang City

300
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,460
and seize Blood River's treasures.

301
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,250
Su Muyu,

302
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,580
this revenge duel of yours

303
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,940
has been thoroughly used.

304
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,490
A sword is a noble weapon.

305
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,250
Those who exploit it

306
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,730
will die by it.

307
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,060
You know who we are,

308
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,180
yet you came alone?

309
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,850
You've got a death wish, huh?

310
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,180
He's a general, after all.

311
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,580
If you fight him openly,

312
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,250
head-on,

313
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,420
you'll only bring Blood River trouble.

314
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,370
Let me do it instead.

315
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,420
Anyway,

316
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,300
I'm just a free blade from Nan'an.

317
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,100
For you two youngsters,

318
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,420
I'll test

319
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,980
the general's golden axe.

320
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,610
That city

321
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,010
has begun to stir.

322
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,460
Tonight?

323
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,980
The news shouldn't spread so fast.

324
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,340
But by the signs before,

325
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,130
tonight is when they strike.

326
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,220
However,

327
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,460
what they didn't expect

328
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,130
is that Sihuai City today

329
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,770
is no ordinary Sihuai City.

330
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,250
They lured Blood River over,

331
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,180
while I invited

332
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,420
three Sword Deities

333
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,610
to watch the show.

334
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,940
Xiao Yong

335
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,770
meant to use this chance

336
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,490
to control Wushuang City

337
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,010
and grow his power.

338
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,820
But he never imagined

339
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,940
Su Muyu

340
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,100
would deliberately tip us off

341
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,250
that someone meant

342
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,370
to use him.

343
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,180
Su Muyu is a clever one.

344
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,250
In this Wushuang turmoil,

345
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,100
the final break

346
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,980
still rests on his choice:

347
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,370
whether to remain Su Muyu

348
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,890
or become Zhuo Yue'an.

349
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,330
Now that is a master.

350
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,250
Who goes there?

351
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,940
Jian Wudi.

352
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,980
What an arrogant name.

353
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,010
Today is my first bout since leaving seclusion.

354
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,490
Anyone not fighting,

355
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,860
clear out.

356
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,570
General Dian Ye,

357
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,090
you can just watch.

358
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,570
Seems

359
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,860
you have some right

360
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,180
to be arrogant.

361
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,530
Xiao Yong promised me

362
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,250
a fine "sword"

363
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,810
to test my skills.

364
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,770
Looks like

365
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,810
you're the "sword" I came for!

366
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,770
I've always accompanied Su Muyu

367
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,810
to these duels,

368
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,860
finding them silly.

369
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,420
He liked them,

370
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,490
so I played along.

371
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,660
But now...

372
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,770
Suddenly it feels

373
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,290
like it means something?

374
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,090
No.

375
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,770
It suddenly feels even sillier.

376
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,770
Because Su Muyu seems

377
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,490
unable to beat that man.

378
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,730
A fine "sword" indeed.

379
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,050
In you,

380
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,730
I see my father's shadow.

381
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,380
Zhuo Yuluo, Lord of No-Sword City.

382
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,250
With a pure sword-heart,

383
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,460
he's an absolute devotee of the Sword's Way.

384
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,700
Other than my father,

385
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,460
I've never seen

386
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,980
such pure sword intent.

387
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,660
One who wields the sword

388
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,380
must keep a single mind.

389
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,290
Seems that battle at Wushuang City

390
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,290
no longer matters.

391
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,330
It's my honor

392
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,090
to cross blades with you.

393
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,420
My last stroke

394
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,980
held intent, no technique.

395
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,490
You blocked it beautifully.

396
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,810
But every stroke that follows

397
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,090
won't be like the last,

398
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,180
only growing stronger

399
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,940
and harsher.

400
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,730
All the better.

401
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,420
True masters of the Sword's Way

402
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,330
each bear their own sword intent.

403
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,180
His intent

404
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,730
is pure,

405
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,290
without a speck of impurity.

406
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,810
A decade honing one blade,

407
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,420
that is true purity.

408
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,180
Do you feel it?

409
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,490
As if rain is coming.

410
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,860
There's a chill.

411
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,860
His sword energy

412
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,380
carries a trace of rain.

413
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,860
Fine "sword"!

414
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,330
Looks like a brilliant duel.

415
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,250
It is.

416
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,140
Truly brilliant.

417
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,010
You're here.

418
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,050
So from now on,

419
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,900
the jianghu will have six Sword Deities?

420
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,060
♪Watch the flames across the river...♪

421
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,770
Seems Su Muyu

422
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,700
has met a worthy foe.

423
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,250
He even spent

424
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,060
his trump card.

425
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,290
You called my sword intent

426
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,490
the purest

427
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,420
you've ever seen.

428
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,250
But yours

429
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,050
is the most complex

430
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,220
I've seen.

431
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,940
Your sword intent carries

432
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,810
too many feelings:

433
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,570
anger,

434
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,770
defiance,

435
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,810
forbearance,

436
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,530
compromise,

437
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,380
even gentleness...

438
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,620
almost the full range

439
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,940
of a human heart.

440
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,700
What have you lived through

441
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,050
to swing

442
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,940
so complex a blade?

443
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,980
♪This battle is mine alone, against myself♪

444
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,580
♪The path lies beneath my feet. I see muddy prints...♪

445
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:22,940
And then

446
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,140
all falls quiet.

447
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:26,900
You lost?

448
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,380
I won.

449
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,620
Not good.

450
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,050
Very not good.

451
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,010
If you won,

452
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,490
why is it not good?

453
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,940
Because Su Muyu

454
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,770
used his strongest strike

455
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,730
yet didn't kill him.

456
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,290
And the opponent

457
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,090
hasn't gone all out.

458
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,730
That last strike was excellent.

459
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,180
May I have its name?

460
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,570
Rain Surge.

461
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,420
Rain Surge...

462
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,770
I call myself Jian Wudi,

463
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,220
yet in my first fight out of seclusion

464
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,660
against my first opponent,

465
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,620
I lost.

466
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,940
But from

467
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,660
that strike just now,

468
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,660
I've gained new insight.

469
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,940
With the next stroke,

470
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,420
you will lose...

471
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,290
and die.

472
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,860
My turn.

473
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,250
Let me try again.

474
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,660
None of you are getting away.

475
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,620
Indeed...

476
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,010
Pure sword intent

477
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,660
is rare in this world.

478
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,050
But when anything

479
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,770
pushes past

480
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,220
the point of return,

481
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,570
the utmost good

482
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,980
turns to utmost evil,

483
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,250
the utmost evil

484
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,220
becomes utmost good;

485
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,940
and the brightest light

486
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,490
is nothing but darkness.

487
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,770
He's about

488
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,570
to go fully demonic.

489
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,940
If going demonic makes my sword stronger,

490
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,810
why not?

491
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,980
If you don't turn back

492
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,330
and keep wielding the sword like this,

493
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,900
within a year,

494
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,490
your sword intent will turn on you.

495
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,180
Your inner channels will snap and you'll die!

496
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,900
My father was devoted to the sword too,

497
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,220
but he never ignored

498
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,530
his family or his people.

499
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,660
You can treat the sword

500
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,900
as the most important thing,

501
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,810
but it

502
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,330
must not be the only thing.

503
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,140
People may betray you,

504
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,810
but a sword...

505
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,290
won't!

506
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,290
After all this time,

507
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,810
you still follow

508
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,620
such an extreme Way of the Sword.

509
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,860
It's you.

510
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,330
Our duel

511
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,770
will have to wait.

512
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,290
If so,

513
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,730
let's join hands against him.

514
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,220
A fortunate turn, perhaps.

515
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,620
Senior Wudi!

516
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,140
Long time no see!

517
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,290
All these years,

518
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,620
why are you still

519
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,620
at the same realm?

520
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,900
The longer you hold the bottleneck,

521
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,290
the stronger the breakthrough.

522
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,980
I've been waiting for the moment,

523
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,380
one strike to divinity.

524
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,090
One strike...

525
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,980
to divinity?

526
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,460
A pity.

527
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,330
You won't get that chance!

528
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,660
Senior Wudi,

529
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,700
seems you've joined the chaos too.

530
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,530
Since you've betrayed Wushuang City,

531
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,730
don't blame me

532
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,980
for putting duty over kin!

533
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,900
Before he went demonic,

534
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,220
he was close to a Sword Deity.

535
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,810
Now, fully demonic,

536
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,530
his power is immeasurable.

537
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,330
As City Lord of Wushuang,

538
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,380
I can't best anyone after all?

539
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,140
At the peak comes decline.

540
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,620
A demonic body looks mighty,

541
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,380
but it's hollow.

542
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,090
Find the weak point

543
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,380
and one strike will kill!

544
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,010
Someone steeped in obsession

545
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,700
is going demonic here.

546
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,290
It's from the Scholarly Sword Deity.

547
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,530
One Stroke Cuts Water!

548
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,090
Swallow Turns Back!

549
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,700
I have a strike too!

550
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,530
It's called...

551
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,250
Mountain Rain at Dusk!

552
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,050
After fresh rain on empty hills,

553
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,380
autumn comes with the evening chill.

554
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,770
You live for the sword,

555
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,380
but a sword is a dead thing.

556
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,530
Living for dead things

557
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,940
will get you hit a dead end.

558
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,490
But the only thing that stays with me

559
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,220
is my sword.

560
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,900
Everything else

561
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,220
leaves me.

562
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,220
Senior Wudi.

563
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,980
I didn't win...

564
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,570
but you

565
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,940
didn't really either.

566
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,700
General Dian,

567
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,860
we'll spare you this once.

568
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,180
From now on, be careful.

569
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,180
And stop scheming

570
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,380
against Blood River.

571
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,490
We didn't duel today,

572
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,220
but after this fight,

573
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,050
I have no regrets.

574
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,290
Never thought

575
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,010
Blood River

576
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,330
would have a swordsman like you.

577
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,140
What?

578
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,980
Should everyone in Blood River

579
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,660
be like me?

580
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,420
You two, don't just stand there.

581
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,800
You burned through a lot of sword moves today.

582
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,900
Sit right now

583
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,700
and reset your breath.

584
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:33,770
Remember:

585
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,010
after a fight,

586
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,570
you must promptly regulate

587
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,460
your breathing.

588
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,270
Awesome!

589
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,490
Yeah, really awesome!

590
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,380
Senior, your strike

591
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,900
was crisp and commanding.

592
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,660
No wonder Master says

593
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,030
you're the most gifted

594
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,810
among our generation.

595
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,380
Right.

596
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,290
If the City Lord watches training,

597
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,010
he might take a shine to you

598
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,330
and accept you as a personal disciple!

599
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,180
That's not enough.

600
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,810
My force isn't enough.

601
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,900
I still need work.

602
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,900
You're ever striving for perfection.

603
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,090
In time,

604
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,460
you'll be Wushuang City's backbone,

605
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,290
the pillar we all rely on!

606
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,530
The City Lord is here!

607
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,250
Greetings, Sir!

608
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,530
Enough.

609
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,290
Yanhui,

610
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,490
this place

611
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,140
is the practice ground

612
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,810
of Wushuang City.

613
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,180
By day, I handle affairs.

614
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,530
In the meantime,

615
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,570
you can come here

616
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,290
and spar with the brothers.

617
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,810
At dusk,

618
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,180
return to the City Lord's manor

619
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,570
to work your forms.

620
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,770
His name is Yanhui.

621
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,810
You lot,

622
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,140
look after him.

623
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,570
- Got it! - Got it!

624
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,250
Senior Jian,

625
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,490
you okay?

626
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,420
Again!

627
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,090
Come on!

628
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,530
Senior Jian,

629
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,420
I need to get back and train at the manor.

630
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,010
See you tomorrow.

631
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,490
I will beat you.

632
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,380
I will beat you!

633
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,620
Even if you have the strongest master

634
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,420
and practice the finest sword art,

635
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,810
I will beat you!

636
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,510
I, Jian Wudi,

637
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,980
don't yield!

638
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,290
I, Jian Wudi,

639
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,900
am meant to be unrivaled!

640
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,940
Senior Wudi,

641
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,380
at first light tomorrow,

642
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,940
I'll have people see you buried.

643
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,810
As for our brotherhood...

644
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,010
let's carry it to the next life.

645
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,380
How did you avoid this floral poison?

646
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,900
A Sword Deity

647
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,900
trapped by a petty floral poison,

648
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,700
isn't that ridiculous?

649
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,050
Truly ridiculous.

650
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,530
So,

651
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,490
how did you break free?

652
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,940
Teach your brother here.

653
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,810
Naturally...

654
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,460
with an antidote.

655
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,250
Third City Lord gave it to you?

656
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,460
No way.

657
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,980
Xueyue Sword Deity,

658
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,730
you're Xueyue City's Second City Lord.

659
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,290
Yet you act

660
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,770
so rough

661
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,620
and rude,

662
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,860
truly...

663
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,220
a "heroine among women"!

664
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,140
Hand over all your antidote.

665
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,090
My antidote for this floral poison

666
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,980
is worth a fortune.

667
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,770
It's not something for charity.

668
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,140
Who are you trying to save now?

669
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,330
Me.

670
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,730
Wait, who are you?

671
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,330
I'm Xie Xuan.

672
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,010
Xie Xuan...

673
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,490
Any antidote left?

674
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,290
Yes... yes!

675
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,050
Right here.

676
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,490
Much obliged, good sir.

677
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,700
By the way, City Lord Li,

678
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,380
In the city,

679
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,570
there are still many jianghu folks

680
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,570
poisoned by this floral poison.

681
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,050
As Sword Deities,

682
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,740
we should lend a hand.

683
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,940
There's plenty of antidote in this vial.

684
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,460
This floral poison

685
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,940
seems weaker than before.

686
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:17,860
How do we save them?

687
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,980
Grind the antidote to powder

688
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,570
and spread it across the city.

689
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,490
Since the toxin came from flowers,

690
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,010
let flowers end it.

691
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,340
In this world,

692
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,780
only you can bring a city of blossoms

693
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,420
with a single sword.

694
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,610
All right.

695
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,460
This...

696
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,130
this is the fabled...

697
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,340
The Floral Sword Art!

698
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,780
[Luoyang Tavern]

699
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,650
No more waiting!

700
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,610
I actually cleared the poison thanks to that woman.

701
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,130
How vexing.

702
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,300
Your swordwork

703
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,980
is still as beautiful.

704
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,650
On my way here,

705
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,780
I ran into some folks from Baixiao Hall.

706
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,780
They asked me a favor.

707
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,420
I hate that kind of thing.

708
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,650
However,

709
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,300
my mother and he both serve

710
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,260
among the Four Guardians.

711
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,460
Since Mother asked me to help him,

712
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,530
of course I will.

713
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:49,940
Good thing

714
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,130
I ran into you.

715
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,610
I see.

716
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,260
So Ji Ruofeng gathered us here

717
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,460
not for a show,

718
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,130
but with his own designs.

719
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,780
But Baixiao Hall came to you.

720
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,530
What's that to me?

721
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,260
I cleared your poison just now.

722
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,980
- I... - I did you a favor.

723
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,260
You owe me.

724
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,610
I suppose

725
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,420
your sages' books

726
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,460
teach that too, no?

727
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,690
You speak true.

728
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:20,980
What do you need from me?

729
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,170
Take us to your master.

730
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,650
Sword Deity, you jest.

731
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,690
If I take you, I'm dead.

732
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,570
Just leave a little early

733
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,780
before we arrive.

734
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,820
If you don't take us,

735
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,910
- you die right now. - I...

736
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,490
Hey!

737
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,010
I can't help anyway.

738
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,650
Lead on.

739
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,900
This way, please.

740
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,490
Driver,

741
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,010
we'll borrow your carriage.

742
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:52,980
It's dangerous in the city.

743
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,300
Wait here.

744
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,460
At daybreak,

745
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,490
we'll be back.

746
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:58,820
All right.

747
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,090
What was that all about?

748
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,860
We came all this way,

749
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,860
saw no good fight,

750
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,260
and now we're cleaning up

751
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,130
Baixiao Hall's mess.

752
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,610
Pretty frustrating, huh?

753
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,050
Fair enough.

754
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,340
Once we're done,

755
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,010
let me cross blades

756
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,210
with the Scholarly Sword Deity.

757
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,900
Then it's worth the trip.

758
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,570
They say Song Yanhui

759
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,210
crossed swords with you

760
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,260
and lost badly.

761
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,610
How come you're still keen on his swordwork?

762
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,900
Song's swordwork is indeed good,

763
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,340
but

764
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,090
Wushuang City holds him back.

765
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,650
Also,

766
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,340
I want to see

767
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,170
Su Muyu's swordwork.

768
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,210
Weren't you together

769
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,780
in the siege on Ye Dingzhi?

770
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,380
Didn't you see his swordwork?

771
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,740
He once said

772
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,300
his "sword"

773
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,650
is no sword...

774
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,090
it's a killing tool.

775
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,940
Only when he returns under a new name

776
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,610
will you see his true swordwork.

777
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,490
He's powerful.

778
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,860
If not for him back then,

779
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,050
we'd never have wounded

780
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,090
Ye Dingzhi so badly.

781
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,010
This Blossom Ash

782
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,340
isn't as thick as before.

783
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,530
I'll pack up

784
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,860
and we can leave this courtyard.

785
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:48,980
Mr. Zhuo.

786
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,340
After this fight,

787
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,860
our test duel

788
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,420
will likely be delayed.

789
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,010
Someone wants to use our bout

790
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,940
for trouble.

791
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,980
If it stirs up chaos

792
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,860
and innocents die again,

793
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,860
the trial loses its point.

794
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,260
Besides,

795
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,260
fighting side by side,

796
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,860
I've felt your sword intent.

797
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,490
It's good.

798
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,300
Had my father met you then,

799
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,380
perhaps

800
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,340
it wouldn't have ended that way.

801
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,300
Wushuang City owes No-Sword City,

802
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,210
and owes you.

803
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,740
I trained in Blood River,

804
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,650
but I'm here

805
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,780
to carry my father's Way.

806
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,940
I only meant

807
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,900
to avenge him

808
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,860
and restore No-Sword City's name,

809
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,380
not to wreck Wushuang.

810
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,260
Push it

811
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,380
and I'd be another Liu Yunqi.

812
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,260
My master was mortally hurt

813
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,170
and has passed.

814
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,300
He was my enemy

815
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,530
and your master.

816
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,170
Now vengeance is done,

817
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,130
I'm pleased.

818
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,490
But such joy should not be shown

819
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,300
before you.

820
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:12,860
I understand.

821
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,260
Mr. Zhuo,

822
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,380
until we meet again.

823
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,650
If there's a chance,

824
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,740
I'd like to see your sword

825
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,380
shine even more dazzling.

826
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,690
I fear that won't be me.

827
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,740
But Wushuang City

828
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,570
will have a finer "sword"

829
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,570
to meet you.

830
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,050
Farewell.

831
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,490
Let's go too.

832
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,090
He took a mortal strike

833
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,780
from you two.

834
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,570
He can't be alive!

835
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:55,980
No pain,

836
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,130
no fear,

837
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,530
only the will to kill.

838
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,090
That's not something "going demonic"

839
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,860
can explain.

840
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,130
Could it be...

841
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:10,980
What?

842
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,940
It's Xichu's drugged puppet art!

843
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:13,980
It makes the dead

844
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,010
rise and fight.

845
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,820
Back when Xichu

846
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,570
fought Beili,

847
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,050
they used it

848
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,420
to drag the war on.

849
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,610
It defies heaven's order.

850
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,900
But its power was so strange

851
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:23,980
the Scholarly Deity of Xichu

852
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,780
couldn't bear to destroy it,

853
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,690
and passed it to Medicine King Valley,

854
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:28,900
hoping the Valley

855
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,980
could find a way

856
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,900
to turn this evil art

857
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,260
to the right.

858
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,090
So your Valley

859
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,210
ended up with it.

860
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,570
Did you fix it?

861
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:40,860
No.

862
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,980
It's so perverse

863
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,090
that even Xin Baicao

864
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,170
couldn't grasp it.

865
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,820
I have a martial niece,

866
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,420
Xin Baicao's junior sister,

867
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,380
named Night Crow.

868
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,610
Her husband died early,

869
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,300
so she grew obsessed

870
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,530
with "revival" arts,

871
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,420
and kept studying

872
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,380
the drugged puppet craft.

873
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:54,900
Later,

874
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,900
she betrayed the Valley

875
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,740
and took the manual.

876
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,130
She's now

877
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,340
the only one who knows it.

878
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,570
How to break it?

879
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,340
Thirteen Glances Back!

880
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,530
Freshly made a drugged puppet,

881
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,460
his foul blood circulates poorly.

882
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,610
I pinned him.

883
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,130
Su Muyu,

884
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,530
shred his heart with one stroke!

885
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,300
That ends it, right?

886
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:30,900
My girl!

887
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,050
What went wrong?

888
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,260
His poisoned blood

889
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,860
is already in me.

890
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:43,820
Troublesome.

891
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:45,340
Su Muyu,

892
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:46,860
there's a jade vial at my waist.

893
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,010
Take the pill inside

894
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,130
and give it to me.

895
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,090
Are you fine now?

896
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,820
The puppet poison

897
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,340
isn't that easy to cure.
