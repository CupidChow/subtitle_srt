[Episode 12]

5
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,100
Master,

6
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,740
are you serious?

7
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,950
Kill them!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,800
End it once and for all.

9
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:46,820
We won't even own up!

10
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,430
As you command.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,100
So, are you two

12
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,740
Su Changhe,

13
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,180
the current Patriarch of Blood River,

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,340
and Su Muyu, the head of the Su family?

15
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,620
This is interesting.

16
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,770
I know about you two.

17
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,180
So, the current Blood River

18
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,090
is led by two Nameless, huh?

19
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,620
How did you guys manage to achieve that?

20
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,650
This has nothing to do

21
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
with our trip here.

22
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,620
You actually utter such preposterous words

23
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,140
at Yellow Springs Pawnshop?

24
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,950
I can see why

25
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,140
you were a former Kui.

26
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,900
Kui

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,370
is a monster among men.

28
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,370
We travel on the same path.

29
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,710
So, you're the owner of
Yellow Springs Pawnshop.

30
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,210
Please don't say something like that.

31
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,460
I am

32
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,530
but an accountant.

33
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,809
I'm not the owner

34
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,810
of the shop.

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,420
You guys can view all the items you want.

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,520
But please don't land me in trouble.

37
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
We dare not do so.

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,920
Your words are too heavy, shopkeeper.

39
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,030
Let's not waste any time, then.

40
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,690
Take us to

41
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,200
the treasures of Blood River.

42
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,710
It's been so long

43
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,590
since anyone

44
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,740
has visited that place.

45
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
Follow me.

46
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
This is the place.

47
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,010
The Yellow Springs Pawnshop

48
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,010
serves everyone in the martial world.

49
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,910
All clans have their treasures
deposited in this place.

50
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,590
This is

51
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,570
the treasury of Blood River.

52
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,230
I have a question.

53
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,830
Even if we don't have this key,

54
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,990
we can get in easily by scaling the wall.

55
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,180
You think you can get
in by scaling the wall?

56
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
Trust me.

57
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,620
There's no way you can leave in one piece

58
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,660
even if you're the Patriarch.

59
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,220
The Blood River's Spider's Nest...

60
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
So, you know about that?

61
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,070
It's nothing compared to the security here.

62
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,220
It's utterly inferior.

63
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,370
When you unlock the gate

64
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,780
with this key,

65
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,810
all the traps and arrays

66
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,860
will be dispelled.

67
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Here.

68
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,180
Keep the key.

69
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,740
After this, you'll understand

70
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
how precious

71
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,690
this key is.

72
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,150
All right.

73
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,120
Is this Blood River's treasury?

74
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,570
Let me show you the
unrefined treasures first.

75
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,250
How many people do they have to assassinate

76
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,670
for them to gather this amount of wealth?

77
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,490
Do the gold bricks here

78
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,510
look a lot to you?

79
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,250
Can you try to understand

80
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,750
the sufferings of the world for once?

81
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,536
Even if I combine the chest of silver taels

82
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,980
and the residence I own,

83
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,270
it's not even worth as much as this chest.

84
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,950
To think that this room

85
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,030
is filled to the brim
with such gold bricks.

86
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,710
I understand now.

87
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,856
Blood River has stored all of their wealth

88
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,890
in this treasury.

89
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,790
If you think that's the
only thing they stored here,

90
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,680
Master Su, you're underestimating

91
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,100
your Blood River predecessors.

92
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,590
Follow me.

93
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,510
Calm down.

94
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,860
There's no one inside.

95
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,780
But I feel sword qi inside.

96
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
This sword

97
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,920
is from the Sword Heart Tomb.

98
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,350
Follow me.

99
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,710
The Sword Heart Tomb,

100
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,890
the Villa of Famed Swords,

101
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,370
and the No-Sword City,
which had been eradicated,

102
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,710
most of the famed swords stored here

103
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,250
all came from those three places.

104
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,690
Look over there.

105
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
The armors,

106
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
the long sabers,

107
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,200
and the bows and crossbows,

108
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,330
they were also created by

109
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,810
the famous Lu Clan of Shanbei.

110
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,330
Now, look at the Overlord Armor.

111
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,500
The world thought

112
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,270
that the Mu family had
the only one of its kind.

113
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,690
In reality, Blood River

114
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,730
has the exact same set.

115
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,870
This room

116
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,060
is more valuable than the gold room.

117
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,900
If you view it from a monetary perspective,

118
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,660
naturally, this room

119
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,776
isn't as valuable as the
room filled with gold bricks.

120
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,210
However, most of the weapons

121
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,730
couldn't even be bought with money.

122
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,730
Any one of them

123
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,210
is rare enough

124
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,140
that the martial world will kill

125
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,970
just to get their hands on them.

126
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,930
Shopkeeper Wang,

127
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,210
why are you feeling proud about it?

128
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,750
All of them belonged
to our organization, you know?

129
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,850
Ah.

130
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,440
I suppose I was too used to it.

131
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,180
Let's check out the remaining rooms.

132
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,830
After this,

133
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,540
you guys have to practice caution.

[Cosmic Duality]

135
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,620
[Drums and Thunder Gate]

136
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,496
I once joined Lei Qianting of the Lei Clan

137
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,210
to fend off

138
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,060
Ye Dingzhi's Killing Array.

139
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
He once mentioned

140
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,380
these names to me before.

141
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,320
All of these are
the strongest gunpowder in the Lei Clan.

142
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,420
I never expected Blood River

143
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,730
to possess

144
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,950
the gunpowder of the Lei Clan.

145
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,730
This room is filled with all of them

146
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,730
except for Kirin Fire Tooth,

147
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,110
which is

148
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,830
a top-tier gunpowder of the Lei Clan.

149
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,776
Therefore, you have to be extra careful

150
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,300
when unlocking this gate.

151
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,730
Its walls

152
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,300
and the gate itself

153
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,850
were forged with Liuhe Steel.

154
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,870
If not,

155
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
if the gunpowder inside

156
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,590
ignites at the same time by accident,

157
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,730
the entire pawnshop

158
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,900
will be levelled.

159
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,140
You have to be careful

160
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,160
when unlocking the next gate as well.

161
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,300
If you're careless,

162
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,990
the three of us

163
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,330
will be buried here.

164
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,450
That room

165
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,230
is filled with all
sorts of mystical poison.

166
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,060
The Slumbering Serpent King

167
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,970
can also be found within.

168
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,810
It was reared with the deadly poison

169
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,570
used by families such as the Wen family

170
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,850
and the Tang Clan.

171
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,900
Right now, this serpent

172
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,900
is filled with deadly poison

173
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,730
that has no cure.

174
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,900
A single drop of its blood

175
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,540
could easily topple the strongest of

176
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,800
Heaven-level martial artists

177
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,970
who had 30 years of cultivation.

178
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,260
If I'm not mistaken,

179
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,380
the last room

180
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,950
should contain all sorts of hidden weapons.

181
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
You're very smart.

182
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,380
If we take them to Blood River,

183
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,970
Blood River can turn
into a full army anytime.

184
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,570
It'll be the strongest army in the world.

185
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,760
No one will be able to stop us.

186
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,570
Monsters will be slain.

187
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,950
Even deities

188
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,710
will be slain.

189
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,540
No wonder this sword

190
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,760
could cause such a huge commotion.

191
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,680
However, this is a pawnshop.

192
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,990
It's not a money house.

193
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
Smart boy.

194
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,930
Plenty of people

195
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,730
would've leapt out of joy

196
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,570
upon seeing

197
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,970
all the treasures here.

198
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,450
No one would care about

199
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
the details.

200
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Since it's a pawnshop,

201
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,380
that means

202
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,420
we have to pay a price

203
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,270
in order to obtain all these treasures.

204
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,030
What's the price we have to pay?

205
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,910
There's no price for you two to pay.

206
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
At least

207
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,500
my pawnshop doesn't
need anything from you two

208
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,570
at the moment.

209
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,990
I don't trust you.

210
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,850
No need to be distrustful.

211
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,850
Actually, you guys had started

212
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,300
to pay the price

213
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,610
long ago.

214
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,630
The people you'd killed

215
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
and the missions

216
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,990
you'd completed

217
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,180
were the price you paid

218
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,450
to possess these treasures.

219
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,590
After all,

220
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,420
half of the missions you took on

221
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,540
were assigned

222
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
by us.

223
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,970
Three Officials,

224
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
you may stop hiding.

225
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,020
We shall not do anything reckless

226
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,330
within the Yellow Springs Pawnshop.

227
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,446
Back then, Soul Reapers' Hall [Earth Official,
Soul Reapers' Hall] had an audience with you two.

228
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,500
I said that we should've
eliminated both of you.

229
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
However, I also said

230
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,260
that the danger of their existence

231
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,540
was precisely why

232
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,810
we need to keep them alive.

233
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,210
Judging from the final result,

234
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,420
perhaps eliminating them back then

235
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,896
[Heaven Official, Soul Reapers'
Hall] was the best choice.

236
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,080
We've been expecting you all.

237
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,300
We've seen the treasures of Blood River

238
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,440
and encounter you guys here.

239
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,060
Our trip wasn't in vain.

240
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
Hell Palm?

241
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,890
Let's retreat!

242
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,460
No one can master

243
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,660
such a technique overnight.

244
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,800
You cultivated it in secret long ago.

245
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,500
You guys'd better hurry

246
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,690
and put a hit on me.

247
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,610
Let's see

248
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,730
who else will obey your command.

249
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,090
The Yellow Springs Pawnshop

250
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,570
isn't a duel arena.

251
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
Don't worry.

252
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,970
We didn't come here

253
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,090
to fight.

254
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,590
Shopkeeper Wang,

255
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,450
I'm afraid you haven't delivered

256
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,970
the entirety of your message yet.

257
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,430
You see, you guys appeared
in the middle

258
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
of our conversation.

259
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Patriarch,

260
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,180
let me finish our conversation.

261
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,570
The key you're holding

262
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,260
can only

263
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,450
unlock the rooms.

264
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,090
You need another token

265
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,600
if you wish to retrieve
the treasures inside.

266
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
What token?

267
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,270
It's this.
[Yellow Springs]

268
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,630
That's the token.

269
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
You may unlock

270
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,210
the room with the key.

271
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,136
And, you may retrieve the treasures inside

272
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,090
with the token.

273
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,111
Both are essential if you
wish to retrieve the treasures.

274
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,256
No wonder the Three
Officials of Soul Reapers' Hall

275
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,380
could always

276
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,760
command the Three Families around.

277
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,090
I know what you're thinking.

278
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
You're thinking

279
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,730
that you should kill us

280
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,750
and steal the token

281
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,360
while the Yellow Springs Pawnshop

282
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,450
can't react in time.

283
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,590
Or,

284
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
you would kill us

285
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,900
and Shopkeeper Wang.

286
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,210
If anyone dares to fight here,

287
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,300
the guns

288
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,970
and mechanisms here

289
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,180
aren't just for show, you know?

290
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,690
I just need to press a button,

291
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,180
and the treasures of Blood River

292
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,050
will be reduced to ashes.

293
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,800
All of your efforts will go down the drain.

294
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,110
Everyone,

295
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,140
please consider this

296
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,730
carefully.

297
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,750
Three Officials,

298
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,500
could it be that you all

299
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,380
have acknowledged me and Su Muyu

300
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,600
as the leaders of Blood River?

301
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,900
What do you think?

302
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,780
You guys neglected one thing.

303
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,110
What is it?

304
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,320
We do not acknowledge
the Soul Reapers' Hall.

305
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,800
And, we will stop acknowledging
the existence of the Three Officials.

306
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,840
You guys won't be included

307
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,830
in the new Blood River.

308
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,700
It seems we thought
too highly of ourselves.

309
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,590
However, don't you guys think

310
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,260
that

311
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,740
you're oversimplifying things here?

312
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,980
This is an invitation.

313
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,256
Could it be that one of you

314
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,460
is getting married?

315
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,910
Is this a wedding banquet invitation?

316
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,260
You guys said you wanted an answer

317
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,740
and you wish to form a new Blood River.

318
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,190
If so,

319
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,610
you guys need to see

320
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,730
the man stated in the invitation.

321
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,130
What we wish to form

322
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,350
has nothing to do with other people.

323
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
So naive.

324
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,670
As long as that individual
in Tianqi City wishes so,

325
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
he can

326
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,940
obliterate all of the treasures here

327
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,550
with just one thought of his.

328
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,150
I assume

329
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,310
you guys are in need
of the treasures here.

330
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,060
Who's that individual?

331
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,890
The ancestors of said person

332
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,780
formed Blood River 100 years ago.

333
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,590
As for the rest,

334
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,460
you guys will find out

335
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,110
once you arrive at Tianqi City.

336
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,540
Keep your Hell Palm in reserve.

337
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,170
To kill in the Yellow Springs Pawnshop...

338
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,060
Only a lunatic like you

339
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,280
would try something like that.

340
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,980
You were right.

341
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,130
They would find us

342
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,740
even if we didn't do anything.

343
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,260
If so, let's follow their will

344
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,060

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,396
The name of Senior Brother Luo
is already a taboo

514
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,570
in the sect.

515
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,370
Up next is...

516
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,460
That's all for tonight.

517
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,590
What do you mean by this?

518
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,950
Tonight, I merely wish to find out

519
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,940
about your identity.

520
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,350
As for the rest,

521
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,710
we can talk about them tomorrow.

522
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,870
The Shadow Sect, huh?

523
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,240
It seems I need to owe them a favor.

524
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,260
This is already the 13th batch

525
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
of assailants.

526
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,410
Someone is trying to impede us

527
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
from entering Tianqi.

528
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
It's Blood River.

529
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,320
I received new intel.

530
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,060
Su Muyu

531
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,170
has already entered Tianqi alone.

532
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,500
I think he has a goal to achieve

533
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,370
before our arrival.

534
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,240
I told you guys long ago.

535
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,230
We shouldn't underestimate Blood River.

536
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,160
I've engaged Su Changhe and Su Muyu

537
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,610
in battle before.

538
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,020
They are outstanding young individuals.

539
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,300
If it's possible,

540
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,260
I hope

541
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,260
that they can become our companions.

542
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
Water Official,

543
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,020
what do you mean by that?

544
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,110
Tianqi City's Shadow Sect

545
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,350
had already fallen from grace.

546
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,540
But the current Blood River

547
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,040
is filled with hope, don't you agree?

548
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
Such foolishness.

549
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,850
Blood River is merely a killing tool

550
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,410
meant for other people to wield.

551
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,520
Enough.

552
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
We should make haste.

553
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
From now on,

554
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,000
do not utter such preposterous words

555
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,350
again.

556
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,456
They didn't want to be the Umbrella Ghost

557
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,500
and the Undertaker.

558
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,130
They merely want to be themselves.

559
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,410
Actually, I'm the same.

560
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,330
I only wish to be Su Henshui,

561
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,980
not the Water Official.

562
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,850
Whose letter is this?

563
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,600
It's from your favorite Su Muyu.

564
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,400
He wants me to complete a request.

565
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,680
You guys said you would
arrive on the second day.

566
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,400
I've been waiting for a few days.

567
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,990
You guys were the one
who decided on that date.

568
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,170
We will come anytime

569
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,850
we like.

570
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,910
Sect Leader is inviting you

571
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,320
to a banquet that will
be held in three days.

572
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Attend it in secret.

573
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,260
Do not let anyone find out.

574
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,390
Sir,

575
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,760
why did you bring me here?

576
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
Are we here

577
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,750
to retrieve the treasures
in Yellow Springs Pawnshop?

578
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,630
I'm bringing you to see someone.

579
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Who is it?

580
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
The Ferryman.

581
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,410
Mister, you've returned.

582
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
Hongying,

583
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,090
you ferry people every day.

584
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,360
How much is Yellow
Springs Pawnshop paying you?

585
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,670
Mister,

586
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,650
to think that you still remember my name.

587
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,850
I ferry people here every day

588
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,240
without charging a single cent.

589
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,030
I'm merely waiting for
my destined one to come.

590
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,550
If so, can the guy beside me

591
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,260
be your destined one, then?

592
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,020
I...

593
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,590
Sir,

594
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,130
are you going to sell me off?

595
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,700
Mister, do you know

596
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,220
what I meant when I uttered the phrase

597
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,940
"destined one"?

598
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,870
Your name is Hongying.

599
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,410
The surname Hong is very rare.

600
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,460
Is that your surname?

601
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,670
I do not have

602
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,300
a surname.

603
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,760
From today onward, you shall have one.

604
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
Your surname will be Mu.

605
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,070
He's the head of the Mu family.

606
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,360
That's what I meant by saying
that he's your destined one.

607
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,170
Patriarch of Blood River,

608
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,570
are you trying to steal one of my men?

609
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,610
You can pick and choose

610
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,770
any items in the room

611
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:43,451
that will amount to the same value as her.

612
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
But now,

613
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Hongying is mine.

614
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,350
The token they gave you

615
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,600
was a fake.
The Shadow Sect

616
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,940
has the real deal.

617
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,240
If so, I will owe you for now.

618
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,980
You may choose your items

619
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,940
once I retrieve the token.

620
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,780
It's a deal.

621
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,170
Miss,

622
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,350
from today onward,

623
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,150
you're a member of the Mu family.

624
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,820
[Zhe]

625
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,406
It turns out that the enemy of Shadow Sect

626
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,950
is Xiao Ruofeng, the Prince of Langya.

627
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,406
The Four Guardians of Tianqi City
and the Inner Security Division,

628
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,220
which were founded by him,

629
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,810
robbed Shadow Sect of their power.

630
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,460
Therefore, they gave

631
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,890
the Three Officials an order.

632
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,090
They instructed the Patriarch

633
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,300
to deal with Second Master Tang

634
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,260
to lure Tang Lianyue

635
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
out of Tianqi City.

636
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,630
After that, they used us

637
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,890
to get rid of Tang Lianyue,

638
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,360
eliminating a powerful foe
of theirs in the process.

639
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,090
This muddy affair in Tianqi City

640
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,030
is much more troublesome than I thought.

641
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,430
Given your identity,

642
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,390
you had to slip away from
that place day after day.

643
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,536
Aren't you afraid that the Prince of Langya

644
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,220
might find out about you?

645
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,850
Many people knew

646
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,840
that I wasn't willing to
remain at the imperial mausoleum.

647
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,330
If I kept watch

648
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,700
over the mausoleum

649
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,060
without doing anything,

650
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
I assume

651
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,560
[Zhuo Qing, Former Great Eunuch]
they need to be worried about that.

652
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,110
Speaking of which,

653
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,790
Sect Leader,

654
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,310
how's that pledge of loyalty

655
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,900
coming lately?

656
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,730
Just tell First Prince

657
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
to enjoy the show.

658
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,980
I will use Blood River

659
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,460
to eliminate

660
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,060
our common foe.

661
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,820
Excellent.

662
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:36,380
It's good that you're confident.

663
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,060
When will we meet the Umbrella Ghost?

664
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,150
He will attend the banquet

665
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,940
in three days.

666
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:49,420
If so, the sword qi that's approaching us,

667
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,690
who does it belong to?

668
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,610
He has an immense sword qi,

669
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,460
yet his killing intent is well-hidden.

670
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,170
A ferocious sword

671
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,610
that will devour its wielder

672
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,130
if he doesn't keep it in check...

673
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,250
Su Muyu!

674
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,710
How dare you?

675
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,500
So, you are Su Muyu.

676
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Excellent.

677
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,710
We were supposed to meet in three days.

678
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,290
But you're here today.

679
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,110
Why is that the case?

680
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
The goal of this trip

681
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,630
wasn't to let Shadow
Sect seek out Blood River.

682
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,460
It's the opposite.

683
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,760
You wish to meet me in three days.

684
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,376
However, I wish to meet you

685
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,540
today.

686
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,090
You're quite different from the tales

687
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
I've heard about you.

688
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,940
Care to explain yourself?

689
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,770
Rumor has it that Su Muyu

690
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,130
resembled a swordsman

691
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,980
more than an assassin.

692
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,160
He had a gentle personality,

693
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,960
and he treated everyone with respect.

694
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,500
But when you came,

695
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
you drew your sword.

696
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
When you spoke,

697
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,210
you wanted to rob the host of his power.

698
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,990
Now, there are no longer any
assassins left in Blood River.

699
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,950
As the head of the Su family,

700
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,190
I have to adopt a stronger attitude.

701
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,630
However, Sect Leader Yi, this
is your residence after all.

702
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,150
I'm a guest.

703
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,880
It's indeed rude of me

704
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,130
to show up unannounced.

705
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,290
If you don't welcome me,

706
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,570
I can leave right now.

707
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,210
In three days,

708
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,250
you would've been able to enjoy

709
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,610
the Jiantian Feast prepared
by Zhaiyue Restaurant.

710
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
What a shame.

711
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,360
Since

712
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,020
you're already here,

713
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,730
I have to host you somehow.

714
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,110
Crow.
Yes, sir.

715
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,690
Tell the kitchen

716
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,040
to prepare some dishes for us.

717
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,900
I need to have a chat

718
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
with Master Su.

719
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,310
Thank you.

720
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,630
Come.

721
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,110
Mr. Su,
please.

722
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,170
Mr. Su, I'm sure you're still perplexed.

723
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,770
Blood River and Shadow Sect

724
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,610
weren't related from the start.

725
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,020
However,

726
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,420
now, it seems

727
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,210
we're bound by countless invisible threads.

728
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
Soul Reapers' Hall

729
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,726
was the one that assigned
all missions to Blood River.

730
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,780
We always thought

731
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,206
that someone in the martial world
put a huge bounty on their targets

732
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,230
and hired Soul Reapers'
Hall to put a hit on them.

733
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,320
I never expected Shadow Sect to be
the one assigning our missions to us.

734
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,900
Speaking of that,

735
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,980
we need to trace back to the time

736
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,360
when Beili had first
established its own state.

737
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,130
This is

738
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,420
a long stretch of history.

739
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,340
[Yi's Residence]

740
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,170
However, Su Changhe and I, who lead

741
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
the current Blood River,

742
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,860
have nothing to do

743
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,976
with the Shadow Guards
that existed centuries ago.

744
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I know.

745
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,080
You guys are Nameless.

746
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
You two aren't connected

747
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,420
to the lineage of Blood River.

748
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
You're wrong.

749
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
The current Blood River

750
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,380
is a true family.

751
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,980
And, we will choose our own paths.

752
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,170
You guys are too young.

753
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,770
It seems you guys don't know anything.

754
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
For example,

755
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,960
Wanjuan Tower.

756
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
Wanjuan Tower?

757
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
That's right.

758
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,020
Wanjuan Tower.

759
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,540
For the past few centuries,

760
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,570
Blood River was under Shadow Sect.

761
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,090
The address of Blood River,

762
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,210
which ordinary people could never locate,

763
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,020
Spider's Nests that were spread throughout

764
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,940
the world,

765
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,250
your true identities,

766
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,980
the martial arts you use, your weaknesses,

767
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,650
and your portraits

768
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,500
were all kept within the Shadow Sect.

769
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,870
If you attempt to betray us,

770
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,590
all this information

771
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,020
will surface in the martial world.

772
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,060
You all are assassins
who've slain countless people.

773
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
When we look around,

774
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,780
the martial world

775
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,420
is filled with your sworn enemies.

776
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,630
By that time,

777
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,500
all of you

778
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,980
will be hunted down.

779
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
I know.

780
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,340
You guys will surely think

781
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,690
that the current Shadow Sect

782
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,430
only has an empty reputation

783
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,720
of an organization led by
the emperor's father-in-law.

784
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,420
You think that we had fallen from grace

785
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,770
in Tianqi City.

786
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,936
You think that we're even
inferior to Blood River.

787
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,090
What gives us the right

788
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,130
to be the master of Blood River?

789
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,630
However,

790
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,020
as long as I'm willing,

791
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,860
I can eradicate Blood River.

792
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,900
You guys wish to
establish a new Blood River

793
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,060
and start from scratch.

794
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
You see,

795
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,500
it's good for youngsters
to have lofty aspirations.

796
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,460
But sometimes,

797
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,900
they should stop

798
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,340
and assess their abilities first.

799
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,200
Do you guys truly think

800
00:40:19,201 --> 00:40:20,801
that you can resist the years of control

801
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,770
of the Shadow Sect

802
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,940
with the likes of you?

803
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,340
Tell me your condition.

804
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,940
I allowed you guys to come to Tianqi City

805
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,690
because I needed you all
to kill someone for me.

806
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,230
Who is it?

807
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,460
The Prince of Langya,

808
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,060
Xiao Ruofeng.

809
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,536
Blood River is the shadow
that handles the martial world

810
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,090
on the Xiao imperial line's behalf.

811
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
The Shadow Sect

812
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,570
is the shadow that protects Tianqi City

813
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,900
in the dark.

814
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,980
If so, what happens in Tianqi City

815
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,240
should be unrelated to Blood River.

816
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,400
The Prince of Langya is a
member of the Xiao imperial line.

817
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,630
Assassinating him

818
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,550
would mean going against the
beliefs of both organizations.

819
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,090
This isn't the duty of Shadow Sect.

820
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,540
You're just doing this for your own desire.

821
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,190
Since that's the case,

822
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,940
you must offer something in exchange.

823
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,630
What do you

824
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,920
desire?

825
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,020
Everything you said just now

826
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,690
must vanish

827
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,940
from the world entirely.

828
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,090
From now on, Blood River

829
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,860
and Shadow Sect will be unrelated.

830
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,690
It seems

831
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,900
that's the end of our negotiation.

832
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Crow,

833
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,270
see our guest off.

834
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,460
Sir, you know the best

835
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,130
about the task

836
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,690
you wish to assign to us.

837
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,480
The Prince of Langya has the
most military strength in Beili.

838
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,670
Even the emperor

839
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,430
has to show him respect
in the imperial court.

840
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
In the martial world,

841
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,536
he's known as the senior
brother of Baili Dongjun,

842
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,980
the lord of Xueyue City.

843
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,880
If I kill him,

844
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,980
I'll offend the entire world.

845
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,900
I don't think

846
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,960
you have the right to
negotiate a deal with me.

847
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,380
If word of Blood River spreads

848
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,730
across the jianghu,

849
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,340
then we, with nowhere to go,

850
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,540
will make Tianqi City

851
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,980
our first stop.
