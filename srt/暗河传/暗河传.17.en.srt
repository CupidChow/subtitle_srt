00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,610
more than once.

178
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,890
You know,

179
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,010
you're really dull.

180
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:20,980
I only wanted

181
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,250
to torture him a little.

182
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,710
Anything else you want to say?

183
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,990
Out of the last shred of conscience,

184
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
I'm willing to listen.

185
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,940
If you're a shadow...

186
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,580
you'll be a shadow for life.

187
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,460
A shadow

188
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,940
that wants to step into the sun...

189
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,890
can only vanish.

190
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,670
You lot...

191
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,370
will fail in the end.

192
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,100
What rotten luck!

193
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,340
[Yellow Springs]

194
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,150
Su Muyu,

195
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,300
we can call today

196
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,180
a sweeping victory.

197
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,650
Let me take you to Diaolou Cottage

198
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,670
for a drink!

199
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,220
We didn't just burn the Shadow Sect,

200
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,990
but also the Imperial
Father-in-Law's Manor it hid behind.

201
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,730
We need to leave Tianqi City at once.

202
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,980
If a shadow wants to step into the sun,

203
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,300
it can only vanish.

204
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,120
So if the Shadow Sect stopped being itself

205
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,280
and put on the Imperial
Father-in-Law's name,

206
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,060
is that what it means

207
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,420
for a shadow

208
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,490
to stand in the light?

209
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,750
So,

210
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,820
what Yi Bu said just now

211
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,730
wasn't only a curse on us...

212
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,820
it mirrors his own lot.

213
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,910
What are you thinking about?

214
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Nothing.

215
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Oh...

216
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
this is for you.

217
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
What is it?

218
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,180
These were in your compartment.

219
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
I didn't check it.

220
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,280
You've never remembered
your childhood, have you?

221
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,820
See what's written on it.

222
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,870
The past...

223
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,150
why fuss over it?

224
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,360
From here on, Blood River,

225
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,910
you and I...

226
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
have only tomorrow!

227
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,749
[Ever Forward]

228
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,750
Your Highness.
General.

229
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,216
The Imperial Father-in-Law's
Manor is ablaze.

230
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,010
Looks like... Blood River won.

231
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,416
What about the Prince of Langya?

232
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,840
He was ambushed at Fengxiao Temple,

233
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,530
but he seems unharmed.

234
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,490
Right now,

235
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,696
he's returning with the
Guardian Azure Dragon,

236
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Li Xinyue.

237
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,350
You may go.

238
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,380
The Shadow Sect really is worthless.

239
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,220
I'd hoped this bout

240
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,090
would leave them and the Langya faction

241
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,810
both crippled.

242
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
So be it.

243
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,550
So be it.

244
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,140
With the Shadow Sect gone,

245
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,700
Father's fear of the Prince of Langya

246
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,180
only deepens.

247
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,490
Which means

248
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,420
it's time to set my board.

249
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,310
Muyu.

250
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,290
Who's the Patriarch here anyway?

251
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,200
Why doesn't anyone
greet me first?

252
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,180
How'd those goons

253
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
you ran into fare?

254
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,800
Changli's crew are handling the bodies.

255
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,416
The Fengxiao Temple mission wrapped too.

256
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,290
Uncle Qidao has gone back ahead.

257
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
As for Mu Ciling,

258
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,010
he said

259
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,630
he's heading to the inn to heal first.

260
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,620
When "dear Muyu" is done,

261
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,010
go cure his poison.

262
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,490
After that he'll be done

263
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,830
with Blood River.

264
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,510
Fine.

265
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
I'll go in a bit.

266
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,460
I meant to wait at the inn.

267
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,290
Didn't expect we'd meet here first.

268
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,110
You acted recklessly again?

269
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,980
Your inner force is nearly spent.

270
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,180
It will cost a lot of my good medicine.

271
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
I wasn't reckless.

272
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,070
I did what I could.

273
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,270
He can vouch for me.

274
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,530
I...

275
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,920
I don't take your word for it.

276
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,700
Xuewei and I

277
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,900
will check on Changli.

278
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,530
If they're done,

279
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,050
we'll head back to the house.

280
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Young miracle physician,

281
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,830
I tried to kill you last time...

282
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
Sorry about that.

283
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,830
No worries.

284
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,160
We were just on different sides.

285
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,900
Don't dwell on it.

286
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,110
It's all in the past.

287
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,030
Farewell.

288
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,510
Farewell.

289
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,070
Farewell.

290
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Get lost.

291
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,670
You're not taking your best buddy here?

292
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,460
I took it as a given you'd come with me.

293
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
At Wanjuan Tower,

294
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,980
I learned a few things

295
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,420
about No-Sword City.

296
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,630
I need to make a trip to Homeland.

297
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Homeland?

298
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,380
Why are you still wasting time here?

299
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,270
Everything's packed?

300
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,570
We're assassins out to kill.

301
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,830
What's there to pack?

302
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,526
My father headed back
to Nan'an City ahead of me.

303
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,550
What about you two?

304
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
Coming with us

305
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,120
or heading back to Blood River?

306
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,900
I've got matters to handle.

307
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Once they're done,

308
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,520
I'll come to Nan'an for you.

309
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,590
All right.

310
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,240
You may go.
Got it.

311
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,820
[Xiao Ruojin, Emperor Mingde]

312
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
Your Majesty.

313
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,940
Here so early to see me,

314
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
what is it?

315
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,486
[Jin Xuan, Great Eunuch] Last
night the Shadow Sect burned down.

316
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,630
Imperial Father-in-Law Yi Bu

317
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,790
was burned to death.

318
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Yi Bu is dead?

319
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,270
Yes.

320
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
The blaze was massive.

321
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,050
The entire manor is gone.

322
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,330
Countless casualties.

323
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
So that means...

324
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,420
From last night,

325
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,870
the Shadow Sect no longer exists.

326
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,220
Did he need to be that ruthless?

327
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,490
Two of a trade seldom agree.

328
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Besides,

329
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,770
he never liked Yi Bu.

330
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Was it really him?

331
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,700
A secret report reached the palace

332
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,790
that last night,

333
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,730
he wasn't at his own manor.

334
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,570
Ending it so absolutely

335
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,330
doesn't quite fit his style.

336
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,770
But our prince

337
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,860
isn't the man he was anymore,

338
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
is he?

339
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Enough.

340
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,480
Call it an accidental fire

341
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
and leave it at that.

342
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,030
Have the Court of
Judicial Review handle it.

343
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,270
As you command.

344
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
Has Consort Xuan

345
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,140
heard the news?

346
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,790
The Seventh Prince

347
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,730
entered the palace this morning.

348
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,860
By now, Her Ladyship

349
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,270

[Prince of Langya's Manor]

351
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Why would Blood River

352
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,380
help us wipe out the Shadow Sect?

353
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,490
You think I hired them?

354
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,770
Those earlier attempts on my life

355
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,570
were staged as a setup.

356
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,940
It's not what I think.

357
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,090
It's what everyone in
Tianqi City will think.

358
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,320
They'll all link the fall
of the Shadow Sect to you.

359
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,050
And your elder brother

360
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,110
will think so too.

361
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,880
Then let them think so. I don't care.

362
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,940
I don't believe

363
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,330
you'd choose that method.

364
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,010
Which is why you and I can be friends.

365
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,010
This wasn't my doing.

Su Changhe and Su Muyu of Blood River

369
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,800
are remarkable.

370

They said they'd change Blood River.

371
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,590
I don't think that's empty talk.

372
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,290
They've cut every chain

373
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,620
on their necks.

374
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,440
They're no longer someone else's pawns.

375

The only shackles left

376
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,460
are rumor and prejudice.

377
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,730
But that's the hardest part.

378
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,770
