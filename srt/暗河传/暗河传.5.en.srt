5
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,020
Sir,

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,540
are you ready?

7
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,410
Yes.

8
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,540
Please start.

9
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,820
It's already this bad.

10
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,010
Mu Bai.

11
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,500
Did you kill Chou the Ox?

12
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,450
I did.

13
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,770
What of it?

14
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,940
Then today,

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,260
we'll avenge him!

16
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,910
Split up!

17
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,220
Xie Huxiao of the Xie family,

18
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,570
your edge isn't what it was.

19
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,980
He inherits the Dragonfang Saber.

20
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,940
Huxiao,

21
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,690
looks like the Xies have produced

22
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,010
a killer sharper than us.

23
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,410
You're Buxie?

24
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,940
You've grown this much?

25
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,350
Back then, the very first

26
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,130
to teach me the blade was you.

27
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,220
I've waited for this fight

28
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,540
a long time.

29
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,940
That little blade fanatic

30
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,130
has become a true blade fanatic.

31
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,340
No idea where Su Muyu is.

32
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,890
Don't keep thinking

33
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,850
about your dream boy.

34
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,570
We're here on business.

35
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,450
The Mu family's fake diviner is here?

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,660
Fine.

37
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,940
Then let me do a quick reading.

38
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,890
How will

39
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,130
this fight end?

40
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,540
Ah, the blossom side's up,

41
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,130
a sign of good luck!

42
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,380
Fraud.

43
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,380
Get over yourself!

44
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,220
Senior.

45
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,220
Do you think

46
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,700
they can break in?

47
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,050
They must have made

48
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,220
very thorough preparations.

49
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,100
And among us...

50
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,220
they have an insider.

51
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,580
I haven't contacted

52
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,250
Blood River headquarters

53
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,030
for many years

54
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,140
to this day.

55
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,850
Perhaps I already

56
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,460
switched to the enemy's side?

57
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,050
I believe you, Senior.

58
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,810
I thought

59
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,140
you had long put me

60
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,780
on the kill list.

61
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,610
Backed into a corner,

62
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,100
sometimes we're powerless.

63
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,700
All we can do

64
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,140
is trust each other.

65
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,370
I trust you the most.

66
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,290
Even if I betray the Spider Shadow Sect,

67
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,490
I believe you'll still stand

68
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,810
by the Patriarch.

69
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,540
What a...

70
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,170
moving speech.

71
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,100
So moving

72
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,170
that I should die for it.

73
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,020
It's the spear array!

74
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,610
Qingyang,

75
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,490
hold them off a while.

76
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,370
I'll go find Muyu.

77
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,220
You're so faithless!

78
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,980
What are you waiting for?

79
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,460
Kill them now.

80
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,170
This isn't a spar.

81
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,250
It's life and death.

82
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,900
I'm not here to kill.

83
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,410
And I told you

84
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,540
I'm here

85
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,810
only to find Su Muyu.

86
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,540
Besides,

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,250
they're from Xie family too.

88
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,100
We all knew each other.

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,700
The day they joined the Spider Shadow Sect,

90
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,930
they were

91
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,220
no longer of the Xie family.

92
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,410
To join the Spider Shadow Sect

93
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,930
is every Blood River warrior's honor.

94
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,370
And they

95
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,050
should have been

96
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,460
your Xie family's pride!

97
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,610
Should I call you Mr. Luo

98
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,340
or Mr. Ke?

99
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,170
My master mentioned you.

100
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,490
I've heard a lot.

101
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,170
Go find Su Muyu.

102
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,780
I'll hold him off.

103
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,810
The array's core is here!

104
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,050
All right.

105
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,930
We can move on now.

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,100
No one is leaving!

107
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,010
Soul-Swap Technique.

108
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,700
So the Patriarch's inner world looks like this.

109
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,940
It's literal hell.

110
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,890
What bug is that?

111
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,580
It disturbed me.

112
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,220
That's the old master's

113
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,130
messenger dagger.

114
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,340
Changhe,

115
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,300
he's urging you...

116
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,010
Nope.

117
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,130
Let me nap.

118
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,530
You little brat,

119
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,420
you're laying a board, huh?

120
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,100
You're the sharp one, Uncle Zhe.

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,580
They're all inside my setup,

122
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,770
just waiting for me to...

123
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,730
reap the reward.

124
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,580
Su Muyu!

125
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,180
I haven't met you.

126
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,700
Looks like the Xie family

127
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,130
hid a fine killer.

128
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,580
I often asked my master

129
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,100
how my blade work was.

130
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,370
He always said

131
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:30,980
my blade skills

132
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,420
are already first

133
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,530
among this generation.

134
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,180
But compared

135
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,730
with the sword-first Su Muyu,

136
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,460
there's still a long gap.

137
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,300
Who is your master?

138
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,180
Xie Qidao

139
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,420
from the Xie family.

140
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,940
Uncle Qidao

141
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,060
is a fine teacher.

142
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,650
You're his disciple...

143
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,420
No wonder you got this far.

144
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,460
Keep your compliments.

145
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,850
The best praise for me

146
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,490
is a fight!

147
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,370
Su Muyu,

148
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,530
stand down here.

149
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,300
Xuewei,

150
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:03,940
you're here.

151
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,770
Do not interrupt

152
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,730
our duel.

153
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,850
If you interfere,

154
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,580
I'll kill you!

155
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,220
You're threatening me?

156
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,770
Just a warning.

157
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,420
As you wish!

158
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm here to fight with your sword,

159
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,820
not a shabby umbrella!

160
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,060
The umbrella is my sword.

161
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,220
You know what I expect.

162
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,100
Do I

163
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,300
lack the standing

164
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,770
to see your Eighteen-Sword Array?

165
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,530
Use your blade

166
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,850
to witness my sword.

167
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,460
Fine!

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,770
Still-Arms Technique...

169
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,700
The Xie family's secret art,

170
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,490
near-invincible.

171
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,060
Su Muyu, careful!

172
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,420
Reveal your real skills,

173
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,060
or you'll die under my blade!

174
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,980
Your blade work is superb.

175
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,490
No wonder Uncle Qidao called you

176
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,890
this era's top bladesman.

177
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,250
But his other line

178
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,340
is also true.

179
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,010
What?

180
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,940
The gap between us

181
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,300
is a chasm.

182
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,890
Eighteen-Sword Array, activate!

183
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,300
So this is the Eighteen-Sword Array.

184
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,460
One person alone

185
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,300
can command so many blades.

186
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,180
This old man

187
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,530
who sometimes looks kindly and gentle...

188
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,490
what past does he really carry?

189
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,980
Who's there?

190
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,300
Tonight...

191
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,370
If we both die here,

192
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,650
are you afraid?

193
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,700
Die here...

194
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,850
Don't talk about death.

195
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,940
Sir,

196
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,650
let me finish this drag.

197
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,730
Then I'll go out and wipe them out!

198
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,340
Su Zhe,

199
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,180
I give you my word.

200
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,650
If this time

201
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,130
we make it out alive,

202
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,700
I'll allow you to leave Blood River for a while

203
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,100
to see your wife and daughter.

204
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,610
Only for a while?

205
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,010
Wife...

206
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,460
And daughter...

207
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,300
Sir...

208
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,530
After today,

209
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,650
consider this term's Kui

210
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,530
already dead.

211
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,100
Kui?

212
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,980
I hate this role.

213
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,460
I'm leaving Blood River.

214
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,010
I want to be with my wife

215
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,250
and daughter for life,

216
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,610
live together, happy.

217
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,650
My dear...

218
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,100
I poisoned him,

219
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,820
and left a mark.

220
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,100
Even if he cures it,

221
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,730
he will forever

222
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,180
carry that mark.

223
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,490
Even if he flees to the ends of the earth,

224
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,980
even if his whole life

225
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,130
he never dares face me,

226
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,610
he still won't forget me.

227
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,420
So it's you.

228
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,490
So...

229
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,770
I'd already met you.

230
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,660
Who are you?

231
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:29,860
I...

232
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,570
You can see me?

233
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,010
Has the Patriarch's

234
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,010
self-awareness in this illusion

235
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,090
awakened?

236
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,490
Oh no!

237
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,600
Who...

238
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,860
exactly are you?

239
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,660
This...

240
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,620
this is a dream.

241
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,330
A dream?

242
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,530
Yes!

243
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,770
I...

244
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,530
I am only a figure

245
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,570
passing through your dream.

246
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:02,860
Right.

247
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,810
That's it.

248
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,090
Back away slowly.

249
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,570
Just slip out of his sight.

250
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,730
Who sent you?

251
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,330
Phantom Step.

252
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,180
You're of the Su family.

253
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,140
But the Su family dared betray me!

254
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,660
Too bad.

255
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,900
If I'm killed in this illusion,

256
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,700
will the real me die?

257
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,010
Master never taught me this.

258
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,380
No.

259
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,730
The Su family betrayed me long ago.

260
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,380
Only Su Muyu

261
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,490
still stands with me.

262
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,980
Why am I

263
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,460
still so surprised?

264
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,570
Could it be

265
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,570
his present memories

266
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,900
are affecting

267
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,760
his former self in here?

268
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,660
Who are you really?

269
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,570
I...

270
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,570
I'm Bai Hehuai.

271
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,250
the miracle physician treating you.

272
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,700
I came

273
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,940
to search

274
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,620
for a way to cure you!

275
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,900
But you use Su family arts.

276
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,460
You're lying to me!

277
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,940
So it turns out

278
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,010
being killed in the illusion

279
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,900
just gets you thrown out.

280
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,180
I'll ask again

281
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,220
the question from before.

282
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,140
Who...

283
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,250
are you really?

284
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,900
The Eighteen-Sword Array is up.

285
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,770
Can you break through my array?

286
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,730
I don't see a way to crack it.

287
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,180
But...

288
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,330
only obstacles you can't cross

289
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,010
make crossing meaningful,

290
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,570
right?

291
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,980
Only winning a doomed game

292
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,700
gives winning meaning.

293
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,290
You're a blade fanatic.

294
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,700
Maybe.

295
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,460
Master says so too.

296
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,810
What about you, Lord Kui?

297
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,250
Are you a sword fanatic?

298
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,250
A sword is just a weapon.

299
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,660
Cling too hard to the sword itself

300
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,770
and you become its slave.

301
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,220
Did a Blood River master

302
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,980
tell you that?

303
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:52,980
No.

304
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,180
These words

305
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,420
were carved on No-Sword City's wall.

306
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,980
You've practiced from dawn to dusk.

307
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,290
You're really

308
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,660
[Zhuo Yuluo from No-Sword City]
a persistent kid.

309
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,980
Because I want to become

310
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,250
as skilled as you, Father.

311
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,810
Oh, Father,

312
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,010
Third Uncle lives for the sword.

313
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,220
So why

314
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,570
you've long reached the Heaven level

315
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,490
while he's still stuck

316
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,490
at the Earth level?

317
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,700
Because

318
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,860
his heart holds nothing but practice.

319
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,700
That's why

320
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,730
he can't move forward.

321
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,730
I don't get it.

322
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,380
Father, what do you have in your heart

323
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,380
that he doesn't?

324
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,570
Silly child,

325
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,700
I have you in mine.

326
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,570
Your devotion to the blade is pure,
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

327
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,770
but why must you beat me?

328
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,810
Just to be stronger than I?

329
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,330
If all you see is strong vs. weak,

330
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,180
then your blade

331
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,810
will never be the strongest.

332
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,050
Win or lose,

333
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,700
that's what gives meaning to me!

334
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,700
This strike...

335
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,460
It deserves respect.

336
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,620
Does Eighteen-Sword Array mean

337
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,620
only eighteen swords?

338
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,330
Why not one hundred eighty,

339
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,140
one thousand eight hundred?

340
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,980
Or eighteen thousand?

341
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,490
What was

342
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,420
that last strike called?

343
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,250
Flying blades scattered,

344
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,490
like evening rain.

345
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,010
Long sword strikes,

346
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,730
like unstoppable rainbow.

347
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,570
That strike takes my name,

348
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,620
Muyu.

349
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,220
You name it after yourself?

350
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,770
Someday I'll forge a technique

351
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,090
named after myself, Buxie.

352
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,730
You're devoted to the blade,

353
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,090
obsessed with it.

354
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,700
Everything you fight for

355
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,620
is for the blade.

356
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,490
But a blade is dead steel.

357
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,050
You need to find

358
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,660
the cause and the reason

359
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,620
that's truly worth dying for.

360
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,810
A reason?

361
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,860
I don't get it.

362
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,940
Like how I must defeat you,

363
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,250
because I can't lose.

364
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,050
I still don't get you.

365
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,660
But to beat you,

366
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,250
I'll try to find it.

367
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,980
You're leaving?

368
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,290
I said earlier

369
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,460
I didn't come here

370
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,090
to kill anyone.

371
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,330
Xuewei,

372
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,660
don't tell me you want a fight too?

373
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,900
Fight my foot.

374
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,290
You're bleeding.

375
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,810
Treat it now.

376
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,620
I don't dare use your meds.

377
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,810
I've got a young miracle physician with me now.

378
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,220
I won't dare use

379
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,620
your medicine that can kill a cow.

380
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,730
Your young miracle physician?

381
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,980
You sure she's still alive?

382
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,220
If you want to save her,

383
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,730
break my poison array first.

384
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,050
Xuewei,

385
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,460
you know clearly

386
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,460
this array won't hold me long.

387
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,330
Sir,

388
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,050
trust me.

389
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,730
I mean no harm.

390
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,380
You wield Su family arts.

391
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,460
You use this Soul-Swap Technique

392
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,380
not to detox me

393
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,570
at all,

394
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,220
but to pry

395
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,420
into my mind's secrets!

396
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,420
Trying to learn

397
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,140
Blood River's secrets?

398
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,530
Did those fools

399
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,980
from the Three Families ever tell you?

400
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,330
Some secrets

401
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,220
kill faster

402
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,340
the more you know!

403
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,810
Sir...

404
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,270
Die!

405
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,090
Mu Xuewei

406
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,420
of the Mu family?

407
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,940
Su family's Three-Needle Threading.

408
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,900
Who are you really?

409
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,620
Don't even know who I am,

410
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,660
and you struck that hard!

411
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:34,980
Trap.

412
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,180
Oh no.

413
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,530
They've breached the rear courtyard.

414
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,570
Su Muyu, you liar!

415
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,460
You promised with you here,

416
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,570
I'd be safe and sound!

417
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,460
Physician!

418
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:06,980
Su Muyu!

419
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,980
Why are you going down there?

420
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,220
I just found him.

421
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,050
I don't want to die yet!

422
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,700
Physician, don't panic!

423
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,940
You really came.

424
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,530
I promised you.

425
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:27,810
With me here,

426
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,330
you'll be safe.

427
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,090
That's high.

428
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,730
How do we get across?

429
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,460
That stone gate weighs a ton.

430
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,250
My palm force won't budge it.

431
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,570
Xuewei

432
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,900
pays respects to you, Sir.

433
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,980
Sleep smoke...

434
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,620
Let's move.

435
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,660
Don't rush.

436
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:16,570
Oh no!

437
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,860
I'm doomed!

438
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,940
I forgot it.

439
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:19,980
What now?

440
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,420
I'm really going to die of poison.

441
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,420
Antidote!

442
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,290
Hurry!

443
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,450
Or I'll actually die soon.

444
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,290
You're losing outside?

445
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,530
Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow

446
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,220
aren't that easy to handle.

447
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,570
At most,

448
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,140
we can hold for a while.

449
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,770
Where's that kid from Xie family?

450
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,490
He left.

451
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,810
Left?

452
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,770
What about Su Muyu?

453
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,570
He jumped into that pit

454
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,250
with the miracle physician from Medicine King Valley.

455
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:01,900
Perfect.

456
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,220
Toss poison down there,

457
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,320
the deadliest kind.

458
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,460
Are you insane?

459
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,730
Su Muyu is still inside!

460
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,530
You gave him an antidote,

461
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,180
sealed in his sword hilt.

462
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,770
You think I don't know about it?

463
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,700
Poison them.

464
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,380
We can't miss this chance!

465
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,250
Su Muyu doesn't have to die,

466
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,490
but that physician must die today!

467
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,010
Hurry!

468
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,660
Careful.

469
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,730
Why?

470
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,460
It's poison.

471
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,010
Take it.

472
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,010
I know it's poison.

473
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,220
I mean,

474
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,050
why should I be careful?

475
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,490
I'm from Medicine King Valley,

476
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,730
the Valley Lord's junior,

477
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,250
and the Wen family head's granddaughter.

478
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,380
You think I'm scared of poison?

479
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,010
Classic you,

480
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,090
really are full of surprises.

481
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,380
But...

482
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,730
what poison art

483
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,660
did that lady train?

484
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,530
She makes herself

485
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,620
out-and-out poisonous.

486
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,700
When Xuewei was little,

487
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,660
she learned the Poison-Sand Palm.

488
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:30,980
Sharp eye, physician.

489
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,810
You spotted it at once.

490
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,290
Once we're out,

491
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,530
I'll fill you in

492
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,180
on the details.

493
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,460
For now, the priority

494
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,050
is getting back to the Patriarch.

495
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,770
Although I've destroyed the blade

496
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,330
that breached Spider's Nest,

497
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,530
Changhe hasn't even moved yet.

498
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,050
The Wen family has plenty

499
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:50,900
who practice poison arts,

500
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,490
but more often than not,

501
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,730
they poison themselves

502
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,490
before they kill others.

503
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,860
Still, that Poison-Sand Palm

504
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,770
isn't exactly

505
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,010
some complex art.

506
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,050
She must've slipped in training.

507
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,530
Some mishap, who knows,

508
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,490
that spread venom through her body.

509
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,940
By rights,

510
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,180
she shouldn't have survived.

511
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,330
She must've been saved

512
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,220
by something miraculous.

513
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,940
Looks like I guessed right.

514
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,180
Even so,

515
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,620
though she lived,

516
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,810
the poison remains.

517
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,420
If someone carelessly brushes

518
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,660
against her,

519
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,570
they'll die miserably

520
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,700
in a short time.

521
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,460
Can you cure her?

522
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,980
She tried to kill me on sight!

523
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,570
Even after I dove into this secret passage,

524
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,810
she sent a poisonous blossom

525
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,570
chasing after me.

526
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,530
And you want her saved now?

527
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,530
That doesn't track.

528
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,570
Sorry.

529
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,460
She's steeped in venom,

530
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,050
but she's gentle,

531
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,140
keeps her distance from people

532
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,980
for fear of harming them.

533
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,900
If she struck at you,

534
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,050
it was likely

535
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,050
under family orders.

536
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,480
Su Muyu,

537
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,190
I'm honestly curious

538
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,140
what kind of

539
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,420
softhearted idealist you are.

540
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,220
She truly meant to kill me.

541
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,300
I could feel it.

542
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,010
As for why...

543
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,090
no idea.

544
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:19,660
Fine.

545
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,420
If after this,

546
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,290
she and I

547
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,570
are both alive

548
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,860
and no longer enemies,

549
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,380
I can cure her.

550
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:28,940
One condition,

551
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,940
simple...

552
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,330
We'll pay enough.

553
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,010
No wonder you're Blood River's Kui!

554
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,570
You catch on fast.

555
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,380
Then, Lord Kui,

556
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,290
how do we get out?

557
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,090
While we spoke,

558
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,420
I thought it through.

559
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,420
The mechanism should be at these two spots.

560
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,740
Let's move.

561
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,980
It looks kinda scary.

562
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,260
No traps, right?

563
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,130
No.

564
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,740
This is the escape route.

565
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,170
No more

566
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,010

570
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,980
time to work!

571
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,690
Bad luck.

572
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,940
Easy, master.

573
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,740
What's there to fear?

574
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,010
I just can't stand that crow,

575
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,340
so I cursed it.

Yes.

579
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:39,650
Sir.

580
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,260
Any news?

581
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,650
Xie and Mu joined up

582
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,340
and stormed Spider's Nest.

583
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,360
So far

584
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,610
they haven't taken the Dormant Dragon Sword.

585
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,380
But the Nest's defenses

586
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,780
are breached.

587
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,210
Those two old foxes

What about Su Changhe?

590
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,010
I wanted him to move at once.

591
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,530
Did the messenger dagger reach him?

592
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,130
He rejected it.

593
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,090
He rejected?

594
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,860
Sir,

595
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,300
Su Changhe

596
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,050
just won't fight Su Muyu.

597
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,090
If you ask me,

598
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,650
give me command.

599
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,530
I'll lead a strike now

600
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,820
and seize the Dormant Dragon Sword!

601
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,460
Only Su Changhe

602
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,380
can handle Su Muyu.

603
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,380
And only if our Su family

604
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,610
wins the Dormant Dragon Sword,

605
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,690
and holds both Su Muyu

00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,260
and Su Changhe,

607
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,780
will Xie and Mu

be kept in check.

Did you cure

615
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,900
the Patriarch's poison?

616
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,130
It's suppressed for now.

617
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,860
After performing the Soul-Swap Technique

618
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,260
on the Patriarch,

619
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,570
I've got some idea

620
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,340
how to treat the poison.

621
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,130
My thanks, physician.

622
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,530
Lord Kui,

623
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,210
I suddenly remembered something.

624
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,300
That day,

625
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,650
leaving the Medicine Hall,

626
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,490
I met a man at the gate

627
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,490
with a staff in hand.

628
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,210
Was he from your Su family?

629
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,300
That was Uncle Zhe.

630
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,820
He was...

631
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,820
the previous Kui, right?

632
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,420
Looks like you already found

633
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,460
the answer yourself.

634
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,530
Won't you ask me

635
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,380
why I need to know?

636
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,050
That's your secret.

637
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,650
I won't pry.

638
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,900
Didn't you say

639
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,300
Blood River's Kui

640
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,900
guard the Patriarch

641
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,980
to the death?

642
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,690
Then why

643
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,300
could he step down?

644
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,860
No one knows.

645
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,320
It's a secret

646
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,140
between Uncle Zhe and the Patriarch.

647
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,610
I know!

648
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,610
In the Patriarch's memories,

649
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,490
I saw it.

650
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,260
To protect him,

651
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,780
Uncle Zhe was badly hurt.

652
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,420
So the Patriarch

653
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,380
gave his word:

654
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,340
if they both survived,

655
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,490
he'd allow him

656
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,940
to lay down the title of Kui

657
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,130
and return him

658
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:32,530
his freedom.

659
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,420
Only somehow,

660
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,820
even then he didn't leave.

661
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,090
There's a secret passage in Spider's Nest.

662
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,300
It's long.

663
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,300
It runs straight to Sanli Pavilion outside the city.

664
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,340
Uncle Zhe,

665
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,380
how about we split up?

666
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,790
You wait at Sanli Pavilion

667
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,860
and kill that young miracle physician.

668
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,130
I'll hit Spider's Nest and take the Dormant Dragon Sword.

669
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,460
So many experts in the Su family,

670
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,340
why is it always us running errands?

671
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,380
You're commanding this time,

672
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,010
so call more people in.

673
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,860
I used to be a Nameless.

674
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,820
When I call the guys

675
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,530
to show up and help,

676
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,780
they barely look at me.

677
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,740
I've gone through fire with you

678
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,530
so many times,

679
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,010
I trust you.

680
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,610
You brat.

681
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,490
I know you're scheming

682
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,300
something nasty.

683
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,670
I won't question you,

684
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,460
and I won't stop you.

685
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,530
I'm just

686
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,980
a feelingless killer.

687
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,050
I do the job,

688
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,130
nothing else.

689
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,460
Uncle Zhe,

690
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,860
of everyone in the Su family,

691
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,340
I admire you most.

692
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,460
Don't you die on me!

693
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,740
Go get 'em!

694
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,740
There are three flames on a person's shoulders.

695
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,050
Don't pat them at random.

696
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,010
Snuff them out,

697
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,260
and you really die.

698
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,610
That hunchback Luo

699
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,490
is a pain.

700
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,300
What about the Mus?

701
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,690
Mu Qingyang and Mu Xuewei

702
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,860
broke the line for a bit,

703
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,210
but were stopped.

704
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,900
The Patriarch left.

705
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,420
The others were driven back

706
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,380
by Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow

707
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,570
and vanished.

708
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,130
Back to base now,

709
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,260
and report to Master.

710
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,210
Yes.

711
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,900
Su Changhe.

712
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,170
Xie Fanhua, you sickly ghost.

713
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,530
What a small world.

714
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,380
Looks like you lot

715
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,610
failed at Spider's Nest

716
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,380
and are in retreat.

717
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,780
You're here

718
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,050
to block my way?

719
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,130
No.

720
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,460
I'm just going to take a look at Spider's Nest.

721
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,210
Run into you again by chance.

722
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,010
If so,

723
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,780
please step aside, Undertaker.

724
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,900
You know, I'm an undertaker.

725
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,210
I didn't come

726
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,050
specifically for you,

727
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,210
but since we've met,

728
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,860
I should pay my respects.

729
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:03,570
You are

730
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,860
a standout of the Xie family,

731
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,260
so...

732
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,170
let me see you off.

733
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,380
Then try.

734
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,900
Why have you been

735
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,940
just standing there.

736
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,210
All together!

737
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,740
Fanhua,

738
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,210
I've been

739
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,610
watching Su Changhe.

740
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,940
I finally spotted a flaw

741
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,130
in his Inch Sword.

742
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,490
Please clear a path for me.

743
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,780
All right.
