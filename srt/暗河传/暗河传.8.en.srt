[Blood River]

00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,979
[Based on the novel of the same name
from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

3
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,020
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,490
You want to see my sword?

5
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,160
I want to see

6
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,930
who's the strongest swordsman

7
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,410
of this Su generation.

8
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,159
Why is the Su family's top swordsman

9
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
one of them?

10
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,650
Did Su Ze crown himself?

11
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
You use daggers.

12
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
If you take a sword,

13
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,310
I'll looked forward

14
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,390
to that instant

15
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,670
you draw,

16
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,570
to your blade's light.

17
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,860
Let's make a bet.

18
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,340
How many moves before Su Ze's down?

19
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,650
Ze is still too young.

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,770
Within five moves, I'd say.

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
I'll make another bet.

22
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,970
I predict that Su Muyu can defeat him

23
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,550
with just one move.

24
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,016
I heard that you practice the
Sword Art of Soul Destruction.

25
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,320
Is killing your foes not enough?

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,020
Do you have to destroy their souls as well?

27
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,630
Although there's a sinister
aura surrounding your sword,

28
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,486
there's no domineering aura surrounding it.

29
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,710
It's because you don't
understand the way of the sword.

30
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,610
Break!

31
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,806
A domineering aura
doesn't come from ferocity

32
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,830
or ruthlessness.

33
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,370
It comes with contempt.

34
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,790
The Dormant Dragon Sword?

35
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,300
[Sword Qi Soars]
Master Su.

36
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,210
Long time no see,

37
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Lord Kui.

38
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,320
The poison in the Patriarch's
body has been neutralized.

39
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,520
He instructed me to bring
the Dormant Dragon Sword here

40
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,630
and deliver it to you,
the head of the Su family.

41
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,520
What conditions does he have?

42
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,990
From now on, I,

43
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,510
Uncle Zhe,

44
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,230
Changhe,

45
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,990
the Patriarch, and the rest of us

46
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,930
will leave Blood River.

47
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,300
What has that got to do with me?

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
You traitor.

49
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,390
That's not it.

50
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,170
I'm serious.

51
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,830
Su Muyu.

52
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,910
Don't try to slander me.

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
Enough.

54
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
Just now, you said

55
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,060
"the rest of us",

56
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,490
who exactly is included?

57
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,400
I will come up with a name list.

58
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,250
Everyone in the name list

59
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,250
will leave Blood River.

60
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,250
Are you trying to disband Blood River?

61
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,490
Those who wish to remain may remain.

62
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,410
Those who wish to leave may leave.

63
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,599
I just hope to give

64
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,180
every member of Blood River

65
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,420
a chance to decide their fate.

66
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,810
Muyu, oh, Muyu.

67
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,520
You've served the Patriarch for many years.

68
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,620
You should know how ridiculous

69
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,930
this idea of yours is.

70
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,250
Even if I agree to it,

71
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,010
the Soul Reapers' Hall

72
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,810
will still

73
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,890
put a bounty on your heads.

74
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,160
They will chase you all
until the end of the world!

75
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,690
That's our business.

76
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,660
Right now, you just need to decide

77
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,230
whether you wish to wield the sword or not.

78
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Master Su.

79
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,010
This isn't the best timing

80
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,560
to wield the Dormant Dragon Sword.

81
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,570
You mustn't agree to

82
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,060
Su Muyu's condition.

83
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,250
The Patriarch

84
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,290
is trying to test me here.

85
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,270
Wielding this sword alone isn't enough.

86
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,180
I have to wield it

87
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,690
and leave Jiuxiao City in one piece.

88
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
When do you think

89
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,060
is the best time

90
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,590
and place

91
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,030
for me to wield it, then?

92
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,780
Opportunities are always fleeting.

93
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,670
Therefore,

94
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,120
the best timing

95
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,470
is the one you seize!

96
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
I shall take

97
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,130
the Dormant Dragon Sword.

98
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,350
Wait!

99
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,490
Don't you think

100
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,080
that it's too early for your family

101
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,630
to wield the Dormant Dragon Sword?

102
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,830
Who's that?

103
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,740
Mu Ciling, The Death Coffin.

104
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,170
That's Mu Ciling of the Mu family.

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
He shared the same master as Mu Zizhe,

106
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:15,801
who was the former family
head of the Mu family.

107
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,856
Back then, he stole the Hell Palm's manual

108
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,100
from the Patriarch.

109
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,200
He cultivated it in secret.

110
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,890
In the end, he became

111
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,660
a half-man, half-monster freak.

112
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,250
After that,

113
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,690
his deeds were exposed

114
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,830
due to Mu Zizhe.

115
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,130
In the end, he was confined

116
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,250
within the coffin.

117
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,199
Darn it.

118
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,580
[Mu Ciling, Mu family]

119
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,420
Where's that darned Mu Zizhe?

120
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,980
Show yourself!

121
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,830
Who's there?

122
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,060
How dare you run wild on
the Su family's grounds?

123
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,690
That buzz cut is something else.

124
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,660
You looked like a hairy egg.

125
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
You!

126
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,660
Mu Zizhe must've lost his mind.

127
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,756
He actually released a fellow
like that from his confinement.

128
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,239
Rumor has it that he didn't master

129
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
the Hell Palm.

130
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,180
It seems Mu Zizhe lied to us.

131
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,040
A red aura is emanating from his palm.

132
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,296
That means the level of his Hell Palm

133
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,960
has advanced to at least the eighth tier.

134
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,260
It seems he's more powerful

135
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,660
than the heads of the Three Families.

136
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,800
Don't be silly.
You aren't his target.

137
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,630
Why are you trying to stick your head out?

138
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,320
How did you injure your hand?

139
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,180
I'm fine.

140
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,009
I just fought

141
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,770
that darned Mu Zizhe.
We were on equal terms.

142
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,010
Hairy Egg.

143
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,570
Do you have a death wish?

144
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Master Mu said

145
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,960
if you could defeat
the head of the Su family

146
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,600
and stole the Dormant Dragon Sword,

147
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,760
he would grant you freedom.

148
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,930
Who does Mu Zizhe think he is?

149
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,690
How dare he order me around?

150
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Mu Ciling.

151
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,060
You...

152
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,606
Aren't you afraid of
the Heart-Piercing Poison?

153
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,060
You're doing this again, huh?

154
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,256
You would give me the
antidote if I defeat him, huh?

155
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,286
Are you guys sure about that?

156
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,710
Master Mu made the promise himself.

157
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Fine, then.

158
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,070
Although Mu Zizhe

159
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:46,330
isn't someone decent,

160
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,380
I guess I'll trust him this time.

161
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,190
Who do I have to defeat again?

162
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
The head of the Su family,

163
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,830
Su Jinhui.

164
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Lower your volume.

165
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,720
What's the name

166
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:18,730
of that brat again?

167
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Mu Tianlin.

168
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,599
It sounds like the name

169
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,970
of someone who's about to die.

170
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
What's your name, then?

171
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,140
Su Ze.

172
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,780
"Ze", as in the grace of nature?

173
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
That's right.

174
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,000
That also sounds like the name
of someone who's about to die.

175
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,450
However, Su Jinhui

176
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
is different.

177
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
That sounds like the name

178
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,260
of a person who's difficult to kill.

179
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,540
In life, one faces Ciling.

180
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,540
In death, one faces the Hell King.

181
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,690
Ten years ago,

182
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,610
I tried to persuade Mu Zizhe to kill you.

183
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,500
He refused to do so.

184
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,210
He said you might be of use to him

185
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,020
in the future.

186
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
I didn't expect

187
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,150
the so-called "future" he mentioned

188
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,020
was today.

189
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,480
But you actually think

190
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,210
you can kill me by yourself.

191
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,610
Doesn't that sound hilarious to you?

192
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,610
Let me just give it a try,

193
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,540
and we'll find out.

194
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,600
You're just a traitor of the Mu family.

195
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,600
You're not worth my effort,
the head of the Su family.

196
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,350
You're quite good at swordsmanship.

197
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,550
You're much more powerful
than that hairy egg.

198
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,710
However,

199
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,970
at best, you're merely decent.

200
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,230
Uncle Qiu.

201
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,520
Su Jinhui.

202
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,020
You're finally willing to show yourself

203
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,080
and engage us in a battle.

204
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,380
Back then, it took the three of you

205
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,450
to barely win against me.

206
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,690
Now, you're the only person left.

207
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,090
Are you afraid?

208
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,080
I've practiced swordsmanship for 40 years.

209
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,960
I've slain all kinds
of monsters and saints.

210
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,540
The word "fear" means nothing to me.

211
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,450
Not bad at all.

212
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,020
It's been many years

213
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,880
since I last witnessed
Master Su's techniques.

214
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,020
Having fun watching this?

215
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,790
It looks quite interesting.

216
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,870
Changhe.

217
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,160
What ending do you hope
this play will have?

218
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,450
For you to be the Patriarch

219
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,190
and for me to be the head of the Su family.

220
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,040
Didn't we make this promise
a long time ago?

221
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
All right.

222
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,900
Let's join hands

223
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,600
and deal with him together.

224
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,610
Su Muyu,

225
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,690
you're something else.

226
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,680
You've even learned
how to trick people now.

227
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,280
You think I have no idea
what's on your mind, huh?

228
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,450
You want to use me to repel your foes.

229
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,910
After that, you'll deliver the sword

230
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,040
to the head of the Su family.

231
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,450
I'm thoroughly impressed.

232
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,210
Hell Palm!

233
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,030
So, there are still other
martial arts experts around.

234
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,470
Go!

235
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,929
This old fool

236
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,330
is quite the experienced swordsman.

237
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,090
No wonder Mu Zizhe

238
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,450
assigned the task to me.

239
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,760
Right now, I can integrate my Hell Palm

240
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,810
into my swordsmanship.

241
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,246
You may have seen the palm
techniques of the Hell King,

242
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,480
but have you ever seen his blade before?

243
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,900
Frostblade Aura?

244
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,330
Interesting.

245
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,200
This was a story from a long time ago.

246
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,570
In "Journey to the West",

247
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Sun Wukong drew a circle

248
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
with his staff.

249
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,966
No matter how the spirits and
demons rage outside the circle,

250
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,450
within the circle,

251
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,540
all stays serene.

252
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,960
But you see, the different thing is,

253
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,610
Sun Wukong's circle entraps people

254
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,140
while my circle

255
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,180
allows people to enter and exit at will.

256
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,180
Wherever I stand,

257
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,060
there lies heaven and earth.

258
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,780
This will be interesting.

259
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,840
Muyu, do you wish to join their battle?

260
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,269
If I lend Master Su a hand,

261
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,470
and if he can only win against

262
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,730
Mu Ciling with my help,

263
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,360
even if he's able to pull
out the Dormant Dragon Sword,

264
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,280
he won't be able to
subdue the Three Families.

265
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,870
On the contrary,

266
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,140
if Master Su wins the battle,

267
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,710
at least the Mu family

268
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,830
won't dare to cause trouble again.

269
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,950
All right.

270
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,500
Let's place our bets, then.

271
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,360
Take a guess at who will win.

272
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,280
Master Su intends to use his full strength.

273
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,660
Even if Mu Ciling has
mastered the Hell Palm,

274
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,390
his foundation won't be deep.

275
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,710
He'll surely lose

276
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,690
once enough time has passed.

277
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,900
You're wrong.

278
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,089
You wouldn't be this naive

279
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,490
had you taken a peek at the manual.

280
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,260
That's a crazy martial art.

281
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,880
The depth of one's foundation
doesn't matter at all.

282
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,066
Have you sneaked a peek at it before?

283
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,090
No.

284
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,910
It's just a guess.

285
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Master Su,

286
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,950
the Mu family has released Mu Ciling.

287
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,570
It seems the death of Mu Bai

288
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,700
has enraged Mu Zizhe.

289
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,430
And,

290
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,630
he has arrived.

291
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,300
Hell Palm,

292
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,870
each tier represents a higher floor.

293
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,550
At the eighth tier, one
beholds Heaven and Earth.

294
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,220
But when you reach the ninth tier,

295
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,390
you shall turn into
Heaven and Earth itself.

296
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,040
I will ascend into the ninth tier soon.

297
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,610
I won the bet.

298
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,190
Su Muyu.

299
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,650
Stay here. Don't go out.

300
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,500
Mu Ciling!

301
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,876
Steal the Dormant Dragon Sword first!

302
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,260
We can plan it through after that!

303
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,390
Uncle Qidao?

304
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,360
Is that a member of the Xie family?

305
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,410
Back then,

306
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,806
the Su family, which was the
strongest family out of the three,

307
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,260
has been utterly defeated

308
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,700
by Mu Ciling alone.

309
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,840
Since I've obtained
the Dormant Dragon Sword,

310
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,060
can I become

311
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,330
the next Patriarch?

312
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,300
It's far too early for that.

313
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,650
It's yours only if you can

314
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,300
take it with you.

315
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,850
I'm hungry.

316
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,890
I'm in no mood to fight.
I'll make a move first.

317
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,150
He and his petty tricks.

318
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
You thief!

319
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,646
Where do you think you're going?

320
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,810
What exactly are you up to?

321
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,410
Although I, Su Changhe,

322
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,050
am injured,

323
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,190
I have to retrieve the Dormant
Dragon Sword for my family's sake.

324
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,650
None of us is a match for him.

325
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,020
You're seriously wounded.

326
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,920
Even if you catch up to him,

327
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,890
it'll be pointless.

328
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,719
[Unpredictable, Untraceable]

329
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,890
A sharp blade breaks easily.

330
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,650
Master Su's resolve

331
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,610
is just like the serpent blade.

332
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,060
He fell just as

333
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,570
he was about to

334
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,080
reach the position of Patriarch.

335
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,830
Master Su...

336
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Su Muyu.

337
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,410
I don't think

338
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,460
you have a choice now.

339
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Muyu,

340
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,020
relay my message to the Patriarch.

341
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
I was unable

342
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,190
to wield the Dormant Dragon Sword.

343
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,540
I've let him down.

344
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,070
All members of the Su family,

345
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,830
sheathe your swords!

346
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,110
Yes, sir!

347
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,166
So, the so-called strongest family

348
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,220
of the Three Families

349
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,460
is giving up already, huh?

350
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,960
The Mu family gave rise
to a harbinger of death.

351
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,350
As for the Su family,

352
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,536
it gave rise to the Umbrella Ghost

353
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,740
and the Undertaker.

354
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,370
It's a shame that the Umbrella Ghost

355
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,700
already has a new identity.

356
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,980
And the Undertaker still wonders

357
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,540
whom he's to bury.

358
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
Me?

359
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,090
Of course I am to bury myself.

360
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,200
You haven't accomplished your mission yet.

361
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,910
What do you plan to do?

362
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,321
Master Su has already given
up on the title of Patriarch.

363
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,120
As for what will happen after this,

364
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,160
we need to discuss it with the Patriarch.

365
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Our current priority

366
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,880
is to retrieve the Dormant Dragon Sword.

367
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,960
You think you can retrieve it alone?

368
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,910
Are you willing to help me out?

369
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,910
Me?

370
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,020
I'm seriously wounded.

371
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
I guess that's fine too.

372
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,760
At least

373
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,070
we won't need to

374
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:26,551
engage each other for the time being.

375
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,380
What a naive fellow.

376
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,300
[Water Official, Soul Reapers' Hall]

377
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,070
The Dormant Dragon Sword is mine now.

378
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,260
It's just a sword.

379
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,090
Is it truly worth all the hassle?

380
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,800
The Dormant Dragon Sword
is no ordinary sword.

381
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,570
Now, it seems the chaotic situation

382
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,126
between the Three Families will grow worse.

383
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,150
We should keep

384
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,290
the Dormant Dragon Sword
in the Soul Reapers' Hall.

385
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,186
Who's playing tricks on me again?

386
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,730
There's something off about the sword.

387
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,020
I suppose I've underestimated Mu Mingce.

388
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,870
Leave the sword behind!

389
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,370
That's Su Jinhui's Frostblade Aura.

390
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,630
Wait.

391
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,430
That isn't a sword aura.

392
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,060
That's the Wen family's
Death in Thirty Feet.

393
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,110
That's one of the hardest poison
arrays to neutralize in the world.

394
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,870
If an ordinary person

395
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,570
inhales the air even for a second,

396
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,570
they will die in an hour.

397
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,430
This young girl

398
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,220
is quite capable.

399
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,740
She knows the martial
arts of the Su family,

400
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,640
and she can use the Wen family's poison.

401
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,390
You're the only one in the
world who's capable of that.

402
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,940
Let's wait here, then.

403
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,650
She'll leave the array eventually.

404
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Miss,

405
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,126
you can't maintain
your Death in Thirty Feet

406
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,410
forever.

407
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,810
Give me the sword,

408
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,330
and I'll spare you.

409
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,700
You think it won't last

410
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,010
just because you said so?

411
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,806
Even after the current cast is over,

412
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,830
I can cast it again.

413
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,170
I'll make sure you two

414
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,590
won't be able

415
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,330
to reach me today.

416
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,980
Su Muyu.

417
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,060
Why aren't you here yet?

418
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,500
Miss, it seems you lied to us.

419
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Your poison array

420
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,300
is starting to fade.

421
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,150
Darned Su Muyu.

422
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,790
He's always late to my rescue.

423
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,360
I can't hang in there any longer.

424
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,960
I'll give you guys the sword.

425
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,530
You guys had better
keep your promises.

426
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,740
Don't kill me!

427
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,720
What are you guys doing here?

428
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,776
Chen the Dragon,
take the sword with you.

429
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,000
I'll cover the rear.
All right.

430
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
Chen the Dragon!

431
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,670
Sir,

432
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,150
I've helped you

433
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,760
to retain

434
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,130
the Dormant Dragon Sword.

435
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Chen the Dragon?

436
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,840
He was struck by Mu
Zizhe's Aqua Heartpiercer,

437
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,870
Miss Bai.

438
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,280
It has pierced through his heart.

439
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,990
There's no way to rescue him.

440
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,630
My dear girl.

441
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Are you okay?

442
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,810
Brat with the umbrella,

443
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,740
one of your buddies

444
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,850
is already dead.

445
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,780
You still have one left.

446
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,940
Let's negotiate a deal.

447
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
Give me the sword.

448
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,940
Do you desire this sword?

449
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,570
Give me the sword,

450
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,230
and you may choose to
pursue this sword later.

451
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,370
But you have to wait
for at least two hours.

452
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,090
By then, the issue will be between you

453
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,850
and Mu Zizhe.

454
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,220
It will be none of my concern.

455
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
Sir!

456
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,630
Pay him no heed!

457
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Will you choose him?

458
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,070
Or will you choose the sword?

459
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,410
You only have one moment

460
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,780
to consider it.

461
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
Fine.

462
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,670
I'll give you the sword.

463
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,330
That was a powerful toss.

464
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,410
Take this sword to the Mu family.

465
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
Deliver it to him.

466
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,740
After that, tell him this.

467
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,700
I, Su Muyu, hereby swear

468
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,260
that no matter what
identity Mu Zizhe assumes,

469
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,890
no matter where he goes,

470
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,110
no matter how long it
takes for me to reach him,

471
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,460
I'll surely

472
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,700
kill him with my own hands.

473
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,830
Excellent.

474
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,190
Excellent!

475
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
Excellent!

476
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,400
I'll surely deliver both
the sword and your message.

477
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
Yin the Tiger!

478
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,220
Sir,

479
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,870
we failed to protect the sword.

480
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,696
It's good as long as you're okay.

481
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,850
Darn it.

482
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Uncle Qidao.

483
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,880
I thought you wouldn't
get yourself involved.

484
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,460
You should ask that darned buddy of yours.

485
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,130
I've already obtained

486
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,090
the sword you desired.

487
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,260
Where's my antidote?

488
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,610
I wasn't the one who
took you to Jiuxiao City.

489
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,090
He has the item you desire.

490
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,350
You mean Water Official?

491
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,130
He hasn't left Jiuxiao City yet.

492
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,540
He won't leave

493
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,370
before the end of the show.

494
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
If so, Master Mu...

495
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
No.

496
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,670
I should address you

497
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,330
as the Patriarch now.

498
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,130
Patriarch,

499
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,980
I shall take my leave now.

500
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,350
But before that,

501
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,090
someone requested me

502
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,470
to deliver a message to you.

503
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,110
Tell me.

504
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,940
"I, Su Muyu, hereby swear

505
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,220
that no matter what identity you assume,

506
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,740
no matter where you go,

507
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,590
no matter

508
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,810
how long it takes for me to reach you,

509
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,890
I'll surely

510
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,260
kill you with my own hands."

511
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,240
Su Muyu, huh?

512
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,260
He's pretty arrogant, isn't he?

513
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,190
But first,

514
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,020
he at least has to survive for the day.

515
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
The Mu family

516
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,190
has already obtained
the Dormant Dragon Sword.

517
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,260
Congratulations, Master Mu.

518
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,850
Congratulations, Master Mu.

519
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,260
Congratulations, Patriarch.

520
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
Excellent.

521
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
Let's return

522
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,780
to our sect immediately.

523
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
Yes, sir.

524
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,240
None of you

525
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,300
will be able to leave this place alive.

526
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,590
Xie Qidao,

527
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,410
you actually came.

528
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,980
It's as if you guys

529
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,430
think that I shouldn't be here.

530
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,020
But I'm here.

531
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,610
I already have the Dormant Dragon Sword.

532
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,170
I'm the current Patriarch of Blood River.

533
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
What a joke.

534
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,810
Even the fledglings of Blood River know

535
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,566
that it's pointless to possess
the Dormant Dragon Sword alone.

536
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,460
You have to return to
the sect in one piece.

537
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,256
You're not the Patriarch until
you receive the acknowledgment

538
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,040
of the Soul Reapers'
Hall's Three Officials.

539
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,570
It's a shame

540
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,190
that you won't be able to
leave Jiuxiao City alive.

541
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
I don't think

542
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,430
you'll be able to leave
this courtyard alive.

543
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,040
You think you can stop me by yourself?

544
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Of course.

545
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,630
I'm here as well.

546
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Xie Ba?

547
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,300
Mu Zizhe,

548
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,740
we've finally met

549
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
at Jiuxiao City.

550
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Ba,

551
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
sorry for the trouble.

552
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,610
You were supposed

553
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,850
to inherit my title.

554
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,410
Once I retrieve the Dormant Dragon Sword

555
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,090
and become the Patriarch,

556
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,570
you shall be the next head

557
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,130
of the Xie family.

558
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,150
It seems I don't need to do anything.

559
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,090
There's a good show about to happen.

560
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,350
The Xie family is here

561
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,330
with our 56 long sabers.

562
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,940
We're here to retrieve one sword

563
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,910
from the head of the Mu family.

564
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Retrieve one sword, huh?

565
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:42,850
Do you know

566
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,220
that Mu Bai died in an attempt

567
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,366
to retrieve the Dormant Dragon Sword?

568
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,390
I know that.

569
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,080
But the Xie family

570
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,810
didn't kill him.

571
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Moreover,

572
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,700
my favorite disciple is also dead.

573
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,016
You and I have been
acquaintances for many years.

574
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,440
Although we follow different paths,

575
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,980
we're still friends for many years.

576
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,830
There's no need for us

577
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,130
to draw our swords against each other.

578
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
What about this?

579
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,690
Once I become the Patriarch,

580
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,230
I'll appoint you as the Deputy Patriarch.

581
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,390
After that, we can eradicate the Su family

582
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,440
together.

583
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
What do you think?

584
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
What a joke.

585
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,016
Do you think the Soul Reapers'
Hall is just an empty hall?

586
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,290
I'll become the Patriarch

587
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,090
by hook or by crook.

588
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,320
Darn it!

589
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,380
What a fool.

590
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,500
The Xie family and the Su family

591
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,210
were always the vanguards

592
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,020
of Blood River.

593
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,090
The Mu family

594
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,170
was just a bunch of cowards

595
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,590
who attacked others from behind.

596
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,570
What gives you the right

597
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,980
to assume this position?

598
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,860
I'll ask you this again.

599
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,290
Have you decided to fight us?

600
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
You don't say?

601
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,230
Fine!
My brothers!

602
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,610
Yes, sir!

603
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,020
Kill all members

604
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,020
of the Mu family!

605
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
Yes, sir!

606
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,130
Set up the array!

607
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
Array, Lone Void!

608
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,090
I didn't expect you to show up.

609
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,170
The Heaven Official grants blessings.

610
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,470
The Earth Official pardons sins.

611
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,350
The Water Official resolves misfortunes.

612
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,980
Now, Blood River is in total chaos.

613
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,350
Naturally, I have to resolve
the current misfortune.

614
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,500
The true Dormant Dragon Sword

615
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
lies here with you,

616
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,536
together with the dark
secrets of Blood River.

617
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,460
You've always held them

618
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,980
tightly in your hands.

619
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,420
Who assigned you to assassinate

620
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,380
Second Master Tang?

621
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,250
Naturally, it's someone you know.

622
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,790
I assume everything that's been happening

623
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,060
is also within his expectations, then.

624
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,060
He's not a prophet.

625
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,420
He can't foresee everything.

626
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,720
However, he's also looking forward

627
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,086
to the fact that the current Blood River

628
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:17,730
will turn into

629
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,900
an entirely new organization

630
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,340
after this incident.

631
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,950
But no matter what Blood
River will turn into,

632
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,540
I should never be here.

633
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,750
You do live up to your
reputation as the Patriarch.

634
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,340
I can head to Homeland.

635
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:39,820
Homeland?

636
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,500
Do you mean the legendary sanctuary

637
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,770
of Blood River?

638
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,250
The sanctuary that can allow people

639
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,940
to put down their feuds and grudges

640
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,020
and lead a peaceful life?

641
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,020
I wouldn't have thought of it as hilarious

642
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,840
if someone else were
to utter the same thing.

643
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,290
But you're the Patriarch.

644
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
You should know

645
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,590
that

646
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,460
Homeland never existed.

647
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,130
That was just a lie.

648
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,020
I was the Patriarch for 30 years.

649
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,230
My reign lasted longer
than any of those before me.

650
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,290
Therefore, I've achieved something

651
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,770
that they couldn't manage to achieve.

652
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,250
So, you actually built such a place

653
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,170
secretly

654
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,210
behind our backs, huh?

655
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,610
Is that the escape route

656
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,160
that you've built for yourself?

657
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,080
Are you going to defy the Three Officials?

658
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
Something's off.

659
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,080
That palm strike of yours...

660
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,686
The Snow Falls on a Plum
Blossom poison in your body

661
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,820
is actually neutralized.

662
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,770
I've been the Patriarch for 30 years.

663
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,060
The only thing

664
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,400
that I haven't managed to achieve

665
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
is to admit defeat.

666
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,460
You guys intend to use my death

667
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,210
to create a new version of Blood River.

668
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,650
However, to me,

669
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,470
Blood River will only be able to

670
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,690
embrace a new future

671
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,090
after your deaths.

672
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,500
Just like what you said,

673
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,540
the poison in my body has been neutralized.

674
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,360
You are no match

675
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,060
for me.

676
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,060
I think you should understand

677
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,650
that Blood River never belonged to you.

678
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,460
The Soul Reapers' Hall

679
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,060
doesn't own Blood River either.

680
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,730
It's just

681
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,250
a tool meant for killing.

682
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,230
We don't have the right
to decide how it's used.

683
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,540
Only those who command it have the right.

684
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,400
That's the one thing I wanted to change

685
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,290
during my 30 years of reign.

686
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,730
Although I couldn't achieve that,

687
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,990
I'm sure someone can achieve that

688
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,460
in the end.

689
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,270
If so,

690
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,840
I shall wait for your good news.

691
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,310
Sir.

692
