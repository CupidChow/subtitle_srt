[Episode 10]

5
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,130
I disagree with much

6
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,330
of what Changhe said,

7
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,820
but one thing

8
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,690
was no empty talk:

9
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,460
together, the two of us

10
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,290
have never lost.

11
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,850
Eighteen-Sword Array,

12
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,490
Activate!

13
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,260
Great.

14
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,730
Excellent!

15
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,450
Eighteen-Sword Array?

16
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,260
The greatest regret of my life

17
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,100
is

18
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,610
not being born a hundred years earlier

19
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,580
to face the Su family's finest,

20
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,690
Su Shiba, in battle.

21
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,380
Who would've thought that after I was sealed

22
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,200
inside a coffin,

23
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,060
the Su family

24
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,060
would produce another who could revive the Eighteen-Sword Array?

25
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,570
You're so talkative.

26
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,540
I've been trapped in that coffin

27
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,690
for so many years,

28
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,010
of course, I have much to say

29
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,100
and many fights yet to fight.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,060
These swords of yours aren't enough to take me down.

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,340
Show me

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,410
your true strike.

33
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,820
Then I'll grant your wish.

34
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,690
Drizzle Sword.

35
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,220
What's that?

36
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,340
He's absorbing my sword energy.

37
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,400
So

38
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,290
this is what makes Hell Palm so terrifying.

39
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,780
What a fool.

40
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,950
You've got some nerve to use your palm against me.

41
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,710
Open your eyes wide

42
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,740
to see who the real fool is.

43
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,490
Changhe.

44
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,050
I didn't know

45
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,580
that besides me,

46
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,810
there was someone in the Blood River

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,900
bold enough

48
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,140
to defy the rules.

49
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,660
You've been secretly practicing the Hell Palm.

50
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,220
Secretly?

51
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,730
Judging from how things turned out,

52
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,140
I'd say I was just early to start.

53
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,490
What a shame.

54
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,220
If your cultivation in the Hell Palm

55
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,610
were one level higher,

56
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,100
you could've beaten me.

57
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,660
But alas.

58
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,340
The Ten Courts of Hell

59
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,610
each rule over life and death.

60
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,780
You're

61
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,290
one step short.

62
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,580
Darn it.

63
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,730
How can a man who just crawled out of a coffin

64
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,290
have such profound inner force?

65
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,040
I looked pathetic.

66
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,540
Changhe,

67
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,760
do you really mean to lead them

68
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,540
to the other shore?

69
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,540
Of course,

70
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,220
even though this is only the beginning.

71
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,050
I've always been the only one

72
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,140
who prefers to stay away from strife.

73
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,020
Since this is fate's will,

74
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,850
I'll sever it with my sword.

75
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,580
Hold the Dormant Dragon Sword

76
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,100
and become the first

77
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,900
Patriarch

78
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,140
as a Nameless.

79
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,660
You finally came around.

80
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,020
We were born

81
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,220
to fight our fate.

82
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,220
If you wish to wield the sword, then let's do it.

83
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,340
Only death

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,540
can stop us.

85
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,810
I'll find you an opening to wield that sword.

86
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,050
Such arrogance.

87
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,020
Yue'an,

88
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,580
if you only have one chance to strike,

89
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,340
close your eyes,

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,140
and trust the judgment

91
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,460
you're most certain of in that moment.

92
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,410
Su Muyu,

93
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,020
I can't hold on anymore!

94
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,730
I'm running out of strength.

95
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,410
That slash

96
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,290
damaged your heart meridian.

97
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,100
If you keep insisting,

98
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,140
you'll die.

99
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,340
You two...

100
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,100
What were your names again?

101
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,810
Su Muyu.

102
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,250
I'm Su Changhe.

103
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,170
Very good.

104
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,610
Your names

105
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,220
will be known across the land.

106
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,850
We'll meet again.

107
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,980
Very good.

108
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,490
You two

109
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,980
are indeed impressive.

110
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,490
I'll look forward

111
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,220
to our next encounter.

112
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,300
Su Muyu,

113
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,510
if you really want to quit,

114
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,350
the promise we made before

115
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,250
doesn't stand anymore.

116
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,020
As for the powers behind all this that you mentioned,

117
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,420
I'll root them out

118
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,140
in no time.

119
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:11,980
Alright.

120
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,850
That being said, the Hell Palm is too dangerous.

121
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,850
One slip,

122
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,720
and it could backfire on you.

123
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,370
You ought to be extra careful.

124
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,180
It's not easy

125
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,530
for us to have come this far.

126
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,700
But

127
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,770
I'll keep moving forward.

128
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,730
Changhe...

129
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,250
I know what you're going to say.

130
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,220
I'll announce to the world,

131
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,770
from today on,

132
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,980
there'll be no more Umbrella Ghost in the Blood River.

133
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,460
I'll destroy the Soul Reapers' Hall,

134
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,100
so no one

135
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,340
can ever issue another writ to kill you again.

136
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,490
As well as the family

137
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,340
you wish to take with you.

138
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,650
You once said you liked Nan'an.

139
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,410
I bought a mansion there

140
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,120
with the savings I stashed away over the years.

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,420
Go to Nan'an and find

142
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,000
the owner of Shouyue Banking House.

143
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,470
He'll give you the deed.

144
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,420
There are ten thousand taels of silver

145
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,460
buried under the courtyard.

146
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,940
If you run out of money,

147
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,580
dig it up.

148
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,730
Every autumn...

149
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,770
Every autumn,

150
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,420
when osmanthus fills Nan'an City,

151
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,370
I'll come find you for a drink.

152
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,580
Of course,

153
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,820
if you'd rather no one,

154
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,300
including me, know where you are,

155
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,010
you can sell the mansion back

156
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,730
to the Shouyue Banking House.

157
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,060
Still,

158
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,010
every autumn,

159
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,580
when osmanthus fills Nan'an City,

160
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,250
I'll hope to see you again.

161
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,370
Changhe.

162
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,250
You never belonged here.

163
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,100
Leaving this place is what you were meant to do.

164
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,300
As for me,

165
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,850
I crawled out from piles of dead bodies when I was a child.

166
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,770
To me, life

167
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,770
was never worth much.

168
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,820
If I leave,

169
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,820
I wouldn't even know where to go.

170
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,980
But you're a fool, really.

171
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,370
You hate killing,

172
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,850
yet it's the only thing you're good at.

173
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,250
You know nothing else.

174
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,300
You've been the Kui for years,

175
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,100

to kill Li Huan, the one who embezzled relief funds?

185

We could've finished him with one strike,

186
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,790
but you insisted on tracing the clues

187
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,000
and took

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,700
all his money and valuables.

189
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,300
And what happened?

190
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,340

191
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,670
by 32 constables from the Six Gates Bureau

192
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,610

at Xuehe Manor,

197
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,890
when we went after the Sword Ghost, Wang Ba.

198
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,300
You just had to sneak into his library,

199
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,900
saying you wanted to collect some martial arts manuals,

200
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,990
and we ended up trapped by his mechanisms.

201
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,630
Luckily, I had

202
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,820
some food on me,

203
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,100
and we managed to last three days and three nights

204
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,980
before reinforcements arrived.

205

shattered the Lone Void Array spanning a hundred li

00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,250
Later,

349
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,570
when the medicine cools a little,

350
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,810
drink it all.

351
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,740
Not a drop left.

352
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,250
All right?

353
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,330
All right, Miss Bai.

354
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,620
It's still hot.

355
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,660
More patients have come today.

356
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,380
It's the Grain Rain season.

357
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,010
The spring wind stirs the heart.

358
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,980
It's easy to fall ill.

359
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,140
What kind of illness?

360
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,010
When the heart is stirred,

361
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,660
it's lovesickness.

362
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,090
The person you wanted to see is here.

363
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,980
And the osmanthus cake I wanted to eat,

364
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,010
I got it.

365
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,290
Let's begin

366
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,030
the consultations.

367
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,330
It starts now.

368
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,050
Coming.

369
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,330
What seems to be the problem?

370
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:56,900
Your hand.

371
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,660
What's your ailment?

372
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,180
Isn't that why I came

373
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,620
to find out what ailment it is?

374
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,490
Ten taels of silver.

375
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,940
I'll have him

376
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,420
prepare your concoction.

377
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,700
What concoction?

378
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,740
[One tael of woad root]

379
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,220
Ten taels of silver.

380
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,660
Ten taels of silver

381
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,770
for one tael of woad root?

382
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,660
If you don't want it,

383
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,040
I'll give it to someone else.

384
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,730
I'll take it. I will.

385
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,980
Next, please.

386
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,490
Why are there still so many in line?

387
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,250
Tell me about it.

388
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,250
Which number is she?

389
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,010
I'll pay a hundred taels.

390
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,350
I want him to feed me the medicine.

391
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,980
[One hundred taels]
One hundred taels?

392
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,880
One hundred taels isn't enough.

393
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,380
Two hundred taels.

394
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,160
Deal.

395
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,460
[A hundred taels]

396
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,860
Next, please.

397
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,560
Stop staring.

398
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,860
Your condition is serious.

399
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,220
Look at me

400
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,140
and listen carefully.

401
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,620
Otherwise,

402
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,660
you won't make it through this spring.

403
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,260
[Yi's Residence]

404
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,380
After Su Muyu succeeded

405
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,220
as head of the Su family,

406
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,490
he opened an apothecary in Nan'an City?

407
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,770
Yes.

408
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,050
We sent people to keep watch,

409
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,700
but they were discovered.

410
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,330
Someone intervened

411
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,490
and crippled their martial skills.

412
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,900
It seems to be a warning.

413
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,050
We've only posted

414
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,420
a few watchers

415
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,380
outside Nan'an City now.

416
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,420
We have no idea

417
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,250
what they're up to.

418
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,940
What about Su Changhe?

419
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,380
He returned to Blood River.

420
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,860
Judging by his moves,

421
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,810
he's after the Soul Reapers' Hall.

422
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,180
But the Three Officials have left.

423
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,090
He took in the disciples from the Three Families who remained in Blood River,

424
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,620
and then left.

425
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,250
Send a message to the Three Officials.

426
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,380
Now is the time

427
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,530
they meet.

428
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,460
Sir,

429
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,090
is this to form an alliance with them?

430
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,140
Even though an unruly sword

431
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,290
is hard to control,

432
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,330
if we hold it in our hands,

433
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,770
only then can we achieve true domination.

434
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,810
Your Eighteen-Sword Array

435
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,530
is amazing.

436
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I could sense your sword aura

437
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,770
from a distance.

438
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,200
But how will you retrieve

439
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,420
the swords you release?

440
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,660
Changhe had the Ban family

441
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,570
specially make this umbrella

442
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,420
for me.

443
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,730
Back then, when I launched the Eighteen-Sword Array,

444
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,460
I used ordinary paper umbrellas.

445
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,730
They broke easily,

446
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,980
and after each launch,

447
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,860
I had to gather the swords myself.

448
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,980
Honestly,

449
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,380
if you ever have to use

450
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,730
this sword array to attack in the future,

451
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,180
wouldn't you have to

452
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,420
pull the swords

453
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,380
out of each body?

454
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,810
There's no assassin in the world who would do that.

455
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,440
As long as the mission is completed.

456
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,720
They're dead,

457
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,770
they won't see me gathering the swords.

458
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,900
I'll take more jobs

459
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,490
and save up

460
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,940
to buy you a decent umbrella.

461
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,460
Otherwise, partnering with you

462
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,180
on a killing mission

463
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,490
would be too embarrassing.

464
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,660
Here.

465
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,800
All right.

466
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,730
Thank you.

467
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,190
You're so kind.

468
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,570
Changhe said

469
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,290
an assassin shouldn't look like that

470
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,730
after a kill.

471
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,940
This is just a sword.

472
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,700
Why must one possess it

473
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,530
