4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,075
Mister.

5
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:25,337
It won’t be complicated, right?

6
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,880
What happens tonight ends tonight.

7
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:32,173
I’m not sure about that.

8
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:34,186
You don’t want to know me that much?

9
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:36,211
I think it’s better for us this way.

10
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,527
Here’s your Chic… Oh shit!

11
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:43,315
I don’t understand.

12
00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:44,489
I can’t read sign language.

13
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,053
I said I didn’t do it.

14
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:49,280
Your son was startled when he saw me and dropped the bottle.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,893
Hey. How could you put the blame on my son?

16
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:53,243
I let you pay us in installments.

17
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:55,361
Can I work for you instead?

18
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,468
What if I want to apply to be your waitstaff?

19
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:03,830
From now on, we are no strangers.

20
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:07,050
What should I call you, Boss?

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,771
Jim.

22
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:11,800
But people call me Uncle Jim.

23
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:25,025
Uncle Jim, have you eaten?

24
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:27,000
Here’s Fermented Soy Bean Dip that Praew made.

25
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:29,216
Put it over there. I’ll eat it later.

26
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:30,885
Eat before it goes bad.

27
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:31,960
A-ha.

28
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:36,000
How is Praew doing? What’s her work shift today?

29
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:38,712
Night shift until 10.

30
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:41,547
She said she can’t stand for long and wanted comfy shoes.

31
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:48,832
[Wen: I’ve arrived. Should I just go in?]

32
00:01:57,562 --> 00:02:00,000
Take her shoe shopping then.

33
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:05,771
How can I?

34
00:02:06,197 --> 00:02:07,412
Li Ming isn’t here.

35
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,144
Can you run the diner alone?

36
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:11,020
You can go.

37
00:02:11,393 --> 00:02:12,640
I’ve got an extra pair of hands.

38
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,866
Gaipa?

39
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:20,836
Ahem.

40
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:28,066
Ah, you came for the card that you forgot?

41
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:29,257
Let me grab it for you.

42
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:30,146
Don’t.

43
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,987
This is Wen, my friend.

44
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,548
He’s helping out.

45
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,508
Ah.

46
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:42,863
The other day, he passed out drunk.

47
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:44,446
Today, he got a job here.

48
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:48,000
I wasn’t drunk in vain, was I?

49
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,799
That’s great then.

50
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,975
Thank you for helping.

51
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:57,602
Bye, Uncle.

52
00:02:57,602 --> 00:02:58,471
Hey.

53
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,267
Where should I start, Uncle Jim?

54
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,125
Sure you can handle it?

55
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,396
It’s tough.

56
00:03:23,257 --> 00:03:24,790
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

57
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:28,204
Don’t worry about me.

58
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:32,198
When someone like me wants something,

59
00:03:34,116 --> 00:03:35,246
I work hard for it.

60
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:50,637
Let's get started.

61
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:52,412
I’m ready.

62
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:41,689
Chapter 2: The Temporary Chicken Rice

63
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:42,871
Here.

64
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:46,985
Ride home safe.

65
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,982
Or if you want me to pick you up, let me know.

66
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:54,000
By the way, I had a dream last night.

67
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:55,260
I saw a silver necklace.

68
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:57,176
A silver necklace?

69
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:57,871
Yeah.

70
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:01,588
I walked into the woods.

71
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,704
I found it on a tree stump.

72
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:05,855
Kind of.

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,123
Let’s look it up.

74
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:13,215
It says here that more expenses are coming your way.

75
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,758
If girls dream about it,

76
00:06:15,935 --> 00:06:17,397
they could be expecting a daughter.

77
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:18,728
A daughter?

78
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:21,023
How are a silver necklace and a daughter related?

79
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:22,769
No.

80
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:25,632
Can I get numbers instead?

81
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:27,821
Give the exact numbers.

82
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:28,709
Let me think.

83
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:30,535
Necklace is ‘4.’

84
00:06:31,051 --> 00:06:32,271
There’s only one necklace, so it’s ‘1.’

85
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:33,882
41 and 14.

86
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:34,600
Go for it.

87
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,721
Buy the lotto.

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It’s not like I dream about a necklace all the time.

89
00:06:38,371 --> 00:06:39,610
We might win.

90
00:06:40,557 --> 00:06:41,318
Hey.

91
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,995
Police, arrest these two.

92
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:45,361
They’re selling illegal lotto.

93
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,458
Yeah, arrest me, officers.

94
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:48,516
Where are the police?

95
00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:49,632
I don’t see any.

96
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:51,935
I sell lotto to police wives.

97
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,000
I’m not scared, you asshole.

98
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:55,950
No, thanks. I’m good.

99
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,969
What are you doing here anyway?

100
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:57,774
Are you cutting work?

101
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,275
I’m not.

102
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:00,803
I came to order LPG for Uncle Jim.

103
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:02,696
I’m dropping off the bike for Praew too.

104
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:04,032
About to head back.

105
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:04,660
Coming with me?

106
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:07,384
Oh? I thought I could use a ride home.

107
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,299
You can walk with me. Okay?

108
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:11,664
I’m taking off, babe.

109
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:12,741
Bye.

110
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,794
But, hey. Don’t forget to buy 14 and 41.

111
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:16,763
You got it.

112
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:18,399
Why going home so early?

113
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:21,068
Aren’t you a senior? Don’t you have night school?

114
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:22,133
Are you really going to school?

115
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,040
No, I’m just wearing a student cosplay.

116
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:27,365
Which uni are you going to? Have you thought about it?

117
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:33,867
[Registration to work overseas is now open.]

118
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,959
I haven’t.

119
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,020
What?

120
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:40,584
What about you?

121
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,760
Uncle Jim told you to enroll in non-formal education, but you didn’t.

122
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:46,567
I don’t want to study. I just want to get rich.

123
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,000
I want to win the lotto.

124
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:50,446
How’s that?

125
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:52,715
You haven’t even paid me back the money you owed.

126
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,488
Quit bringing the 100 baht up.

127
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:57,918
It’s not like I owe you one million.

128
00:07:58,182 --> 00:08:00,000
I’ll pay you back once I win the lotto.

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,913
You all right?

130
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:02,352
I’m fine.

131
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:12,550
This is Wen.

132
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,097
He’ll step in when you’re not here.

133
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,515
Hello.

134
00:08:16,716 --> 00:08:17,657
Hi.

135
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:21,316
Come on. Storing plates is easy.

136
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:23,453
Learn to cook the rice with me back here.

137
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:25,701
On my very first day?

138
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:26,998
Yeah. Come on.

139
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:30,872
Hurry up.

140
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:32,028
All right.

141
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:35,082
Uncle Jim, why does no one wash the dishes?

142
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,757
You do it, Leng.

143
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:40,229
So what’s this?

144
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,642
I recognize him.

145
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:44,381
Leave it for adults.

146
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:02,466
We’re friends.

147
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:04,451
He asked if he could work here.

148
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,473
Well, you need to be out for work anyway.

149
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:10,291
The diner will need an extra hand.

150
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:17,686
When will you start working at Officer Supoch’s?

151
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:19,624
About now.

152
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:21,360
I’m here to grab my portable charger.

153
00:09:25,768 --> 00:09:26,992
Take the food too.

154
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:28,858
I’m sick of your food.

155
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:31,480
And don’t pick a fight with anyone.

156
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:38,249
Can you quit talking? It’s annoying.

157
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:40,383
I’m just warning you.

158
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:59,676
Once you’re done with the house chores, you don’t have to do anything else.

159
00:10:00,718 --> 00:10:03,005
If we’re home, you can leave after that.

160
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:05,621
But if we aren’t, please keep Heart company.

161
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:09,337
He understands simple hand gestures.

162
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:11,599
If he doesn’t, you can write it down.

163
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:20,287
Normally, Heart can stay by himself just fine.

164
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:23,478
Before you leave, don’t forget to ask him to lock the doors.

165
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:27,120
He might be in his room. You can tell if the light is on.

166
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,282
Are you listening to me?

167
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:34,537
I am.

168
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:36,896
I’ll be leaving then.

169
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,240
Take care of the house.

170
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:00,000
Hey.

171
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:18,489
What?

172
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,364
I’m wiping it.

173
00:11:23,512 --> 00:11:25,200
I’m cleaning it.

174
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:28,459
I am cleaning.

175
00:11:30,382 --> 00:11:31,066
Ow!

176
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:31,819
Shit!

177
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:01,666
Here.

178
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:06,718
You and I mop the floor together.

179
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,718
You and I…

180
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:18,255
mop the floor together.

181
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,065
You’re not doing.

182
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:42,694
I’m not doing.

183
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,634
You and I spilled it together.

184
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:18,900
We clean it together.

185
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,123
Got it? Huh?

186
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:28,074
Come on.

187
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:31,740
Hurry.

188
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,654
Do it, chop-chop.

189
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:57,308
For me?

190
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:00,426
For you.

191
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,484
The chicken was all sold.

192
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,787
If you’re done here, you can go home.

193
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:11,949
I’ll take it from here.

194
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:17,258
There’s one chicken left. Don’t you see?

195
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:19,981
Somebody bought it already.

196
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:22,677
I’ll chop it, put it in a box, and give it to the delivery guy.

197
00:14:22,677 --> 00:14:23,445
And I’ll be done.

198
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:27,201
Can you teach me how to chop?

199
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:32,697
I can help you chop the chicken next time.

200
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:41,768
Now that we cut it in half,

201
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:44,996
we will cut below the wings and drumsticks.

202
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:47,016
Here?

203
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:48,106
Yes.

204
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:49,823
Be careful.

205
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:55,625
Isn’t it too mushy?

206
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:57,081
What?

207
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:03,151
Here.

208
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:11,418
Uncle.

209
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:16,505
Why don’t you make it thin and flat first?

210
00:15:17,855 --> 00:15:18,829
Why?

211
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,457
You like to eat thin chicken meat?

212
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:22,225
No.

213
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,000
But it will seem like a big serve.

214
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:26,040
Other diners do that.

215
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:28,491
If I want that,

216
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:30,921
I won’t let people eat all they want after midnight, will I?

217
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:43,976
Seriously, if you don’t have the ‘Eat all you want’ signature,

218
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:46,625
you might make a better profit.

219
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:51,201
I won’t make that much better profit.

220
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,810
I’m comfortable with the way I’m doing it.

221
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:57,592
I don’t know what to do with the chicken anyway if I bring home.

222
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,520
I’d rather share it with customers.

223
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:01,875
Here. I’ll handle the rest.

224
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,984
What?

225
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:18,613
Can’t I look at you?

226
00:16:28,816 --> 00:16:30,129
The work is over.

227
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,460
Time to go home.

228
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,629
What?

229
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,050
Don’t I get extra time tonight?

230
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:39,510
You mean this?

231
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:42,960
I prefer to drink alone.

232
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,147
Such an artist.

233
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,200
Your wage isn’t that big. Spend it on beer and you’ll have nothing left.

234
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:55,502
And who says I want wages at all?

235
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,348
Go home.

236
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,560
I’m going home too.

237
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,069
Bye-bye.

238
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:17,521
You can ride with me to the main street.

239
00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:20,885
No.

240
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:22,941
I can manage on my own.

241
00:17:23,196 --> 00:17:24,220
I booked my ride.

242
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,123
If I get in your car,

243
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:31,068
I’m afraid I might never reach home.

244
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:42,644
Did you call a ride service?

245
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,520
I did.

246
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:45,475
Hold on.

247
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:50,260
One moment, please.

248
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,977
Thank you for helping.

249
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:06,314
Don’t thank me.

250
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:08,728
I did it for money.

251
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:09,765
Bye, Uncle Jim.

252
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:30,923
Here are your chicken wings.

253
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:31,821
100 baht, please.

254
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:33,438
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

255
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:37,548
Praew, should we become chicken meat vendors?

256
00:18:37,936 --> 00:18:39,690
They’re rich.

257
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,653
Look. His gold necklace is as big as my thumb. Damn!

258
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,206
What a loaded man.

259
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:46,771
Oh, yeah?

260
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:53,006
Tootee, the boba tea girl, said you didn’t reply to her messages.

261
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,806
What a homewrecker you are.

262
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,159
What’s this, Leng?

263
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:57,366
Who is Tootee?

264
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,511
Tootee who? That’s no one.

265
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:01,329
Gaipa was being nonsense.

266
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:02,830
Take responsibility, Gaipa.

267
00:19:03,514 --> 00:19:04,986
I’m kidding, Praew.

268
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:06,535
For real.

269
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:09,050
If you say you’re kidding, don’t say for real.

270
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,418
Where are you going? Fix what you started.

271
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,273
It’s nothing.

272
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,837
Don’t believe him.

273
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:15,990
Is her shop over there?

274
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:17,223
Where?

275
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:19,190
You took a peek when walking past it.

276
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,048
No way. Don’t trust what he says.

277
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:23,119
Here.

278
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:24,405
What is it?

279
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:25,367
Ah.

280
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:28,737
Let’s see.

281
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,086
[2 chickens, 5 chicken blood cubes, 2 kg of liver,  2 kg of gizzard, 3 kg of chicken carcass]

282
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,398
Leng, whose handwriting is this?

283
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:36,731
Don’t think I’ve seen it. Is it Li Ming’s?

284
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:38,552
No. It’s Wen’s.

285
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:39,868
Wen?

286
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:41,554
Who?

287
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:43,469
Uncle Jim’s friend.

288
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:45,085
He’s passed out drunk at the diner the other day.

289
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:46,207
He’s working there now.

290
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:47,988
He doesn’t seem fit though.

291
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:49,610
Doesn’t seem fit?

292
00:19:50,153 --> 00:19:51,246
How?

293
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:53,794
He looks like he comes from money.

294
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:55,595
He shouldn’t be doing something like this.

295
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:56,833
He’s good-looking though.

296
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:58,046
Yeah?

297
00:19:58,685 --> 00:19:59,863
You can stop by and say hi.

298
00:20:01,422 --> 00:20:03,406
But don’t fall for him too.

299
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:07,046
Leng, damn you!

300
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:09,046
It’s not like I like everyone I see.

301
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:09,799
Oh, yeah?

302
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,678
Hell yeah!

303
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:12,231
Don’t forget to answer Tootee.

304
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:14,685
Damn it. Tootee again?

305
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,247
Do you believe him? Seriously?

306
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:18,396
I saw you look.

307
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:19,836
Are you nuts?

308
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:21,472
It’s nothing.

309
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:22,647
But you did look.

310
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:24,122
I looked around all over the place.

311
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,840
Uncle Jim.

312
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:30,477
The shop isn’t yet open, sir.

313
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:32,460
Ah.

314
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:35,886
Is Uncle Jim here?

315
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:38,193
Uncle.

316
00:20:40,683 --> 00:20:43,240
Hi, Gaipa.

317
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:44,828
What’s up?

318
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:48,380
My mom went to Kathin Ceremony.

319
00:20:48,768 --> 00:20:50,440
She got lots of Thai desserts.

320
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:56,326
Have a seat.

321
00:20:57,486 --> 00:20:58,666
Here.

322
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:01,793
She asked if you could help finish some.

323
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:05,199
I’d leave it with Leng but I was afraid he’d forget.

324
00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:09,282
Wow.

325
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,636
This is a lot.

326
00:21:12,168 --> 00:21:13,597
How can I finish all this?

327
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:15,126
Tell your mom I said thank you.

328
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,433
Of course.

329
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:21,886
Uncle Jim, have you heard about the Marina Food Court construction?

330
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:24,689
The one that requires market zone adjustment?

331
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,065
That’s the one.

332
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,764
Ah.

333
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:30,938
Song told me about it, but I don’t know the details.

334
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:32,675
How far will the food court cover?

335
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:36,603
I think they’re using the fresh market zone too.

336
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:37,701
The fresh market, huh?

337
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:40,778
Should we eat?

338
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,645
Uncle.

339
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:49,241
Uncle, should I put this basket of clothes in the back?

340
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:53,956
Yes, in the back for now.

341
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:55,342
Leng will take it from there.

342
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:03,684
Wen.

343
00:22:03,684 --> 00:22:04,983
This is Gaipa.

344
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:06,418
Gaipa, this is Wen.

345
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:12,244
My friend.

346
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,086
He’s helping out when Li Ming isn’t here.

347
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:20,778
Uncle Jim, you could have just told me.

348
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:23,469
Let me know when it’s busy. I can come help.

349
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:24,575
It’s okay.

350
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:27,191
The diner isn’t that busy and Wen…

351
00:22:30,287 --> 00:22:31,533
might not be here every day.

352
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:37,840
Well then.

353
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,266
I’ll put this behind the diner.

354
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,363
Should we eat?

355
00:22:48,363 --> 00:22:49,301
Sure.

356
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:55,423
Thanks a lot.

357
00:22:57,366 --> 00:23:00,108
Mom complains that her blood sugar keeps rising.

358
00:23:00,494 --> 00:23:01,524
That’s why she gave it away.

359
00:23:01,524 --> 00:23:03,397
Even so, there’s still a lot at home.

360
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:05,212
Would you like some?

361
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,549
I’m good.

362
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:29,727
Wanna join us?

363
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:31,455
No. You play.

364
00:23:31,455 --> 00:23:33,435
I’m going to work. I don’t want to sweat my shirt.

365
00:23:33,665 --> 00:23:34,915
Take it off and play.

366
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:37,033
Oh, come on.

367
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:38,509
We’re missing one player. Come on.

368
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:39,722
You go on. I’m not playing.

369
00:23:43,414 --> 00:23:44,503
You’re on Pond’s team.

370
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:45,414
Get up.

371
00:23:46,043 --> 00:23:47,674
Come on, bro.

372
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:51,630
Come.

373
00:24:22,706 --> 00:24:24,788
Li, why address your mother's younger brother as if he is older than her?

374
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,810
People call him Uncle.

375
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:31,518
I follow what other people do.

376
00:24:34,912 --> 00:24:37,268
Should we go eat at Li Ming’s next time?

377
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:41,086
His diner was on TV. How cool.

378
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:44,834
Go ahead.

379
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:47,896
The diner is so quiet during covid.

380
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:51,343
Pattaya seems like an abandoned town.

381
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,815
Which uni are you choosing?

382
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:56,936
In Bangkok or here?

383
00:24:59,982 --> 00:25:01,572
I haven’t decided yet.

384
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:05,378
I’m thinking of studying Film at Rangsit University.

385
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:09,366
My mom is okay if I join a private institute.

386
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:10,816
I don’t need to go through tests.

387
00:25:10,816 --> 00:25:12,347
For the tuition, I plan to get a student loan.

388
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,002
Come on. Your mom is loaded. You don’t need a loan, Golf.

389
00:25:16,002 --> 00:25:17,856
Spare it for those who need it.

390
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:20,501
I don’t want to bother my mom.

391
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:24,784
I heard from our seniors that we don’t need to pay off the loan.

392
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:26,376
Those assholes.

393
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:29,962
Wow, Golf.

00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,657

Li Ming, look.

396
00:25:35,248 --> 00:25:36,844
Cute, right?

397
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:43,684
My girlfriend’s friend is asking for your chat ID. Are you interested?

398
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Let me show you her picture.

399
00:25:47,668 --> 00:25:48,534
No.

00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:50,297

401
00:25:52,657 --> 00:25:53,525

No.

Let me see.

404
00:25:55,732 --> 00:25:58,644
Wow. Isn’t she pretty?

405
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:00,153
Give me her IG.

406
00:26:00,153 --> 00:26:01,167
She has eyes for him.

407
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:03,050
He doesn’t care. I do.

408

409
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,352
Yeah.

410
00:26:10,288 --> 00:26:11,804
It’s an English assignment for your group.

411
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:12,961
Pass it on to the group members.

412
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:14,823
All right. Thanks a lot.

413
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:16,534
Bye now. See you.

Leng!

415
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:04,622
Leng, can I borrow your motorbike?

416
00:27:04,877 --> 00:27:06,877
He’s not here. He’s at the market.

417
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:19,486
Li Ming,

418
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:22,891
I met Auntie Khiao’s son at the market.

419
00:27:23,286 --> 00:27:26,161
He said there’s a free tutoring session at Tha Kru School.

420
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:28,195
I told him to get the application for you too.

421
00:27:28,675 --> 00:27:29,854
Don’t forget to go grab it.

422
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,777
Li Ming.

423
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:40,247
Are you listening to me?

424
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:42,430
I am.

425
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:44,898
If you are, say something.

426
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:45,756
So that I know you get what I say.

427
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:47,255
Will you stop nagging?

428
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:56,022

It’s not like I’m running away.

You do realize that both of my parents passed away, right?

461
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:36,033
Where should I get the money from?

462
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:38,606
You should give me time to make the money.

Can you even handle the interest?

508
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:52,795
In the mall?

509
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:55,489
It’s pricey. Like 200 baht per meal.

510
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:57,870
If I do that, I won’t have any money left to save.

511
00:36:58,701 --> 00:37:00,701
You seem to get a nice salary.

512
00:37:02,282 --> 00:37:03,397
Not really.

513
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:08,068
If so, I wouldn’t work an extra job at your diner.

514
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,596
Is it good, Uncle?

515
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:29,674
One fresh mango, please.

516
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,222
Want some fruit?

517
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:32,695
Sure.

518
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:34,159
20 baht, please.

519
00:37:34,737 --> 00:37:36,397
A 500-baht bill?

520
00:37:36,397 --> 00:37:37,216
Let me go break it.

521
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:39,738
It’s okay. I'll come get the change tomorrow.

522
00:37:39,738 --> 00:37:41,057
Sure. Thank you.

523
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:42,723
Hello.

524
00:37:42,723 --> 00:37:43,563
Hello, Wen.

525
00:37:43,563 --> 00:37:44,580
Can I have my regular, please?

526
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,364
Of course. Four bags, right?

527
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,177
Did she need to be in such a hurry?

528
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,099
Her?

529
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:50,683
She did, Uncle.

530
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,600
If she is late, her pay will be deducted by the minute.

531
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:54,711
She must hurry.

532
00:37:55,196 --> 00:37:58,771
If this rule applies at the diner, Leng won’t have any money left.

533
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:01,899
So…

534
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:04,163
where do you normally have lunch?

535
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:07,186
Sometimes, I buy. Sometimes, I cook.

536
00:38:07,186 --> 00:38:09,022
But I don’t usually wake up to have lunch.

537
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:11,155
I eat whatever Leng buys for me.

538
00:38:13,178 --> 00:38:14,246
Yours is ready, Wen.

539
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,664
Thank you.

540
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:16,981
Here you go.

541
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:17,819
Thank you.

542
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:18,778
See you.

543
00:38:18,778 --> 00:38:20,405
Come again tomorrow.

544
00:38:21,828 --> 00:38:22,630
Want some?

545
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,231
It was a big profit.

546
00:38:26,475 --> 00:38:29,300
100 baht can get you everything in my market.

547
00:38:29,906 --> 00:38:34,818
But these are peeled, come with sticks, and salt and chili dip.

548
00:38:37,157 --> 00:38:39,521
Uncle, I need to get back to work.

549
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:40,377
I’ll see you later.

550
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:42,070
Are you coming this evening?

551
00:38:45,419 --> 00:38:46,307
Of course, I’m coming.

552
00:38:48,177 --> 00:38:51,609
My work is easy. Point a finger and give orders. That’s all.

553
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,885
I have so much time for you.

554
00:38:57,382 --> 00:38:59,892
Your job seems fun.

555
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:03,338
Selling Chicken Rice is more pleasurable.

556
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,582
Uncle, I’m taking off.

557
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:12,349
Here.

558
00:39:13,053 --> 00:39:14,931
Don’t you want it at all?

559
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:16,695
Well…

560
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,123
I’ll take one piece.

561
00:39:27,714 --> 00:39:28,621
Don’t forget.

562
00:39:28,912 --> 00:39:29,577
Hm?

563
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:30,629
To eat.

564
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:33,356
Bye.

565
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,057
We should play football together again.

566
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:50,839
Sure.

567
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:53,348
How about this Saturday? Are you free?

568
00:39:57,712 --> 00:39:58,529
Hey.

569
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:00,755
We better hurry.

570
00:40:00,755 --> 00:40:01,702
Golf said the pizza has been served.

571
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:03,373
You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.

572
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:04,962
Go.

573
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:07,076
Spare me some.

574
00:40:07,076 --> 00:40:08,218
All right. Come quickly.

575
00:40:12,735 --> 00:40:13,470
Li Ming.

576
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:15,225
Wen.

577
00:40:15,897 --> 00:40:16,937
Hello.

578
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:23,717
Wanna join Work & Travel?

579
00:40:24,654 --> 00:40:26,416
I want to go to the states.

580
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:29,607
Or somewhere affordable.

581
00:40:31,544 --> 00:40:33,177
Why don’t you walk in and talk to her?

582
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:36,433
I don’t know the language.

583
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,876
America and Australia?

584
00:40:44,488 --> 00:40:47,847
Where would you choose if you could?

585
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:52,148
It actually depends on the person.

586
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:54,539
And the money you have.

587
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,446
I’d choose America as I think it’s more interesting.

588
00:40:58,618 --> 00:41:00,618
Besides, I have some relatives there.

589
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,141
You do?

590
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:02,935
Yeah.

591
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,417
Then can I ask you if I need some advice?

592
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:08,707
Of course.

593
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:11,403
You can message me.

594
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:12,422
Here’s my chat ID.

595
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:24,246
Have you asked Uncle Jim though?

596
00:41:54,004 --> 00:41:54,849
Hey.

597
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:56,415
Hey.

598
00:41:58,697 --> 00:41:59,512
Hey.

599
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:12,266
Ah. You want to wash it yourself?

600
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:13,962
Thanks a lot.

601
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:22,751
I have nothing to do tonight.

602
00:42:33,047 --> 00:42:34,416
Are you asking me to watch a movie?

603
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:50,046
I want to watch a Thai movie, but there are no subtitles.

604
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,895
Can you tell me what happens in the key scenes?

605
00:43:06,096 --> 00:43:08,776
You’re ordering me around…

606
00:43:10,438 --> 00:43:12,268
You’re ordering me around like I’m your minion.

607
00:43:27,244 --> 00:43:28,783
[I see you can understand it just fine.]

608
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:43,737
[I can guess the main idea. But for some scenes, I can’t. I want to know what’s going on.]

609
00:43:51,887 --> 00:43:53,887
[All right. Next time, let me know which one you want to watch. I watch it with you.]

610
00:44:01,656 --> 00:44:02,663
For what?

611
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:04,170
Oh, right.

612
00:44:07,617 --> 00:44:09,156
[For what?]

613
00:44:13,197 --> 00:44:15,197
[For being my ears.]

614
00:44:20,137 --> 00:44:22,283
[Should we catch a movie at the cinema next time?]

615
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:27,860
Wanna go?

616
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:44,198
[I can’t. Ever since I went deaf, my mom forbids me from going out.]

617
00:45:19,776 --> 00:45:20,524
Leng.

618
00:45:20,912 --> 00:45:21,800
Yes, Uncle?

619
00:45:22,484 --> 00:45:23,203
Here.

620
00:45:23,591 --> 00:45:24,629
My gift for you.

621
00:45:25,214 --> 00:45:26,165
What now?

622
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,699
I bet they’re leftovers again.

623
00:45:36,287 --> 00:45:37,473
Why dressed up today?

624
00:45:38,177 --> 00:45:38,991
Where did you go?

625
00:45:39,271 --> 00:45:40,228
I ran an errand.

626
00:45:41,878 --> 00:45:42,921
What errand?

627
00:45:43,994 --> 00:45:44,899
None of your business.

628
00:45:52,034 --> 00:45:53,129
Whose gold necklace?

629
00:45:57,427 --> 00:45:58,304
Here.

630
00:46:00,294 --> 00:46:01,417
I bought it for you.

631
00:46:04,112 --> 00:46:05,327
It’s Praew’s dowry.

632
00:46:09,258 --> 00:46:10,286
Are you serious?

633
00:46:21,605 --> 00:46:23,177
Don’t you sell it.

634
00:46:26,714 --> 00:46:27,668
Uncle, thank you.

635
00:46:27,668 --> 00:46:28,714
Leng!

636
00:46:28,878 --> 00:46:29,809
I’m giving you a reward.

637
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:31,072
I don’t want your damn reward.

638
00:46:31,072 --> 00:46:33,774
- Leng, back to your seat.
- Go ahead, Leng.

639
00:46:43,059 --> 00:46:44,094
What about you?

640
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:45,180
What’s going on?

641
00:46:45,724 --> 00:46:47,433
One during the day, another at night.

642
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,142
Why don’t you pick one?

643
00:46:51,472 --> 00:46:52,955
Be respectful, Leng.

644
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:56,142
Get serious with someone.

645
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:57,513
Kill your loneliness.

646
00:47:00,911 --> 00:47:02,351
How do you know I’m lonely?

647
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,930
Well, we’re all destined to pair up with someone.

648
00:47:06,598 --> 00:47:09,205
I can't stay with you forever, you know?

649
00:47:09,205 --> 00:47:10,485
I’m having a wife. See?

650
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,657
Just deal with your own business.

651
00:47:12,657 --> 00:47:13,774
Don’t you worry about me.

652
00:47:15,936 --> 00:47:16,897
I’m going to see Praew.

653
00:47:16,897 --> 00:47:17,451
Yes.

654
00:47:17,702 --> 00:47:18,491
Thank you, Uncle Jim.

655
00:47:18,491 --> 00:47:19,338
Here.

656
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,459
Is it good?

657
00:47:37,948 --> 00:47:39,093
Hello.

658
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,695
What did you say?

659
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:47,579
Almost there.

660
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:48,803
We’re parking.

661
00:47:48,803 --> 00:47:49,953
Shit!

662
00:47:51,855 --> 00:47:52,979
I gotta go.

663
00:47:57,688 --> 00:47:58,718
Are you guys all right?

664
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:01,484
Gosh.

665
00:48:02,068 --> 00:48:03,064
Are you okay?

666
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:08,065
You okay? Are you hurt?

667
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,387
It hurts. My leg might be broken.

668
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:14,948
Mister, why didn’t you look carefully when you reversed a car?

669
00:48:15,156 --> 00:48:17,156
We had the light on. Couldn't you see us?

670
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:20,212
Sir, please calm.

671
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,561
Uncle, do you have the car insurance?

672
00:48:23,188 --> 00:48:23,985
One sec.

673
00:48:25,512 --> 00:48:26,513
Are you all right?

674
00:48:30,193 --> 00:48:31,062
Clean your wound.

675
00:48:31,062 --> 00:48:31,868
[Kongsup Car Insurance]

676
00:48:32,663 --> 00:48:36,028
If we’re to compensate you, how much would you ask?

677
00:48:37,276 --> 00:48:39,468
3,000 THB would do. I’m in a hurry here.

678
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:46,088
Uncle.

679
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:48,301
What did the insurance staff say?

680
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:50,880
He’s in a rush.

681
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,339
He said we could pay him.

682
00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:54,707
Then you can deal with the insurance company later.

683
00:48:55,512 --> 00:48:56,630
How much is he asking?

684
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:57,692
3,000 baht.

685
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:58,763
3,000 baht?

686
00:48:59,414 --> 00:49:00,936
My car insurance just expired.

687
00:49:01,321 --> 00:49:02,821
I’ll pay him.

688
00:49:03,046 --> 00:49:04,428
Just tell him to wait a moment.

689
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:28,111
I advanced it.

690
00:49:30,951 --> 00:49:31,983
I will transfer it back.

691
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,106
It’s fine.

692
00:49:35,668 --> 00:49:38,668
This wouldn’t happen if I didn’t ask you to drop me off here.

693
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:39,910
We can’t do that.

694
00:49:41,504 --> 00:49:42,635
Come on.

695
00:49:44,724 --> 00:49:46,188
Let’s talk later.

696
00:49:46,188 --> 00:49:47,214
I need to get to work now.

697
00:49:47,304 --> 00:49:48,078
Thank you.

698
00:49:49,549 --> 00:49:50,321
Hello.

699
00:49:51,549 --> 00:49:52,777
I’m almost there.

700
00:50:11,695 --> 00:50:13,067
We don’t have enough bats on this side.

701
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:14,548
Why not?

702
00:50:15,147 --> 00:50:17,641
I think Jack sent us the wrong work file.

703
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:18,669
Wrong file?

704
00:50:18,669 --> 00:50:19,322
Yeah.

705
00:50:22,174 --> 00:50:22,713
Damn it.

706
00:50:24,548 --> 00:50:26,009
Can we use black fabric instead?

707
00:50:27,112 --> 00:50:28,272
Don’t think it will look good.

708
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:29,952
It’s weird.

709
00:50:30,767 --> 00:50:31,729
You’re right.

710
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,012
We should put it up inside.

711
00:50:38,476 --> 00:50:39,601
Black papers work.

712
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:41,487
But I think if we…

713
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:10,685
You came yourself.

714
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:11,315
I did.

715
00:51:13,885 --> 00:51:16,850
Great job you did here.

716
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:18,469
Thank you, sir.

717
00:51:18,469 --> 00:51:20,150
Sorry though. It’s a little later than scheduled.

718
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:22,287
Can I please get your chat ID?

719
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:23,470
My chat ID?

720
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:26,209
Yes. We can discuss work afterward.

721
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,804
That’s awesome.

722
00:51:44,431 --> 00:51:45,511
Is this you?

723
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,039
Does the beer here taste better than the beer at your diner?

724
00:52:22,152 --> 00:52:23,770
Beer tastes the same everywhere.

725
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:25,765
How can it taste better?

726
00:52:29,761 --> 00:52:32,268
You are not romantic at all. You know that?

727
00:52:34,725 --> 00:52:36,725
When you’re almost 40 like me,

728
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:39,230
with one nephew, one employee,

729
00:52:39,549 --> 00:52:42,537
a house, a car, and a money pool to deal with,

730
00:52:42,922 --> 00:52:44,134
you can’t afford to be romantic.

731
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,179
Life is bitter.

732
00:52:47,268 --> 00:52:48,380
Bitter like beer?

733
00:52:49,952 --> 00:52:51,020
Beer is much sweeter in comparison.

734
00:52:52,268 --> 00:52:54,268
That’s why you drink it every day.

735
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,147
I drink because I want to get drunk.

736
00:53:02,706 --> 00:53:03,945
When I’m drunk, I don’t dream.

737
00:53:04,888 --> 00:53:06,188
Just sleep and wake up.

738
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,195
Do you have a dream?

739
00:53:13,418 --> 00:53:16,231
My dream isn’t romantic.

740
00:53:18,078 --> 00:53:19,107
Pay off my debt.

741
00:53:19,668 --> 00:53:20,976
Financially support my nephew until he graduates.

742
00:53:23,493 --> 00:53:25,785
And I’d like to experience having a million baht.

743
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:26,812
See what it’s like.

744
00:53:27,723 --> 00:53:28,623
What is yours?

745
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:47,975
I want home.

746
00:53:52,398 --> 00:53:55,313
Home where someone waits for me.

747
00:53:57,062 --> 00:53:58,591
When I get home, all my tiredness is gone.

748
00:53:59,764 --> 00:54:01,225
When I’m home, I have peace of mind.

749
00:54:04,062 --> 00:54:06,062
Not just a place to sleep.

750
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,104
Don’t you already have one?

751
00:54:14,642 --> 00:54:15,661
I don’t.

752
00:54:31,398 --> 00:54:32,289
Don’t.

753
00:54:36,363 --> 00:54:37,083
It’s not good.

754
00:54:39,957 --> 00:54:43,460
If you don’t try, how can you tell if it’s good or not?

755
00:55:02,873 --> 00:55:03,895
Okay, Uncle.

756
00:55:04,658 --> 00:55:05,636
I get it.

757
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,529
I see I’m not the right person.

758
00:55:10,854 --> 00:55:12,634
Sorry for making you uncomfortable.

759
00:55:12,634 --> 00:55:13,317
Hey.

760
00:55:13,956 --> 00:55:14,829
I’m okay.

761
00:55:16,086 --> 00:55:17,213
You will be okay too.

762
00:55:23,281 --> 00:55:26,381
Can you lend me your shoulder?

763
00:55:32,026 --> 00:55:32,827
Why should I?

764
00:55:34,548 --> 00:55:35,567
As an acquaintance, if you don't mind

765
00:55:58,023 --> 00:55:59,776
Don’t waste your time on me.

766
00:56:05,617 --> 00:56:06,554
Someone like me

767
00:56:09,697 --> 00:56:11,546
doesn’t fit to be anyone’s home.

768
00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:59,263
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

769
00:56:59,908 --> 00:57:01,668
I used to argue with my sister.

770
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:05,110
She claimed that man-to-man love does not exist.

771
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:06,350
Do you know what I said to her?

772
00:57:06,428 --> 00:57:07,461
I said, “I’ll show you.”

773
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:09,548
What a cunning son you are.

774
00:57:11,149 --> 00:57:13,948
Tell me which faculty or university you want to go to.

775
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:16,668
Do you still need your uncle to make school decisions for you?

776
00:57:16,668 --> 00:57:17,856
What do you want to be?

777
00:57:17,856 --> 00:57:19,489
I don’t know yet.

778
00:57:19,966 --> 00:57:21,786
Do you want to go Loy Krathong together?
