Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:21,241
You broke up, but you're still living together.

5
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:23,223
Whatever you choose, make it clear.

6
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,948
My love was just for you.

7
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:27,638
But it's no longer that.

8
00:00:27,638 --> 00:00:30,000
Hold on. That’s my pen.

9
00:00:30,384 --> 00:00:34,760
Now that you are aware, just return what you took to me.

10
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:37,593
Do you remember my question?

11
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:41,493
I asked you if it’s going to be complicated.

12
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:43,254
Then what is this?

13
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:52,533
Oh shit!

14
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:54,029
You taught him to ride a motorcycle?

15
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:56,125
He’s deaf.

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Deaf people can ride motorcycles.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,000
He wants to live his life like everyone else, not cooped up in here like this.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,335
Why would you stay with someone who no longer loves you?

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,316
I don't have a place to stay anymore.

20
00:01:37,336 --> 00:01:39,798
Do you always stare at everyone who sleeps over?

21
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:42,216
No.

22
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:49,147
I mean

23
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:51,206
no one sleeps over.

24
00:02:08,064 --> 00:02:10,100
Am I making you uncomfortable?

25
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:21,803
You mean making me sleep on the floor?

26
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:24,059
It’s okay.

27
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,578
I’m used to it.

28
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:34,221
You know what I mean.

29
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:45,636
Actually, I even have to thank you.

30
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,055
I can finally move on from him.

31
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:57,541
Otherwise, we'll get stuck together for who knows how long.

32
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:06,664
So that means I’m the reason why

33
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,718
you decided to do this.

34
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,562
I told you.

35
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:15,844
I broke up with him long ago.

36
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:22,594
This just helps him get over me more easily.

37
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,147
What’s your plan now?

38
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:44,893
If you’re not okay, I can stay at a hotel.

39
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:49,356
Are you testing me?

40
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:51,635
Am I allowed to test you?

41
00:03:57,626 --> 00:04:00,195
Crash here for now.

42
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:04,551
When you find yourself a place, we will talk again.

43
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:10,245
Thank you.

44
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,730
Chapter 6: The Walk to Forget and Forgive

45
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:29,430
Here.

46
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,396
Mariner’s Omelet.

47
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:33,692
My favorite.

48
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:37,138
Let me.

49
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:41,555
Here, try it.

50
00:06:43,907 --> 00:06:44,912
Sure.

51
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,552
It’s good.

52
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:02,686
Let's call it my work in exchange for a place to sleep.

53
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:09,680
I’m not a picky person.

54
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,852
Very easy to treat.

55
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,720
By the way, where’s Li Ming?

56
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:23,080
Hello.

57
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,031
Hey, want to join us?

58
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:27,755
You guys go ahead.

59
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:42,614
There are no more eggs.

60
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:44,080
Sit and eat with us.

61
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,312
It’s okay, Uncle Jim.

62
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,186
I’m not eating.

63
00:07:47,186 --> 00:07:50,280
I’m headed out.

64
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,399
Fighting again?

65
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:19,847
Hey.

66
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:22,835
Which one do you think the cat will choose?

67
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:25,894
Animals trust their instincts when they make choices.

68
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:33,058
Come to daddy.

69
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:34,257
Go to your daddy.

70
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:46,086
Jimbo, which flavor do you want?

71
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:54,488
If we don’t offer him choices, he won’t have the right to choose.

72
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:56,390
He chooses anyway.

73
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,446
Choose whether or not he will eat.

74
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,469
But if it’s this one, you’ll definitely eat it. Right, Jimbo?

75
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:07,499
It smells so nice. Right, Jimbo?

76
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:10,362
So good, isn’t it?

77
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:16,200
Seems like he trusts you.

78
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:18,927
Does his owner trust me too?

79
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:27,663
Here. Let me feed him.

80
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:29,662
Eat.

81
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,583
It’s really good. Huh, Jimbo?

82
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:48,276
Right, Jimbo?

83
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:49,926
Jimbo, you don’t stop eating.

84
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:10,341
Hi, Mrs. Jintana.

85
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:11,591
Hi.

86
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:16,153
Let me help.

87
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:26,120
I changed these pots the other day.

88
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:36,884
Actually, your work has paid off your debt.

89
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,587
You don’t have to come anymore.

90
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,360
Let Jim know too.

91
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:45,098
Can I come to see Heart though?

92
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,487
I’m sorry for taking Heart out without telling you.

93
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,569
Heart said staying home stressed him out so much.

94
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:16,532
So I took him outside.

95
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,463
He told you that?

96
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:21,474
Yes.

97
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:25,887
Where did you guys go?

98
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:32,026
To shopping malls, to take a walk,

99
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:35,412
and to catch a movie.

100
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,983
Catch a movie?

101
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,834
Yes, we did.

102
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:42,311
Heart likes watching movies so much.

103
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:44,944
He usually watches Western movies

104
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:49,372
because Thai movies don’t have subtitles for him.

105
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,396
And…

106
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:59,445
actually, Heart is quite communicative.

107
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:03,835
Do you know Paolo Church?

108
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:13,200
There are activities for deaf people to do.

109
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,187
Many activities.

110
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:17,187
They use sign language to talk to each other.

111
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:20,996
Heart likes to communicate with people there.

112
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:22,862
He’s so communicative.

113
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:26,417
Besides, he seems…

114
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,664
He seems really happy.

115
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:58,012
Next time,

116
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,482
if you’re going out again, let me know.

117
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,079
I will tell my husband to take you two.

118
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,730
So that I won’t get worried.

119
00:13:13,736 --> 00:13:14,778
Ma’am,

120
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:20,232
can I take Heart to hang out at my house?

121
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:55,112
[Are you being a troublesome kid, jackass?]

122
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:40,846
You almost hit the pole, Uncle Jim.

123
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:43,573
It was right there.

124
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:45,575
Leng.

125
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:47,354
For you.

126
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,526
Hey.

127
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,020
Hi, Uncle Jim.

128
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:56,626
So?

129
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:57,842
Why did you come together?

130
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,592
I’ve been sleeping at his house.

131
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:03,767
Uncle Jim lets you stay at his place?

132
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:06,237
He normally doesn’t get serious with anyone.

133
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:07,866
Really?

134
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:08,853
Yeah.

135
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,310
Are you guys boyfriends now?

136
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,752
Huh?

137
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:19,324
Not yet.

138
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,112
You’re staying together.

139
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:23,300
If not boyfriends, then what is it?

140
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:27,926
I’d like to know too.

141
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:30,000
Can you ask him for me?

142
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:37,362
Uncle Jim,

143
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:40,440
you guys are staying together,

144
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,448
and going places together.

145
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:44,253
What should I call this relationship?

146
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:50,517
Friends.

147
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,930
Is there a problem, Leng?

148
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:57,476
Friends.

149
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,124
Fried Banana. Let me try.

150
00:16:03,732 --> 00:16:06,000
Wow. It’s a lot.

151
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:10,020
Is it good?

152
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,258
Yes.

153
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:16,171
Thanks.

154
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:30,315
Are you missing home?

155
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:35,635
A little.

156
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:42,746
I never asked why you moved here.

157
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,479
Bangkok seems to suit you better.

158
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:51,269
Bangkok

159
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,130
is overcrowded.

160
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:57,491
If every place was well-developed like Bangkok,

161
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,288
people wouldn't choose to live there.

162
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,790
Why?

163
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:11,586
There was a job vacancy then.

164
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:16,109
So I took the risk.

165
00:17:19,344 --> 00:17:20,918
Back in old days,

166
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:23,312
I loved to take risks too.

167
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,813
You?

168
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,521
Otherwise, my big sister and I wouldn’t have run away from home.

169
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:38,181
Li Ming’s mom?

170
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:40,862
Right. Her name is Jam.

171
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
I hear from her once in a while.

172
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:50,624
She said

173
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:54,376
we’re two great survivors.

174
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:00,213
Pa said the same to me.

175
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:02,697
He said I’m a survivor.

176
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:07,407
I can live anywhere.

177
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:16,585
But it’s damn lonely.

178
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:22,459
It is.

179
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:29,396
If possible,

180
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,226
I’d like to have a permanent home too.

181
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:56,594
Anyone

182
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:59,852
wants a permanent home.

183
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:06,920
Pa once told me love is like a home.

184
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,061
To find out whether we like it or not,

185
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:13,105
we must take a chance and try it.

186
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:17,541
If it’s not the right home,

187
00:19:19,363 --> 00:19:20,759
we must move out.

188
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:25,536
But once we find the right one,

189
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:29,545
we won’t want to move anywhere.

190
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,610
That’s where we can stay for the rest of our lives.

191
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
Why, Uncle Jim?

192
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:26,544
Why is your wall so high?

193
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:36,000
Am I not the right one for you?

194
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:39,744
It’s not you.

195
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:43,654
It’s me.

196
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:47,797
Yes.

197
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:48,784
Sure.

198
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:49,976
Goodbye.

199
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,143
I won’t be home tonight and tomorrow night.

200
00:20:56,143 --> 00:20:57,554
I will be back on Sunday.

201
00:20:58,158 --> 00:20:59,155
See you.

202
00:21:00,195 --> 00:21:02,080
Do you have to take the ring off to go home?

203
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,920
What’s wrong? I just forgot.

204
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,017
You forget it every Friday when you go home.

205
00:21:12,894 --> 00:21:14,432
Please don’t start a fight.

206
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,325
Who’s calling?

207
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,136
Pick up.

208
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:28,996
A friend.

209
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:29,929
Nothing urgent.

210
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:30,820
A friend?

211
00:21:31,348 --> 00:21:32,220
What friend?

212
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,680
Let me see if it’s just a friend.

213
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,854
Just a friend.

214
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:36,277
That’s bullshit.

215
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:38,075
What kind of friends have anniversaries?

216
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:39,348
Are you sure that’s called ‘friends?’

217
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:40,080
Let me see.

218
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,825
Calm down.

219
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:44,080
Let’s talk when I’m home.

220
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,021
Home?

221
00:21:45,294 --> 00:21:46,761
Which home?

222
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,044
Every time you go home, I can never reach you.

223
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:56,414
I believe you when you say your family doesn’t know about us.

224
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,525
I’ve always trusted you.

225
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,760
How does it play out now?

226
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:04,640
I’m just an idiot for believing you.

227
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,772
What’s the matter with you?

228
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:06,616
Can you stop being silly?

229
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,480
Silly?

230
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,347
I’m silly?

231
00:22:12,295 --> 00:22:15,880
Do you want me to tell you what her name is?

232
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:18,570
I can explain.

233
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,364
Explain?

234
00:22:19,364 --> 00:22:20,307
No more explanation.

235
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:22,229
We’re over.

236
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:24,437
Hey, Mister!

237
00:22:24,437 --> 00:22:26,100
Are you boarding?
We’re about to go.

238
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,359
I am. Just a moment, please.

239
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,263
Sure.

240
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:29,374
Hey!

241
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,076
I’ll call you when I’m home.

242
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:32,741
I can explain.

243
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:33,746
Just get lost, Beam.

244
00:22:33,746 --> 00:22:35,047
Sir!

245
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:35,746
Yes.

246
00:22:35,746 --> 00:22:36,849
One second, please.

247
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:37,900
Just a moment.

248
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,144
Hurry up.

249
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,447
Please let me–

250
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:44,035
We’re leaving, sir.

251
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:45,405
All right.

252
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,448
Just one second, please.

253
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,661
Come on, guys. We’re leaving.

254
00:22:48,661 --> 00:22:50,047
I’ll call you once I’m home.

255
00:22:50,915 --> 00:22:52,915
Please be quick. We’re leaving.

256
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:57,351
Please hurry.

257
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:04,767
Thank you.

258
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:06,000
Be careful there.

259
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,957
Let’s go.

260
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:38,595
A ferry accident has been reported.

261
00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:45,298
Today, at 10:30 a.m., the Pattaya-Koh Larn ferry capsized.

262
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,982
The police have not yet determined what caused this accident.

263
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:50,875
As of now, 14 casualties have been found.

264
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,238
There are also an unknown number of people missing.

265
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:56,343
One of the assumptions is that there was a problem with the engine.

266
00:25:56,872 --> 00:25:58,170
Do you know

267
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,355
what I think every time I’m here?

268
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:07,545
I think if I put up a bigger fight that day,

269
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
and stopped him from boarding that ferry,

270
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,710
I wouldn’t have to feel this way.

271
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:22,298
It’s not your fault.

272
00:26:32,327 --> 00:26:34,007
I could have learned

273
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:38,353
what it was all about.

274
00:26:39,216 --> 00:26:40,896
Who was that woman?

275
00:26:43,281 --> 00:26:45,139
Was I in the guilty position?

276
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:47,849
Did I take him from her?

277
00:26:49,571 --> 00:26:51,571
But I have absolutely no idea.

278
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:56,710
I don’t even know if the feeling we shared all those times

279
00:26:59,142 --> 00:27:00,573
were real.

280
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:18,404
Time

281
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:23,208
will make everything better.

282
00:27:28,638 --> 00:27:30,000
The older we get,

283
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:32,143
the harder our scars can get healed.

284
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,853
Do you agree?

285
00:27:43,148 --> 00:27:44,899
I’m sorry, Uncle Jim.

286
00:28:33,062 --> 00:28:34,786
I suggest you get a loan somewhere else.

287
00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:38,027
What do you mean?

288
00:28:38,691 --> 00:28:39,555
I’m not approved?

289
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,530
It’s not that.

290
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:43,651
If you file this, you might get the approval.

291
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,058
However,

292
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:49,149
I can’t separate work from personal matters.

293
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,025
Try submitting this to a different branch or bank.

294
00:28:58,545 --> 00:29:00,739
This is the loan department's card at the Naklue branch.

295
00:29:01,258 --> 00:29:02,816
Try with them.

296
00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:34,773
[Gaipa]

297
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,792
What’s up, Gaipa?

298
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,952
Here, Uncle Jim.

299
00:29:50,643 --> 00:29:51,370
Thanks a lot.

300
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,691
I kind of miss Moo sometimes.

301
00:29:59,804 --> 00:30:02,025
I just met him not too long ago.

302
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:07,880
I feel like Dad’s still with me too.

303
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:11,777
Mom talks about him every day.

304
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:17,044
Is Mrs. Hong feeling lonely?

305
00:30:17,044 --> 00:30:17,840
She is.

306
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:19,847
That’s why I don’t go out very often.

307
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,863
I stay home to keep her company.

308
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:28,743
You’re a very nice kid, Gaipa.

309
00:30:29,987 --> 00:30:30,769
Am I?

310
00:30:36,276 --> 00:30:38,165
Dad used to tell me that

311
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:44,318
when Mom was young, she chased after him, like…

312
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:46,456
She never quit.

313
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:49,659
He didn’t like her at first.

314
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:52,061
But he said

315
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:57,145
after a while, people can eventually get softhearted.

316
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:00,189
Mom kept on pestering him.

317
00:31:01,024 --> 00:31:02,720
And they finally went out.

318
00:31:07,987 --> 00:31:10,955
If we keep chasing after the one we love,

319
00:31:11,842 --> 00:31:13,207
do you think we'll ever be loved back?

320
00:31:16,747 --> 00:31:17,852
I think

321
00:31:18,618 --> 00:31:19,733
something like this

322
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:24,352
depends on whether they like us or not.

323
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:29,751
If we’re not the right one, we’re not.

324
00:31:31,935 --> 00:31:34,350
Is it possible for me to be the right one for you?

325
00:31:49,661 --> 00:31:51,357
I’m sorry, Gaipa.

326
00:32:04,972 --> 00:32:06,419
I was just saying.

327
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:15,927
Here, try this for me.

328
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:20,623
Mom always says I make it too plain.

329
00:32:20,623 --> 00:32:23,851
But I think it’s okay.

330
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:26,883
Try it.

331
00:32:26,883 --> 00:32:27,884
Let’s eat.

332
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:30,041
Come on. Let’s eat.

333
00:33:01,014 --> 00:33:02,025
Gaipa.

334
00:33:03,605 --> 00:33:05,246
I’m returning your title deed.

335
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,434
I don’t think I will need it.

336
00:33:10,315 --> 00:33:11,406
Uncle Jim,

337
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:14,223
it has nothing to do with us.

338
00:33:14,956 --> 00:33:17,884
I truly want to help you.

339
00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:22,505
I’m not helping you because I want you to like me.

340
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:24,133
It really has nothing to do with us.

341
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,835
It’s not that, Gaipa.

342
00:33:27,804 --> 00:33:31,740
I think I’ll ask my sister for her title deed.

343
00:33:32,622 --> 00:33:35,120
We’re siblings. It should help get the approval easier.

344
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:42,267
Okay.

345
00:33:57,117 --> 00:33:58,195
Let’s eat.

346
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:02,657
Eat.

347
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:12,884
Gai, how are you?

348
00:34:13,443 --> 00:34:14,672
Do you want me to come over?

349
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:18,236
Don’t worry about Uncle Jim.

350
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,986
Worry about yourself first.

351
00:34:23,802 --> 00:34:24,789
I gotta go.

352
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,393
Uncle Jim, I got a question.

353
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,090
Did you return Gaipa his title deed?

354
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:33,928
Yes, I did.

355
00:34:35,722 --> 00:34:37,584
Why? I don’t get it.

356
00:34:38,506 --> 00:34:40,871
This is whatever Gaipa said.

357
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:46,124
But the deed and Gaipa are two different issues.

358
00:34:49,373 --> 00:34:50,222
Leng.

359
00:34:50,803 --> 00:34:53,254
I don’t want to use his feelings for my own benefit.

360
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,413
I think that’s a little selfish.

361
00:34:56,612 --> 00:35:00,852
But it’s normal to be selfish when we’re desperate, isn’t it?

362
00:35:01,796 --> 00:35:03,053
Desperate, yes.

363
00:35:03,053 --> 00:35:04,736
But you must have dignity too.

364
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:09,519
If you were in my place, you wouldn’t want anyone to do this to you either.

365
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,713
Fine.

366
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,295
What are you gonna do now?

367
00:35:19,165 --> 00:35:21,054
Where will you get the money from?

368
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,698
I think I’ll talk to my family.

369
00:35:32,353 --> 00:35:34,124
There might be a title deed I can borrow.

370
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,950
[Jam: What’s up?]

371
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:56,937
(Hello.)

372
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:58,124
Hello, Jam.

373
00:35:59,547 --> 00:36:01,768
Do you have a title deed I can borrow?

374
00:36:06,173 --> 00:36:07,620
I need money.

375
00:36:17,273 --> 00:36:18,117
Uncle Jim.

376
00:36:18,725 --> 00:36:20,268
Why are you home before me today?

377
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,590
It’s towards the end of the year.

378
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,354
People go out to eat something fancy.

379
00:36:25,637 --> 00:36:27,637
We barely had any customers left at 10 p.m.

380
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:30,604
And…

381
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:33,605
why are you decorating the house for the new year?

382
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:36,677
It might help better my life.

383
00:36:42,608 --> 00:36:43,769
Let me help.

384
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,179
Sure.

385
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:48,435
Like this?

386
00:36:49,683 --> 00:36:50,710
Right.

387
00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:05,787
Can you help add the tape for me?

388
00:37:05,787 --> 00:37:06,682
Of course.

389
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:38,943
Do you feel the spark?

390
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:47,996
See?

391
00:37:48,245 --> 00:37:50,313
Decorating a house can bring something good.

392
00:37:51,846 --> 00:37:52,856
Come on.

393
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,565
We talked about this.

394
00:37:57,587 --> 00:37:58,418
Okay.

395
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,569
Come here, Uncle Jim.

396
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,491
Here.

397
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:49,164
Uncle Jim.

398
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:52,161
Can I sleep on your lap?

399
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:57,332
Sure.

400
00:39:14,867 --> 00:39:17,061
Do you take this place as your home?

401
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:45,287
Uncle Jim.

402
00:40:46,297 --> 00:40:48,484
What are you cooking so early? It smells great.

403
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:49,872
Are you hungry?

404
00:40:51,276 --> 00:40:52,341
No.

405
00:40:52,341 --> 00:40:54,161
I heard the noise, so I came out to take a look.

406
00:40:54,898 --> 00:40:58,124
I’m going to the temple. I’m cooking for my offerings.

407
00:40:59,402 --> 00:41:00,666
Why did you ask me too?

408
00:41:01,402 --> 00:41:03,216
It’s a day off.

409
00:41:03,216 --> 00:41:04,874
I thought you could use some rest.

410
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,708
I’m coming with you.

411
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:10,564
I might not seem like it, but I do go to temples.

412
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,576
Can you wait for me? I’ll go get ready.

413
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,160
All right, then.

414
00:41:53,141 --> 00:41:55,335
Pour water of dedication and get blessed.

[Bavorndech Pithakwiwattana]
[Born July 15 1984]
[Died December 30 2018]
[Aged 34 years.]

416
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,068
He was still young.

417
00:42:59,186 --> 00:43:01,186
Nothing in life is certain.

418
00:43:04,577 --> 00:43:08,126
Death comes too easy sometimes.

419
00:43:19,007 --> 00:43:20,758
Living, in fact, is more difficult.

420
00:43:32,354 --> 00:43:34,437
I even think what it’d be like…

421
00:43:37,299 --> 00:43:38,525
if he still lived.

422
00:43:53,499 --> 00:43:54,470
Uncle Jim.

423
00:43:54,747 --> 00:43:58,569
Have you met that woman?

424
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:06,910
Who am I to meet her?

425
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:11,182
Besides, I have no idea why I should meet her.

426
00:44:12,762 --> 00:44:13,979
Meet her

427
00:44:16,274 --> 00:44:18,550
so that you can let go of what you’ve been doubting.

428
00:44:35,915 --> 00:44:37,279
I don’t know her.

429
00:44:38,818 --> 00:44:40,524
I don’t know anything about her.

430
00:44:41,653 --> 00:44:45,063
If you want to, it can’t be that hard.

431
00:44:50,057 --> 00:44:51,642
Do you still have Beam’s Facebook?

432
00:45:42,235 --> 00:45:43,137
Uncle Jim.

433
00:45:45,162 --> 00:45:46,605
Do you want me to come with you?

434
00:45:51,455 --> 00:45:52,626
I can do this alone.

435
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:56,061
Then

436
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,279
I’ll be waiting around here.

437
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:20,628
I made merit for Beam the other day.

438
00:46:28,848 --> 00:46:31,386
Actually, I have no idea why I came.

439
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,324
Maybe because I don’t know anything at all.

440
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:38,431
That’s why.

441
00:46:41,511 --> 00:46:42,717
What do you want to know?

442
00:46:44,242 --> 00:46:45,704
Did you know about me?

443
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:47,442
I did.

444
00:46:56,574 --> 00:46:58,509
Beam and I had been together since university.

445
00:46:59,741 --> 00:47:01,224
Our dads were close.

446
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:04,482
They introduced us.

447
00:47:05,715 --> 00:47:07,112
Typical Chinese families.

448
00:47:08,545 --> 00:47:12,010
After some meals and getting to know one another, we started dating.

449
00:47:17,424 --> 00:47:20,846
That means I came later.

450
00:47:23,818 --> 00:47:24,760
So?

451
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:30,418
In the end, he dated you too anyway.

452
00:47:31,566 --> 00:47:32,384
Could you take it?

453
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,449
This kind of stuff,

454
00:47:35,577 --> 00:47:36,725
nobody can take it.

455
00:47:40,581 --> 00:47:41,762
When I found out,

456
00:47:43,765 --> 00:47:45,396
I forced him

457
00:47:46,052 --> 00:47:47,083
to break up with you.

458
00:47:52,438 --> 00:47:53,296
Thanks.

459
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,935
Can I ask you back?

460
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,369
If you knew about me,

461
00:48:18,702 --> 00:48:19,707
what would you do?

462
00:48:21,086 --> 00:48:22,598
I might have asked him to choose.

463
00:48:26,853 --> 00:48:28,016
How nice of you.

464
00:48:28,689 --> 00:48:33,317
Beam told me he needed time to fix our problem.

465
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:41,285
So that means he wanted to break up with me.

466
00:48:45,151 --> 00:48:46,505
I don’t know.

467
00:48:46,785 --> 00:48:48,120
He passed first.

468
00:48:48,965 --> 00:48:50,965
But if you ask me,

469
00:48:52,523 --> 00:48:53,941
I don’t think he wanted to break up with you.

470
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:57,809
If he did, he would’ve done it long ago.

471
00:49:01,529 --> 00:49:03,034
He must have loved you so much.

472
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:06,156
You think?

473
00:49:09,677 --> 00:49:11,677
I’ve been living with this doubt.

474
00:49:12,846 --> 00:49:17,108
I don’t even know if he truly loved me.

475
00:49:20,968 --> 00:49:21,941
He did.

476
00:49:27,347 --> 00:49:28,783
But you don’t believe so, do you?

477
00:49:30,752 --> 00:49:33,226
If I told you Beam didn’t love you,

478
00:49:36,649 --> 00:49:38,391
lovers didn’t do that to each other,

479
00:49:39,265 --> 00:49:41,502
you wouldn’t believe me either no matter what I said.

480
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:52,809
We just fell in love with a selfish man.

481
00:49:59,421 --> 00:50:01,292
I forgave him for everything, though.

482
00:50:09,808 --> 00:50:12,993
I don’t know if this is the answer you’re looking for.

483
00:50:25,617 --> 00:50:26,795
I’m glad

484
00:50:28,949 --> 00:50:31,666
that at least Beam wanted to do right by you.

485
00:50:41,188 --> 00:50:46,376
Mommy, can we continue our coloring now?

486
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,026
Okay.

487
00:50:47,026 --> 00:50:49,002
But first, say hello to Uncle.

488
00:50:49,141 --> 00:50:51,141
Hello, Uncle.

489
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:52,893
Good girl. I’ll be right there.

490
00:50:52,893 --> 00:50:53,458
All right.

491
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:02,600
Is she the daughter of…

492
00:51:04,065 --> 00:51:05,276
It’s not what you think.

493
00:51:06,949 --> 00:51:08,067
I’m married.

494
00:51:13,064 --> 00:51:14,097
And you?

495
00:51:14,395 --> 00:51:17,084
Are you still running a Chicken Rice diner?

496
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:18,560
Yes.

497
00:51:18,797 --> 00:51:19,689
Still.

498
00:51:22,339 --> 00:51:23,180
You know what?

499
00:51:24,235 --> 00:51:27,268
I followed you and Beam to the diner once.

500
00:51:31,252 --> 00:51:32,530
I was furious then.

501
00:51:33,252 --> 00:51:37,571
What hurt me even more was that he never apologized.

502
00:51:39,986 --> 00:51:43,731
But what can we expect from a dead man?

503
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,425
I quit suffocating over the past.

504
00:52:01,399 --> 00:52:03,248
I’m happy with my life today.

505
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,140
Will you excuse me?

506
00:52:09,657 --> 00:52:11,232
This meal is on me.

507
00:52:16,787 --> 00:52:17,868
Do it right here too.

508
00:52:18,105 --> 00:52:19,519
What is this? Tell me.

509
00:52:20,188 --> 00:52:20,942
A princess.

510
00:52:20,942 --> 00:52:22,188
A princess!

511
00:52:37,689 --> 00:52:39,280
Did the food there taste good?

512
00:52:40,854 --> 00:52:42,060
I didn’t eat it at all.

513
00:52:44,343 --> 00:52:47,809
Are you going back for it?

514
00:52:49,661 --> 00:52:50,480
No.

515
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:53,821
I’m not going back anymore.

516
00:52:58,732 --> 00:53:01,252
If you hadn’t passed out drunk at my diner that night,

517
00:53:03,435 --> 00:53:05,198
I have no clue what I’d have been right now.

518
00:53:08,758 --> 00:53:13,450
You wouldn’t have had a multifunctional employee who helps you with everything.

519
00:53:15,257 --> 00:53:17,602
I’m so entitled to the best employee award.

520
00:53:19,003 --> 00:53:19,689
Sure.

521
00:53:20,551 --> 00:53:21,865
You’re the first.

522
00:53:22,088 --> 00:53:23,400
Leng is the second.

523
00:53:23,723 --> 00:53:25,703
The third would be Li Ming.

524
00:53:27,489 --> 00:53:29,489
These are all I have.

525
00:53:34,556 --> 00:53:36,384
Are you including me in your family?

526
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:47,192
Thank you so much.

527
00:53:49,324 --> 00:53:51,873
This is the most relieved new year ever in my life.

528
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,061
Come on.

529
00:54:11,237 --> 00:54:12,484
What’s the hurry?

530
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:14,519
Can’t we see the fireworks first?

531
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:17,021
No.

532
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:18,391
I’ve seen it too many times.

533
00:54:29,504 --> 00:54:31,060
Let’s join a prayer ceremony instead.

534
00:54:31,728 --> 00:54:33,314
Oh please, Uncle Jim.

535
00:55:36,096 --> 00:55:39,355
[See? I told you. If you asked your mom nicely, she would let you come.]

536
00:55:41,178 --> 00:55:44,773
[You’re smart. You can persuade her.]

537
00:56:02,922 --> 00:56:04,123
[Jimbo.]

538
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:04,922
Jimbo.

539
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:12,638
Yyim-bo.

540
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,467
Hey!

541
00:56:17,922 --> 00:56:18,697
You

542
00:56:18,697 --> 00:56:19,197
can

543
00:56:20,354 --> 00:56:21,179
speak?

544
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:25,774
Hey, you can speak?

545
00:56:28,974 --> 00:56:29,752
Yeah?

546
00:56:30,864 --> 00:56:31,608
Can

547
00:56:32,447 --> 00:56:33,136
you

548
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,277
speak

549
00:56:36,312 --> 00:56:37,228
again?

550
00:56:37,396 --> 00:56:38,190
I want to hear.

551
00:56:49,357 --> 00:56:50,146
I

552
00:56:50,272 --> 00:56:51,063
want

553
00:56:51,604 --> 00:56:52,357
to hear

554
00:56:52,357 --> 00:56:53,184
your voice.

555
00:57:04,205 --> 00:57:04,844
H…heart.

556
00:57:04,844 --> 00:57:05,536
Hey!

557
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:09,017
I heard

558
00:57:09,017 --> 00:57:11,044
you just say

559
00:57:11,044 --> 00:57:12,503
your name.

560
00:57:13,278 --> 00:57:14,186
You’re great.

561
00:57:14,396 --> 00:57:15,803
You’re awesome.

562
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:16,899
How can you speak?

563
00:57:17,612 --> 00:57:18,600
You’re so great.

564
00:57:18,747 --> 00:57:20,175
I’m happy.

565
00:57:20,175 --> 00:57:21,126
How could you do it?

566
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:23,795
I’m happy. Can you see?

567
00:57:23,795 --> 00:57:24,600
I’m so happy.

568
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,597
Why do you look confused?

569
00:57:25,597 --> 00:57:26,428
I’m so delighted.

570
00:57:26,428 --> 00:57:27,502
Let me hug you.

571
00:57:30,186 --> 00:57:30,965
What?

572
00:57:31,133 --> 00:57:32,089
You’re so great.

573
00:57:32,089 --> 00:57:32,925
Speak again.

574
00:57:32,925 --> 00:57:33,425
Do it.

575
00:57:33,593 --> 00:57:34,190
Do it again.

576
00:57:34,613 --> 00:57:36,409
It's finally here, everyone,

577
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:41,836
the night we countdown to wave goodbye to 2022 and welcome 2023.

578
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:45,533
I believe this is the year many of you have been looking forward to.

579
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:49,712
After many years of dealing with the pandemic,

580
00:57:49,712 --> 00:57:53,813
we can finally celebrate the new year like we used to.

581
00:57:53,813 --> 00:57:57,820
Despite the length of the crisis,

582
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:01,430
I believe everyone who has lived through it

583
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:07,934
appreciates how precious it is to spend meaningful time with loved ones.

584
00:58:22,106 --> 00:58:22,747
You…

585
00:58:22,747 --> 00:58:24,798
have never…

586
00:58:25,863 --> 00:58:26,482
celebrated…

587
00:58:27,699 --> 00:58:28,891
Ah!

588
00:58:28,891 --> 00:58:31,646
You’ve never celebrated the new year with anyone before?

589
00:58:35,062 --> 00:58:35,834
With me now.

590
00:58:43,513 --> 00:58:44,298
Uncle Jim,

591
00:58:45,074 --> 00:58:47,190
should we go to the shrine tomorrow?

592
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:50,750
Let’s go eat the auspicious new year oranges.

593
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:54,749
Sure.

594
00:58:56,952 --> 00:59:00,710
How about you ask Li Ming to come too?

595
00:59:03,485 --> 00:59:04,596
You do it.

596
00:59:05,169 --> 00:59:07,086
He won’t come if I do.

597
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,669
Okay.

598
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:16,832
Hey.

599
00:59:19,662 --> 00:59:20,649
It’s almost time.

600
00:59:20,838 --> 00:59:24,348
And now the countdown is starting.

601
00:59:24,348 --> 00:59:26,694
Everyone, let’s count down together.

602
00:59:28,132 --> 00:59:28,952
Ten…

603
00:59:29,456 --> 00:59:30,292
Nine,

604
00:59:30,628 --> 00:59:31,422
eight,

605
00:59:31,706 --> 00:59:32,321
seven,

606
00:59:32,426 --> 00:59:33,235
six,

607
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:34,567
five,

608
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,012
four,

609
00:59:36,432 --> 00:59:37,218
three,

610
00:59:37,887 --> 00:59:38,720
two,

611
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:39,971
one!

612
00:59:39,971 --> 00:59:42,483
Happy new year.

613
00:59:42,483 --> 00:59:44,376
I wish you all the best in the coming year.

614
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:46,148
Yeah!

615
00:59:53,049 --> 00:59:53,913
Uncle Jim,

616
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:55,846
I forgot my phone charger.

617
00:59:55,846 --> 00:59:56,900
Can I have the key?

618
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,266
Here.

619
01:00:02,923 --> 01:00:03,679
Hello.

620
01:01:05,255 --> 01:01:05,845
Uncle Jim.

621
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:07,550
Uncle Jim.

622
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:09,080
Uncle Jim.

623
01:01:09,369 --> 01:01:10,597
Can you take me to the hospital?

624
01:01:11,184 --> 01:01:12,606
Alan had an accident.

625
01:01:25,376 --> 01:01:26,537
How’s he doing?

626
01:01:27,523 --> 01:01:28,866
The cop said he’s drunk.

627
01:01:29,339 --> 01:01:30,518
They’re examining his blood.

628
01:01:31,546 --> 01:01:33,395
But I have no idea what really happened at the scene.

629
01:01:36,844 --> 01:01:38,057
How did he get drunk?

630
01:01:38,582 --> 01:01:40,169
He doesn’t usually drink.

631
01:01:41,188 --> 01:01:43,083
Right. He usually doesn’t.

632
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:01,796
Which one of you will be the caregiver?

633
01:02:01,796 --> 01:02:03,654
I’m explaining the procedures.

634
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:20,921
Uncle Jim.

635
01:02:23,879 --> 01:02:24,534
I think…

636
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:26,170
I think you should stay.

637
01:02:27,642 --> 01:02:30,523
If I were you, I would, too.

638
01:02:55,164 --> 01:02:57,164
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

639
01:03:00,274 --> 01:03:01,084
Li Ming.

640
01:03:02,406 --> 01:03:03,512
How are you, dear?

641
01:03:04,022 --> 01:03:06,106
I saw you and him kiss.

642
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:11,049
Isn't it difficult enough to be born poor? And now you're gay?

643
01:03:15,806 --> 01:03:17,302
I’ve cleaned all my mess.

644
01:03:17,953 --> 01:03:21,652
I'll take this as our first date.
