00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:30,369
The Covid-19 situation appears to be improving.

4
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,647
However, the overall picture of the economy has yet to improve.

5
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:42,000
However, the overall picture of the economy has yet to improve.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,744
Today's scoop will take you to see the atmosphere of a tourist destination like Pattaya.

7
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:52,324
It appears that the cost of living here has skyrocketed,

8
00:00:52,324 --> 00:00:56,550
in contrast to the current economic situation that is still in a recession.

9
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,884
The majority of restaurant owners have raised their prices

10
00:01:00,884 --> 00:01:04,455
because they can no longer absorb the rising ingredient costs.

11
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:06,471
What's interesting is that

12
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:10,829
some eateries insist on charging the same prices as before

13
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:14,663
because they understand people who struggle to make ends meet.

14
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,980
Like this Hainanese Chicken Rice diner

15
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,473
that is popular among night-goers,

16
00:01:23,473 --> 00:01:25,529
Moonlight Chicken.

17
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:29,157
It’s also known as Midnight Chicken Rice to many customers.

18
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:32,309
Aside from their delicious Chicken Rice,

19
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:34,857
what draws customers to this diner is that

20
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:36,802
they serve an unlimited amount of Chicken Rice after midnight.

21
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:40,727
In other words, customers can order additional servings until they are satisfied.

22
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:44,651
After midnight, as I close my diner,

23
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:48,141
I want my customers to eat as much as they want.

24
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,434
I want to fill their stomachs until they are satisfied.

25
00:01:49,434 --> 00:01:51,230
That's how we spread joy to everyone before calling it a night.

26
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:53,620
Bummer! I even bought a new shirt for this.

27
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,573
They don’t friggin’ show me.

28
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,247
Who do you think you are?

29
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:58,799
They must focus on the owner.

30
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,906
No, I should be included as well. I've been working here longer than him.

31
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:04,296
Here you go.

32
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:06,551
You big talker! Why are you bothering him?

33
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:08,401
220 baht? But I gave you a 500-baht banknote.

34
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:10,162
Are you sure you've done the math correctly?

35
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:12,142
What’s going on? Let me help you, ma’am.

36
00:02:12,142 --> 00:02:14,100
The change is 100 baht short.

37
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,676
100 baht, right?

38
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,546
Our food is just a bit over 100 baht.

39
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:19,729
Okay. Here you go.

40
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:21,424
Now we’re talking.

41
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:23,783
My apologies.

42
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:25,901
Li Ming, why didn’t you use the calculator?

43
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,775
Or you can ask Leng to help.

44
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:29,763
It's just basic math. I can do it in my head.

45
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:31,763
You've never made a mistake and charged a customer the wrong amount?

46
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,832
It’s almost 10. Go get rest.

47

Uncle Jim.

48
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,725
The interest on our money pool this time is 35 baht.

49
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:43,807
Mom said you would have to pay the interest only 3 more times.

50
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:45,291
Got it. Wait a minute.

51
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,533
Sure.

52
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,841
Uncle Jim, the internet data this month has reached. I need money to recharge it.

53
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:51,391
Hold on, Li Ming.

54
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,450
Here you go. I can use this money to pay for his tuition.

55
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,817
Here. Mom asked me to give this to you.

56
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,744
Your mom or you exactly?

57
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:00,592
Damn it, Leng!

58
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:08,372
Here, Li Ming. Your internet fee.

59
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:12,000
Jim, can I have the bill?

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,110
Of course.

61
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,824
Leng, bill Table 2.

62
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:18,067
All right, sir.

63
00:03:18,511 --> 00:03:20,920
Only 35 baht for 1 dish.

64
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,174
Thank you so much.

65
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:23,410
Please have a seat.

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,017

67
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:27,458
Gai, help me.

68
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,000
Bring that to them.

69
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:00,468
Can you clear up the rest?

70
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:02,097
You can lock the door. I’ve already brought out the key.

71
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:04,679
Bring some food home.

72
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,662
No, thanks. Praew wanted to have Somtum tonight.

73
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:08,512
Maybe her period is approaching.

74
00:04:09,018 --> 00:04:12,139
You should be relieved that she still has her period.

75
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:13,807
Yeah. So true.

76
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:15,361
It's best if she still has her period.

77

No, thanks.

I’ll call my friend.

Both.

It’s my daily reward.

You must have a good day today. You rewarded yourself with it.

I guess.

112
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,136
Actually, it’s to remind me that

113
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,606
I can only afford one can of beer per day.

What about you?

115

You are drunk like this. It must be a good day for you too.

116
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:42,392
Just a small celebration for my job.

My friend should be here in a minute.

Have you seen the news about a drunken young man being robbed for his cell phone?

121
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,567
It was right here last week.

00:09:25,223 --> 00:09:28,239
I will give you a ride to the main street.

You can tell your friend to meet you there.

Are you the cell phone culprit?

128
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,451
A cell phone is not worth it.

129
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:41,923
I can get a better price for kidneys.

130

Are you drunk?

131

Aren’t you afraid of getting stopped by the police for drunk driving?

132
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,837
Only one can. A breath alcohol test cannot detect it.

It’s the Moon Festival today.

That’s why the moon is exceptionally beautiful.

So nice.

Isn’t it a rabbit?

Not yet.

00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,182
Come here.

169
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:06,858
You are so drunk. Stay here.

170
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,282
Where am I?

171
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:09,712
My place.

172
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:10,891
Come on. Slowly.

173
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:12,321
Your place?

174
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:15,191
Yes. Wait here.

175
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,457
All right.

176
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:32,476
Walk slowly.

177
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:40,728
No. Not here.

178
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:41,464
Come on.

179
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:44,516
Take it easy.

180
00:17:57,345 --> 00:17:59,345
I’ll be right back. Wait here.

181
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:42,795
Mister.

182
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,167
Mister.

183
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,959
Mister.

184
00:19:22,718 --> 00:19:24,718
Hey.

185
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:36,661
Hey. Not this room.

186
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:38,534
Come here.

187
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:41,103
Sorry, Li Ming.

188
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,649
Tell your son I’m sorry.

189
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,279
Do I look that old?

190
00:19:57,973 --> 00:19:59,973
That’s my nephew.

191
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:03,209
I don’t have a wife yet.

192
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:08,942
I’m sure you know my preference.

193
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:25,029
You are too wasted.

194
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:27,208
Just crash here tonight.

195
00:20:39,382 --> 00:20:41,382
I’m already sober.

196
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:47,209
But I don’t want to leave just yet.

197
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,910
It won’t be complicated, right?

198
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:57,414
We don’t need to make it complicated.

199
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:02,515
What happens tonight ends tonight.

200
00:21:11,363 --> 00:21:13,363
I’m not sure about that.

201
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:27,611
You cute little thing.

202
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,272
You are so cute.

203
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:36,494
You like it, huh?

204
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:40,938
May I know the name?

205
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:43,920
Me or the cat?

206
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:47,458
The cat.

207
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:50,955
Jimbo. Call it Jimbo.

208
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:58,776
Jimbo.

209
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:04,786
You are so cute.

210
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:12,985
Can I feed it?

211
00:24:13,938 --> 00:24:15,083
Sure?

212
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,368
Can you open it for me?

213
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,847
Thank you

214
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:28,063
Jimbo, your treat.

215
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:32,242
It’s yummy, isn’t it?

216
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:38,591
You like it, huh?

217
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,827
What should I call your dad, Jimbo?

218
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,335
You are cuter. How could I not want to know your name first?

219
00:25:08,284 --> 00:25:09,308
Enough now, Jimbo.

220
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:13,857
Come here.

221
00:25:35,084 --> 00:25:40,300
Comrades, Almost a Love Story: 365 days, I love only you

222
00:25:41,402 --> 00:25:43,402
It’s 3650 days.

223
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:46,016
You cut their love 9 years short.

224
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,946
Ah. You’re right.

225
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,821
3650 days.

226
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:59,128
Wow. I can't even remember the last movie I watched on DVD.

227
00:26:00,588 --> 00:26:01,687
It’s classic.

228
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,732
But I haven't watched it in a long time. The disc is probably damaged.

229
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:07,933
I’m sure you can stream it online nowadays.

230
00:26:09,422 --> 00:26:10,390
It’s all right.

231
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:12,668
I don’t feel like watching it anymore.

232
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:17,523
Well, I’m going outside.

233
00:26:17,862 --> 00:26:20,083
Want me to drop you at the main street?

234
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:26,800
I guess I have to bother you about that.

235
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:54,388
You can wait and catch a ride over there.

236
00:26:58,348 --> 00:26:59,062
Okay.

237
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:12,033
Seriously.

238
00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:15,083
You don’t want to know me that much?

239
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:20,511
It’s not what you think.

240
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,915
I think it’s better for us this way.

241
00:27:30,084 --> 00:27:30,941
Good luck.

242
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:02,507
Mrs. Hong.

243
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:03,312
Yes?

244
00:28:03,312 --> 00:28:04,195
Hi, Gaipa.

245
00:28:04,727 --> 00:28:06,727
I owe you this for last week’s order.

246
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:07,688
Thanks.

247
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:09,748
I thought you didn’t offer credit.

248
00:28:09,748 --> 00:28:11,858
It depends on who that customer is.

249
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:15,883
He's been my customer for a very long long time.

250
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:17,895
Or simply because he’s hot.

251
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:19,829
That’s too, but only slightly.

252
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:21,483
Understandable.

253
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,203
By the way, the chicken price will be higher from next week.

254
00:28:26,653 --> 00:28:29,153
The slaughterhouse said it was due to the rising fuel prices.

255
00:28:29,364 --> 00:28:34,008
I'm sick of being slammed whenever the price gets higher.

256
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:35,667
Slam the government, not me.

257
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:38,295
I’m just a vendor, not a Minister of Commerce.

258
00:28:38,295 --> 00:28:40,460
I can’t control the price of chicken.

259
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,106
If the price increases again,

260
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:47,966
I'm going to buy some land around here and open my own gas station.

261
00:28:47,966 --> 00:28:50,083
Please hire me as your gas staff.

262
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:50,944
Are you sure?

263
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:51,584
I am.

264
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:55,006
The Sour Soup you gave me yesterday was very delicious.

265
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:55,973
U…m..um.

266
00:28:56,378 --> 00:28:57,250
Um.

267
00:28:57,631 --> 00:29:01,138
If you like it, come and eat at our place anytime.

268
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:03,033
We always have a full table of food.

269
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,579
All your staff at the diner are welcome too.

270
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:05,521
I don’t want to trouble you.

271
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:06,650
Don’t worry about it.

272
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,880
You are famous now Uncle Jim.

273
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,845
I saw you on the news.

274
00:29:11,845 --> 00:29:14,261
Customers must be flocking to your diner.

275
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:17,727
Yes. That's why I have to order a few more chickens from Mrs. Hong.

276
00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:19,960
Good for you.

277
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,801
Do you really want to order more chicken?

278
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:27,769
If your diner is short-staffed, Gaipa can help you out.

279
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,779
Even though he has enough staff, I'm happy to help him.

280
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:30,564
See?

281
00:29:30,564 --> 00:29:31,423
Come on, Mrs. Hong.

282
00:29:31,423 --> 00:29:33,063
I have no budget to pay him.

283
00:29:33,274 --> 00:29:36,322
My son? Just one dish of food, that’s all it takes for him to be there.

284
00:29:36,322 --> 00:29:37,775
He can bring food himself, even.

285
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:38,815
Mom!

286
00:29:38,815 --> 00:29:39,681
Isn’t it true?

287
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:40,482
It is.

288
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:41,422
Uncle Jim, hold on.

289
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,632
Hold on a sec.

290
00:29:43,632 --> 00:29:46,423
Here. Take these mooncakes.

291
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:49,047
Here's to many customers for you.

292
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:51,953
Mom bought way too many of these for the Moon Festival last night.

293
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:54,520
It's just me and her. We can’t finish them all.

294
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,055
Here.

295
00:29:59,438 --> 00:30:00,719
You may share it with Leng.

296
00:30:03,077 --> 00:30:04,082
Thank you so much, Gaipa.

297
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,824
Share some with Leng too.

298
00:30:06,824 --> 00:30:09,155
- Sure. See you.
- See you.

299
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:10,774
- 1 kg of chicken thighs, please.
- Good day, Mrs. Hong.

300
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:11,501
Bye.

301
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:13,352
- Chicken thighs, right?
- Yes.

302
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:15,049
Mom, give me a bag.

303
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:18,203
What are you looking at? The bag is right here.

304
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:21,273
This dreamy boy.

305
00:30:37,196 --> 00:30:38,410
Can I sit here?

306
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:12,483
Here.

307
00:31:17,104 --> 00:31:18,617
I know old people like to eat ginger.

308
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:21,088
It’s okay.

309
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,843
I’m already old.

310
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:34,081
What about you? You seem to like eating ginger like old people.

311
00:31:35,528 --> 00:31:36,449
No.

312
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:41,315
I like old people.

313
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:56,795
I’m leaving first.

314
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:03,028
Ma’am.

315
00:32:07,204 --> 00:32:08,894
Thank you. Please come again.

316
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:19,649
This meal is on me.

317
00:32:20,343 --> 00:32:23,772
For your service last night, Uncle Chicken Rice.

318
00:33:28,534 --> 00:33:31,082
[Pick up the package at the building office for me.]

319
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:02,909
Beer is getting more and more expensive.

320
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:05,041
At this rate, I may have to start brewing my own liquor.

321
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:20,733
Do you want me to put dates on these cans now?

322
00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:23,921
Uncle Jim.

323
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,507
Uncle Jim!

324
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,892
What?

325
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,466
You’re dreamy like a teen waiting for a text back from his lover.

326
00:35:30,466 --> 00:35:31,882
Do you want me to put a date on the beer?

327
00:35:32,891 --> 00:35:33,665
Leave that to me.

328
00:35:34,888 --> 00:35:37,938
You need to deliver this to Senior Sergeant Major Supoch’s house.

329
00:35:40,776 --> 00:35:42,287
Can you ask Li Ming to do it?

330
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:44,751
I still owe his wife’s lotto money. I haven’t paid for it yet.

331
00:35:45,778 --> 00:35:47,211
Don't pull any tricks on this family.

332
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,846
You have no idea what they're capable of.

333
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:50,413
- I know.
- You could be in trouble.

334
00:35:51,227 --> 00:35:53,020
Give it to me. I’ll do it.

335
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:56,477
How could you do it? It’s dangerous.

336
00:35:56,477 --> 00:35:57,468
You don't even have a driver's license yet.

337
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:01,473
My friend doesn’t have a driver’s license

338
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,690
and he rides his bike to school every day.

339
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:09,388
I've never seen a police checkpoint on this road.

340
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,694
Bye, my beloved bro. Drive safely.

341
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:19,680
See you.

342
00:36:37,812 --> 00:36:39,256
Here’s your Chicken Rice.

343
00:36:54,307 --> 00:36:55,773
Here’s your Chicken Rice.

344
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:05,032
Here’s your Chicken Rice.

345
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:17,792
Here’s your chic… Oh shit!

346
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:29,373
What the hell was that?

347
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:36,496
I don’t understand.

348
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:37,955
I can’t read sign language.

349
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:44,965
No, it wasn’t me.

350
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:47,688
What was that? I don’t get it. I can’t read it.

351
00:37:52,334 --> 00:37:53,644
I just put it here.

352
00:38:06,602 --> 00:38:08,036
Hey, Leng.

353
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,983
Need my help?

354
00:38:14,982 --> 00:38:15,839
Why are you here?

355
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:19,006
Can I have the diner’s spare key? I didn’t bring it with me last night.

356
00:38:23,321 --> 00:38:24,031
Thank you.

357
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:24,987
Where’s Uncle Jim?

358
00:38:30,496 --> 00:38:32,207
Come home as soon as school is over.Come home as soon as school is over.

359
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,073
I don’t want to hear your uncle nag.

360
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:36,930
Let him.

361
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:39,310
He stops when he’s done with it.

362
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:41,920
Like uncle, like nephew.

363
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:47,636
Hey, Leng.

364
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:52,112
Officer Supoch's son is deaf?

365
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:56,469
Ah…you mean Heart?

366
00:38:57,229 --> 00:38:59,007
He only became deaf a few years ago.

367
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,266
It was caused by a disease. I'm not sure what it is.

368
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,503
I see. How does he study then?

369
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:06,993
I don’t think he goes to school now.

370
00:39:07,527 --> 00:39:09,019
I haven’t seen him for quite a while.

371
00:39:09,561 --> 00:39:11,561
His parents don’t want him to go anywhere.

372
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:12,647
They probably don’t like the way people look at him.

373
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:18,223
Do you know him?

374
00:39:20,515 --> 00:39:22,232
I see him when I bring his mother lotto orders.

375
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,183
He looks kind of annoying, right?

376
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:28,309
What happened? Did you have a fight with him?

377
00:39:31,348 --> 00:39:32,127
No.

378
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:36,685
Did you?

379
00:39:37,471 --> 00:39:38,594
No. Nothing happened.

380
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:43,209
Okay. Later then.

381
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,415
Customers can order additional servings until they are satisfied.

382
00:39:59,987 --> 00:40:05,613
And now I’m with Mr. Jim, the owner of Moonlight Chicken.

383
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:07,876
Good evening, Mr. Jim.

384
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:11,613
Can you tell me what draws people here?

385
00:40:11,613 --> 00:40:14,948
After midnight, as I close my diner…

386
00:40:14,948 --> 00:40:18,551
Hey, Wen. Where were you last night?

387
00:40:24,786 --> 00:40:26,386
I didn't want to butt in your business.

388
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:29,708
But Alan messaged me asking for you.

389
00:40:30,368 --> 00:40:32,902
He doesn’t know that I have read the message. What should I say to him?

390
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:34,027
Hm?

391
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:41,844
You don’t need to answer what you don’t know.

392
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:45,402
You have so many secrets, you sly kid.

393
00:40:46,828 --> 00:40:47,457
Hey, Gong.

394
00:40:47,457 --> 00:40:48,004
Yes?

395
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,607
Have you ever had a one-night stand?

396
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,073
I knew it.

397
00:40:52,251 --> 00:40:54,352
I know now what happened to you last night.

398
00:40:55,445 --> 00:40:57,223
Yes, I have had it.

399
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:03,007
So? Who initiated it? You or your one-night stand?

400
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:05,511
We both took turns.

401
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:07,189
Really? That’s my slutty boy.

402
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,029
A one-night stand is not a problem.

403
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,229
What could be a problem is when it doesn’t end after one night.

404
00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:16,301
Be careful about it.

405
00:41:17,205 --> 00:41:18,591
Don't make it complicated.

406
00:41:18,591 --> 00:41:20,918
Avoid making affectionate eye contact during the action.

407
00:41:22,682 --> 00:41:25,972
You can go all out physically.

408
00:41:25,972 --> 00:41:28,247
Any position, any location, your choice.

409
00:41:28,895 --> 00:41:30,215
Just don’t show your inside feeling too much.

410
00:41:30,895 --> 00:41:31,931
I don’t think I can control that.

411
00:41:33,695 --> 00:41:34,647
Then don’t make eye contact.

412
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:42,147
Don’t let your partner know what you are thinking or feeling.

413
00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:43,680
And don’t say anything tacky.

414
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:48,052
“Oh, it’s really good. It feels so good.”

415
00:41:48,052 --> 00:41:49,423
Damn it, Gong!

416
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:54,885
Hey.

417
00:41:55,953 --> 00:41:57,166
Then what do you think?

418
00:41:58,336 --> 00:42:01,248
As you are doing it, don’t you think that your partner may find it weird?

419
00:42:02,298 --> 00:42:04,743
Put on some act. No need to show that you are into it.

420
00:42:05,237 --> 00:42:08,038
Just nail and bail. Then part ways.

421
00:42:08,038 --> 00:42:09,498
It's a win-win situation.

422
00:42:10,936 --> 00:42:11,882
Let me tell you this.

423
00:42:12,638 --> 00:42:14,493
This kind of sex is not love.

424
00:42:15,234 --> 00:42:16,454
It's pure sex.

425
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:22,485
If you give too much feeling or if one of you likes it and develops a bond,

426
00:42:23,147 --> 00:42:24,480
that will be complicated.

427
00:42:35,665 --> 00:42:36,455
Gong.

428
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:38,911
Let’s go eat Chicken Rice.

429
00:42:40,268 --> 00:42:41,486
What’s with you?

430
00:42:41,486 --> 00:42:43,202
We just talked about sex.

431
00:42:43,202 --> 00:42:45,048
How could you invite me out to eat?

432
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:46,567
No, I don’t want to eat it.

433
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:48,426
Didn’t you just have it yesterday?

434
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,024
You look sus. There must be something.

435
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,770
[Mr. Wongsakorn Thunapakarn]

436
00:45:46,749 --> 00:45:48,749
[Mrs. Jintana]

437
00:46:02,618 --> 00:46:05,962
When he brought Chicken Rice here yesterday,

438
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:07,521
He played with a bottle of liquor.

439
00:46:07,521 --> 00:46:10,205
He was startled when my son appeared and dropped it on the floor.

440
00:46:10,205 --> 00:46:12,246
Then he ran back home.

441
00:46:12,246 --> 00:46:14,451
I didn’t do that, Uncle Jim.

442
00:46:14,451 --> 00:46:15,721
We weren’t home.

443
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:17,455
The liquor couldn’t drop itself.

444
00:46:17,455 --> 00:46:19,454
It wasn’t me.

445
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:24,282
It was him.

446
00:46:24,943 --> 00:46:26,992
Hey. How could you put the blame on my son?

447
00:46:28,802 --> 00:46:30,802
I said I didn’t do it.

448
00:46:30,802 --> 00:46:33,847
Your son was startled when he saw me and dropped the bottle.

449
00:46:36,368 --> 00:46:39,856
That bottle was always there. Why would he want to grab it?

450
00:46:40,479 --> 00:46:42,419
And on the day that you came?

451
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:44,580
Why don’t you hear it from him?

452
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:52,173
He’s already told us everything.

453
00:46:56,352 --> 00:46:58,352
You dropped it.

454
00:46:59,727 --> 00:47:02,015
Tell them you tried to drink that liquor when they weren’t around.

455
00:47:02,423 --> 00:47:04,908
- He said here he didn’t do it.
- It wasn’t me.

456
00:47:04,908 --> 00:47:06,292
He told me he didn’t.

457
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:07,941
You friggin’ did it.

458
00:47:08,413 --> 00:47:09,647
Stop.

459
00:47:11,143 --> 00:47:13,143
You use your deafness to get you off the hook, right?

460
00:47:13,143 --> 00:47:14,537
Don’t talk to my son like that.

461
00:47:14,537 --> 00:47:16,146
But I didn’t do it.

462
00:47:16,146 --> 00:47:17,420
Li Ming, stop!

463
00:47:18,604 --> 00:47:22,145
Please excuse us for a moment.

464
00:47:22,145 --> 00:47:23,460
Get up.

465
00:47:33,394 --> 00:47:35,394
Tell me everything.

466
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,715
I already told everything.

467
00:47:37,715 --> 00:47:39,848
He was sneakily drinking his father's liquor.

468
00:47:39,848 --> 00:47:43,359
When he saw me, he was startled and dropped the bottle.

469
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:46,962
So I placed the food on the counter and left.

470
00:47:47,202 --> 00:47:48,859
That's all there is to it.

471
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,667
You should have told me about it first.

472
00:47:53,677 --> 00:47:55,398
What would I do that for?

473
00:47:55,398 --> 00:47:57,922
I did nothing wrong.

474
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:09,156
What's the point of asking me if you're not going to believe me?

475
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:21,482
Okay. You didn’t do it.

476
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:24,046
But we have nothing to prove your innocence.

477
00:48:24,046 --> 00:48:26,522
If we keep arguing with them like that, it will never end.

478
00:48:26,858 --> 00:48:29,025
What evidence do you want?

479
00:48:29,025 --> 00:48:31,989
I said I did nothing wrong.

480
00:48:38,269 --> 00:48:41,061
I know. But if Officer Supoch refuses to drop the matter,

481
00:48:41,061 --> 00:48:42,632
you cannot win against him.

482
00:48:48,473 --> 00:48:50,473
Can you think of this incident as bad luck?

483
00:48:51,217 --> 00:48:53,253
What bad luck?

484
00:48:53,253 --> 00:48:55,075
I don’t get it.

485
00:48:55,323 --> 00:48:57,619
I did nothing wrong.

486
00:48:59,432 --> 00:49:01,057
Because we are poor?

487
00:49:01,729 --> 00:49:03,913
They can do anything at all to us?

488
00:49:07,722 --> 00:49:09,554
I don’t want to settle it at the police station.

489
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:12,262
What exactly do you fear?

490
00:49:12,262 --> 00:49:14,400
Because he’s a police officer?

491
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,850
So he has the power to do anything to us.

492
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:38,851
To be honest, I don’t want to put you in this position.

493
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,081
But this was one of his old liquor collections.

494
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:43,943
It is worth over 10,000 baht.

495
00:49:45,959 --> 00:49:47,959
We don’t want you to think that we are mean.

496
00:49:49,727 --> 00:49:50,863
What do you think?

497
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,576
Since we cannot find evidence.

498
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:55,422
Say we split the responsibility 50/50.

499
00:49:55,422 --> 00:49:57,326
7000 baht, are you able to pay that?

500
00:50:05,382 --> 00:50:07,382
I will get money from Mrs. Hong’s money pool at the end of this month.

501
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:09,570
I’ll pay you then.

502
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,395
You don’t need to do that.

503
00:50:12,067 --> 00:50:14,067
I’ll pay you myself.

504
00:50:15,508 --> 00:50:18,659
I let you pay us in installments.

505
00:50:19,911 --> 00:50:21,911
Can I work for you instead?

506
00:50:42,683 --> 00:50:44,683
[We’re hiring daily waitstaff.]

507
00:51:07,033 --> 00:51:09,033
We have no Chicken Rice left.

508
00:51:13,623 --> 00:51:15,623
This has an owner.

509
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,796
I’m not here to eat.

510
00:51:18,244 --> 00:51:22,083
I want a can of beer. Can I have that?

511
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:51,319
Where’s everyone?

512
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,168
They have gone home.

513
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:58,827
You are the most chill Chicken Rice seller I know.

514
00:52:00,796 --> 00:52:02,796
You only saw me when I’m chilling.

515
00:52:04,149 --> 00:52:07,721
I'm a different man when my diner is packed with customers.

516
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,407
What kind of person is that man?

517
00:52:13,534 --> 00:52:15,534
Just an ordinary seller

518
00:52:15,534 --> 00:52:18,751
with an oily face and a body that smells like boiled chicken.

519
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:21,829
And I look so damn tired.

520
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:23,761
You must see it yourself for once.

521
00:52:27,953 --> 00:52:29,953
I take that as your permission.

522
00:52:32,168 --> 00:52:35,872
Well. Aren’t you curious about me at all?

523
00:52:40,222 --> 00:52:42,222
Why are you here?

524
00:52:43,778 --> 00:52:45,778
If you're only here for a beer,

525
00:52:45,778 --> 00:52:48,048
I don't think you need to come all the way to my diner.

526
00:52:52,866 --> 00:52:54,866
I just want…

527
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,980
to have a friend to drink beer with.

528
00:53:04,031 --> 00:53:06,031
I don't believe you have no friends.

529
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,710
I do have some.

530
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:13,953
But it's more about who I'd like to drink with.

531
00:53:46,722 --> 00:53:48,098
This is yours.

532
00:53:48,098 --> 00:53:49,788
You dropped it the other night.

533
00:54:01,663 --> 00:54:03,663
What if…

534
00:54:04,892 --> 00:54:06,892
I want to leave it here again?

535
00:54:12,463 --> 00:54:15,831
Didn’t I make it clear that what happened that night ended that night?

536
00:54:19,976 --> 00:54:21,976
Okay.

537
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:33,417
What if I want to apply to be your waitstaff?

538
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,070
I am available for an interview at your convenience.

539
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,607
You may interview me as many times as you like.

540
00:54:47,077 --> 00:54:48,429
What’s your name?

541
00:54:48,429 --> 00:54:49,579
Wen.

542
00:54:50,897 --> 00:54:52,976
I thought you wouldn’t ask that.

543
00:54:52,976 --> 00:54:54,471
Okay, Wen.

544
00:54:56,133 --> 00:54:59,261
From now on, we are no strangers.

545
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,214
So?

546
00:55:09,727 --> 00:55:14,534
Here is the rule for working with me.

547
00:55:15,326 --> 00:55:19,635
We must not do anything that strangers do.

548
00:55:22,407 --> 00:55:24,407
Like what?

549
00:55:25,961 --> 00:55:29,041
Like…what we did the other night.

550
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:40,029
What should I call you, Boss?

551
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:43,380
Jim.

552
00:55:44,536 --> 00:55:46,536
But people call me Uncle Jim.

Thanks.

No, I’m good.
