He’ll step in when you’re not here.

6
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:24,677
Hello.

7
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:25,760
Hi.

8
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:28,258
You and I…

9
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,101
mop the floor together.

10
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:34,240
You can ride with me to the main street.

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,695
If I get in your car,

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,599
I’m afraid I might never reach home.

13
00:00:40,484 --> 00:00:41,685
Whose handwriting is this?

14
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:44,120
Don’t think I’ve seen it. Is it Li Ming’s?

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,808
No. It’s Wen’s.

16
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:47,169
Wen?

17
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:48,651
Who?

18
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:50,172
There’s a free tutoring session at Tha Kru School.

19
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:52,183
I told him to get the application for you too.

20
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:55,615
Why didn’t you ask if I wanted to join or not?

21
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:58,596
Praew is pregnant.

22
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:01,400
Leng must take responsibility.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,153
You should give me time to make the money.

24
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:04,659
But my growing tummy can’t wait, Leng.

25
00:01:05,303 --> 00:01:07,303
Don’t waste your time on me.

26
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:08,447
Someone like me

27
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:10,283
doesn’t fit to be anyone’s home.

28
00:01:13,557 --> 00:01:17,648
The Marina Food Court Project's Phase 1 has been delayed far too long.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,468
It gets delayed because of Covid.

30
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:21,366
Yes.

31
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,440
I know.

32
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,995
If we wait until Covid is gone, we will not see it open next year either.

33
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,056
So the board gave us a solution.

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,000
They want us to form a new team and move forward with Phase 3.

35
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,439
Be prepared for it.

36
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:40,559
How is it going, Wen?

37
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:44,421
I'd appreciate it if you could expedite the presentation deck.

38
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:46,280
I've already rescheduled a client meeting twice.

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,560
I bragged a lot about you.

40
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:54,457
Come on. I haven’t finished the layout for the Loy Krathong Festival yet.

41
00:01:54,704 --> 00:01:57,547
I’m getting you an assistant.

42

Hey,

Nop. Can you go back a few slides?

A bit further back.

Aof, what is this about?

50
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:26,188
This is the area around Phase 3 where demolition is being negotiated.

51
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:28,928
Demolition?

52
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:29,745
Yes.

53
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,572

[“One Float Per Family” campaign, Chonburi Town Municipality]

57
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:08,171
We’re so grateful to you for speaking with them for us.

58
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:11,580
Some sellers and householders had to be persuaded several times.

59
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,760
It's normal.

60
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,340
These businesses were started by their parents.

61
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,039
They probably don't want people to think they're selling off their family's assets.

62
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,857
By the way, ma’am. I have been wanting to ask you about this.

63
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:24,367
Those buildings on the Chinese Opera house’s side,

64
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,149
around the Moonlight Chicken diner,

65
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,545
who should I speak with?

66
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:28,725
Song.

67
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:32,045
Only Song. Do you want his number?

68
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:32,938
Yes, please.

69
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:38,480
Gaipa, give me my phone.

70
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:39,513
All right.

71
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:48,200
Song rents out the properties in that area.

72
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,430
He’s easy to talk with. Trust me.

73
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,000
It should not be that difficult.

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,746
If things become difficult, let money talk.

75
00:05:57,746 --> 00:05:59,916
The deal will be over quickly. Trust me.

76
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:04,775
But I can’t help feeling sad about it.

77
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:08,745
Those entrepreneurs seem to enjoy demolishing things.

78
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:13,023
The buildings in that area are historic and old.

79
00:06:13,023 --> 00:06:19,454
If I were the landlord, I would keep them all and turn the area into a historic market.

80
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:24,486
I would redevelop the area to make it a tourist attraction, as many people do nowadays.

81
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:26,944
It'll be a place where people can check in for their visits.

82
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:27,867
But look at what they're doing.

83
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,383
They only think of demolishing everything and starting over.

84
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:32,489
They should have thought things through rather than simply tearing things down.

85
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:34,139
What a shame.

86
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:46,405

Ah, you can’t hear me.

96

97
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:45,020
What?

98
00:07:48,597 --> 00:07:49,848
This means ‘thank you’.

99
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:52,040

336
00:31:12,918 --> 00:31:15,844
Come on. Let my mother talk to him for you.

337
00:31:19,414 --> 00:31:20,206
Okay.

338
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,684
In exchange, you must join me in the Loy Krathong festival.

339
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:30,212
How does it sound?

340
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,117
Let me think about it.

341
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:36,280
Whatever.

342
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:41,488
If you don’t have a plan that day, you must come with me.

343
00:31:47,746 --> 00:31:49,217
Thank you so much, Gaipa.

344
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,466
Don’t mention it.

345
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,988
Lertpong's academic record is somewhat concerning.

346
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:16,072
I think he should pay more attention to his studies than other students.

347
00:32:17,153 --> 00:32:19,470
And I should inform you because you are his guardian.

348
00:32:23,913 --> 00:32:28,346
Have you ever asked him which faculty he wants to attend?

349
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:31,921
I let him choose himself.

350
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:37,291
Despite that, you should also consider if it’s feasible for him.

351
00:32:37,672 --> 00:32:39,831
You must take into account his capability.

352
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:43,208
Some faculties require a high academic record.

353
00:32:52,986 --> 00:32:55,330
What if he takes extra classes? Will it help?

354
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,749
For that, I can’t answer.

355
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:01,869
It depends on each student.

356
00:33:01,987 --> 00:33:04,701
Some students need extra classes.

357
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:06,711
It is also up to their parents whether they can afford the fee.

358
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:13,588
Here is the list of all universities and faculties.

359
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,981
If you have any further questions,

360
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:19,734
please leave them in the chat group for students' parents or teachers.

361
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,132
All right. Thank you so much.

362
00:33:23,476 --> 00:33:24,679
My pleasure.

363
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:29,088
You may put them in this envelope.

364
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:41,660
Hey, Li Ming. Isn’t that your uncle?

365
00:33:45,245 --> 00:33:46,402
It’s really him.

366
00:33:47,698 --> 00:33:48,700
You are screwed.

367
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:52,775
Damn.

368
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,169
What was your uncle here for?

369
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:58,130
Mrs. Samorn probably wanted to talk to him.

370
00:33:58,808 --> 00:34:00,279
Must be about your school record.

371
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,899
Many parents of grade 10 students were also called over.

372
00:34:03,463 --> 00:34:05,251
Hey, you are in grade 12 now.

373
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,990
Do you still need your uncle to make school decisions for you?

374
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:10,812
Did your parents get called over?

375
00:34:10,944 --> 00:34:11,821
No.

376
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:16,530
Those boys at the football field told me their parents got called.

377
00:35:02,954 --> 00:35:03,790
Li Ming.

378
00:35:05,615 --> 00:35:07,837
Why haven't you gotten a cram school application form yet?

379
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,778
I never told you I would apply for it.

380
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:15,101
Can’t you give it a try?

381
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:16,880
Your GPA could be improved.

382
00:35:23,281 --> 00:35:25,281
Was this why you came to my school today?

383
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,668
Your teacher wanted to talk to me about you.

384
00:35:32,787 --> 00:35:35,633
Tell me which faculty or university you want to go to.

385
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:46,211
I want to go for Work and Travel for a few years.

386
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,289
What?

387
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:50,888
I want to spend a few years in the US.

388
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:54,008
You? Studying in the US?

389
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:56,810
What will you go there for with such a low GPA? How?

390
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,768
What will you do there?

391
00:35:57,768 --> 00:36:01,440
I'll serve and earn money while also taking an English course.

392
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,481
Just that?

393
00:36:02,481 --> 00:36:03,440
Yes.

394
00:36:04,072 --> 00:36:05,152
Then what?

395
00:36:05,734 --> 00:36:07,395
I don’t know. I haven’t planned it out.

396
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,048
I’ll think about it later.

397
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Do you believe you can land on your feet over there?

398
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,842
What can you do there? Do you even have money to get your ass there?

399
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:16,666
Do you expect me to get stuck here for the rest of my life?

400
00:36:20,653 --> 00:36:22,653
I’ll figure out how to get my money.

401
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:28,868
What a surprise. You don't even bother telling me about it.

402
00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:30,725
I’m telling you right here, ain’t I?

403
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,536
Where are you going, Li Ming?

404
00:36:40,296 --> 00:36:41,423
Li Ming!

405
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:04,629
There are too many colors. Look.

406
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:06,506
I think it looks okay now.

407
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:07,725
Which part do you want to change?

408
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:09,852
The colors and also the banner.

409
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,160
I think it should be in a rounded shape, not this.

410
00:37:12,728 --> 00:37:14,728
Okay. I’ll change them.

411
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:17,709
Anything else?

412
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:19,531
No. That’s all.

413
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:20,499
I’m taking off then.

414
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:21,325
See you.

415
00:37:25,228 --> 00:37:26,092
Hey, Li Ming.

416
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:29,635
What are you doing here? Watching a movie?

417
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:30,999
No.

418
00:37:31,528 --> 00:37:33,162
I’m looking for a new phone case.

419
00:37:33,505 --> 00:37:35,505
Can I see your phone model?

420
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,029
I have a lot of these unused phone cases. I'll bring you some.

421
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:42,777
No need to buy a new one.

422
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,121
[Uncle Jim]

423
00:37:53,253 --> 00:37:54,367
Do you two have a fight?

424
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,088
About Work and Travel, right?

425
00:38:02,803 --> 00:38:05,363
What did he say?

426
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,628
He’s not okay with the idea?

427
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,107
I don’t know how to work this out with him.

428
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:16,349
He still makes me go to cram school.

429
00:38:22,784 --> 00:38:23,896
You can let it all out.

430
00:38:31,486 --> 00:38:35,865
To be honest, college isn't always the best option for everyone.

431
00:38:37,805 --> 00:38:41,048
I just want to work and earn money.

432
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:44,565
I'm willing to try what I'm capable of and get paid for it.

433
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:46,630
I'm not interested in studying.

434
00:38:51,523 --> 00:38:52,886
What do you want to be?

435
00:38:55,585 --> 00:38:57,162
I don’t know yet.

436
00:39:04,102 --> 00:39:07,557
Listen. It’s not wrong to not know what you like to do.

437
00:39:08,697 --> 00:39:13,342
I wasted a whole year to find out that I didn’t like Mass Comm.

438
00:39:14,423 --> 00:39:16,317
So I transferred to study Fine Arts instead.

439
00:39:25,545 --> 00:39:31,208
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a zookeeper.

440
00:39:34,794 --> 00:39:37,323
Later on, I wanted to be a football player.

441
00:39:39,429 --> 00:39:40,704
But now…

442
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:46,983
Now I want to be a bartender.

443
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:49,325
Bartender?

444
00:39:49,775 --> 00:39:51,153
Want to get wasted on free booze?

445
00:39:55,337 --> 00:40:00,325
Shouldn't we try a variety of things to see what we like and dislike?

446
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:02,842
Then we know which field of study we should take.

447
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:04,879
What holds you from trying?

448
00:40:06,096 --> 00:40:10,441
How? My school doesn’t offer a damn thing for me to try.

449
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,915
Students are not permitted to use cell phones in school.

450
00:40:13,529 --> 00:40:17,751
Recently, my school counselor even asked me to demonstrate how to use a cloud drive.

451
00:40:21,224 --> 00:40:22,695
What kind of advice can I rely on?

452
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:27,178
Have you said all this to Uncle Jim?

453
00:40:28,497 --> 00:40:29,127
No.

454
00:40:30,106 --> 00:40:33,169
He's so annoying. Our talks always end in a fight.

455
00:40:35,677 --> 00:40:38,788
Because you are just as unbending as he is.

456
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:49,088
I do understand his concern for me.

457
00:40:50,118 --> 00:40:52,197
But I want to try living my own life.

458
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,288
Are you hungry?

459
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:02,049
Let's get something to eat.

460
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,552
No, thanks. I have to go to work now.

461
00:41:04,852 --> 00:41:05,554
I see.

462
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:07,830
All right.

463
00:41:11,456 --> 00:41:12,788
See you then.

464
00:41:13,105 --> 00:41:14,249
Goodbye.

465
00:41:16,313 --> 00:41:18,551
[Papa Chawin]

466
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:21,583
Hi, Pa. What’s up?

467
00:41:22,848 --> 00:41:23,745
Here.

468
00:41:23,957 --> 00:41:25,060
Thank you so much.

469
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,103
It’s so quiet today.

470
00:41:33,802 --> 00:41:35,072
How about we close early?

471
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:40,377
Leng, put your head down.

472
00:41:40,377 --> 00:41:42,648
Easy there. It hurts.

473
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:53,683
Don’t put coins in there.

474
00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:55,568
It will not make it to the middle of the way.

475
00:41:55,697 --> 00:41:57,697
Kids are waiting to steal the coins.

476
00:41:58,131 --> 00:41:59,893
Just our hair.

477
00:42:01,874 --> 00:42:03,768
Why are you making so many flower baskets?

478
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:07,355
One is for Uncle Jim. Another one is for Li Ming.

479
00:42:11,514 --> 00:42:12,297
What?

480
00:42:12,973 --> 00:42:15,952
(They are in dispute at the moment. Why did you say that?)

481
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:17,548
(How would I know?)

482
00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:19,556
(Didn’t I tell you that?)

483
00:42:19,556 --> 00:42:20,423
(You didn’t.)

484
00:42:23,729 --> 00:42:24,786
Look at this brat.

485
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:26,760
How could I keep my mouth shut?

486
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:28,331
He doesn’t answer my phone.

487
00:42:29,249 --> 00:42:30,881
His battery may have died.

488
00:42:31,191 --> 00:42:33,928
I saw him with Wen at Marina.

489
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:35,688
You may call Wen and ask about him.

490
00:44:53,951 --> 00:44:55,951
[At Uncle Thiam’s party. We’ll be home late.]

491
00:45:12,848 --> 00:45:13,782
Look.

492
00:45:14,592 --> 00:45:17,084
Your parents will be back late at night.

493
00:45:26,384 --> 00:45:27,992
Ah.

494
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:31,333
That’s why, that night, you sneakily drank their alcohol?

495
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:32,464
Right?

496
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,480
What a cunning son you are.

497
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,611
What? Where are you taking me to?

498
00:45:51,804 --> 00:45:53,804
What is it? Huh?

499
00:46:04,615 --> 00:46:05,599
No.

500
00:46:08,408 --> 00:46:09,586
No, I don’t want it.

501
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:26,664
Pa.

502
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,687
What brings you to Pattaya?

503
00:46:28,898 --> 00:46:30,111
A change of scenery?

504
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:33,491
Hey. I also have friends in this city.

505
00:46:34,442 --> 00:46:38,128
Your mother told me that you got promoted.

506
00:46:39,244 --> 00:46:42,054
So I came here to get some free wine to celebrate.

507
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:49,786
Is your date still the same person?

508
00:46:51,052 --> 00:46:54,284
The one with a Chinese look.

509
00:46:55,177 --> 00:46:56,950
The same as in when?

510
00:46:58,217 --> 00:47:02,356
How would I know? You tell me.

511
00:47:06,804 --> 00:47:09,208
Hard to say. It’s complicated.

512
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:10,572
Complicated what?

513
00:47:10,901 --> 00:47:12,901
It can’t be that complicated.

514
00:47:13,236 --> 00:47:15,949
Love is not complicated.

515
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:20,344
It becomes complicated when you are out of love.

516
00:47:27,062 --> 00:47:28,316
I'm not sure either.

517
00:47:30,261 --> 00:47:31,928
Look at me as an example.

518
00:47:31,928 --> 00:47:34,149
When your mother was still with your father,

519
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,319
I stayed completely out of her life.

520
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:40,428
I told her to sort things out on her end.

521
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:44,832
We should see each other again when we are both unattached.

522
00:47:45,005 --> 00:47:46,648
That's what we call a win-win situation for both of us.

523
00:47:47,783 --> 00:47:48,733
Right?

524
00:47:50,502 --> 00:47:52,178
Come on. Eat up.

525
00:48:04,076 --> 00:48:05,045
Hello.

526
00:48:10,102 --> 00:48:11,133
Yes.

527
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:16,752
He has left.

528
00:48:18,192 --> 00:48:19,544
I think his phone battery ran out.

529
00:48:24,788 --> 00:48:26,140
Not really.

530
00:48:27,255 --> 00:48:28,931
Hold the line for a sec.

531
00:48:30,514 --> 00:48:33,728
Pa, can my friend join us?

532
00:48:34,115 --> 00:48:35,726
Of course. Not a problem.

533
00:48:38,066 --> 00:48:39,147
You can come.

534
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:43,632
I have something to say to you as well.

535
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,159
I’ll send you the location.

536
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:58,272
So? Are you introducing me to your new boyfriend?

537
00:48:59,954 --> 00:49:02,343
Not that. We’re just friends.

538
00:49:02,343 --> 00:49:03,451
Just friends?

539
00:49:05,368 --> 00:49:06,334
Really?

540
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,266
Maybe we have become more. I’m not sure.

541
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:14,798
That’s my boy.

542
00:49:32,377 --> 00:49:33,469
Look at you.

543
00:50:18,555 --> 00:50:20,134
Put it further down.

544
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,634
Do you want to go Loy Krathong together?

545
00:51:18,751 --> 00:51:19,778
Today…

546
00:51:21,651 --> 00:51:24,040
Yeah, it’s Loy Krathong day today.

547
00:51:26,731 --> 00:51:27,776
Wanna go do it?

548
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,234
Huh?

549
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:03,552
Sit down.

550
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:08,143
Uncle Jim, this is my father.

551
00:52:09,018 --> 00:52:11,731
Pa, this is Uncle Jim.

552
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:14,958
Good evening.

553
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:18,214
Hold on. You call him Uncle.

554
00:52:18,214 --> 00:52:19,194
And I’m your dad.

555
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,648
How should I address him here?

556
00:52:21,648 --> 00:52:23,030
I’m confused.

557
00:52:23,568 --> 00:52:25,568
My name is just Jim.

558
00:52:25,568 --> 00:52:27,065
Just Jim? Okay.

559
00:52:30,616 --> 00:52:33,524
Make yourself comfortable.

560
00:52:34,028 --> 00:52:36,028
Excuse me, lady. Thanks.

561
00:52:41,402 --> 00:52:42,592
Eat up.

562
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,183
Let me try this one.

563
00:52:51,927 --> 00:52:55,126
When it comes to Stir-fried Minced Pork with Chinese Olive,

564
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:58,368
no one beats your mother's cooking.

565
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:02,754
She's a fantastic cook. She can make any dish delicious.

566
00:53:02,754 --> 00:53:04,415
Sadly, I don't get that talent from her.

567
00:53:04,985 --> 00:53:06,726
You surely get something from her.

568
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,725
Her silver tongue.

569
00:53:11,568 --> 00:53:12,683
Am I right?

570
00:53:12,683 --> 00:53:14,442
I think I get that from you.

571
00:53:16,231 --> 00:53:17,842
But I’m a nagger like her.

572
00:53:19,508 --> 00:53:21,022
If you say so.

573
00:53:23,585 --> 00:53:25,585
You seem to be close to your papa.

574
00:53:28,341 --> 00:53:30,049
It was a little awkward at first.

575
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:35,772
But when I saw how happy he could make my mother, I opened up to him.

576
00:53:37,266 --> 00:53:40,919
And I believe he knows about me a lot more than my mother does.

577
00:53:43,196 --> 00:53:45,196
I must be really terrible at raising my nephew.

578
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:48,255
He never tells me anything.

579
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,667
You want him to talk to you. Have you ever really listened to him?

580
00:53:52,091 --> 00:53:54,568
Li Ming is difficult to deal with. He always talks back.

581
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:55,680
Such as?

582
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,221
He talks back with whatever he is thinking.

583
00:53:57,438 --> 00:54:00,864
That means you don’t try to acknowledge his thoughts.

584
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,543
I can understand if he wants to go abroad.

585
00:54:10,942 --> 00:54:14,660
I give him an education. I thought he wanted to go there to study.

586
00:54:15,306 --> 00:54:17,568
I can’t believe he wants to be there to work as a server.

587
00:54:18,196 --> 00:54:19,807
A server, seriously?

588
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:26,694
A server in a foreign country can earn at least 3,000 baht a day, you know?

589
00:54:28,005 --> 00:54:31,950
A hard life over there is better than living here.

590
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:45,047
Seriously, if I could go back in time, I might not have gone to college.

591
00:54:46,091 --> 00:54:49,517
There are more options in life these days than ever before.

592
00:54:52,947 --> 00:54:58,870
I only want him to complete his studies and get a degree.

593
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,169
A degree?

594
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:05,895
A degree may not be the right answer for everyone.

595
00:55:07,585 --> 00:55:08,764
Like for myself.

596
00:55:08,894 --> 00:55:10,720
I completed my bachelor’s degree.

597
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:13,083
And now I’m living paycheck to paycheck.

598
00:55:14,108 --> 00:55:15,589
Some months, I’m short.

599
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:26,689
The struggles of the wealthy cannot be compared to those of the poor.

600
00:55:28,267 --> 00:55:29,424
You will never understand.

601
00:55:30,942 --> 00:55:36,314
The feeling of not knowing how to live the next day, trying to get through it.

602
00:55:37,659 --> 00:55:38,785
You have no idea how stressful it is.

603
00:55:40,373 --> 00:55:43,678
Have you ever opened your wallet only to discover that you were out of money?

604
00:55:54,488 --> 00:55:56,488
What I’m trying to say is that…

605
00:55:56,618 --> 00:55:59,346
Happiness can be varied for each individual.

606
00:55:59,569 --> 00:56:03,190
As for you, you are happy to run your Chicken Rice diner, aren’t you?

607
00:56:06,215 --> 00:56:07,648
As for Li Ming,

608
00:56:08,374 --> 00:56:12,352
he’s probably happy to have the freedom to direct his own life.

609
00:56:18,685 --> 00:56:19,777
Wait a minute.

610
00:56:21,296 --> 00:56:22,680
Are you no longer angry with me?

611
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,527
Should I be?

612
00:56:30,317 --> 00:56:34,008
I told you I wouldn’t be angry with you.

613
00:56:36,649 --> 00:56:37,871
Good for you.

614
00:56:38,826 --> 00:56:40,941
If you are still angry,

615
00:56:42,367 --> 00:56:44,133
I’m gonna

616
00:56:45,399 --> 00:56:46,783
I’m gonna…

617
00:56:51,383 --> 00:56:55,393
I’m gonna make us cool again by asking you to float flower baskets with me.

618
00:56:58,067 --> 00:57:00,456
Wait a minute. I’m buying us flower baskets.

619
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:03,073
No. You wait here. I’ll take care of it.

620
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,625
Look.

621
00:57:22,954 --> 00:57:24,449
My float.

622
00:57:24,943 --> 00:57:26,688
Tada.

623
00:57:46,301 --> 00:57:48,168
[It's fine to use. I'm sure The Goddess of Water doesn't mind.]

624
00:58:15,928 --> 00:58:16,923
Here.

625
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,516
Next year.

626
00:59:09,775 --> 00:59:14,757
How about we float a basket…at the river together?

627
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,156
Hey.

628
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:37,410
Do this.

629
00:59:38,293 --> 00:59:39,648
Do like this.

630
00:59:41,645 --> 00:59:42,850
Get up.

631
00:59:43,855 --> 00:59:45,169
Do this.

632
00:59:46,765 --> 00:59:47,672
Yes.

633
00:59:50,451 --> 00:59:51,544
Like this.

634
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:52,828
This. Yes.

635
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:54,783
And do this.

636
00:59:55,205 --> 00:59:56,229
Put it up like this.

637
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:01,999
Like this.

638
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:03,238
Yes. Now faster.

639
01:00:10,063 --> 01:00:12,063
[Floating Baskets: 50 baht]

640
01:00:14,651 --> 01:00:17,568
Aren’t you tired of doing this tradition with your mom every year?

641
01:00:18,783 --> 01:00:20,061
I can’t say I’m not.

642
01:00:20,385 --> 01:00:21,950
What can I do?

643
01:00:22,124 --> 01:00:23,279
I don’t have anyone yet.

644
01:00:23,279 --> 01:00:25,608
Hurry and find one.

645
01:00:25,608 --> 01:00:28,711
I can’t wait to see who your lover will be.

646
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:31,926
It would be great if it’s that easy to find.

647
01:00:31,926 --> 01:00:33,141
How hard could it be?

648
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:35,375
You can always be the one who makes a move.

649
01:00:37,143 --> 01:00:38,721
It’s okay. I can do this with you.

650
01:00:38,721 --> 01:00:39,404
Right?

651
01:00:39,404 --> 01:00:41,768
How many more years can you do this with me?

652
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:44,311
I'll keep doing this with you for as long as I can.

653
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:45,395
We’ll see.

654
01:00:46,608 --> 01:00:48,349
Now make a wish.

655
01:01:13,395 --> 01:01:14,500
Wait.

656
01:01:14,987 --> 01:01:16,692
Did you get these from your car?

657
01:01:21,099 --> 01:01:23,568
What kind of person brings along floating baskets?

658
01:01:27,215 --> 01:01:29,568
Leng’s girlfriend, Praew. She made these baskets for me and Li Ming.

659
01:01:34,104 --> 01:01:35,688
Thank you.

660
01:01:46,305 --> 01:01:47,300
Let’s make a wish.
