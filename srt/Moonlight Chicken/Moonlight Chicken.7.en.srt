4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,554
Are you guys boyfriends now?

5
00:00:21,677 --> 00:00:22,605
Not yet.

6
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:25,880
You guys are staying together. What should I call this relationship?

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,749
Friends.

8
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,143
Is there a problem, Leng?

9
00:00:29,044 --> 00:00:33,807
Why is your wall so high?

10
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:38,681
Is it possible for me to be the right one for you?

11
00:00:39,338 --> 00:00:41,338
I’m sorry, Gaipa.

12
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,800
Have you met that woman?

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,901
Who am I to meet her?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,603
So that you can let go of what you’ve been doubting.

15
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,141
He didn’t want to break up with you.

16
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:58,080
If he did, he would’ve done it long ago.

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,328
Can I take Heart to hang out at my house?

18
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:11,797
3 2 1 Happy New Year. I wish you all the best in the coming year.

19
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:28,000
It might feel strange at first. Don't put all of your weight on it just yet.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,495
Your body will remember and find an appropriate balance.

21
00:01:31,495 --> 00:01:33,421
Remember to keep it away from water.

22
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:35,238
Let’s begin.

23
00:01:35,238 --> 00:01:39,043
On the injured hand, don’t press it all the way. Just slightly.

24
00:01:39,313 --> 00:01:40,710
Very good.

25
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,048
Now gently move the injured leg. Just place some weight.

26
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:47,574
There you go. Very good.

27
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,257
Now move the other leg.

28
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:54,639
In addition to this, his caregiver must assist him when going up and down the stairs.

29
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,834
Uh, Mister.

30
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:01,320
Mister.

31
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,518
Okay.

32
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:08,883
Then there's nothing else. Just be careful not to infect the wound.

33
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:12,601
While bathing, you may lift his injured leg up.

34
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:20,084
How long do I have to wear this brace?

35
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:24,184
You may come back here in 4-6 weeks to have it checked.

36
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,966
And is everything all right with the insurance?

37
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:27,972
It is.

38
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:29,896
How lucky that you have insurance.

39
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:33,738
Is there anyone who can look after you at home?

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,013
There is.

41
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:45,480
I used to wear a cast.

42
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:47,845
I should be able to look after him.

43
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:46,027
Chapter 7: My Heart Represents the Moon

44
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:51,285
Usually, you don't ride on a motorcycle's pillion.

45
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:54,160
I didn't want to drink and drive.

46
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,238
Who would have thought I'd gotten myself into more serious trouble?

47
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:02,132
Wen.

48
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:03,033
Hm?

49
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:07,650
You don’t need to look after me.

50
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:10,969
I…don’t want to impose on you.

51
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:13,400
I don't want to take away your time for work.

52
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:16,346
If you were me, you would do the same.

53
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:22,541
I already told Jeab that I would stay at her place.

54
00:05:23,296 --> 00:05:24,880
She should be here to pick me up soon.

55
00:05:30,853 --> 00:05:32,087
Don’t worry.

56
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:34,886
I already told her about us.

57
00:05:37,552 --> 00:05:39,552
What did she say?

58
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:42,998
She said she kind of knew.

59
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,841
You haven't been to her house to eat with her in a while.

60
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:52,868
Don’t feel bad about it though.

61
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:10,053
I’ll be staying at the condo. If you need anything, tell me.

62
00:06:10,053 --> 00:06:11,196
I’ll bring it to you.

63
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:12,773
Um.

64
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,432
Thanks.

65
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:17,053
Hey.

66
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:18,018
Good morning, Jeab.

67
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,006
- Hi.
- How are you doing? It’s been a while.

68
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:25,847
Thank you so much for looking after him over the past few days.

69
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:29,373
If you have time, come over to my house. The kids miss you.

70
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:34,020
Let me.

71
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:35,870
Thanks.

72
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:48,224
Watch it.

73
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:58,203
See you around.

74
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,671
See you.

75
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,174
All good?

76
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:33,576
Um.

77
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:36,873
Alan wanted to go with his sister-in-law.

78
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:39,044
Are you okay with that?

79
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:44,122
I didn’t expect to see her.

80
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:47,233
I didn’t know how to act around her.

81
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:49,472
But I think I’m okay.

82
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,656
Are you hungry?

83
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:54,026
Wanna grab something to eat together?

84
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:55,681
Sounds good.

85
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:57,381
What do you want to eat?

86
00:07:58,842 --> 00:08:00,215
How about Somtum?

87
00:08:00,215 --> 00:08:01,376
Somtum?

88
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:05,648
I know a good place. I’ll take you there.

89
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,034
Where is it?

90
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:08,060
On the beach.

91
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:41,167
Woah.

92
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:44,645
This place is stunning.

93
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:06,705
What’s wrong? The food is not good?

94
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:10,230
For a Northeasterner like me,

95
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:13,111
Somtum will never be to my liking unless I make it myself.

96
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:17,436
Make one for me next time.

97
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,626
Li Ming is the best cook when it comes to Somtum.

98
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:23,529
We are true Northeasterners.

99
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:30,464
Since I moved here,

100
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:34,463
I've never eaten on the beach casually like this.

101
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,000
I’ll take this as our first date.

102
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,333
You can call it whatever you want.

103
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:52,936
Come on. This is something both of us must agree upon.

104
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:57,318
When we recall our date anniversary in the future,

105
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,909
we can remember what we ate on our first date.

106
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:05,804
It doesn’t really matter. What’s the point of keeping track of it?

107
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,373
Listen. I don't mind if you're not romantic.

108
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:18,138
But when I'm feeling romantic, at least try to go along with it.

109
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:24,787
Uncle Jim.

110
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,803
I’ve cleaned all my mess.

111
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,609
Do you still not trust me?

112
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:44,491
It’s not about trusting you.

113
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:48,574
I’m just not sure about myself.

114
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:53,473
I’m at this age.

115
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:54,970
It’s not easy for me.

116
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:58,603
There are a lot of things I need to think about.

117
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:03,781
You always think too much.

118
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:05,139
Here.

119
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:09,740
Keep calm and eat chicken.

120
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,442
Uncle Jim.

121
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:16,607
If you eat it,

122
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,413
It means you're starting to open up to me.

123
00:11:23,353 --> 00:11:24,845
If you refuse to eat it,

124
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:28,215
I will disappear from your life.

125
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:44,902
Plain chicken is too dry.

126
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:48,000
Why don’t you dip it in the sauce?

127
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,525
It’s not too dry now.

128
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:30,400
You don’t have to come here if you don’t want to see him.

129
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:33,334
It’s all right. I’m fine.

130
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:39,760
Someone will walk into your life one day. Believe me.

131
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,950
Mrs. Hong. For the chicken I owe.

132
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:06,462
How’s it going with the loan?

133
00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:13,000
I wanted to talk to you about it the other day but you weren’t home.

134
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:18,000
I really appreciate you lending me the deed.

135
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,920
But I think I’d rather use the ones from my family.

136
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,497
I already asked my sister.

137
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:25,997
She said she could find a way to help me with that.

138
00:13:27,414 --> 00:13:30,303
We are in the same neighborhood. I'll do what I can to help you.

139
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:31,562
Don’t worry about it.

140
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:39,611
Tomorrow, I need just 6 chickens.

141
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,207
I still have some left.

142
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:43,260
Gaipa.

143
00:13:43,482 --> 00:13:44,477
Yes?

144
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:45,989
Write down his order for me.

145
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:46,739
Okay.

146
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:57,991
Gaipa.

147
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,746
Have you eaten?

148
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,410
I have.

149
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:07,760
Why don’t you get him some curry?
Don’t forget the rice noodles too.

150
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:10,680
No, thank you. I have eaten.

151
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,666
Then give it to your staff.

152
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:15,127
All right.

153
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,298
Here you go.

154
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:41,400
Thank you so much, Gaipa.

155
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:43,649
Thank you so much, Mrs. Hong.

156
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:46,118
See you again.

157
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:14,152
Are you okay, dear?

158
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:25,091
Stay strong.

159
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:32,580
Wait, Uncle Jim.

160
00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:35,387
Give this stamp card back to Li Ming.

161
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:36,613
He left it here the other day.

162
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,504
Thank you.

163
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:44,379
Can I have one Bubble Tea?

164
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:45,364
Okay.

165
00:15:46,307 --> 00:15:48,148
Make it two.

166
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:50,880
Li Ming, I don’t want it.

167
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,143
It’s not for you.

168
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:11,589
[Want to go to the cinema together this Valentine's Day?]

169
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:14,689
[Let me ask Mom.]

170
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:17,882
[OK :)]

171
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:30,544
Mom.

172
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:32,267
Li Ming.

173
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,207
How are you, dear?

174
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:38,019
I’m going in.

175
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,118
Uncle Jim went to the market. He should be back soon.

176
00:16:57,795 --> 00:16:59,022
How are you doing, dear?

177
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,969
Have you gained weight at all? Huh?

178
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:04,333
I'm not sure. Still the same. I guess.

179
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:08,520
What about you? You didn’t say you would come.

180
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,530
I came down here with Tong to run errands.

181
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:15,352
Uncle Tong?

182
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,885
Do you remember him?

183
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:23,083
That uncle who took you fishing when you were small.

184
00:17:25,026 --> 00:17:26,118
No, I don’t remember.

185
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:32,425
Well, I've recently been doing business with him.

186
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:36,040
So we see each other a lot and are close.

187
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:40,396
So he’s your new boyfriend?

188
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:44,097
He’s a nice guy.

189
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:48,277
He takes care of me in a lot of ways.

190
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:53,330
Well, his wife passed away many years ago.

191
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,775
He actually talked about marrying me, but I told him I didn't want that.

192
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:01,287
I'm this old. It's embarrassing to have more than one marriage.

193
00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:03,962
But you'll marry him anyway, right?

194
00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:11,759
What do you think about it?

195
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:17,470
If you want me to say it’s okay, say it.

196
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,464
Tong remembers you.

197
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,720
He wanted me to talk to you about it first.

198
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:31,897
I’m at this age in my life. Marriage is not something I want.

199
00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:38,565
But he’s a well-settled man.

200
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:39,946
What are you trying to say, Mom?

201
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:46,741
I want to be with you.

202
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:49,984
My life is more comfortable now, you know?

203
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,653
And you're about to graduate from high school.

204
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:58,219
Maybe we can be together again.

205
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:03,171
Tong knows a dean at the college over there.

206
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:07,578
If you want to continue your studies, he can enroll you in that college.

207
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,031
I never said I wanted to study.

208
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,875
I never said I wanted to go back there with you.

209
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:18,278
What’s with you all?

210
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:19,998
Why do you all decide for me?

211
00:19:22,415 --> 00:19:24,000
Nobody bothers to ask me first.

212
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,623
Isn’t it good to have options?

213
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,347
Yeah, it’s good.

214
00:19:29,728 --> 00:19:31,880
What do you want me to be happy about first?

215
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,040
About your break up with Uncle Sith.

216
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:35,753
About your new boyfriend.

217
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:39,094
Or about you being well-off, having a comfortable life,

218
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,000
and wanting to take me back with you?

219
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:45,992
Why do you have to be so sarcastic?

220
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:48,907
I didn’t come a long way to pick a fight with you.

221
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,779
Well, I’ll be staying here with you for a few days.

222
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,125
[Where are you?]

223
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,889
[Out to see doctor with Mom. Will be back home in the evening.]

224
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:35,092
Where are you going now?

225
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:40,183
Outside.

226
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:42,146
Where?

227
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,826
Don’t know yet.

228
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:45,574
What do you mean?

229
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,000
I haven’t decided where I want to be yet.

230
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:51,523
Then stay home and study.

231
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,670
I’m going to Heart’s home.

232
00:20:55,313 --> 00:20:56,439
Heart’s home?

233
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,314
What are you going there for?

234
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,725
Can’t I visit a friend’s place?

235
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:02,616
Li Ming.

236
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:07,266
Are you sure that’s a friend’s place?

237
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:11,506
I saw you and him kiss.

238
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:16,350
Can we talk about this later?

239
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,861
So what exactly is your relationship to him?

240
00:21:22,306 --> 00:21:23,120
Huh?

241
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,400
What is your relationship to Wen? That’s what we are as well.

242
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,120
Li Ming. I’m your uncle.

243
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,326
So what?

244
00:21:34,637 --> 00:21:36,446
Adults can do no wrong?

245
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:41,131
Adults can kiss, but kids cannot?

246
00:21:41,131 --> 00:21:43,618
Is it the wrong thing to do? Is the world coming to an end?

247
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,797
Isn't it difficult enough to be born poor?

248
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,761
And now you're gay?

249
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:01,683
So what?

250
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,156
What’s the big deal?

251
00:22:37,077 --> 00:22:39,437
I just found out on New Year’s eve.

252
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,790
I haven’t really talked about it with him yet.

253
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,273
Can I blame you for this?

254
00:22:49,264 --> 00:22:51,072
Was it my fault that I left my child in your care?

255
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:54,246
Give me a break, Sis. How could you say that?

256
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:58,322
He wasn’t like this when he was with me.

257
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:01,927
What if he was that before living with me?

258
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:05,643
Who should I blame then?

259
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:09,427
No one. What’s the point of placing blame?

260
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,833
He does nothing wrong.

261
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,359
I didn’t say he did wrong.

262
00:23:14,105 --> 00:23:16,826
My son is gay. Do you expect me to accept it with a smile?

263
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:19,900
Jam.

264
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:22,358
If you think that way, I don’t know what else I can say.

265
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:29,654
Gosh. I don’t know. My head is blank.

266
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:37,604
What are you here for by the way?

267
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,673
I’m here to tell you that I’m going to marry Tong.

268
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:50,607
And I want to take Li Ming back with me.

269
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:53,329
What do you think?

270
00:24:06,515 --> 00:24:09,909
He’s your son. What can I say?

271
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:13,781
But you raise him.

272
00:24:14,635 --> 00:24:18,101
Right now I’m living well and comfortably.

273
00:24:18,287 --> 00:24:20,479
Tong has connections over there.

274
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,396
It’s not hard to enroll Li Ming in a college.

275
00:24:28,877 --> 00:24:30,324
You should ask him yourself.

276
00:24:33,045 --> 00:24:35,045
He doesn’t listen to me.

277
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:36,519
You do realize that.

278
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:41,724
That’s why I want you to help talk to him for me.

279
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:52,929
Jim.

280
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:56,322
Please help me.

281
00:24:57,886 --> 00:25:03,034
This is the title deed to an apartment Tong rents out in the city.

282
00:25:03,438 --> 00:25:05,438
I've talked this over with him for you.

283
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:08,272
You don’t need to sign an agreement or anything.

284
00:25:09,085 --> 00:25:12,407
Jam, don’t do this.

285
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:15,031
Jim.

286
00:25:16,857 --> 00:25:18,966
I know that I’m not a good mother.

287
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,874
But I’m trying.

288
00:25:25,788 --> 00:25:27,067
Please help me out.

289
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:33,147
I…want to do something a mother should do.

290
00:25:54,627 --> 00:25:57,540
What the hell? Why are baby diapers so expensive?

291
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,982
How did my mom get the money to pay for this for me?

292
00:26:03,024 --> 00:26:03,957
Where’s Praew?

293
00:26:04,918 --> 00:26:06,225
Not yet off her shift.

294
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:11,807
She’s pregnant. Why is she still working?

295
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:15,752
Having a child costs a lot of money.

296
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:17,887
Hear my word of warning.

297
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,381
I can speak from my first-hand experience.

298
00:26:21,534 --> 00:26:22,597
Don’t do it.

299
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,655
Can you tell me, Leng?

300
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,445
Have you ever considered ab…?

301
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:35,708
Abortion?

302
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:37,144
Right?

303
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:39,534
Yes. It did cross my mind a few times.

304
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,927
Really? Then why?

305
00:26:42,677 --> 00:26:43,654
Are you afraid?

306
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:44,821
What to be afraid of?

307
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:47,485
Having children without the ability to raise them is even more terrifying.

308
00:26:48,461 --> 00:26:50,461
Praew’s grandparents want a grandchild.

309
00:26:51,055 --> 00:26:52,671
So I’m okay to have this child.

310
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:54,837
They said they would support this child.

311
00:26:57,168 --> 00:26:58,809
Your issue is also a big one.

312
00:26:59,921 --> 00:27:00,967
Can you handle it?

313
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:05,309
No, thanks.

314
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,063
I’m struggling to make it through each day.

315
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,065
How can I raise my child?

316
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:20,112
I’m curious though.

317
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:22,501
How did my parents manage to raise me?

318
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:25,891
They didn’t have jobs. They didn’t even go to school.

319
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:27,913
I wish I could ask them.

320
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:29,995
But they both are dead.

321
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:36,998
What if they were still alive?

322
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:42,697
Would you want to stay with them?

323
00:27:45,508 --> 00:27:46,568
Probably not.

324
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:48,637
Everyone has their own life to live.

325
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,390
And parents cannot be with us forever.

326
00:27:52,135 --> 00:27:53,089
Right?

327
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:20,965
Uncle Jim!

328
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:27,527
What fight did you have with your nephew today?

329
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:35,499
Honestly, I can’t help blaming myself for it.

330
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,390
Li Ming might not have become gay if he hadn’t lived with me.

331
00:28:43,308 --> 00:28:44,248
Wait a minute.

332
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:47,423
How come Saleng is straight?

333
00:28:47,423 --> 00:28:50,833
He’s been with you for a long time as well.

334
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,637
Trust me. It has nothing to do with you.

335
00:28:54,954 --> 00:28:58,756
Even if Li Ming stayed with his mother, he would still be gay no matter what.

336
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:01,951
And what era are we in now?

337
00:29:02,263 --> 00:29:06,877
No one looks for a reason why people are gay anymore.

338
00:29:07,338 --> 00:29:10,491
Look at me. None of my friends are gay, but I am.

339
00:29:12,762 --> 00:29:13,640
Um.

340
00:29:16,684 --> 00:29:18,479
I’m probably just shocked.

341
00:29:22,997 --> 00:29:23,785
Listen.

342
00:29:24,338 --> 00:29:25,838
Have you heard about this?

343
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:34,519
People can accept and not mind if someone is gay, lesbian, or whatever.

344
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:41,051
But when it comes to someone in their family, they can't accept it.

345
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:46,464
Come on, Uncle Jim.

346
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,142
You are gay, aren’t you?

347
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,590
Why can't you accept that your nephew is gay?

348
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:56,741
I can accept that.

349
00:29:57,283 --> 00:29:58,995
I’m just worried about him.

350
00:29:59,649 --> 00:30:03,403
You do know that it's not easy to be gay in this country.

351
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:08,802
I can’t see how he is able to lead a good life.

352
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:11,816
Same-sex marriages are still not allowed here.

353
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:15,167
That’s also true.

354
00:30:17,257 --> 00:30:18,231
What can we do?

355
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:22,620
We might have to wait until those conservative dinosaurs die.

356
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:27,724
I may become an MP candidate.

357
00:30:28,247 --> 00:30:31,665
If I’m chosen, I will write a new draft bill.

358
00:30:33,476 --> 00:30:35,044
Please vote for me.

359
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,066
Actually, I could tell

360
00:30:48,024 --> 00:30:49,239
about Li Ming and Heart.

361
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:52,378
I saw them hanging out.

362
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:55,431
They looked cute together.

363
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,887
Why didn’t you tell me?

364
00:31:01,082 --> 00:31:02,450
It’s not my story to tell.

365
00:31:02,762 --> 00:31:04,259
It’s theirs.

366
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:08,382
They have the right to tell or not tell people.

367
00:31:09,273 --> 00:31:12,114
If they are ready, they will tell.

368
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:13,872
It’s their lives.

369
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:20,167
If he wants to tell someone about it, you'll hear from him before I do.

370
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:21,182
Trust me.

371
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:23,338
Because you are strict.

372
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:26,481
It’s true.

373
00:31:26,983 --> 00:31:28,469
Try to listen to your nephew too.

374
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:29,896
Understood?

375
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,214
Uncle Jim.

376
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:49,930
I made you a new one. I’m sure it fits you this time.

377
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:09,295
Hey.

378
00:32:10,606 --> 00:32:12,205
You can sleep in my room.

379
00:32:15,387 --> 00:32:16,258
I don’t think it’s a good idea.

380
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:21,375
Though I don’t trust myself,

381
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:22,997
I trust you.

382
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,429
I’m sure you would not do anything to me.

383
00:32:39,172 --> 00:32:41,172
[I'll sleep over at Leng's. Don’t worry.]

384
00:32:42,602 --> 00:32:44,602
[OK.]

385
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:49,452
Uncle Jim.

386
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:54,374
You smile at your phone like this. Are you cheating on me?

387
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,247
Cheating?

388
00:32:57,448 --> 00:33:00,890
I know that you have feelings for me too.

389
00:33:01,754 --> 00:33:03,754
I'm just waiting for the day when you'll let me in.

390
00:33:05,714 --> 00:33:07,189
It’s already good this way.

391
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:12,326
It’s good in a way.

392
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:14,638
Who knows about the future?

393
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:17,554
Are you giving up, young man?

394
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:27,489
I don’t know. I have never chased after someone this long either.

395
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:32,181
If I get tired, I might just vanish into thin air.

396
00:33:32,783 --> 00:33:36,801
And then, no matter how much you want me, you can't have me.

397
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,087
Are you threatening me now?

398
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:42,153
Yes.

399
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:45,438
Are you Jimbo?

400
00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:47,015
Um.

401
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:51,117
Uncle Jim.

402
00:33:54,144 --> 00:33:58,150
What should we say if someone asks about our relationship?

403
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:00,178
How about brothers?

404
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,262
You’ve got to be kidding.

405
00:34:03,262 --> 00:34:05,128
Brothers don't spend this much time together.

406
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:07,377
Seriously.

407
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,324
I’m done talking with you. I’d rather go to bed.

408
00:34:13,324 --> 00:34:14,044
Hold on.

409
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:17,957
What?

410
00:34:25,526 --> 00:34:26,606
Happy now?

411
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:28,370
Go to bed.

412
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:29,775
Good night.

413
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:33,586
Not yet.

414
00:34:35,268 --> 00:34:36,167
Do it again.

415
00:34:36,865 --> 00:34:38,312
Go to bed now.

416
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:39,356
Do it again.

417
00:34:39,356 --> 00:34:40,313
Go to bed.

418
00:34:47,935 --> 00:34:48,981
Go to bed.

419
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,746
Nighty night, Uncle Jim.

420
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:15,034
Hey Gaipa.

421
00:35:15,034 --> 00:35:15,755
Hm?

422
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:19,312
I want my child to be born on Tuesday. So it is the same day as mine.

423
00:35:20,054 --> 00:35:23,409
What will your child call me– ‘Lung’ or ‘Ar’? What year were you born?

424
00:35:23,409 --> 00:35:24,380
Year of the Horse.

425
00:35:24,696 --> 00:35:25,955
I’m Year of the Monkey.

426
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:28,020
I’m younger, so I’m an ‘Ar’.

427
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:31,487
Great. There will be just one ‘Lung’.

428
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:33,553
Lung Jim and Lung Gaipa would be too confusing.

429
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:43,032
Hey, I’m sorry.

430
00:35:44,283 --> 00:35:46,960
I forgot. The wound is still fresh.

431
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:50,276
A good guy like you will find someone soon.

432
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:52,809
I don’t want to be a good guy.

433
00:35:53,379 --> 00:35:54,856
I want to be a guy who has a lover.

434
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:59,245
Love has nothing to do with goodness.

435
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:05,247
I’m this damn good. He still doesn't want me.

436
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,904
How sad.

437
00:36:10,445 --> 00:36:13,915
If Uncle Jim doesn't want you, let someone else do.

438
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,083
Look at those bulky veggie delivery guys.

439
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,040
Pick one.

440
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,583
You asshole.

441
00:36:19,124 --> 00:36:20,041
Sorry.

442
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:21,432
You want a piece of me?

443
00:36:21,883 --> 00:36:24,499
Look at your fat gold chain.

444
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:26,556
It will attract someone to you soon enough. Trust me.

445
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:29,066
I see. My fat gold chain?

446
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:34,899
I intended to give this to your baby. But I changed my mind.

447
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:35,786
Wait,

448
00:36:35,786 --> 00:36:38,204
- Ar Gaipa.
- You’re bugging me.

449
00:36:38,204 --> 00:36:40,313
- My kid is no one else.
= I better keep it to myself.

450
00:36:41,237 --> 00:36:42,191
Please reconsider.

451
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:43,487
Give it to my baby.

452
00:36:43,487 --> 00:36:46,003
Are you gonna snatch it? I’m telling my mom.

453
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,783
Come on. My kid will call you Ar.

454
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:49,977
I’ll think about it.

455
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:51,615
Ar Gaipa.

456
00:36:53,871 --> 00:36:55,104
Get her an Inhaler!

457
00:36:55,104 --> 00:36:55,901
What?

458
00:36:56,086 --> 00:36:57,244
What’s going on?

459
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,736
- Mrs. Hong! Are you okay?
- Anyone has inhalers?

460
00:36:59,736 --> 00:37:02,784
Mrs. Hong.

461
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,186
Excuse me.

462
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,257
Mom!

463
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,429
Sorry, folks.

464
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:08,658
I don’t know what happened to her.

465
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,102
Mrs. Hong!

466
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,876
Call an ambulance.

467
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:14,317
- Don’t crowd her. Move aside. Don’t crowd her.
- What happened to her?

468
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:16,098
- Mom!
- I don’t know.

469
00:37:16,098 --> 00:37:17,719
- She just fell down all of a sudden.
- - Mom!

470
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,575
Someone, call an ambulance.

471
00:37:20,496 --> 00:37:22,866
Mom.

472
00:37:23,093 --> 00:37:24,662
Someone, please call an ambulance.

473
00:37:24,887 --> 00:37:25,762
Mom.

474
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,195
Call an ambulance.

475
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:28,620
Mrs. Hong.

476
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:31,110
Don’t crowd her.

477
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:38,022
Mom!

478
00:37:38,372 --> 00:37:40,372
Mrs. Hong. Do you hear us?

479
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,052
Hello. Please come to the market instantly.

480
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:49,281
Someone has collapsed. Please come here right away.

481
00:38:10,352 --> 00:38:11,352
How is she?

482
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:17,587
How is she?

483
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,566
She’s gone.

484
00:38:38,303 --> 00:38:39,841
Gaipa.

485
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:46,812
Gaipa.

486
00:39:21,931 --> 00:39:23,408
[Hongdarun Kansamut]
[Born March 15 1973]
[Died February 12 2022]
[Aged 49 years.]

487
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:25,160
Gaipa.

488
00:39:26,576 --> 00:39:27,404
Yes?

489
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:29,790
I’ll be taking care of things over there.

490
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,487
Thank you so much, auntie.

491
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:32,496
You may just sit here.

492
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:33,284
All right.

493
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:47,345
Leng.

494
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:51,384
What happened to Aunt Hong?

495
00:39:51,894 --> 00:39:53,586
She had a sudden collapse.

496
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:59,087
Gaipa was unaware that his mother had severe hypertension.

497
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,460
You should keep him company for the time being.

498
00:40:11,045 --> 00:40:12,087
Sure.

499
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:17,967
I think you should rather be with him.

500
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:22,703
Can I leave this to you?

501
00:40:22,703 --> 00:40:23,544
Sure.

502
00:40:32,962 --> 00:40:34,531
Thank you for coming.

503
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:35,656
It’s too sudden.

504
00:40:35,656 --> 00:40:37,739
Please have a seat.

505
00:40:41,258 --> 00:40:42,791
Should you eat something now?

506
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:45,300
You may not have time to eat later.

507
00:40:46,473 --> 00:40:48,473
No. I’m not hungry yet.

508
00:40:49,223 --> 00:40:50,792
Drink some water.

509
00:40:51,758 --> 00:40:52,918
Sit and take a break.

510
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:55,487
Leave everything to me.

511
00:41:00,547 --> 00:41:01,807
Thank you.

512
00:41:17,946 --> 00:41:18,825
Here.

513
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:24,934
Gaipa. Someone is asking for you.

514
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:26,886
Ah. Okay.

515
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:35,319
Are you Gaipa, Mrs. Hong’s son?

516
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:37,956
Yes.

517
00:41:38,877 --> 00:41:40,075
My name is Alan.

518
00:41:42,671 --> 00:41:44,671
I’m from Krungthep Thai Bank.

519
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,121
I'm in charge of her account.

520
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:50,232
I see.

521
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:52,979
I’m sorry for your loss.

522
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,529
And…

523
00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:58,638
Sorry for meeting you while I’m like this.

524
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:01,652
It’s totally fine.

525
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:05,418
I appreciate your visit.

526
00:42:06,881 --> 00:42:08,358
This is from me.

527
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:17,629
After the funeral, I must request an appointment with you.

528
00:42:17,629 --> 00:42:21,384
Your mother purchased a number of insurances.

529
00:42:21,384 --> 00:42:23,801
I need to get some additional documents from you.

530
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,131
Sure.

531
00:42:27,347 --> 00:42:31,746
After…I’m done with the funeral.

532
00:42:31,746 --> 00:42:33,134
I'll visit you at the bank.

533
00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:37,487
All right. Sorry for having to request your time.

534
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:39,495
No worries.

535
00:42:39,495 --> 00:42:40,592
Sorry for your loss again.

536
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:42,592
Thank you for coming.

537
00:42:42,592 --> 00:42:44,827
Please take a seat.

538
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:47,446
Thank you.

539
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:10,095
Good evening.

540
00:43:12,035 --> 00:43:12,991
Li Ming.

541
00:43:13,952 --> 00:43:15,459
Go get them drinks.

542
00:43:18,901 --> 00:43:23,687
She is…a close friend…of mine.

543
00:43:24,272 --> 00:43:27,504
We have known each other…since we were small.

544
00:43:31,487 --> 00:43:33,210
It’s sad, isn’t it?

545
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:38,979
That’s…your friend.

546
00:43:40,507 --> 00:43:42,507
Good evening.

547
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,017
Go ahead.

548
00:44:25,087 --> 00:44:26,105
Here you are.

549
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:34,323
Hey, Jim.

550
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:36,004
Sit down.

551
00:44:36,527 --> 00:44:37,881
Are you here by yourself?

552
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:40,166
With my friend.

553
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,101
I’m with Mr. Boo, the owner of your diner’s property.

554
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:50,207
About that, please hurry and make your decision.

555
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:53,809
That party wants to finish the contract deal now. I’m afraid it will be too late.

556
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:57,022
I’m trying to get a bank loan.

557
00:44:58,638 --> 00:45:02,301
Or you can find a new location to rent. I may help you with that.

558
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:05,576
No, I don’t want that.

559
00:45:05,887 --> 00:45:09,427
But a new place might cost more to rent.

560
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,437
You need to come to terms with that.

561
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:13,704
I don't think I want to move.

562
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:16,087
Come on, Jim.

563
00:45:16,087 --> 00:45:18,758
Why are you so attached to that location?

564
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:24,550
With a new building in a new location, you might make more money.

565
00:45:33,018 --> 00:45:34,618
Make a decision.

566
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,586
Please give me time to think.

567
00:45:39,085 --> 00:45:42,009
After this funeral, I will call you.

568
00:45:42,462 --> 00:45:44,185
All right. Please hurry though.

569
00:45:46,475 --> 00:45:51,000
I can't believe Hong left so quickly.

570
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:56,807
No one is prepared for her sudden pass.

571
00:45:56,807 --> 00:46:02,861
She loved her son so much that she left him a fortune.

572
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,200
Gaipa will be comfortable from now on.

573
00:46:06,649 --> 00:46:08,926
He doesn’t even have to do anything much.

574
00:46:08,926 --> 00:46:12,258
Just collecting the rent is enough.

575
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:27,191
[Bavorndech Pithakwiwattana]
[Born July 15 1984]
[Died December 30 2018]
[Aged 34 years.]

576
00:46:34,045 --> 00:46:35,060
How are you?

577
00:46:38,386 --> 00:46:39,863
Good evening.

578
00:46:50,845 --> 00:46:52,845
There are just these two bank accounts, right?

579
00:46:53,267 --> 00:46:56,807
We had many bank accounts, but only these two are still active.

580
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,192
A lawyer will meet with you later.

581
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:04,899
However, all accounts were under Beam’s name.

582
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:10,632
But Beam and I put money into the Kiatsiam Siam Bank account together.

583
00:47:10,964 --> 00:47:13,949
There is my own money and also money from the diner.

584
00:47:14,884 --> 00:47:16,699
But it’s under Beam’s name, right?

585
00:47:19,844 --> 00:47:21,690
Why do you do this, sir?

586
00:47:22,543 --> 00:47:24,543
Beam and I built everything together.

587
00:47:25,362 --> 00:47:27,085
You can say things in any way you want.

588
00:47:27,085 --> 00:47:28,993
You don't have any proof.

589
00:47:29,663 --> 00:47:31,487
How could I continue the diner?

590
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:36,439
Beam is no longer here. You can do whatever you want to.

591
00:47:36,439 --> 00:47:37,679
But, sir.

592
00:47:38,052 --> 00:47:40,422
Beam and I were in a serious relationship.

593
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,474
You must understand.

594
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:46,216
How could a man-to-man relationship be serious?

595
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:49,607
Nothing has your name on it.

596
00:47:53,134 --> 00:47:55,750
What about the car? Whose name is it?

597
00:47:57,233 --> 00:47:58,648
Solely in my name.

598
00:47:59,466 --> 00:48:00,462
Anyway,

599
00:48:00,893 --> 00:48:04,607
someone will go get my son's belongings later.

600
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,906
Please help prepare them.

601
00:48:06,382 --> 00:48:08,567
As for the cat, I don't want it.

602
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,400
It's inconvenient to pet a cat at my house.

603
00:48:32,623 --> 00:48:33,463
Jim.

604
00:48:34,387 --> 00:48:35,331
Jim.

605
00:48:36,057 --> 00:48:37,109
Jim!

606
00:48:40,527 --> 00:48:43,784
Tell me when you've decided so I can figure out what to do next.

607
00:48:44,112 --> 00:48:47,159
If you wait too long to decide, I don't know what to do to help.

608
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:19,632
Which one? Valentine's one?

609
00:50:20,695 --> 00:50:22,695
I see. Okay.

610
00:50:23,128 --> 00:50:24,348
Switch colors?

611
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:26,914
Which color?

612
00:51:01,248 --> 00:51:02,433
Thank you.

613
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,807
Please accept my thanks on Gaipa's behalf.

614
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,417
Do you want me to call a ride for you?

615
00:51:15,736 --> 00:51:18,383
Don’t worry about it. I have requested a ride.

616
00:51:23,374 --> 00:51:26,175
Let me keep you company then.

617
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:35,103
Are you two now together?

618
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:39,932
We still aren't.

619
00:51:44,908 --> 00:51:48,910
If it hadn’t been for you, we would not have broken up like this.

620
00:51:56,265 --> 00:51:58,265
But I wasn’t there back then.

621
00:52:02,893 --> 00:52:05,909
I have only known Wen for less than 6 months.

622
00:52:23,344 --> 00:52:26,727
Nonetheless, I must apologize to you.

623
00:52:39,454 --> 00:52:41,977
You may leave. My ride is here.

624
00:52:52,796 --> 00:52:54,177
Did you book the ride?

625
00:52:54,177 --> 00:52:55,073
Yes.

626
00:52:56,013 --> 00:52:56,953
Please get in.

627
00:52:56,953 --> 00:52:57,728
Thanks.

628
00:53:34,555 --> 00:53:35,633
Here.

629
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:41,666
I kept this for you. You haven’t eaten yet.

630
00:53:43,641 --> 00:53:44,672
What about you?

631
00:53:45,826 --> 00:53:46,918
I have eaten.

632
00:53:50,501 --> 00:53:51,764
Let me send this mail out.

633
00:53:59,678 --> 00:54:01,487
Usually, people work from home.

634
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:03,675
But you are working from temple.

635
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,676
You know how to make a pun now?

636
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,767
I met Alan earlier.

637
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,367
He said that if I hadn't gotten in the way,

638
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:28,501
things between you and him wouldn't have ended that way.

639
00:54:39,688 --> 00:54:40,798
Uncle Jim.

640
00:54:42,676 --> 00:54:44,490
Even though I hadn’t met you,

641
00:54:45,413 --> 00:54:47,013
I would still break up with him.

642
00:54:51,328 --> 00:54:52,958
I felt bad too.

643
00:54:54,126 --> 00:54:55,880
Who wants to love and then break up?

644
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:06,119
Do you still love him?

645
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,386
I'm not sure I can call it love.

646
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:19,275
But there is still some caring.

647
00:55:21,643 --> 00:55:25,183
If we stay in a relationship that makes us unhappy,

648
00:55:26,141 --> 00:55:31,097
isn't it better to end it while there’s still some goodwill left?

649
00:55:39,501 --> 00:55:40,701
Finish it.

650
00:55:47,105 --> 00:55:48,121
Eat more.

651
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,020
No, I’m done. It’s all for you.

652
00:56:12,726 --> 00:56:15,037
[12-14 February, close for 3 days]

653
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:19,464
Here you are.

654
00:56:26,944 --> 00:56:27,855
Li Ming.

655
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:32,445
Have you talked to your mom about going back to Sakhon Nakhon?

656
00:56:35,399 --> 00:56:36,890
I don’t want to talk about it.

657
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,098
Go talk it out with her.

658
00:56:40,337 --> 00:56:42,104
Don’t you want to live with your mother?

659
00:56:50,693 --> 00:56:51,671
Why?

660
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:55,100
You don’t want to go back there?

661
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,834
I hadn't seen her in about 5 or 6 years.

662
00:57:03,514 --> 00:57:06,834
Out of the blue, she showed up and told me she loved me.

663
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,498
Do you expect me to love her back just like that?

664
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:12,055
I'm confused, too.

665
00:57:15,803 --> 00:57:18,812
Can’t you love her simply because she is your mother?

666
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:23,131
I know I owe her gratitude.

667
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:27,093
But being a mother or father should not be used as an excuse for everything.

668
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,087
But I think your mother loves you too.

669
00:57:44,584 --> 00:57:48,292
Love can't be forced, right?

670
00:57:49,816 --> 00:57:51,908
Just because she gave birth to me.

671
00:57:53,772 --> 00:57:55,751
Must I love her back?

672
00:57:59,571 --> 00:58:03,098
If you ask me if I love you or not, I can answer that more easily.

673
00:58:09,602 --> 00:58:11,602
I can easily say that I love you.

674
00:58:18,348 --> 00:58:19,420
I’ll be back.

675
00:58:31,844 --> 00:58:32,772
Here.

676
00:58:33,336 --> 00:58:34,569
Drink with me.

677
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,588
Get a taste of being an adult.

678
00:58:47,355 --> 00:58:48,580
That’s tacky.

679
00:58:49,486 --> 00:58:52,254
Does drinking beer make a person an adult?

680
00:59:27,823 --> 00:59:29,383
Go ahead.

681
00:59:30,399 --> 00:59:32,813
Don't tell me you're afraid I'll copy your behavior?

682
00:59:40,162 --> 00:59:41,207
Um…

683
00:59:41,983 --> 00:59:44,802
About the cigarette that day,

684
00:59:46,454 --> 00:59:48,454
I’m sorry.

685
00:59:53,252 --> 00:59:54,605
I was not mad at you for that.

686
00:59:56,165 --> 01:00:02,022
I was mad at myself for being your guardian and doing that myself.

687
01:00:04,812 --> 01:00:06,398
I just wanted to try.

688
01:00:09,096 --> 01:00:11,924
If I didn't try it out, how would I know if I like it or not?

689
01:00:12,647 --> 01:00:13,562
Right?

690
01:00:14,753 --> 01:00:15,838
What about Heart?

691
01:00:16,898 --> 01:00:20,887
Have you tried him out already, so you know you…like him?

692
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,179
Keep your nose out of my business.

693
01:00:25,687 --> 01:00:28,080
I have never asked about your relationship with Wen, haven’t I?

694
01:00:28,649 --> 01:00:29,755
It's not a matter for kids.

695
01:00:29,755 --> 01:00:31,866
My matter is not for adults either.

696
01:00:31,866 --> 01:00:33,762
So you want to be an adult or a kid?

697
01:00:37,064 --> 01:00:39,711
Well, just stay out of my business.

698
01:00:41,031 --> 01:00:41,953
Cheers.

699
01:01:15,193 --> 01:01:16,041
Mom.

700
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:16,986
Hm?

701
01:01:18,623 --> 01:01:22,280
You truly love Uncle Tong, right?

702
01:01:24,002 --> 01:01:27,322
I do. Or I wouldn't agree to marry him.

703
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:35,254
Do you want to marry him because he makes your life better?

704
01:01:37,788 --> 01:01:38,889
That’s also true.

705
01:01:39,788 --> 01:01:43,042
For someone who takes care of me and loves me,

706
01:01:43,258 --> 01:01:44,495
it's not hard to love him back.

707
01:01:45,258 --> 01:01:48,195
And it can make your life better too.

708
01:01:49,634 --> 01:01:53,083
What about Dad?

709
01:01:54,455 --> 01:01:56,222
I loved him of course.

710
01:01:56,816 --> 01:01:59,127
But it was a different kind of love.

711
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:02,694
There is no single pattern to love.

712
01:02:04,836 --> 01:02:06,189
I don’t get it.

713
01:02:15,528 --> 01:02:18,667
You're angry that I'm going to remarry, aren’t you?

714
01:02:19,651 --> 01:02:21,133
So you don’t want to live with me.

715
01:02:21,806 --> 01:02:25,197
I’m not angry. If you want to marry him, do it.

716
01:02:25,918 --> 01:02:31,490
I just feel that I don’t belong there.

717
01:02:33,556 --> 01:02:37,967
Sis, let him be. He has grown up.

718
01:02:38,461 --> 01:02:41,548
When we were his age, we ran away from home, didn’t we?

719
01:02:43,784 --> 01:02:44,721
Um.

720
01:02:46,326 --> 01:02:47,104
Really?

721
01:02:49,782 --> 01:02:54,396
If we had lived there, we would have both been farmers like our grandparents.

722
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,410
Yes.

723
01:02:57,471 --> 01:03:00,141
It’s his life. Let him choose.

724
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,228
He’s 18 years old.

725
01:03:03,715 --> 01:03:05,153
He knows how to jerk off.

726
01:03:05,568 --> 01:03:06,537
Uncle Jim!

727
01:03:08,194 --> 01:03:09,743
I knew how to do that a long time ago.

728
01:03:11,542 --> 01:03:12,998
Eat up.

729
01:03:14,252 --> 01:03:15,527
Seriously, Jam.

730
01:03:15,638 --> 01:03:17,819
I chop chicken and ginger every day.

731
01:03:17,819 --> 01:03:20,092
Why did you make this ginger dish for me to eat?

732
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:22,808
Just eat it. Gingers are cheap.

733
01:03:22,808 --> 01:03:24,478
Didn't you say that you're rich now?

734
01:03:24,478 --> 01:03:25,589
What is this?

735
01:03:25,589 --> 01:03:28,367
Go to Sakhon Nakhon. I'll fill up your stomach every day.

736
01:03:28,367 --> 01:03:29,901
Fine. I’ll eat it.

737
01:03:29,901 --> 01:03:30,728
All meals will be on me.

738
01:03:31,769 --> 01:03:33,433
Stir-fried Ginger is actually yummy.

739
01:03:45,262 --> 01:03:46,716
Three years ago,

740
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:51,248
my dad passed away.

741
01:03:54,017 --> 01:03:56,303
Mom was by my side and comforted me.

742
01:04:01,117 --> 01:04:02,747
She said,

743
01:04:05,254 --> 01:04:07,047
“Even though he is no longer here with us,

744
01:04:09,883 --> 01:04:16,024
the love we have for him will last forever.”

745
01:04:19,508 --> 01:04:20,741
And today,

746
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,064
I lost my mom too.

747
01:04:28,821 --> 01:04:34,160
If Mom was still with me here and comforted me,

748
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,599
she would say,

749
01:04:40,007 --> 01:04:41,593
“Even though I’m no longer here with you,

750
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:50,097
the love you have for me will last forever.”

751
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:54,966
Mom had a song she liked.

752
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,700
When she was alive,

753
01:04:58,942 --> 01:05:00,933
she asked me to sing for her.

754
01:05:02,336 --> 01:05:06,148
Up until now, I have one regret.

755
01:05:07,406 --> 01:05:09,561
I haven't been able to sing it to her yet.

756
01:05:11,665 --> 01:05:13,665
So I would like to take this occasion

757
01:05:14,648 --> 01:05:16,286
to sing this song,

758
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:20,007
which is her favorite,

759
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,812
for the first time and the last for her.

760
01:05:34,376 --> 01:05:35,496
Mommy.

761
01:05:38,783 --> 01:05:40,527
I'm going to sing you this song right now.

762
01:08:38,326 --> 01:08:41,232
[It's okay, Sis. I'm going to try it my way.]

763
01:08:44,741 --> 01:08:46,741
[Cancellation Of Lease]

764
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,929
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

765
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:12,621
Don’t you want to sell Chicken Rice anymore?

766
01:09:12,802 --> 01:09:19,704
I'm not sure if I do it because I love it or because I'm not good at anything else.

767
01:09:20,527 --> 01:09:21,723
America?

768
01:09:21,967 --> 01:09:22,771
Um.

769
01:09:23,567 --> 01:09:28,129
From now on, your life might not be easy.

770
01:09:28,407 --> 01:09:32,179
Do you remember you once asked me if this place feels like home to me?

771
01:09:32,179 --> 01:09:34,419
3 2 1.
