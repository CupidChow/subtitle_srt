What is this about?

2
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:25,536
This is the area around Phase 3 where demolition is being negotiated.

3
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:26,855
Demolition?

Yes.

Mrs. Hong told me the other day that the Marina project would affect my diner.

And I just found out that the new project assignment is the Marina Food Court.

Tell me which faculty or university you want to go to.

8

I want to spend a few years in the US.

You? Studying in the US?

I don’t know how to tell him either.

40

Tell him whatever you want.

41
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,805
You can handle it, can’t you?

42

I’m not going.

43
00:08:05,783 --> 00:08:07,417
He invited you too.

44

If you’re not going, let him know yourself.

45

Can you stop?

46

Stop pushing the burden towards me.

47
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:24,751
If I go, then we must pretend we’re still together.

48
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:26,838
I don’t like that.

49
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:28,193
It’s awkward.

00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:34,261
I’m off to work.

51
00:08:58,377 --> 00:09:02,022
Can a one-night stand turn into a serious relationship?

52
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:03,014
Damn!

Are you serious?

You’ve been obsessed.

How can something started from sex develop to love?

56
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:16,524
It’s like we started from step 10.

57
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:19,049
What should I do with steps 1-9?

58
00:09:23,392 --> 00:09:24,661
Just start counting from one.

59
00:09:26,155 --> 00:09:29,373
Isn’t it better when you don’t have to hope for it to work out

60
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:30,900
since you guys already matched?

61
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:34,852
It’s better than starting with love and a good relationship

62
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,629
but your sex life is bad.

63
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:38,108
That’s a waste of time.

But since I started my day 1 like that,

66
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,780
I don’t know how to carry on.

67
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:51,254
Treat it as an activity.

68
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:55,156
Like when you catch a movie, go shopping, or go to the gym.

69
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,154
Don’t put too much meaning into sex.

70
00:09:58,154 --> 00:09:59,251
It’s just sex.

71
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:00,550
Don’t be serious.

72
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:09,919

00:22:39,063 --> 00:22:40,302
The birthday guy hasn’t–

175
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:43,463
The birthday guy hasn’t started eating yet.

176
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:45,797
I’m happy enough that you guys remembered my birthday.

177
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:48,310
No more surprises next time.

178
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:49,343
I was startled.

179
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:50,759
Not us.

180
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:54,006
He’s the one with the surprise idea.

181
00:22:54,587 --> 00:22:55,875
Dressed up so nicely.

182
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:58,325
A spoon, please.

183
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:00,155
So?

184
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,042
Don’t you like my compliment?

185
00:23:08,434 --> 00:23:09,621
Eat.

186
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,857
Can I get a knife, Praew?

187
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:15,234
Should I cut it?

188
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:19,437
Uncle.

189
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:23,175
It’s a birthday gift from Gaipa.

190
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:24,816
Should we open it?

191
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:26,239
Sure.

192
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:53,174
One, two, three.

193
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:55,775
Yeah!

194
00:23:58,672 --> 00:23:59,589
Thanks a lot.

195
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:07,979
Here.

196
00:24:13,122 --> 00:24:14,668
Can I really crash here?

197
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,616
Of course.

198
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:17,600
Why?

199
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:19,480
I’m sure I’m self-contained.

200
00:24:22,683 --> 00:24:24,683
What do you mean, Uncle?

201
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,286
We’re all adults.

202
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:40,426
[Gaipa: Happy birthday, Uncle.]
[Gaipa: Sorry, I didn’t go. I needed to keep Mom company.]
[Jim: It’s okay. Thank you for the booze. Leng drank half of it.]

203
00:25:01,444 --> 00:25:02,518
What are you smiling at?

204
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:11,541
Uncle and nephew are both handsome.

205
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:16,075
Maybe he’s really grown up.

206
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:18,522
It’s just me who always regards him as a kid.

207
00:25:20,056 --> 00:25:21,191
No surprises.

208
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,814
When you decide on something for him, you think he’s too young.

209
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:30,522
But when you expect him to do something,

210
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:34,164
you think he’s old enough.

211
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:38,151
It’s normal.

212
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:40,017
It’s called the generation gap.

213
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:43,356
I’m almost 30.

214
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:47,771
In my mom’s opinion, I’m still 13.

215
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:51,235
Slowly adjust.

216
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,911
Don’t think too much.

217
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:57,769
It’s your birthday.

218
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:00,450
Smile more.

219
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:07,904
I have a present for you, by the way.

220
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:12,205
It’s a limited edition.

221
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:12,954
Seriously.

222
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:13,839
Let’s see.

223
00:26:24,702 --> 00:26:26,930
I screen-printed it myself.

224
00:26:31,605 --> 00:26:32,734
Thank you.

225
00:26:48,522 --> 00:26:49,838
Well, try it on.

226
00:26:51,204 --> 00:26:53,033
See if I got your size correctly.

227
00:26:59,623 --> 00:27:00,558
All right.

228
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:35,340
It’s a little tight.

229
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:38,372
Right.

230
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,954
Don’t you like me?

231
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:34,829
Thank you for the present.

232
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:36,522
I’m going to take a shower.

233
00:30:14,971 --> 00:30:16,458
It’s not gonna work.

234
00:30:16,896 --> 00:30:18,322
It’s old.

235
00:30:20,436 --> 00:30:21,541
Let’s try it first.

236
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:22,465
It might.

237
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:34,019
Come on.

238
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,460
What a shame.

239
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:39,745
Hey. Can you present your movie?

240
00:30:39,745 --> 00:30:40,628
I want to hear it.

241
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,679
It’s bittersweet.

242
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,062
Love in the wrong place at the wrong time.

243
00:30:51,513 --> 00:30:53,171
The male lead meets the female lead.

244
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:55,970
And they fall in love.

245
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:58,916
But the guy already has a fiancée.

246
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:01,058
That’s all?

247
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:02,422
No.

248
00:31:03,176 --> 00:31:08,226
The guy marries his fiancée. The girl even attends his wedding.

249
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,669
Maybe they don’t love each other enough?

250
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:16,078
If they do, they will try harder for their love.

251
00:31:16,904 --> 00:31:17,759
No.

252
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:20,814
I think they both try hard enough.

253
00:31:22,177 --> 00:31:25,944
Their way out is to be patient and live on with their lives.

254
00:31:33,027 --> 00:31:33,723
And…

255
00:31:33,723 --> 00:31:35,141
Watch it yourself.

256
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:37,465
You want me to tell you the whole story or what?

257
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,078
No.

258
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,549
I don’t like watching sad movies.

259
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:50,582
My life is dramatic enough.

260
00:31:51,681 --> 00:31:54,365
That’s what I call bittersweet.

261
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:57,651
I really like this movie.

262
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:00,067
By the way,

263
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:03,402
do you know where Li Ming got his name from?

264
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:04,815
From where?

265
00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:07,043
The name of the main actor in this movie.

266
00:32:07,528 --> 00:32:08,538
Really?

267
00:32:13,795 --> 00:32:15,795
Li Xiao Jun, played by Li Ming.

268
00:32:16,265 --> 00:32:17,225
It’s true.

269
00:32:19,249 --> 00:32:24,280
Uncle, if you’re the male lead, who would you choose,

270
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,157
your fiancée or the girl you like?

271
00:32:28,392 --> 00:32:31,532
For me, if the timing is wrong,

272
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,950
it’s still wrong even though the person is right.

273
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:41,874
Aren’t you just clingy?

274
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:44,790
Clingy cat.

275
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:51,617
I think he wants to sit with you, Uncle.

276
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:53,962
Give him a snack.

277
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:55,502
He might feel better.

278
00:32:55,502 --> 00:32:56,463
Yeah?

279
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:08,257
Jimbo.

280
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:10,318
It’s snack time.

281
00:33:19,153 --> 00:33:22,664
Cats are the hardest animal to please. Don’t you think?

282
00:33:26,062 --> 00:33:28,062
I bet you love it, huh, Jimbo?

283
00:33:31,196 --> 00:33:32,619
It smells great.

284
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:34,992
No wonder why Jimbo enjoys it so much.

285
00:33:36,395 --> 00:33:37,602
How do you know he enjoys it?

286
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:39,042
Come on.

287
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:42,725
They must have tasted it before launching the product.

288
00:33:43,578 --> 00:33:44,855
Tasted the cat snack?

289
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:46,405
Are you kidding me?

290
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:49,832
It’s edible, Uncle.

291
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:55,962
Let’s say if I try this cat snack, you try it too.

292
00:33:56,645 --> 00:33:58,274
What are you doing? I’m not playing this.

293
00:33:59,543 --> 00:34:00,506
Come on.

294
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:01,543
Eat up, Jimbo.

295
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:05,756
What?

296
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:07,762
No.

297
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:08,726
Eat it.

298
00:34:08,726 --> 00:34:10,172
Let Jimbo eat it.

299
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:11,413
You eat it first.

300
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:12,538
Hey, no.

301
00:34:12,538 --> 00:34:13,634
Eat.

302
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,454
No.

303
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:15,092
Come on.

304
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:15,592
No way.

305
00:34:15,592 --> 00:34:16,476
Jimbo, come here.

306
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:18,643
I’m feeding him.

307
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:21,003
No. Let’s just feed him.

308
00:34:21,003 --> 00:34:23,753
You eat it then. You said it’s edible.

309
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,393
Just try it first, Uncle.

310
00:34:25,393 --> 00:34:26,079
No.

311
00:34:27,362 --> 00:34:28,383
[Alan]

312
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:29,145
You eat it first.

313
00:34:29,145 --> 00:34:30,734
You said it first. You try it first.

314
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:32,166
Give it to Jimbo.

315
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:43,353
You can spend the night somewhere else.

316
00:34:44,464 --> 00:34:46,191
But you should at least tell me.

317
00:34:48,738 --> 00:34:49,856
Sorry. I forgot.

318
00:34:58,836 --> 00:35:02,027
And can you please pick up my calls?

319
00:35:02,744 --> 00:35:04,744
What if I have something urgent?

320
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,577
Do you?

321
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,559
If you do, say it right now.

322
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,990
To make it seem urgent to you, should someone die first?

323
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:22,835
I found myself a new condo.

324
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:28,494
You can start making plans of what to do when I move out.

325
00:35:30,882 --> 00:35:32,165
A new condo

326
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:36,103
or a new boyfriend’s condo?

327
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:44,895
Don’t even bother to ask

328
00:35:45,737 --> 00:35:47,338
why I don’t want to come back here.

329
00:36:23,712 --> 00:36:24,803
Gong.

330
00:36:24,803 --> 00:36:25,712
Hey.

331
00:36:27,169 --> 00:36:28,055
What’s up?

332
00:36:31,162 --> 00:36:32,647
Do you know anything about Wen?

333
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,038
Whatever you want to know, ask him.

334
00:36:40,038 --> 00:36:41,227
I’m an outsider.

335
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:43,939
If you’re an outsider, don’t take sides.

336
00:36:44,584 --> 00:36:45,723
Aren’t I your friend too?

337
00:36:48,716 --> 00:36:50,062
Don’t say that.

338
00:36:51,371 --> 00:36:53,856
Whatever fight you guys have, I’m always caught up in the middle.

339
00:36:57,643 --> 00:37:00,071
You should at least tell me something.

340
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:02,498
Don’t leave me clueless like I’m an idiot.

341
00:37:10,484 --> 00:37:11,434
Yeah.

342
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:14,536
I think he’s talking to someone.

343
00:37:15,138 --> 00:37:16,340
That’s all I know.

344
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,850
I still want you two to find the way out.

345
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,261
Clear things up.

346
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:31,554
Why, Gong?

347
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:35,303
Am I not good enough?

348
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:41,333
I tried for him.

349
00:37:43,323 --> 00:37:44,696
Everything I did, I meant well.

350
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,803
Hope you don’t think I’m cruel.

351
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:55,122
I get that you meant well.

352
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:59,642
But you should’ve asked him too if he wanted it.

353
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,115
I don’t know anymore.

354
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:11,988
I don’t know what to do.

355
00:38:14,873 --> 00:38:17,215
How about you try doing nothing?

356
00:38:31,994 --> 00:38:33,012
Gong.

357
00:38:35,642 --> 00:38:36,767
Do you know this guy?

358
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:40,622
[A chilling seller.]

359
00:38:42,478 --> 00:38:43,390
Uncle.

360
00:38:46,632 --> 00:38:47,462
Uncle.

361
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:55,186
Uncle Jim.

362
00:39:05,756 --> 00:39:06,696
Gaipa.

363
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,236
What are you doing here so early?

364
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:11,896
Don’t tell me you just got up.

365
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:13,167
I did.

366
00:39:14,024 --> 00:39:16,447
I'm going to go get your car inspected and the registration renewed.

367
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,217
Look at you.

368
00:39:20,757 --> 00:39:21,881
Did you forget?

369
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:23,635
Oh, right.

370
00:39:23,823 --> 00:39:25,149
I did forget, Gaipa.

371
00:39:25,803 --> 00:39:27,263
I have to run an errand.

372
00:39:27,263 --> 00:39:28,672
Can we take a rain check?

373
00:39:29,144 --> 00:39:30,065
Where are you going?

374
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,402
A bank.

375
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:42,451
Let’s say I drop you off at the bank first and pick you up once I’m done.

376
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,556
Okay?

377
00:39:43,556 --> 00:39:44,848
No, Gaipa.

378
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:46,599
I feel bad. I’ll do it myself.

379
00:39:46,746 --> 00:39:48,402
Just give me the vehicle inspection facility number.

380
00:39:48,402 --> 00:39:49,523
No way.

381
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:51,526
I already dressed up for it, Uncle.

382
00:39:51,643 --> 00:39:52,748
Let me take you.

383
00:39:55,182 --> 00:39:56,542
Can I?

384
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:57,182
All right then.

385
00:39:57,182 --> 00:39:58,234
Just a moment.

386
00:39:58,234 --> 00:40:00,303
Go take a shower.

387
00:40:01,285 --> 00:40:02,676
All right.

388
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:03,285
Go.

389
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,308
Wait a moment.

390
00:40:04,308 --> 00:40:05,127
Sure.

391
00:40:05,127 --> 00:40:06,077
Are you going in there with me or what?

392
00:40:06,077 --> 00:40:08,055
Yes. Just hurry up.

393
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:08,892
Okay.

394
00:40:11,913 --> 00:40:13,913
A159, please.

395
00:40:18,562 --> 00:40:20,562
Hello. Applying for a business loan, right, sir?

396
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:21,741
Yes, I am.

397
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:30,868
You don’t have the company's registration.

398
00:40:30,868 --> 00:40:32,733
Have you got any collateral to secure the loan?

399
00:40:34,762 --> 00:40:35,798
I have a car.

400
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:37,322
But it’s still in finance.

401
00:40:38,529 --> 00:40:40,740
Cars in finance can’t be used as collateral, sir.

402
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,084
Is your house or your shop under your name?

403
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,206
They’re both rental properties.

404
00:40:48,944 --> 00:40:49,973
Just a second, please.

405
00:40:49,973 --> 00:40:51,809
Alan, over here, please.

406
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:00,470
How may I help?

407
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:03,589
The client has no statement or collateral.

408
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:06,473
May I see the documents?

409
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:12,430
This is Mr. Alan, Head of the Loan Credit Department.

410
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,423
Hello.

411
00:41:27,535 --> 00:41:29,183
This can be difficult.

412
00:41:29,632 --> 00:41:31,749
I suggest you find a surety

413
00:41:31,749 --> 00:41:34,001
or borrow someone else's asset to use as collateral.

414
00:41:34,001 --> 00:41:35,677
You can make the contract with them later.

415
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:49,139
Just what I said.

416
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:50,689
Sure.

417
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:56,302
I’m sorry.

418
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:58,381
It’s okay.

419
00:42:11,939 --> 00:42:13,939
Well, well.

420
00:42:13,939 --> 00:42:17,438
Aren’t you so happy?

421
00:42:17,617 --> 00:42:20,228
You’re smiling from ear to ear. I can see it from here.

422
00:42:20,983 --> 00:42:22,490
It’s nothing, Mom.

423
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,592
Look at you. Your face says otherwise.

424
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:26,362
I look like this every day.

425
00:42:29,558 --> 00:42:31,722
Does he show any sign at all though?

426
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:32,743
No.

427
00:42:33,213 --> 00:42:35,871
Mom, why is it so hard to hit on an old man?

428
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:37,248
What?

429
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:39,126
No signs at all?

430
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:44,563
I don’t know if he’s shy, he’s being humble, or he simply doesn’t like me.

431
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,990
I can’t tell.

432
00:42:47,587 --> 00:42:52,973
When I was hitting on your dad, it was just the same.

433
00:42:52,973 --> 00:42:54,365
This thing takes time.

434
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:59,077
Men don’t like to get hit on.

435
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:02,238
They think it hurts their stupid pride.

436
00:43:03,443 --> 00:43:04,762
Your child here is a man too, you know?

437
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:07,242
I know.

438
00:43:07,242 --> 00:43:12,073
What I meant was you should let him hit on you instead.

439
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:14,491
Play hard to get.

440
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,845
You have only one life.

441
00:43:19,162 --> 00:43:21,162
Go ahead and do whatever you want.

442
00:43:21,437 --> 00:43:22,611
I only have one ask.

443
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:24,658
Don’t regret it later.

444
00:43:25,273 --> 00:43:25,968
Okay?

445
00:43:26,344 --> 00:43:27,156
Go for it.

446
00:43:31,803 --> 00:43:33,122
- Mom.
- Yeah?

447
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:35,695
Have you felt regret about anything?

448
00:43:36,385 --> 00:43:37,358
Regret?

449
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:39,160
Sometimes.

450
00:43:39,763 --> 00:43:41,642
I regret having just one child.

451
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:44,762
If I had one more, you would have had someone to play with.

452
00:43:48,613 --> 00:43:49,820
That should be good.

453
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,613
Right.

454
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:54,016
And do you regret it?

455
00:43:54,016 --> 00:43:54,882
Regret what?

456
00:43:56,564 --> 00:43:57,953
That I’m gay.

457
00:44:03,121 --> 00:44:03,920
No.

458
00:44:07,763 --> 00:44:09,998
But I’d regret it

459
00:44:11,543 --> 00:44:14,999
if my child didn’t love anyone at all.

460
00:44:17,867 --> 00:44:19,322
Have a boyfriend already, for me.

461
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:21,441
Please.

462
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:22,281
Please, please.

463
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:23,360
Come on, Mom.

464
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,500
You’re wasting your handsomeness.

465
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,438
Please.

466
00:44:26,438 --> 00:44:28,548
Like having a boyfriend is so easy.

467
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:30,154
If so, I wouldn’t be lonely like this.

468
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:34,780
When did you find out?

469
00:44:37,881 --> 00:44:38,915
To be honest,

470
00:44:40,032 --> 00:44:43,629
parents know what their kids are.

471
00:44:43,992 --> 00:44:46,203
But I’m way cooler.

472
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:49,162
I knew since you were a kid.

473
00:44:51,425 --> 00:44:52,265
But…

474
00:44:53,017 --> 00:44:55,140
you just like men.

475
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:57,682
It’s no biggies.

476
00:44:57,682 --> 00:44:58,462
Right?

477
00:44:59,239 --> 00:44:59,877
Right.

478
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:00,722
Of course.

479
00:45:00,722 --> 00:45:01,522
Go for it.

480
00:45:01,522 --> 00:45:02,224
Sure.

481
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,222
Fight for it.

482
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:05,552
You can do it, son.

483
00:45:13,866 --> 00:45:15,866
You like this song very much, don’t you?

484
00:45:22,752 --> 00:45:24,752
I attracted your dad with this song.

485
00:45:28,084 --> 00:45:28,950
Uncle.

486
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,705
Hello.

487
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:33,431
Hey.

488
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,506
You said you couldn’t come today and on Christmas.

489
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,062
I changed my mind.

490
00:45:38,555 --> 00:45:40,057
I’d rather celebrate Christmas with you.

491
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,155
What are these things?

492
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:45,122
These?

493
00:45:46,772 --> 00:45:48,772
They’re leftovers from the mall decorations.

494
00:45:49,405 --> 00:45:50,416
Don’t tell anyone that.

495
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,364
Your diner is still undecorated.

496
00:45:54,364 --> 00:45:55,135
Right?

497
00:46:13,576 --> 00:46:14,365
Uncle.

498
00:46:15,576 --> 00:46:18,619
I went to a Christian school as a kid.

499
00:46:18,923 --> 00:46:20,782
They made me dress up like Jesus on Christmas.

500
00:46:23,305 --> 00:46:25,916
When I was young, I went to a temple school.

501
00:46:26,198 --> 00:46:27,658
I only knew Buddist’s religious days.

502
00:46:31,425 --> 00:46:32,814
Do you know Santa Claus?

503
00:46:34,162 --> 00:46:36,914
Everyone knows Santa Claus, all right?

504
00:46:37,854 --> 00:46:38,628
Yeah?

505
00:46:43,352 --> 00:46:44,592
So tomorrow,

506
00:46:45,085 --> 00:46:47,301
this Chicken Rice diner will be run by Santa Claus.

507
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:50,711
Hey.

508
00:46:50,711 --> 00:46:51,476
No.

509
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,930
Say, “Ho ho ho.”

510
00:46:54,272 --> 00:46:55,802
You’re playing like a child.

511
00:46:55,802 --> 00:46:56,852
Come on, Uncle.

512
00:46:58,305 --> 00:47:00,305
Age is just a number.

513
00:47:00,305 --> 00:47:01,772
You should have fun sometimes.

514
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:03,126
Do I look great?

515
00:47:10,763 --> 00:47:14,431
