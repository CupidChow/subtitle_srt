Stop pushing the burden towards me.

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,837
Do you know this guy?

6
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:25,767
Does he show any sign at all though?

7
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:29,880
No. Mom, why is it so hard to hit on an old man?

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,854
Don’t you like me?

9
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:36,900
Is running a Chicken Rice diner really your dream?

10
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:38,676
Are you truly happy?

11
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:42,798
Look at me. I'm soaking wet here.

12
00:00:44,265 --> 00:00:45,802
What are you playing?

13
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:51,052
I’m sorry, Uncle Jim.

14
00:00:52,983 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to take you somewhere.

15
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:03,434
Did you sleep with my boyfriend?

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,649
You stop!

17
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:06,669
Wen.

18
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,423
I broke up with him, Uncle Jim.

19
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:10,720
Please believe me.

20
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:31,025
And this is the man who posted

21
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:34,609
“An early bird gets things done first.”

22
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:40,244
Put that away. It's my day off. Can’t I sleep for a little longer?

23
00:01:40,244 --> 00:01:41,777
No, you can’t.

24
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:45,680
Who promised me yesterday that he would go jogging with me today?

25
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,655
I’ll do it tomorrow. I’ll go with you tomorrow.

26
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:52,329
“Tomorrow is too late.”

27
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:54,598
Who posted this?

28
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:56,660
Are you bullying me?

29
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,139
Are you bullying me?

30
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:00,000
No.

31
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:02,174
Are you bullying me? Huh?

32
00:02:02,174 --> 00:02:04,000
Ouch.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,981
It tickles.

34
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:05,961
Wen.

35
00:02:06,263 --> 00:02:08,263
Wen, it tickles.

36
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,655
What day is today?

37
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,197
I don’t know.

38
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:26,859
You don’t, really?

39
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:27,676
I don’t.

40
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:28,816
I’ll be mad.

41
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:30,461
I don’t know.

42
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:32,664
Fine.

43
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,360
Come here. Let’s snap a picture.

44
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:42,445
For what?

45
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:43,865
For our anniversary.

46
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:48,909
Here we go.

47
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,244
One two…

48
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,319
Look at our first anniversary picture.

49
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:03,320
How many 'N's are there in anniversary?

50
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:07,036
A-N-N, two Ns.

51
00:03:07,607 --> 00:03:08,861
I always forget it.

52
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:09,854
You rarely use it.

53
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,796
I want to use it a lot more often with the same person for a long time.

54
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:20,732
Did I make you blush?

55
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,881
Write it.

56
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:28,097
One year anniversary.

57
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:30,552
You will now remember how to spell.

58
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,186
Sure.

59
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,147
Come here.

60
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:41,629
To where.

61
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:42,625
Just come.

62
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,680
Hold on.

63
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,906
Come on.

64
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:48,080
What?

65
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,680
Here. Our board of memory.

66
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:54,627
Let me put it.

67
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:02,285
How about we celebrate our first year anniversary?

68
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:39,514
Wen.

69
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,623
Seriously,

70
00:04:47,444 --> 00:04:48,911
can you tell me what I did wrong?

71
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:53,174
I’m done talking about that.

72
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:56,801
Then tell me how you want it to be.

73
00:04:57,948 --> 00:04:59,516
I’ll do better.

74
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:03,984
You don’t have to do anything.

75
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:06,614
You don’t have to do anything for me anymore.

76
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:11,898
You don't give me any choices?

77
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,077
All you want is to break up with me?

78
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:20,335
I don’t want to torture you any longer.

79
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,624
For me, really?

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,411
How could you say that?

81
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:27,364
Because you are like this.

82
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:30,468
I wanted to call it quit, but you said we could try to be friends.

83
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:32,306
Look how we are now.

84
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:34,545
Can’t you see it doesn’t work?

85
00:05:35,005 --> 00:05:38,960
Do you think it's easy to go from being a boyfriend to a friend?

86
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,247
Exactly!

87
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:43,213
That’s why I didn’t want us to stay even as friends.

88
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:44,620
You never treat me as friends.

89
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:47,301
You can say "friends" as if you don't give a shit about us.

90
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:48,298
I don’t?

91
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:50,332
I wouldn't be staying here if I didn't care.

92
00:05:52,374 --> 00:05:56,504
That’s why I believe there’s still a chance in our relationship.

93
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:58,049
It won’t get any better.

94
00:05:58,314 --> 00:05:59,820
What else do you want me to do then?

95
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:03,881
You broke up with me out of the blue and said you didn’t love me anymore.

96
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:05,706
That’s one shitty excuse.

97
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,175
I don’t get it.

98
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:08,711
Do you want to hear it again?

99
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:10,680
The shitty excuse you said.

100
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:15,640
I don’t love you anymore.

101
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,611
I don’t want to get up early to go jogging with you.

102
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,889
I don’t want to have a Shabu with you.

103
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:20,797
I don’t want to go anywhere with you anymore. Do you get it?

104
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,232
And I don’t want you to stay up waiting for me when I come home late.

105
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:25,645
Don’t be upset about that anymore.

106
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:34,676
But I can’t do that because I still care about you. Can’t you see?

107
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:42,382
However you want to live your life, do it.

108
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:45,593
Just let me be a part of your life too. Can I?

109
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,895
You don’t want just that. Deep down you know you want more.

110
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:51,676
You always initiate it.

111
00:06:51,676 --> 00:06:53,927
You still want to get it on even though we already broke up.

112
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:57,347
That’s bold of you to say.

113
00:06:58,124 --> 00:07:01,050
We slept together, but I'm the only one who gets blamed..

114
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,478
I did it because I felt sorry for you.

115
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,576
Are you happy now?

116
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:07,536
I slept with you because I felt sorry for you.

117
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:27,317
See?

118
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:31,944
I’m the jerk here whenever we talk about this.

119
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:36,000
Deep down you don’t want us to be like this.

120
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:38,885
But I did my best.

121
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:41,557
I did my best, really.

122
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,341
Look where it got us.

123
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:46,951
We ended up fighting as always.

124
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,616
Aren’t you tired?

125
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:52,358
You are tired, so am I.

126
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:13,185
I’m sorry.

127
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:25,290
I’m sorry too.

128
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,716
I try to stay as a friend to you.

129
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:09,200
Chapter 5: Wrong You in the Right Time

130
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:23,278
I broke up with him, Uncle Jim.

131
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:25,520
Please believe me.

132
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:45,975
Hello.

133
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:48,136
Where are you, Gong?

134
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:49,772
At my condo.

135
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,354
You called me this late. Did you get stopped at the police checkpoint?

136
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,223
No.

137
00:11:57,643 --> 00:11:58,983
Another fight?

138
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:03,070
Can I stay at your place tonight?

139
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:04,682
Wen.

140
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,840
I think you should stop doing this.

141
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,038
You can’t run away every time you have a fight with him.

142
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:13,088
That place is also yours.

143
00:12:16,304 --> 00:12:18,705
You're a grown man. You should set things right.

144
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,266
It’s suffocating.

145
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,433
Then move out.

146
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,217
Be decisive.

147
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:29,860
If you continue to stay with him, you will only give him hope.

148
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,167
It’s never going to be over.

149
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:32,819
I got it.

150
00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:57,124
Wen.

151
00:12:59,254 --> 00:13:00,316
Come here.

152
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:02,651
I’ll dress your wound.

153
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:56,948
Does it still hurt?

154
00:13:57,813 --> 00:13:58,866
Um.

155
00:14:06,871 --> 00:14:09,272
I…am sorry.

156
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:15,433
For?

157
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,557
For hurting you

158
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,121
and for being a jerk to you.

159
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:44,978
We are not what we used to be anymore, Alan.

160
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:47,146
Can you tell me?

161
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:51,543
What does he have that I don't?

162
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:55,019
I don’t have an answer for that.

163
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:00,438
I never compare you with anyone.

164
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,162
When I was with you,

165
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:06,232
I focused only on you.

166
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,558
My love was just for you.

167
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:13,383
But it's no longer that.

168
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:24,669
You don’t leave me any options?

169
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,365
Wen.

170

That can’t help.

00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:32,650
There is no one in this world who has not been hurt by love.

184

If it doesn’t hurt, it’s not love.

185

Being hurt when you're in your twenties is totally different from being hurt when you're nearly 40.

340
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:38,321
Okay.

341
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,598
That's not a problem for you, right?

342
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,201
Not at all.

343
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,357
I can use the contact number that's written here, right?

344
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:47,372
Yes.

345
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:56,432
Hold on.

346
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,050
That’s my pen.

347
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,358
Sorry.

348
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:06,847
I'm not aware that I'm taking it.

349
00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:10,398
That’s all right.

350
00:32:11,532 --> 00:32:13,125
Now that you are aware,

351
00:32:14,243 --> 00:32:15,830
just return what you took to me.

352
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,700
[No Answer]

353
00:33:02,586 --> 00:33:03,389
Hey.

354
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:05,426
How come you are home early?

355
00:33:07,469 --> 00:33:09,225
Stop picking on me.

356
00:33:10,517 --> 00:33:11,894
I’m just asking.

357
00:33:13,022 --> 00:33:13,893
Why?

358
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,620
I'm that much of a jerk to you?

359
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:25,355
Are you sure you are not picking a fight?

360
00:33:25,763 --> 00:33:27,573
Okay. Let’s be civil.

361
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,820
Alan.

362
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,699
Yes?

363
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:34,798
Can I ask something?

364
00:33:38,237 --> 00:33:42,430
To get a bank loan, can we use someone else’s title deed?

365
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:48,380
Of course, as long as the owner lets you.

366
00:33:53,358 --> 00:33:54,436
Why?

367
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:56,441
That man told you to ask me?

368
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:00,622
He came to my bank today to request a loan.

369
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:04,424
There are so many banks to choose from, but he chose mine.

370
00:34:08,365 --> 00:34:10,906
Do you think he'll be able to get a loan?

371
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:15,304
Do you think I’ll approve it?

372
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:20,450
Is this what you call being civil?

373
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,661
What's wrong with my words?

374
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:29,306
I’m professional enough to separate work from private matters.

375
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:34,476
Even if his loan gets declined, I still like him.

376
00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:01,010
Look, guys. We are told to inspect the site today.

377
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,541
Is anyone free to go with me?

378
00:35:03,615 --> 00:35:04,883
I can go with you.

379
00:35:05,127 --> 00:35:07,781
Hold up. Did we get a green light to go ahead with Phase 3?

380
00:35:08,152 --> 00:35:11,343
The contractors are not able to get to the site by the original timelines.

381
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:16,282
That’s right. Some homeowners are hesitant to sell their properties.

382
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,709
The negotiations are not yet finished.

383
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,261
What a waste of time.

384
00:35:20,562 --> 00:35:23,347
If Marina really wants those properties, they should be able to work it out.

385
00:35:23,731 --> 00:35:25,027
That’s true.

386
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:29,833
But some of the houses near the Chicken Rice place have yet to accept the deals.

387
00:35:34,404 --> 00:35:37,247
What if we fail to acquire those places?

388
00:35:37,518 --> 00:35:39,057
Shouldn’t we delay the project for the time being?

389
00:35:40,953 --> 00:35:42,953
You can go ahead with the project. Don’t wait.

390
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:45,661
I’m sure the board can sort this out one way or another.

391
00:35:46,131 --> 00:35:47,535
This is Thailand.

392
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:49,970
Big fish always eat small fish.

393
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:52,628
Go for it.

394
00:35:55,227 --> 00:35:57,898
Get yourself ready. We are going to the site.

395
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:11,761
I forgot to tell you this.

396
00:36:11,978 --> 00:36:15,131
Alan asked me about that picture in your Story.

397
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,130
He asked me who he is.

398
00:36:21,286 --> 00:36:22,799
What did you say to him?

399
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:25,279
I said I didn’t know and told him to ask you himself.

400
00:36:28,285 --> 00:36:30,691
Whatever you choose, make it clear.

401
00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:34,220
I have been so clear. We already broke up.

402
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:36,106
I have nothing else to say to him.

403
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,319
I still don’t understand.

404
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:41,447
You broke up, but you're still living together.

405
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,743
Isn’t it strange?

406
00:36:47,523 --> 00:36:49,577
Well, he said we could stay as friends.

407
00:36:51,427 --> 00:36:54,158
I understand that part where you can still be friends.

408
00:36:54,158 --> 00:36:54,890
It’s actually nice.

409
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,647
But think about this.

410
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,486
A friend who once was your lover and had intimate relationship with you

411
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:03,056
stays under the same roof, in the same room and on the same bed as you.

412
00:37:03,452 --> 00:37:04,954
And for a drinker like you,

413
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,374
I’m sure you can get it on easily.

414
00:37:07,954 --> 00:37:09,170
Get it on, my ass.

415
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,199
I’m trying to find a new place to live.

416
00:37:13,451 --> 00:37:14,910
I don’t want to imagine this.

417
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,638
If I’m your new boyfriend and know about this.

418
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:20,029
I don’t think I can sleep.

419
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:22,660
Anyway, see you.

420
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,614
See you.

421
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:07,943
Thank you.

422
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,264
What’s wrong?

423
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:50,922
Nothing. I just don’t want to talk to you.

424
00:38:52,573 --> 00:38:55,764
Didn’t you say we should talk face to face?

425
00:38:56,737 --> 00:38:57,996
Here I am.

426
00:39:00,243 --> 00:39:01,607
What do you want to talk about? Go ahead.

427
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:05,557
What do you want me to do?

428
00:39:06,332 --> 00:39:07,791
You can let me know.

429
00:39:10,488 --> 00:39:12,380
I don’t want anything from you, Wen.

430
00:39:13,722 --> 00:39:16,182
I think I made it clear from Day 1.

431
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:21,984
And now, it couldn’t be any clearer.

432
00:39:25,164 --> 00:39:26,947
Be logical, please.

433
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:29,398
Alan and I did break up.

434
00:39:29,686 --> 00:39:31,307
We are now friends.

435
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:33,719
We just live together.

436
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,625
You can have any kind of relationship with anyone. It’s totally up to you.

437
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,510
Don’t involve me.

438
00:39:41,971 --> 00:39:43,130
I’m not a part of it.

439
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:45,622
You are.

440
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,819
You do know that I like you.

441
00:39:49,876 --> 00:39:53,446
And I’m sure you like me too.

442
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:09,988
Wen.

443
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,491
Do you remember my question?

444
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:17,890
I asked you if it’s going to be complicated.

445
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,430
Then what is this?

446
00:40:22,188 --> 00:40:23,639
I’m a grown up man.

447
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,788
I don't like things that are complicated like this.

448
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,360
You got what I meant?

449
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:34,972
Jim, one Chicken Rice, please.

450
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,760
Sure. Your usual, right?

451
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,352
Yes.

452
00:40:43,352 --> 00:40:44,237
Okay, ma’am.

453
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:35,782
My love was just for you.

454
00:41:37,402 --> 00:41:38,996
But it's no longer that.

455
00:41:39,422 --> 00:41:40,329
It’s suffocating.

456
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,234
Then move out.

457
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:43,977
Be decisive.

458
00:41:44,324 --> 00:41:46,920
If you continue to stay with him, you will only give him hope.

459
00:41:47,075 --> 00:41:48,297
It’s never going to be over.

460
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:55,410
I asked you if it’s going to be complicated.

461
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:56,556
You dumped me

462
00:41:57,206 --> 00:41:59,130
for this Chicken Rice seller?

463
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,725
Hey!

464
00:42:00,928 --> 00:42:01,970
Stay the f**k out!

465
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,290
Calm down.

466
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,327
Then what is this?

467
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:05,991
I’m a grown up man.

468
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,330
I don't like things that are complicated like this.

469
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,321
You broke up, but you're still living together.

470
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:12,130
Whatever you choose, make it clear.

471
00:42:24,478 --> 00:42:25,326
Hello, Alan.

472
00:42:30,822 --> 00:42:32,191
Are you free this evening?

473
00:42:35,205 --> 00:42:36,772
Want to go out to eat?

474
00:43:09,828 --> 00:43:10,761
You know what?

475
00:43:11,828 --> 00:43:14,194
I only started to eat beef when I went out with you.

476
00:43:15,482 --> 00:43:16,430
Yes, I know.

477
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:19,970
When you had that first bite of beef,

478
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,678
I could tell by the look on your face.

479
00:43:22,189 --> 00:43:23,518
You'd clearly never had beef before.

480
00:43:24,573 --> 00:43:25,970
It was our first date.

481
00:43:26,968 --> 00:43:28,968
You even ordered imported beef.

482
00:43:29,716 --> 00:43:31,370
So I ate that to please you.

483
00:43:41,107 --> 00:43:43,324
Now we have just simple cheap beef together.

484
00:43:45,445 --> 00:43:46,619
You know what?

485
00:43:48,243 --> 00:43:50,287
I don’t really like beef.

486
00:43:55,118 --> 00:43:56,631
Then you don’t have to eat it.

487
00:43:57,785 --> 00:43:59,406
But you like it.

488
00:44:01,242 --> 00:44:02,592
I can eat it too.

489
00:44:06,136 --> 00:44:08,298
But now you like chicken better than beef, right?

490
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:15,702
You were not this sarcastic back then.

491
00:44:18,127 --> 00:44:20,127
I have always been like this.

492
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:22,852
You just start to not like it.

493
00:44:29,053 --> 00:44:33,679
I told Gong that we broke up.

494
00:44:41,793 --> 00:44:43,970
You brought me here to tell me this?

495
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,662
What about those past 4 or 5 months?

496
00:44:50,509 --> 00:44:52,130
Why did you make me hope?

497
00:44:54,353 --> 00:44:55,970
I was wrong.

498
00:44:58,898 --> 00:45:02,793
Deep down, I also hope we could make it work again.

499
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:10,408
Everything you did for me,

500
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,257
I saw it.

501
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:16,229
I'm sorry…

502
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:21,987
for being the one who fell out of love with you.

503
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:31,427
But I can't keep lying to myself any longer.

504
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,117
Can I ask?

505
00:45:43,472 --> 00:45:45,264
If there’s no one else,

506
00:45:47,969 --> 00:45:49,617
will we reach this point in the relationship?

507
00:45:52,386 --> 00:45:54,034
I asked myself that too.

508
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,646
Even if there was no one else,

509
00:46:03,545 --> 00:46:05,384
it wouldn't be any better.

510
00:46:15,596 --> 00:46:16,747
I'm thinking...

511
00:46:18,723 --> 00:46:21,711
I should make this clear once and for all.

512
00:46:23,301 --> 00:46:24,161
For what?

513
00:46:25,301 --> 00:46:27,280
So that you would feel less like a jackass?

514
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:34,071
No, Alan.

515
00:46:39,242 --> 00:46:41,419
So that I could finally let you go.

516
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,743
Why would you stay with someone who no longer loves you?

517
00:47:16,684 --> 00:47:19,144
Excuse me. I’ll rekindle the fire for you.

518
00:47:19,415 --> 00:47:20,346
No need to.

519
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,483
We’re done. Thanks.

520
00:47:33,381 --> 00:47:35,381
Let’s stop hurting each other.

521
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:50,441
Now we are truly friends.

522
00:48:10,564 --> 00:48:11,914
You can go first.

524
00:48:58,022 --> 00:48:59,795
Please lend me your motorcycle.

525
00:48:59,795 --> 00:49:01,092
Go ahead. The key is over there.

526
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,191
Don’t you have to go to Officer Supoch's house?

527
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:07,743
I'm finished with that. I'm going to Noch's house to work on an assignment.

528
00:49:10,454 --> 00:49:11,381
I’m leaving.

529
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,553
Hold up, Li.

530
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,926
Fill up the tank for me too, my Li bro.

531

Okay, bro.

533
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:30,977
What is it for?

534
00:49:30,977 --> 00:49:32,442
For your gas.

535
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,840
Li Ming has been using your bike.

536
00:49:35,095 --> 00:49:36,926
I would be an ass if I take that.

537
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:41,971
Wait. But I’ll keep it to buy my baby’s diapers.

538
00:49:43,611 --> 00:49:46,203
You told me not to turn down money, no matter how small.

539
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,877
Have you taken Praew for an ultrasound?

540
00:49:51,683 --> 00:49:53,232
We won’t need that. It’s a waste of money.

541
00:49:55,062 --> 00:49:57,372
A baby girl or baby boy, we raise them the same.

542
00:49:57,372 --> 00:49:59,090
We let them choose their gender identity when they grow up.

543
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:01,273
Don’t eat your own words later.

544
00:50:01,656 --> 00:50:04,022
Who cares if people are straight or gay these days?

545
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,491
The ones who could make more money are the winners .

546
00:50:15,636 --> 00:50:17,861
Or simply the ones who are happier.

I’m sorry. It was my fault.

577
00:56:03,704 --> 00:56:07,095
I taught Heart to ride a motorcycle and it skidded.

578
00:56:09,718 --> 00:56:13,353
We went to the hospital already. It was not serious.

579
00:56:15,984 --> 00:56:17,646
You taught him to ride a motorcycle?

580
00:56:18,366 --> 00:56:20,056
He’s deaf.

Ma’am.

00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,837
Deaf people can ride motorcycles.

583
00:56:27,205 --> 00:56:28,923
He asked me to teach him how to ride.

584
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:32,299
But I never gave permission.

585

Your previous offense has yet to be cleared, and you have now added to it.

Stop saying that.

Mute?

595

Aren't you aware that deaf people dislike being called mute?

596
