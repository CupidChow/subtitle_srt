4
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:20,062
Uncle Jim.

5
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:22,271
I’ve cleaned all my mess.

6
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:26,760
Do you still not trust me?

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,984
And you're about to graduate from high school.

8
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:33,630
Maybe we can be together again.

9
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:35,269
I never said I wanted to go back there with you.

10
00:00:37,327 --> 00:00:39,462
So what exactly is your relationship to him?

11
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:43,240
What is your relationship to Wen? That’s what we are as well.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,209
Li Ming.

13
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:49,427
- Mrs. Hong!
- Mom. Mom!

14
00:00:49,564 --> 00:00:51,782
She’s gone.

15
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:59,257
If it hadn’t been for you, we would not have broken up like this.

16
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:01,921
But I wasn’t there back then.

17
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,258
[It's okay, Sis. I'm going to try it my way.]

18
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:38,760
Here you go.

19
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,912
Wow! Looks yummy.

20
00:01:55,194 --> 00:01:57,443
You’re lucky that you get to eat

21
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:00,370
before the diner is closed down.

22
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:06,000
Have you thought it through about the diner?

23
00:02:06,554 --> 00:02:08,086
Why did you return the title deed?

24
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,486
Li Ming should be able to decide what to do with his life.

25
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:18,995
If he doesn’t want to go back, let him.

26
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:23,004
Jam,

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,959
we shouldn’t become the kind of adults we hate.

28
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:35,445
About the diner, I can manage to survive.

29
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:37,590
So can Li Ming.

30
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:42,407
Honestly,

31
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:46,598
I can’t help worrying about him.

32
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,024
About what?

33
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:51,404
Well.

34
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:55,165
Him being gay.

35
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:57,228
Jam,

36
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,938
you accept your brother but can’t do the same with your son?

37
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,920
What is this? I don’t get it.

38
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,533
Hey, I’m okay with that.

39
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:09,128
I’m just worried about him as a mother.

40
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:10,740
He’s young.

41
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,840
Will people disdain him when he becomes an adult?

42
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,521
Who will take care of him when he’s old?

43
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:17,738
There’s no guarantee either that straight couples can always make it.

44
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:18,781
Look at you.

45
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:22,096
Yeah.

46
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:23,560
You’re right.

47
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:29,751
Li Ming might even have a better love than we do.

48
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:34,192
Whatever mistake he’s making,

49
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:40,944
he has me to give advice.

50
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:43,895
Don’t you worry.

51
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:52,270
I guess he was right to choose to live with you over with me.

52
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:54,662
No, Jam.

53
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:56,636
We’re just learning together.

54
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:05,590
Keep eating.

55
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:06,705
Right.

56
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,080
I’ll finish it all.

57
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:58,037
Chapter 8: The Self-made House and Home

58
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,072
I said I’d come.

59
00:06:01,072 --> 00:06:02,876
I’m not that mad at Mom.

60
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:04,165
Come on.

61
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:05,264
Let’s make it her day today.

62
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,414
I’ll pick you up later.

63
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,757
Wait. Why?

64
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:10,909
So you can spend time with your mom.

65
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:12,949
We live together every day.

66
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:14,867
I’m sick of seeing your face.

67
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:15,935
Oh, yeah?

68
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:18,350
Let’s go.

69
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:20,625
Hi.

70
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,038
Are you guys hungry?

71
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:23,600
Not at all, Jam.

72
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,679
You guys go ahead.

73
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:26,040
I got something to do around here.

74
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,931
What?

75
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:28,045
I’ll call you later.

76
00:06:31,163 --> 00:06:32,205
Let’s go then.

77
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:33,308
Are you hungry?

78
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:34,838
Come on.

79
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:37,084
What do you want to eat?

80
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:52,000
You’re standing here looking so handsome.

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,121
Have you got yourself a lover?

82
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:55,505
I haven’t.

83
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:06,357
It’s this room.

84
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:07,701
Please take a look inside.

85
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:08,748
Sure.

86
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,785
Please take your time.

87
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:14,364
- Thank you.
- Of course.

88
00:07:25,602 --> 00:07:26,629
How’s it, Uncle Jim?

89
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,050
Nice location.

90
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:39,791
I thought it’d be further.

91
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:43,115
10 minutes from the mall.

92
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:46,808
When I’m tired, I’ll crash here.

93
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:49,173
When I miss you,

94
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:52,275
I’ll sleep at your place.

95
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:55,324
Why would you want to hurt your back?

96
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:56,897
Sleeping here seems a lot more comfortable.

97
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,711
Comfortable but not with you.

98
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:03,343
I’d rather choose the back pain.

99
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,031
Uncle Jim,

100
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:10,687
I think I’ll keep this loose furniture.

101
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:14,576
If I get bored with them, I can easily replace them.

102
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,067
What color do you think I should paint the walls?

103
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,132
Black or blue?

104
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:27,750
Green.

105
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:30,316
Green?

106
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:32,884
Interesting.

107
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:39,320
If green walls, then I think I should change the couch.

108
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,594
Good idea?

109
00:08:41,694 --> 00:08:44,349
I think a leather couch will fit better. What do you think?

110
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,929
That’s your call.

111
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:50,691
This is your home.

112
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:13,098
Uncle Jim,

113
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:17,009
it’s my first home.

114
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:20,772
I want you to be part of it.

115
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:38,663
I changed my mind.

116
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,477
I’m gonna call it

117
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:44,915
our home.

118
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,280
You want this pair?

119
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:23,267
No.

120
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:24,994
Who would wear these?

121
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:28,800
Why? I think they’re pretty.

122
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:31,376
You can wear them to school or when you’re on trips.

123
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:32,991
You can play football in these too.

124
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,736
No, I can’t.

125
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,972
Football boots and leisure shoes can’t be the same pair.

126
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,427
Two different purposes.

127
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:42,591
I can’t wear the same pair for both.

128
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:37,698
Here.

129
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:42,000
Since I get to buy you stuff once in a blue moon.

130
00:11:57,736 --> 00:11:59,424
They’re expensive. Why did you buy them?

131
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:00,874
We could’ve got them for a cheaper price online.

132
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
And these are the socks.

133
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,795
I think they’re cute.

134
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,283
You like them?

135
00:12:14,415 --> 00:12:15,554
I do.

136
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:20,811
That’s all it takes.

137
00:12:44,073 --> 00:12:46,073
Did you use your credit card to buy these?

138
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,242
Yeah.

139
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:48,920
Tong got me the card.

140
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Uncle Tong,

141
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:01,610
do you really love him?

142
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:03,945
Of course.

143
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:06,720
Otherwise, why would I marry him?

144
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:21,177
And…

145
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:27,366
You get married many times. Aren’t you afraid people will talk?

146
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,079
If they want to gossip, they still do whether I get married or not.

147
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:39,972
You’re the only one I care about.

148
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:53,277
Whatever makes you happy,

149
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:58,964
do it, Mom.

150
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:14,449
Come on. Why are you crying?

151
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,381
Keep it.

152
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,836
I just want you to have it.

153
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,071
Here.

154
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,738
For you.

155
00:15:34,254 --> 00:15:37,345
Pour water of dedication and get blessed.

156
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,145
Your mom isn’t around anymore.

157
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:13,026
Do you want to continue the chicken stall, Gaipa?

158
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:24,579
When I was young, I hated working at the chicken stall.

159
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:33,015
I thought I wouldn’t sell chicken meat when I grew up.

160
00:16:33,871 --> 00:16:35,497
I would do something else.

161
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:45,562
Do you want to close it down?

162
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:51,313
Right now,

163
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,746
you have your own life.

164
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:57,838
I will continue the stall.

165
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:02,612
Do you think it’s wrong?

166
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,000
I have a bachelor’s degree.

167
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:10,204
But in the end, I’m still a chicken meat vendor.

168
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:15,423
Hey.

169
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:18,000
I don’t think it’s wrong.

170
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:19,471
Don’t be dramatic.

171
00:17:19,814 --> 00:17:21,685
I myself want to run a Chicken Rice diner.

172
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,977
I’m serious.

173
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:30,906
You’re right.

174
00:17:31,123 --> 00:17:32,874
Uncle Jim, let’s go.

175
00:17:35,062 --> 00:17:39,240
I’ll bring the car here so that you don’t have to walk a long way.

176
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:40,884
I’ll catch up with you.

177
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:55,116
I’m sorry about Mrs. Hong.

178
00:17:58,998 --> 00:17:59,830
Yes.

179
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:06,361
Thank you so much for helping out at the funeral every day.

180
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:12,889
Damn it.

181
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:15,677
There’re many spots available. Why here?

182
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,360
Stop complaining.

183
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,055
I’m gonna find out whose car it is.

184
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:21,329
Do you know whose car it is?

185
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:22,569
No, I don’t.

186
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,880
The Moonlight Chicken diner will open for the last time tonight.

187
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:29,527
Do you want to join the farewell party?

188
00:18:58,225 --> 00:18:59,583
I think I’m good.

189
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:03,468
Have fun at the party.

190
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:11,758
Come down here. It’s hot.

191
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:12,718
Let’s go.

192
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:14,043
Okay.

193
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,395
Anyone want my special recipe Chicken Rice?

194
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:22,266
You mean your haphazard recipe?

195
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:23,800
Haphazard, my ass.

196
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,068
Let me help.

197
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:27,725
Here.

198
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,060
My recipe is to mix the sauce with the rice.

199
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,634
Keep mixing it. The more sauce we add, the more mouthwatering it gets.

200
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,072
That looks just like monk’s food.

201
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:41,089
Why don’t you pour the soup on it too?

202
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:43,799
Damn you, Li.

203
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,273
So?

204
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,256
Good, isn’t it?

205
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:55,532
I told you, Leng.

206
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,195
You always brag about this recipe.

207
00:19:58,195 --> 00:19:59,879
But no one likes it.

208
00:20:03,573 --> 00:20:05,573
Do you want

209
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:07,334
to try

210
00:20:07,521 --> 00:20:08,947
chopping the chicken?

211
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:14,960
Why don’t you try my recipe first?

212
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,047
I told you it’s haphazard.

213
00:21:30,142 --> 00:21:31,448
Yes, right there.

214
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:32,890
Now let’s count it down.

215
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,292
Five, four, three, two, one.

216
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,281
Hey.

217
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,840
These pictures,

218
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:19,452
which box should I put them in?

219
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:22,799
Leave them here, Jeab.

220
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,764
We don’t need to take them.

221
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:26,095
Are you sure?

222
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:30,087
Yeah. I don’t know where to keep them anyway.

223
00:22:34,114 --> 00:22:35,384
Up to you then.

224
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:39,890
So what time are you going to the doctor to take the cast off?

225
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,910
During this initial phase, please do not take heavy steps.

226
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:52,945
But you’ll get used to it in no time.

227
00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:53,823
Sure.

228
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:54,991
Thank you.

229
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:55,733
Of course.

230
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:57,279
I’ll take it from here.

231
00:22:58,341 --> 00:22:59,898
Would you please excuse me then?

232
00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:00,555
Sure.

233
00:23:00,555 --> 00:23:01,321
Thank you.

234
00:23:01,587 --> 00:23:02,776
Here. Let me help.

235
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:10,925
Wen.

236
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:11,712
Hm?

237
00:23:16,002 --> 00:23:17,519
You don’t have to help me anymore.

238
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:19,321
I can walk myself now.

239
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:24,184
Hey, but I think…

240
00:23:27,814 --> 00:23:29,255
I can really walk on my own.

241
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:31,767
Trust me.

242
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:40,913
Bye now.

243
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,658
This is it, ma’am.

244
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:03,255
It’s a university like what we have in our country.

245
00:24:04,117 --> 00:24:06,117
But particularly for deaf people.

246
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:08,401
That’s great.

247
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:14,027
There’s the Faculty of Engineering that Heart wants to join too.

248
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,210
Oh, yeah?

249
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,524
If we don’t try, we’ll never know.

250
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:55,117
I’ll talk to my husband later.

251
00:24:57,107 --> 00:25:01,555
If you need more information on this, I’ll be happy to help.

252
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:08,275
Stay for dinner.

253
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,321
You can help me explain this to him.

254
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:13,439
Ah, sure.

255
00:25:31,692 --> 00:25:34,772
Don’t be home so late.

256
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:49,985
[Li Ming’s and Heart’s offerings.]

257
00:26:56,576 --> 00:26:57,450
Hey.

258
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:05,008
I used to work as a lion dancer.

259
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,110
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

260
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,072
Long time no see.

261
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:17,336
Can I borrow this for a second?

262
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:17,958
Of course.

263
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:20,263
You haven’t been around that much lately.

264
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,666
My uncle’s making me work my ass off.

265
00:27:22,704 --> 00:27:24,091
Come visit sometimes.

266
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:25,016
Of course.

267
00:27:25,016 --> 00:27:26,300
All right. Should we do this?

268
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:28,116
Let’s try it. See if you can still do it.

269
00:27:28,116 --> 00:27:28,808
Okay.

270
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,230
[Have you had a boyfriend before?]

271
00:28:31,594 --> 00:28:33,594
[Never. You?]

272
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:40,933
[No.]

273
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:46,657
[What do you think having a boyfriend is like?]

274
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:49,160
[Like this, perhaps.]

275
00:29:13,572 --> 00:29:14,287
Hey.

276
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,374
Read my lips.

277
00:29:21,528 --> 00:29:22,376
Boyfriend.

278
00:29:27,219 --> 00:29:28,059
Boyfriend.

279
00:29:55,872 --> 00:29:56,740
Here.

280
00:29:57,872 --> 00:30:00,046
This cup is surely yours.

281
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:01,451
I bought it for you.

282
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:19,772
Are you tired, Uncle Jim?

283
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:32,112
I am.

284
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,091
But I’m used to it.

285
00:30:34,975 --> 00:30:36,741
It used to be more tiring back in old days and I got through it.

286
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,680
When I have a job, I’ll pay you back every baht I spent.

287
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,457
What, Uncle Jim?

288
00:31:06,738 --> 00:31:08,212
When did you know yourself?

289
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:12,089
What kind of question?

290
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,182
I don't know.

291
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:21,092
But I didn’t copy you for sure.

292
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:31,016
I’m glad you realize what you like.

293
00:31:32,193 --> 00:31:35,209
And please know that you do nothing wrong.

294
00:31:40,374 --> 00:31:46,827
From now on, your life might not be easy.

295
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:50,564
Don’t worry about me.

296
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:54,651
Love isn’t that big of a deal.

297
00:31:56,557 --> 00:32:00,212
Earning money for a living is much more important.

298
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,772
But if you’d chosen to stay with some other relatives,

299
00:32:11,582 --> 00:32:13,582
your life might have been better.

300
00:32:15,303 --> 00:32:16,243
No.

301
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:20,454
Staying with you

302
00:32:22,662 --> 00:32:23,904
is the best.

303
00:32:30,257 --> 00:32:31,458
Thank you, Uncle Jim,

304
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:34,199
for everything.

305
00:32:41,132 --> 00:32:42,481
Thank you too.

306
00:32:44,186 --> 00:32:45,401
For what?

307
00:32:46,443 --> 00:32:51,472
For teaching me to be more mature even though you’re still a kid.

308
00:32:56,906 --> 00:32:57,693
I’m out of here.

309

I love you, Uncle.

These are the hands that have made Chicken Rice for almost 10 years.

311
00:33:40,907 --> 00:33:43,193
I sometimes feel envious of Li Ming

312
00:33:43,829 --> 00:33:46,089
for knowing what his dream is.

313
00:33:47,763 --> 00:33:51,195
Don't you want to sell Chicken Rice anymore?

314
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:59,241
Li Ming asked me if it was really my dream.

315
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:05,528
Come to think of it.

316
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:07,872
I don’t even know the answer.

317
00:34:10,478 --> 00:34:14,772
I have no idea if I do what I do because I love it

318
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,720
or I just don’t know how to do anything else.

319
00:34:23,544 --> 00:34:25,336
You can think now.

320
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,643
What do you want to do?

321
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,429
Without knowing it,

322
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:35,865
life tells you there’s too late to dream.

323
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:39,204
We’re free to dream anytime, Uncle Jim.

324
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,938
Without money,

325
00:34:48,011 --> 00:34:49,594
dreams can be tough.

326
00:34:54,531 --> 00:34:55,802
I have an amount of money.

327
00:34:57,156 --> 00:35:00,359
Whatever you want to do, just let me know.

328
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:04,772
If it’s interesting, I can be your investor.

329
00:35:23,698 --> 00:35:25,255
I actually

330
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:27,576
have a fund.

331
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:31,026
Are you serious?

332
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:33,478
It’s been with you forever, hasn’t it?

333
00:35:36,258 --> 00:35:37,841
It’s been with me for so long.

334
00:35:39,072 --> 00:35:40,447
That’s why I want to sell it.

335
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:53,861
Can you help take a picture of me and the truck?

336
00:36:04,006 --> 00:36:05,015
Sit down, please.

337
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:12,177
Smile handsomely.

338
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:16,697
One, two, three.

339
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:21,399
One, two, three.

340
00:36:25,013 --> 00:36:25,976
Come on, Uncle Jim.

341
00:36:27,512 --> 00:36:28,757
Let’s take some pictures.

342
00:36:30,418 --> 00:36:31,497
With me or the car?

343
00:36:32,018 --> 00:36:32,939
Both–duh!

344
00:36:35,168 --> 00:36:36,934
One, two.

345
00:36:44,973 --> 00:36:49,043
The Marina Food Court project is 80% complete.

346
00:36:49,043 --> 00:36:52,139
Next week, you can inform the tenants to decorate their shops.
[ TWO MONTHS LATER ]

347
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,225
I’ll give you two thumbs up.

348
00:36:57,577 --> 00:36:59,459
You never disappoint me.

349
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:02,506
It was two weeks behind the schedule yet you managed to put it back on track.

350
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:04,857
Thanks to the foremen.

351
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:06,705
Give them a big bonus, please.

352
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,558
I felt so bad for pushing them so much.

353
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:10,749
All right. You got it.

354
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:16,203
And what about the Marina project in Rayong province?

355
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:19,946
If we don’t postpone it, the timeline will be really tight.

356
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:22,517
Well, Boss says we can so we can.

357
00:37:23,404 --> 00:37:25,404
I have no idea how he did it.

358
00:37:25,851 --> 00:37:27,499
He got the license so quickly.

359
00:37:30,586 --> 00:37:31,888
Hey, Wen.

360
00:37:32,212 --> 00:37:34,463
For this project, you're coming with me.

361
00:37:35,058 --> 00:37:37,141
You’ll get at least 30% of your salary for extra.

362
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:39,537
Me?

363
00:37:40,572 --> 00:37:41,652
In Rayong?

364
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:42,260
Yes.

365
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,222
No one is in charge of this project.

366
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:45,805
You can do it. Trust me.

367
00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:54,364
Hey, Wen just got a loan to buy his new condo.

368
00:37:54,364 --> 00:37:55,522
Are you moving him now?

369
00:37:56,513 --> 00:37:57,437
Right.

370
00:38:03,098 --> 00:38:04,104
I have a solution.

371
00:38:04,732 --> 00:38:05,415
What?

372
00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:07,625
I go instead.

373
00:38:10,544 --> 00:38:11,517
I have a solution too.

374
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,506
You stay at Wen’s condo.

375
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:15,947
Come on.

376
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:17,132
Here.

377
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:20,238
Read your promotion letter.

378
00:38:20,802 --> 00:38:22,802
Let me know later what you think.

379
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,271
Is there another one?

380
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:27,881
You, shut it.

381
00:38:27,881 --> 00:38:28,863
There’s just one.
[Job Promotion Letter]
[You have been promoted from Art Director to Project Manager.]

382
00:38:28,863 --> 00:38:31,104
[Job Promotion Letter]
[You have been promoted from Art Director to Project Manager.]

383
00:38:55,472 --> 00:38:56,752
It’s okay.

384
00:39:00,126 --> 00:39:01,177
We still got time.

385
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,142
It’s all right.

386
00:39:12,632 --> 00:39:13,600
Don’t worry.

387
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:15,510
I will be

388
00:39:16,793 --> 00:39:17,939
the subtitle

389
00:39:18,394 --> 00:39:19,318
for you.

390
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,698
You have to sign here as well.

391
00:39:44,155 --> 00:39:45,513
All right.

392
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:46,479
This.

393
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:47,376
You can use it.

394
00:39:47,376 --> 00:39:47,876
Okay.

395
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,417
Right here?

396
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:50,210
Yes, sir.

397
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:54,354
Right here, too.

398
00:39:54,354 --> 00:39:55,250
Okay.

399
00:39:57,903 --> 00:39:58,862
Okay, then.

400
00:39:58,862 --> 00:39:59,514
All right.

401
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,852
I think we’re all set here, Mr. Gaipa.

402
00:40:07,136 --> 00:40:07,687
Sure

403
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:13,255
I’m sorry the headquarter asked for more documents.

404
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:16,065
That’s totally fine.

405
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:20,252
Please take it from here, Mr. Alan.

406
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:21,148
Of course.

407
00:40:24,114 --> 00:40:24,991
How refreshing.

408
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:25,658
Right.

409
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,006
May you please excuse me now?

410
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:29,675
Mr. Gaipa.

411
00:40:30,296 --> 00:40:30,812
Yes.

412
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,080
I just changed my phone number.

413
00:40:37,446 --> 00:40:38,991
Can I please have your chat ID?

414
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:41,007
Yes?

415
00:40:41,252 --> 00:40:43,601
In case the headquarter asks for more documents.

416
00:40:44,185 --> 00:40:46,185
You can just take a photo and send it to me.

417
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,750
Ah, of course.

418
00:40:52,837 --> 00:40:53,618
QR code.

419
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,292
Yes.

420
00:40:57,128 --> 00:40:58,362
Let me scan it.

421
00:41:00,411 --> 00:41:01,120
We got it.

422
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,080
Okay then.

423
00:41:02,689 --> 00:41:06,573
If we’re done here, I’ll be on my way.

424
00:41:06,573 --> 00:41:07,733
Sure. Have a great day.

425
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:08,861
Thank you.

426
00:41:08,861 --> 00:41:09,697
Thanks for your hard work.

427
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:11,662
- No problem. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

428
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,347
Sorry.

429
00:41:14,616 --> 00:41:15,509
I have your pen.

430
00:41:16,638 --> 00:41:18,038
Right.

431
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,259
What’s your order number?

432
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:08,223
A115.

433
00:42:08,377 --> 00:42:09,468
A115.

434
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:12,302
Here you go. Thank you so much.

435
00:42:14,279 --> 00:42:15,032
Uncle Jim.

436
00:42:15,922 --> 00:42:16,858
Hey.

437
00:42:17,145 --> 00:42:17,958
Tired?

438
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:19,415
I’m okay.

439
00:42:21,648 --> 00:42:23,400
Sir, what’s your order number?

440
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,326
A116.

441
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,966
A116?

442
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:26,808
It’s right there.

443
00:42:27,862 --> 00:42:29,551
Here you go. Thank you.

444
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:33,346
Lots of customers today?

445
00:42:33,971 --> 00:42:35,569
Quite a lot.

446
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:36,389
Yeah?

447
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,396
Your order is ready.

448
00:42:38,612 --> 00:42:40,334
Chicken breast, no skin.

449
00:42:41,887 --> 00:42:45,667
May I get one Chicken Rice with extra bazooka skin, please?

450
00:42:46,493 --> 00:42:47,726
- Leng.
- Wow.

451
00:42:47,726 --> 00:42:53,012
Customer, why don’t you go buy Fried Chicken Skin instead of Chicken Rice?

452
00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:54,675
Oh, please.

453
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:57,412
Why wasn’t your diner looking this cool back then?

454
00:42:57,412 --> 00:42:58,255
None of your biz.

455
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:01,214
Very nice mouth.

456
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:02,893
Want some water?

457
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:04,081
Thank you.

458
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:07,011
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

459
00:43:07,332 --> 00:43:08,267
Wow.

460
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:11,047
You seem like a pro now.

461
00:43:11,336 --> 00:43:12,251
Uncle Jim,

462
00:43:12,437 --> 00:43:15,716
do you still get any customers who pass out drunk here?

463
00:43:18,543 --> 00:43:19,261
Yeah?

464
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:21,847
And then you guys hook up.

465
00:43:22,923 --> 00:43:25,303
- Damn you!
- Do you?

466
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:27,438
You look more masculine.

467
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,480
Of course.

468
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:29,949
I’m a waterpark staff.

469
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:32,277
I carry swim rings and chase after kids all day.

470
00:43:32,603 --> 00:43:34,066
It’d be weird if I didn’t gain any muscles.

471
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:37,046
Here. Can you see it?

472
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:38,733
Be careful it might hurt your eyes.

473
00:43:38,733 --> 00:43:39,435
Here.

474
00:43:40,224 --> 00:43:43,492
I got the Best Employee award last month so I got the star.

475
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,292
Are you sure you didn’t get it yourself?

476
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:47,021
Call me workplace and ask.

477
00:43:47,123 --> 00:43:49,252
They gave me this from the customers’ votes.

478
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:51,183
Leng, I was joking.

479
00:43:52,862 --> 00:43:54,314
How’s your son Jason?

480
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,353
I asked Praew to quit her job to take care of him.

481
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:58,433
We will take him to a nursery when he’s a little older.

482
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:02,913
Uncle Jim, can I have that apron?

483
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,872
Why?

484
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,642
I want free food.

485
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:09,082
Oh, come on, Leng.

486
00:44:09,732 --> 00:44:11,044
Take it off, Uncle Jim.

487
00:44:11,741 --> 00:44:12,444
Are you serious?

488
00:44:12,444 --> 00:44:12,967
I am.

489
00:44:13,052 --> 00:44:14,033
All right then.

490
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:15,213
Here.

491
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:17,955
Sit down.

492
00:44:18,052 --> 00:44:19,311
Are you giving me an order?

493
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:19,965
Yes.

494
00:44:20,175 --> 00:44:22,092
I’m the one with the biggest apron.

495
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:27,193
Wow! It fits perfectly.

496
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,550
Hey, what is this, Uncle Jim?

497
00:44:32,677 --> 00:44:33,499
What, Leng?

498
00:44:37,267 --> 00:44:38,838
How’s this?

499
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:41,824
Do you like it?

500
00:44:45,244 --> 00:44:46,215
Give me your hand.

501
00:44:47,244 --> 00:44:48,418
Hand, please.

502
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:51,465
I saved up to buy you back this gold necklace.

503
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,444
Here.

504
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:58,068
Next month, I’m taking Praew back to her hometown to get the marriage blessings.

505
00:45:02,813 --> 00:45:05,082
Thank you for trusting me.

506
00:45:06,629 --> 00:45:08,277
Wow, Leng.

507
00:45:08,683 --> 00:45:12,236
I didn’t see you for a while and you’ve become a lot more mature.

508
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:16,353
It’s not much. They just made it look big. Don’t praise me.

509
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:19,110
One Fried Chicken with Rice for takeaway, please?

510
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,815
Oh, come on.

511
00:45:20,815 --> 00:45:22,233
Don’t you see me here?

512
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:22,855
You two stay.

513
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:23,941
One moment, please.

514
00:45:23,941 --> 00:45:25,408
You guys stay here. I’ll take care of that.

515
00:45:28,264 --> 00:45:29,974
I love this truck, Uncle Jim.

516
00:45:31,442 --> 00:45:34,417
I’ve worked here for so long but haven’t got a gold necklace yet.

517
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:35,099
Yes, sir.

518
00:45:35,665 --> 00:45:36,419
Yes, sir.

519
00:45:37,558 --> 00:45:38,452
You want gold.

520
00:45:38,452 --> 00:45:39,141
Yeah.

521
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:40,581
I have one for you.

522
00:45:41,223 --> 00:45:42,012
For real?

523
00:45:42,426 --> 00:45:43,018
Here.

524
00:45:47,884 --> 00:45:48,765
One baht.

525
00:45:52,988 --> 00:45:54,645
Can I get one more baht? I want some candies.

526
00:45:54,645 --> 00:45:56,437
You’re such a greedy man.

527
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,889
Just take it back.

528
00:46:07,497 --> 00:46:08,508
Jam.

529
00:46:11,164 --> 00:46:12,291
Jim!

530
00:46:12,634 --> 00:46:15,372
You came so late. Why didn’t you call so I could go pick you up?

531
00:46:15,688 --> 00:46:17,895
Jam, there’s no problem at all.

532
00:46:17,895 --> 00:46:19,347
Don’t act like I’ve never been here.

533
00:46:20,624 --> 00:46:21,841
Tong.

534
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:22,969
Yes?

535
00:46:28,525 --> 00:46:29,291
Hello.

536
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:30,387
Good evening.

537
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:31,917
You guys must be tired.

538
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:33,358
Come on in and have some food.

539
00:46:33,516 --> 00:46:34,171
Come on.

540
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:35,102
Please.

541
00:46:49,694 --> 00:46:50,859
Jam.

542
00:46:51,694 --> 00:46:52,770
Tong.

543
00:46:56,743 --> 00:46:57,808
This is Wen,

544
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:01,606
my boyfriend.

545
00:47:04,578 --> 00:47:06,578
Hello.

546
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,895
I finally get to meet my brother-in-law in person.

547
00:47:10,776 --> 00:47:13,431
Oh. I’m just his boyfriend.

548
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:17,156
Thank you.

549
00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:20,247
Mom, this is Heart.

550
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,081
Heart,

551
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:25,871
she is my Mom.

552
00:47:25,871 --> 00:47:28,645
And he’s her boyfriend.

553
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:34,532
Hi.

554
00:47:35,012 --> 00:47:36,172
Heart.

555
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,440
His name is Heart.

556
00:47:41,788 --> 00:47:44,616
Gam, have you greeted your guests?

557
00:47:45,289 --> 00:47:47,289
What did I teach you to do?

558
00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:48,666
Good evening.

559
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:50,616
Good girl.

560
00:47:50,616 --> 00:47:53,954
You don’t seem vibrant as when you make your TikTok videos.

561
00:47:54,777 --> 00:47:56,172
She isn’t used to you guys yet.

562
00:47:56,172 --> 00:47:57,263
She’s shy.

563
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,270
Let’s eat.

564
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,379
Everyone, please get started.

565
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:04,212
Eat before the food gets cold.

566
00:48:04,212 --> 00:48:05,522
You want sticky rice? Here.

567
00:48:09,275 --> 00:48:10,792
Looks yummy.

568
00:48:11,053 --> 00:48:13,053
Wen, can you eat this?

569
00:48:13,053 --> 00:48:13,982
I can.

570
00:48:14,571 --> 00:48:16,571
Get that for your boyfriend, Jim.

571
00:48:37,507 --> 00:48:38,662
Your friend,

572
00:48:38,662 --> 00:48:40,404
is he in school?

573
00:48:41,978 --> 00:48:44,806
He finished non-formal education.

574
00:48:44,806 --> 00:48:46,821
High school equivalent.

575
00:48:48,671 --> 00:48:53,332
He’s joining a university for deaf students in America.

576
00:48:53,993 --> 00:48:55,993
Hey. He’s great.

577
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:00,184
I think

578
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:01,860
I'm going with him.

579
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:05,122
To America?

580
00:49:05,372 --> 00:49:06,510
Yes.

581
00:49:07,972 --> 00:49:10,938
To study and work.

582
00:49:13,939 --> 00:49:15,313
And to…

583
00:49:15,313 --> 00:49:17,871
keep him company.

584
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:26,102
And how much money do you need for that?

585
00:49:28,685 --> 00:49:30,685
About a hundred thousand baht.

586
00:49:31,943 --> 00:49:34,771
I’ve saved up some already.

587
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,745
Uncle Jim sold his car and lent me thirty thousand.

588
00:49:41,821 --> 00:49:45,822
I’m also planning to work in the water park with Saleng.

589
00:49:46,702 --> 00:49:48,702
It pays really well, Mom.

590
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:59,301
Oh. In America, people tip generously for your service.

591
00:49:59,301 --> 00:50:01,570
It’s around 1-2 thousand baht per time.

592
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:06,079
If I work and save up, I can get a hundred thousand back in no time.

593
00:50:08,002 --> 00:50:10,002
Heart and I are going together.

594
00:50:10,002 --> 00:50:11,658
I won’t be lonely, Mom.

595
00:50:13,108 --> 00:50:14,453
It’s great.

596
00:50:39,915 --> 00:50:41,071
Heart.

597
00:50:41,726 --> 00:50:42,949
Is he your boyfriend?

598
00:50:52,004 --> 00:50:53,314
Why?

599
00:50:56,299 --> 00:50:57,687
Is it troubling you?

600
00:51:00,654 --> 00:51:02,094
Him being deaf?

601
00:51:02,094 --> 00:51:03,078
Yes.

602
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,654
Honestly, Mom.

603
00:51:08,846 --> 00:51:11,535
I have no problem at all with him being deaf.

604
00:51:13,545 --> 00:51:16,890
He understands everything just like everyone else.

605
00:51:20,261 --> 00:51:22,261
Did you learn sign language?

606
00:51:22,502 --> 00:51:23,868
You seem good at it.

607
00:51:25,029 --> 00:51:27,029
I just started.

608
00:51:27,525 --> 00:51:29,525
I still make mistakes when I use it.

609
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:33,557
We mostly talk through written messages.

610
00:51:39,621 --> 00:51:42,035
Nothing is too difficult, Mom.

611
00:51:50,939 --> 00:51:52,939
I love it when I’m with him.

612
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,857
Mommy.

613
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:01,610
Yes, dear.

614
00:52:03,818 --> 00:52:05,116
What is it?

615
00:52:05,116 --> 00:52:07,759
Heart peeled an orange for me.

616
00:52:07,759 --> 00:52:09,726
How nice of him.

617
00:52:10,396 --> 00:52:11,480
Thank you.

618
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:12,706
Wait.

619
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,382
In sign language,

620
00:52:14,727 --> 00:52:16,012
how do you say thank you?

621
00:52:16,012 --> 00:52:18,282
When you want to say ‘thank you,’ you do this.

622
00:52:21,662 --> 00:52:23,662
This and this.

623
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,417
Right.

624
00:52:26,521 --> 00:52:29,172
Mom said thank you.

625
00:52:32,978 --> 00:52:34,737
He thanks you too.

626
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,360
Ah!

627
00:52:38,861 --> 00:52:41,206
It’s late. You should go to bed.

628
00:52:41,718 --> 00:52:43,235
Let’s go to bed, honey.

629
00:52:58,038 --> 00:52:59,029
Yeah?

630
00:53:01,772 --> 00:53:03,160
Not as cute as you.

631
00:53:05,373 --> 00:53:07,396
You can

632
00:53:07,545 --> 00:53:10,212
say your name

633
00:53:10,677 --> 00:53:12,677
so clearly now.

634
00:53:25,444 --> 00:53:27,444
Your voice

635
00:53:28,047 --> 00:53:29,110
is very

636
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,047
nice.

637
00:53:30,783 --> 00:53:32,783
I want to

638
00:53:33,004 --> 00:53:34,092
hear it

639
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:36,004
more often.

640
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,220
What’s that?

641
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:00,541
Li Ming.

642
00:54:04,993 --> 00:54:06,612
Did you just say my name?

643
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:09,270
My name?

644
00:54:11,029 --> 00:54:12,149
Yes?

645
00:54:12,737 --> 00:54:13,935
Can you say it again?

646
00:54:14,737 --> 00:54:15,918
One more time.

647
00:54:17,873 --> 00:54:19,873
Li Ming.

648
00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:22,598
That’s cute.

649
00:54:23,729 --> 00:54:24,763
Cute.

650
00:55:16,064 --> 00:55:18,581
You finally have a permanent home.

651
00:55:20,566 --> 00:55:21,529
Um.

652
00:55:22,805 --> 00:55:24,980
I hope I don’t have to move again.

653
00:55:30,608 --> 00:55:32,125
Thanks a lot.

654
00:55:33,508 --> 00:55:37,440
I couldn’t have raised Li Ming all alone.

655
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:45,565
I learned maturity from him too, Jam.

656
00:55:52,965 --> 00:55:54,102
Here.

657
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:56,897
Take care of his tuition.

658
00:55:57,311 --> 00:55:58,261
Jam.

659
00:55:59,311 --> 00:56:02,172
Use it as collateral. I’ll pay the installments.

660
00:56:03,476 --> 00:56:04,751
No, Jam.

661
00:56:04,751 --> 00:56:06,732
Tong can get you wrong.

662
00:56:06,732 --> 00:56:08,940
I already talked to him.

663
00:56:14,373 --> 00:56:16,373
Let me perform a mom’s duty for once.

664
00:56:18,267 --> 00:56:21,129
To pay him back for all those times he’d been neglected.

665
00:56:34,482 --> 00:56:35,930
All right then.

666
00:56:36,785 --> 00:56:38,132
I’ll take care of it for you.

667
00:56:46,389 --> 00:56:47,531
Uncle Jim.

668
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:49,228
Uncle Tong asked if you wanted to join us for a beer.

669
00:56:49,228 --> 00:56:50,520
Wanna come?

670
00:56:51,072 --> 00:56:53,552
Don’t complain if all the beer was out.

671
00:56:53,552 --> 00:56:55,150
Come on, Wen!

672
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:56,467
I think he’s drunk.

673
00:56:56,467 --> 00:56:58,428
Wen finishes two cans already.

674
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:01,083
Let’s go.

675
00:57:01,497 --> 00:57:02,593
Come on.

676
00:57:02,593 --> 00:57:04,326
Yes, I’m joining you. Quickly.

677
00:57:13,074 --> 00:57:15,936
If I get…

678
00:57:16,535 --> 00:57:18,914
graduate certificate,

679
00:57:18,914 --> 00:57:20,200
I will send you.

680
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,368
Okay.

681
00:57:21,368 --> 00:57:22,710
When approximately will it be?

682
00:57:23,826 --> 00:57:25,550
Next month.

683
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,072
Okay. Perfect.

684
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:32,192
If the application gets any progress,

685
00:57:32,192 --> 00:57:35,158
I’ll inform you as soon as possible. Right?

686
00:57:35,158 --> 00:57:39,131
And please feel free to ask me about anything anytime.

687
00:57:39,131 --> 00:57:40,123
Okay?

688
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:44,085
Can you please, too, sign the application?

689
00:57:44,551 --> 00:57:45,930
Sign the paper.

690
00:57:46,267 --> 00:57:47,301
My signature, right?

691
00:57:56,243 --> 00:57:58,933
Okay. Let me go make a copy.

692
00:58:03,745 --> 00:58:04,902
Thank you, Uncle Jim.

693
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,229
Thank your mom.

694
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:12,772
Thank you both.

695
00:58:13,342 --> 00:58:16,446
Li Ming, I think you should call her.

696
00:58:22,241 --> 00:58:23,772
Okay.

697
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:27,390
Sign?

698
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:30,079
Yes, you need to sign it too.

699
00:58:39,196 --> 00:58:44,266
I will pay you back every baht you paid.

700
00:58:46,364 --> 00:58:47,536
Don’t worry about it.

701
00:58:55,636 --> 00:58:56,795
Here’s your change.

702
00:58:56,795 --> 00:58:58,212
Thank you.

703
00:59:13,835 --> 00:59:14,816
Alan.

704
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:16,854
What’s up?

705
00:59:17,504 --> 00:59:18,882
Are you here to eat?

706
00:59:21,262 --> 00:59:23,471
I’m here to meet a client for his documents.

707
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:27,404
I’m sorry.

708
00:59:27,404 --> 00:59:29,333
I don’t have time to drop by the bank.

709
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:30,603
It’s fine.

710
00:59:30,603 --> 00:59:32,692
I was just running errands in this area.

711
00:59:32,692 --> 00:59:33,855
Ah, cool.

712
00:59:34,753 --> 00:59:36,492
Do you guys know each other?

713
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,636
This is Wen,

714
00:59:46,413 --> 00:59:47,723
my friend.

715
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:53,787
Uncle Jim.

716
00:59:58,229 --> 00:59:59,884
Would you like to join us for dinner?

717
01:00:04,774 --> 01:00:06,016
Please join us.

718
01:00:08,362 --> 01:00:10,017
We can go over the documents.

719
01:00:12,202 --> 01:00:13,547
Well, then.

720
01:00:14,154 --> 01:00:16,154
Can I have Chicken Rice with no blood cube, please?

721
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,099
Of course.

722
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:18,478
Thank you.

723
01:00:25,294 --> 01:00:26,035
Please.

724
01:00:26,035 --> 01:00:26,772
Sure.

725
01:00:26,772 --> 01:00:28,347
Have you got all the documents needed?

726
01:00:28,347 --> 01:00:29,833
I think so.

727
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:30,945
Can you please…

728
01:00:30,945 --> 01:00:32,080
Sure. May I?

729
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,468
Recheck for me.

730
01:00:34,212 --> 01:00:35,154
May I?

731
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:37,612
A banker, I see.

732
01:00:37,792 --> 01:00:39,309
Hello, sir.

733
01:00:39,309 --> 01:00:40,128
Hello.

734
01:00:40,128 --> 01:00:42,081
Will you get a free credit card if you date him?

735
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:44,532
Date, my ass, Leng!!

736
01:00:44,532 --> 01:00:46,722
Don’t. You’re blushing.

737
01:00:46,722 --> 01:00:48,480
He’s here for my documents.

738
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,240
You’re always furious when you blush.

739
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,281
Leng, come back here.

740
01:00:53,492 --> 01:00:55,492
Don’t poke your nose in their business. Come here.

741
01:00:56,529 --> 01:00:58,529
Goodbye, sir.

742
01:01:00,012 --> 01:01:01,460
Sorry about him.

743
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,621
That’s okay.

744
01:01:02,768 --> 01:01:03,842
Leng, hello.

745
01:01:06,188 --> 01:01:07,666
Wen, hello.

746
01:01:10,781 --> 01:01:11,619
Uncle Jim.

747
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,402
Two Chicken Rices, no offal.

748
01:01:14,402 --> 01:01:15,572
Okay.

749
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:16,889
You got it, Li Ming.

750
01:01:17,134 --> 01:01:18,122
Hello, sir.

751
01:01:18,122 --> 01:01:19,514

I chose to sell Chicken Rice because it’s a simple dish

768
01:02:33,133 --> 01:02:35,031
consisted of four components;

769
01:02:35,031 --> 01:02:38,850
rice, chicken, broth, and sauce.

770
01:02:39,066 --> 01:02:41,583
It might have only four units

771
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:45,230
yet everyone's definition of 'delicious' differs.

772
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:47,200
Some love to eat chicken skin.

773
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,028
Some love chicken thighs.

774
01:02:49,028 --> 01:02:50,822
Some don’t eat it with the sauce at all.

775
01:02:50,822 --> 01:02:53,125
Some love the hot broth.

776
01:02:53,373 --> 01:02:55,787
That’s what makes this simple dish stand out.

01:03:09,907 --> 01:03:15,081

785
01:04:00,135 --> 01:04:01,090
See?

786
01:04:01,849 --> 01:04:04,550
I told you it’s the player.

787
01:04:04,931 --> 01:04:06,237
The DVDs work fine.

788
01:04:08,203 --> 01:04:10,570
I believe now that you don’t give up easily.

789
01:04:14,986 --> 01:04:16,434
Isn’t it good?

790
01:04:18,019 --> 01:04:21,813
If I give up easily, will we have us today?

791
01:04:27,246 --> 01:04:28,170
Come on.

792
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:29,970
Let’s watch your favorite movie.

793
01:05:09,528 --> 01:05:10,588
Uncle Jim.

794
01:05:11,332 --> 01:05:13,514
You said the male lead got together with his fiancée.

795
01:05:14,456 --> 01:05:15,697
I did.

796
01:05:16,475 --> 01:05:19,406
I said he got married to his fiancée.

797
01:05:19,406 --> 01:05:22,621
I didn’t say he didn’t end up with the female lead.

798
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:25,203
If I told you the ending, it wouldn’t be fun.

799
01:05:29,345 --> 01:05:31,104
You’re being a smartass, huh?

800
01:05:36,051 --> 01:05:40,452
Do you get it now why I love this movie?

801
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:54,016
The right love consists of the right person…

802
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,738
and the right time.

803
01:05:58,052 --> 01:05:59,604
At midnight.

804
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,800
At a Chicken Rice diner.

805
01:06:08,283 --> 01:06:09,394
Uncle Jim,

806
01:06:10,463 --> 01:06:11,766
can I sleep on your lap?

807
01:06:30,693 --> 01:06:31,720
Uncle Jim.

808
01:06:32,927 --> 01:06:34,590
You’ve become more romantic.

809
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,573
Isn’t it good?

810
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:40,881
Hm?

811
01:07:00,674 --> 01:07:04,399
Aren’t you tired of eating chicken every day?

812
01:07:07,258 --> 01:07:08,285
No.

813
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:11,892
Are you?

814
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,730
What are you referring to?

815
01:07:18,704 --> 01:07:20,532
The chicken or the uncle?

816
01:07:29,621 --> 01:07:34,212
If you mean the chicken, I must admit I’m tired of it sometimes.

817
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:37,082
The uncle, however,

818
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:42,053
I’m never tired of him.

819
01:07:46,418 --> 01:07:48,659
You might get tired of him in the future.

820
01:08:00,735 --> 01:08:02,149
Don’t think so.

821
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:06,576
I’ll never get tired of the uncle.

822
01:08:10,212 --> 01:08:12,212
I’m tired of going out to theme parks.

823
01:08:12,817 --> 01:08:14,369
Maybe I’m already old.

824
01:08:15,796 --> 01:08:17,796
I just want to stay home.

827
01:09:37,391 --> 01:09:38,977
You just want to be my employee?

828
01:09:39,686 --> 01:09:40,849
What else can I be?

829
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:44,653
Boyfriend.

830
01:09:45,361 --> 01:09:46,671
The seller’s boyfriend.

831
01:09:51,243 --> 01:09:52,409
What did you say?

832
01:09:52,995 --> 01:09:54,588
It wasn’t very clear.

833
01:10:16,246 --> 01:10:17,556
Clear enough now?
