00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,647
EPISODE 13

4
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,484
You...

5
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,236
will never be King.

6
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,405
Why can't the fifth son be the King

7
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,867
when the mere eighth son tries to become
the crown prince?

8
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,705
Could you go as far
as to killing His Majesty?

9
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,167
Listen to my words
while you can still breathe.

10
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,920
I will get the Crown Prince under my thumb

11
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,882
and make sure to become
the real power behind the throne.

12
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,886
That means Nam Jeon isn't his only target.

13
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,305
He wants to turn this country upside down.

14
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,810
Your Highness' country.
The country of the abandoned.

15
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,436
I wished to see it with you.

16
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,232
You wish to see my kingdom?

17
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,444
A battlefield for Nam Jeon and Bang-won.

18
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,154
It's time we need it.

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,369
You just watch it

20
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,829
in your grave.

21
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,747
Watch who will be

22
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,999
the King.

23
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,379
Bang-won lives and dies for justification.

24
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,258
I desperately live

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,968
to live.

26
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,308
It's true that I never expected
any form of apology.

27
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,395
Still, how can you be so proud
of your actions?

28
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,482
How?

29
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,944
I dreamed of a nation
ruled by the subjects. That's all.

30
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,572
And that dream

31
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,117
wasn't one that needed
anyone's permission.

32
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,496
It was solely mine to fantasize.

33
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,494
It's best not to torture yourself forever

34
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,247
for killing a friend's father.

35
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,208
It's how I lived

36
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,169
after killing Poeun.

37
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,839
The guilt is unbearable.

38
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,941
I should be by His Majesty's side.

39
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,401
No one would dare hurt him.

40
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,279
Your Royal Majesty,
it is too dangerous to leave.

41
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,120
Your Royal Majesty.

42
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,397
You killed him.

43
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,400
It was not my doing.

44
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,237
Because of your greed,

45
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,241
because you tried to protect
your throne so badly,

46
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,619
you made your children fight each other

47
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,331
and you enjoyed watching it.

48
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,001
And this is the result.

49
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,171
If you are human,

50
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,009
how could you kill your own brother?

51
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,725
You will die...

52
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,191
a lonely death...

53
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,862
amidst the hatred of everyone.

54
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,248
Look at you weeping so sadly here,

55
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,917
as if you want others to see it.

56
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,462
Even I was almost fooled.

57
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,926
I suppose the people will cry with you.

58
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,512
And as for me,

59
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,432
I will be criticized for my heinous act
once again.

60
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,185
You sure never let me down.

61
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,022
What do you even know

62
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:11,277
about what it feels like
for a father to lose his child?

63
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,862
Right, I know nothing.

64
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,533
However, I do know
that your tears are insincere.

65
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,871
You speak about sincerity
even when it comes to tears.

66
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,582
There is only one occasion

67
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,918
when you'd cry sincere tears.

68
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,671
I know

69
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,049
when that is.

70
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,761
When?

71
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,888
When you lose

72
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,432
your kingdom.

73
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:48,439
That day, I will be sure to witness it
with my own two eyes.

74
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:56,405
You breaking down in tears
and looking much more devastated

75
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,537
than a father who just lost his child.

76
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,865
Do not run away.

77
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,202
And do not say
that you weren't expecting it.

78
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,454
I had to kill my brother

79
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,998
to take my father down.

80
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,085
I don't know what I've done.

81
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,839
Too many people have died

82
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,218
or gotten injured
just for me to get my revenge.

83
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,679
It was no one's fault.

84
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,850
We did what we had to do.

85
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,394
You got your revenge,

86
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,231
and I started a revolution.

87
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,608
For what?

88
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,200
For whom?

89
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,495
I am standing

90
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,290
for I must endure

91
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,793
and get through this.

92
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,926
Hence,

93
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,346
you must rise again.

94
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,932
For yourself

95
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:48,934
as well as

96
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,563
for me.

97
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,816
I am exhausted.

98
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,238
I wish to rest now.

99
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,847
He's been taking medication
more toxic than the poison itself

100
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,140
to stop it from spreading.

101
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,310
I have no idea how he endured
the pain of his intestines rotting away.

102
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,953
I heard you blocked His Majesty's way.

103
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,956
Thanks to you, we could buy some time.

104
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:56,210
I will reward you separately
for your contribution.

105
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,299
Please reward me now.

106
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,679
Please...

107
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,306
let Hwi go now.

108
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,768
Has he ever been mine?

109
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,687
Do not get attached.

110
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,691
Our emotions

111
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,110
can't be controlled.

112
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,964
The hunt has begun.

113
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,300
Don't even step out.
The moment you step out,

114
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,759
you'll die.

115
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,596
Just leave me alone.

116
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,611
It's all over now.

117
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,989
So you should leave too.

118
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,451
Go back to where you came from.

119
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,250
A warrior may be abandoned by his master,

120
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,252
but he never deserts his master first.

121
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,297
So you'd better survive.

122
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,257
Stop whining.

123
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,770
Mother.

124
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,982
You will now be officially called
the former Queen

125
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,443
instead of your posthumous title.

126
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,530
It's incredible news, isn't it?

127
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,201
But the thing is,

128
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,417
how much more blood
must I douse myself with

129
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,172
in order to create the world
I am dreaming of?

130
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,592
I...

131
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,138
can't even fathom.

132
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,604
Mother.

133
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,192
My son

134
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,737
killed another son of mine.

135
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,075
Then as a father,

136
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,704
must I get back at my own son

137
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,916
for killing my child?

138
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,793
Or...

139
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,422
do nothing but wail

140
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,676
like a beast that has lost its cub?

141
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,110
Where is Bang-beon?

142
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,070
He's been arrested.

143
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,116
It was a long night.

144
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,869
Now,

145
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,209
I shall tend to matters that need
to be looked after during the daytime.

146
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,118
Now that Bang-seok is dead,

147
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,704
Bang-beon must be your next target.

148
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,207
I am sorry to admit it, but yes.

149
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,630
You must stop.

150
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,673
Then try and stop me.

151
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,761
Killing my own brother
is considered a heinous act,

152
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,098
and killing a meritorious subject
is also considered a grave crime.

153
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,225
So why hesitate?

154
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,020
Here.

155
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,272
Shoot.

156
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,317
I will die with a smile on my face.

157
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,240
What is making Your Majesty hesitate?
Shoot me now!

158
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,167
You have turned

159
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,254
into a monster.

160
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,384
All I did

161
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,179
was trying to survive.

162
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,475
You wanted to make this throne yours.

163
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,646
Thus, you came up with excuses
and ways to justify it

164
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,314
and finally caused a bloodbath.

165
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,150
Am I not allowed...

166
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,864
to covet the throne?

167
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,366
A king

168
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,453
must embrace and protect
those who are weaker than him

169
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,747
and let go of those
who are stronger than him.

170
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,291
However,

171
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,502
you desert those who are weaker than you

172
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,838
and destroy those who are stronger
just to control them.

173
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,173
That is why you mustn't be King.

174
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,967
I cannot let you take the throne

175
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,929
for I do not see anything else
but bloodlust in you.

176
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,890
The bloodshed

177
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,727
will begin at the palace
and take the lives of disloyal subjects,

178
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,022
only to stop right before the people.

179
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,817
That blood will strengthen
the King's power,

180
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,821
which, in turn, will help the people
enjoy more comfortable lives.

181
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,781
That blood

182
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,620
should have been yours.

183
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,380
Bang-gwa should be

184
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,425
installed as the new Crown Prince.

185
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:23,222
You must step down as soon as
he is installed as the Crown Prince

186
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,308
and just be...

187
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,854
the former king.

188
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,315
In your royal order,

189
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,319
you must admit your fault for violating
the rules of primogeniture

190
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,072
and choosing your young son of a concubine

191
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:45,702
and state that Sambong and Nam Jeon
instigated you to make such a decision.

192
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,043
Your Majesty's kingdom

193
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,796
no longer...

194
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,012
exists.

195
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,701
You are wrong.

196
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,912
This kingdom...

197
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,627
is still mine.

198
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,108
TRAITOR NAM JEON

199
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,379
He'll cause trouble if we spare his life.

200
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,717
From now on, we must be selective
about whom we will kill.

201
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,470
So let's wait and see.

202
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,779
Do you remember?

203
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,658
"Do not let anyone oppress you.

204
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,119
That's the only way you won't collapse."

205
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,790
"Don't let anyone intimidate you
even if they're stronger than you.

206
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,418
Only then can you hold out."

207
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,420
I remember, of course.

208
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,551
Your father told me that.

209
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,807
He saved me from Ganggae.

210
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,685
Thanks to him, I could survive.

211
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,565
And I've been able to hold out
all these years thanks to his words.

212
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,026
Why are you telling me this just now?

213
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,736
I didn't want you to think

214
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,448
that I like you because
I feel indebted to your father.

215
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,036
It's all you.

216
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,996
I mean it.

217
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,502
From now on,

218
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,838
don't get hurt or sick.

219
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,257
Let's live like that.

220
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,421
It's where

221
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,507
Seon-ho is.

222
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,221
I figured you'd be worried.

223
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,408
You lived like you were
on top of the world.

224
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,204
Now you're dead,
you own one mere span of ground.

225
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,210
It serves you right.

226
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,714
It...

227
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,425
serves you right.

228
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,224
You did well.

229
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:43,935
You did...

230
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,356
more than enough.

231
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,695
I did well?

232
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,034
I did more than enough?

233
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,288
Are you sure?

234
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,243
Let go.

235
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,458
What do you want from me?

236
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,128
This is what you wanted.

237
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,466
Do you want to see me wrecked?
Will that make you feel better?

238
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,888
Why...

239
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,977
Why can't I even freely kill myself?

240
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:12,982
Why?

241
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,488
Now, I'm sick and tired
of seeing you and thinking about you.

242
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,199
So go away.

243
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,744
Please.

244
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,644
Live.

245
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,149
That's one last favor I ask you.

246
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,129
To me, every day was like a battle
and the pit of hell.

247
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,632
All the mockery and contempt.

248
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,677
I barely managed to make it here
after enduring all that.

249
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,609
My country is already dead!

250
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,821
So who cares
about immorality and conspiracy?

251
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,333
Did you have a lucky dream last night?

252
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,127
I think you'll live.

253
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,087
Mun-bok.

254
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,131
Hold on.

255
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,689
Hey.

256
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,649
What's going on?

257
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,651
You should take a look at him.

258
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,867
Oh, my. There's a hole.

259
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,619
You fool.

260
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,287
You're the one who should be lying down.

261
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,663
It's fine.

262
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,332
Take care of that guy first.

263
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,708
Stay still. Let me look.

264
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,754
I'm sorry, Jeong Beom.

265
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,507
I'm sorry, everyone.

266
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,509
This is all my fault.

267
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,470
Hey.

268
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,056
Once I acquired my position,

269
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,768
I realized
why you risked your life to fight

270
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,146
after becoming a lieutenant.

271
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,733
You were trying to save
every possible life.

272
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,737
You didn't want to see us dead,

273
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,156
so you tried so hard.

274
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,867
You're that kind of man.

275
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,787
You don't need to apologize.

276
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,000
Stay still.

277
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,210
It hurts, doesn't it?

278
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,420
It pains me too.

279
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,517
We should send them off.

280
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,667
May your soul rest in peace.

281
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,468
Gosh, I thought we might have to spend
the whole night burning those.

282
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,928
There are so many.

283
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,223
Of course there are many.
Hundreds of people died.

284
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,101
May all your souls rest in peace.

285
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,980
I'm so sick and tired of this.

286
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,482
Until when do I have to see this?

287
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,323
I can't believe this.
Did you get only one bottle of this?

288
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,784
Live up to your big belly, punk.

289
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,996
If you're so bold,
let me see what you took.

290
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,210
You want a piece of me?

291
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,838
Calm down.

292
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,591
You guys are funny.

293
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,386
When you quit being a soldier,
will you teach children?

294
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,638
Yes, I will.

295
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,433
I wonder what you will teach to children.

296
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,727
How to live as a virgin?

297
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,020
No.

298
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,355
He will teach them
how to fly over the clouds.

299
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,818
I will teach them how to survive.

300
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,532
I have only been teaching how to kill.

301
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,161
Because I thought

302
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,623
killing others was
the only way to survive.

303
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,376
But now I know.

304
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,629
Killing...

305
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,215
kills me too.

306
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,137
What is he saying?

307
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,764
I don't know. It sounds difficult.

308
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,224
I can hear you.

309
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,477
Chi-do, here's what I'm going to do.

310
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,314
I'm going to make a medicine
that makes your hair grow.

311
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,857
I'm going to make that.

312
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,528
And I'm going to sell that
to the Japanese and the Chinese.

313
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,447
I don't know what I should do
with all the money I will earn.

314
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,242
Who would pay you for that?

315
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,410
You're losing hair too. Here.

316
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,370
Come on.

317
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,374
What about you, Hwi?

318
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:30,962
I don't want to see anyone
getting hurt or sick anymore.

319
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,632
I want to see smiles.

320
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,093
I want to see you smile

321
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,886
and Hui-jae too.

322
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,472
And...

323
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,100
I envy Bang-won.

324
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,355
The world is afraid of him
even when he just raises his eyebrow.

325
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,942
No one can stop him
when he enters the palace with his sword.

326
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,529
That's the life.

327
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,324
I'm jealous.

328
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,911
Sir.

329
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,540
Can you do something about your hair?

330
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,792
You're not a shaggy dog.

331
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,461
I was born an outcast,

332
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,923
so I can't put my hair up in a topknot
before having a child.

333
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,427
Until when do I have to be a spy?

334
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,596
As much as possible.

335
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,473
I'll end up dead.

336
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,142
I'll let you have a topknot
before you die.

337
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,312
So, why are you here?

338
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,065
I found

339
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,692
Nam Seon-ho.

340
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,539
Now, it's my time to start moving.

341
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,877
If Bang-won can stir up this world,
so can I.

342
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,549
Let's go grab a weapon.

343
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,473
Hey, Inspector Nam.

344
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,600
Goodness.

345
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,814
Your handsome face has become so thin now.

346
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,989
So, did your father's funeral go well?

347
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,043
You leaving after I have just sat down
will only embarrass me.

348
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,837
What do you want?

349
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,046
What's life anyway?

350
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,591
Isn't it about those lonely
keeping each other company?

351
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,845
That's why I wanted to offer you my help.

352
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:27,888
In what way?

353
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,106
Your revenge.

354
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,278
Bang-won slayed your father
which makes him your enemy.

355
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,531
A man should not be in one's debt.

356
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,284
You should pay him back for what you got.

357
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,458
If I get back out there this time,

358
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,336
no one will be able to handle me,

359
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,466
so fight to the death yourselves
for all I care.

360
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,935
How formidable.

361
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,479
You just charmed my socks off.

362
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,131
The son of a traitor

363
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,467
dares to live.

364
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,969
Come on. Let's go and cash him in.

365
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,641
Former associate commander, Cho Sa-ui.

366
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,437
Senior second rank of
the Department of State Affairs, Lee Yeom.

367
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,231
Lord Wanseong, Lee Baek-yu.

368
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,484
Senior fourth rank of
the Ministry of Personnel, Lee Jo.

369
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,071
Lock them up in the military prison.

370
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,168
Nam Seon-ho.

371
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,428
Let him go.

372
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,347
You slayed two of Sambong's children

373
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:19,143
and sent his eldest son to war
after beating him,

374
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,521
so why are you letting me go?

375
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,274
Thanks to you provoking the King,

376
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,776
my revolution became a success,

377
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,237
so call it a reward.

378
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,034
A revolution?

379
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,497
Killing your own brothers to be King

380
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,582
is a sin, not a revolution.

381
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,628
Discriminating against
illegitimate children

382
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,298
is a deep-rooted evil, not a revolution.

383
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:53,677
The fact that I discriminate against them
is what saved your life.

384
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:58,766
You are not Nam Jeon's son,
just an illegitimate offspring.

385
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,811
It's why you're not even worth killing.

386
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,855
Bang-won!

387
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,486
Live.

388
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,530
Live...

389
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,951
and watch with your two eyes
how I build my own nation.

390
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,872
That's all you can possibly do now

391
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,083
in my world.

392
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,921
You're right.

393
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,340
My world is over,

394
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,133
but...

395
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,638
whatever it takes
I will take everything from you.

396
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,021
I will make sure you regret
not killing me.

397
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,108
Regret?

398
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,342
Regret...

399
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,762
is...

400
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:25,269
just an excuse for the weak.

401
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,610
I will come back...

402
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,822
for your neck.

403
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,833
He even owns the palace guards?

404
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,670
All that's left are the 50 men
under my command.

405
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,508
I need a weapon.

406
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,427
Shall I summon Nam Seon-ho?

407
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,473
No, his sword is already broken.

408
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,642
I'm done with him.

409
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,099
If you're willing to start over,

410
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,226
I have a plan.

411
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,025
At the Northeastern Township,

412
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,487
Jurchen members of Gabyeolcho
still remain.

413
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,781
They have disbanded,

414
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,283
but they're still as brutal and sharp.

415
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,202
How do I get them on my side?

416
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,121
Jurchens follow the command

417
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,914
of their deputy chief once the chief dies.

418
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,499
And if they both die?

419
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,042
They will surrender.

420
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,461
You slay the chief,

421
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,255
I'll kill its deputy.

422
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,509
Bang-won slayed your father
which makes him your enemy.

423
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,387
A man should not be in one's debt.

424
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,681
You should pay him back for what you got.

425
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,269
Use Bang-gan to take down Bang-won.

426
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,522
To the Northeastern Township we go.

427
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,038
Prince Muan, Bang-beon,

428
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,082
was slayed while in exile.

429
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,503
Should we take care of the rest too?

430
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,594
Before this night is over,

431
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,599
kill them.

432
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:25,574
Transportation, beacon fires,
and messengers were all cut off?

433
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,661
"Orders couldn't travel from the palace

434
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,999
which is why troops couldn't be called in.

435
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,211
At the market outside Sajeong Gate,

436
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,924
all the palace guards were slayed?"

437
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:46,261
Build a marketplace outside Sajeong Gate?

438
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,347
Having the Six Ministries

439
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,766
and the Office of the Inspector General
outside Gwanghwamun

440
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,352
is helping the whole area thrive.

441
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,437
If we can do that with the area
outside Sajeong Gate,

442
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,358
the entire city of Hanyang will prosper.

443
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,111
He didn't know it was a trap.

444
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,198
It was a sword that would aim at his neck!

445
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,872
He who laid the trap at Sajeong Gate

446
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:20,254
and those who had the nerve
to block my path... No.

447
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,675
I will punish
all members of private armies

448
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,176
that were involved in the uprising.

449
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,258
You'll end up drunk this way.

450
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,844
Isn't that why one drinks?

451
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,638
What?

452
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:15,726
Are you about to condemn me too?

453
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,231
Go ahead.

454
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,777
I'm worried.

455
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,531
Is this path I'm taking

456
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,660
truly the right one?

457
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,163
Not knowing the answer scares me.

458
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,291
I'm also afraid of those
aiming for my neck.

459
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,335
How history

460
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,130
will remember me

461
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,800
is also something I fear.

462
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,553
That fear will keep you going.

463
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,431
Never

464
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,725
let go of it.

465
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,945
Are you leaving?

466
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:15,369
We're supposed to dig the soil
to plow, sow,

467
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,914
and harvest crops
in order to feed our families.

468
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,710
However, all I've done is bury bodies.

469
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,092
I don't want to live that way anymore.

470
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,597
A nation raised by those abandoned.

471
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,142
I hope your dream comes true.

472
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,773
You wanted me, Your Highness?

473
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,900
I hear that

474
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,862
you killed your master and his son.

475
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:36,742
What now?

476
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,536
Are you done with me

477
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,829
now that you know

478
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:43,749
I killed my master and lived as a robber?

479
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,636
Here is your slave ownership paper.

480
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,558
Your Highness.

481
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,394
He deserved to die.

482
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:12,068
The bonfire seems to have dwindled
if you ask me.

483
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,113
It needs something to burn.

484
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,755
I was born an animal,

485
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,424
but I can die as a human thanks to you.

486
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,844
You may leave me

487
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,806
whenever you want to.

488
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,269
Wanting to keep people by my side...

489
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,357
is me being greedy.

490
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,672
You blocked the King's way.

491
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,091
His Majesty will dig up on this.

492
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,926
Everything will be revealed.

493
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,429
You should hide.

494
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,557
It was my doing, and I shall endure it.

495
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,768
I'm not going anywhere.

496
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,562
Madame Han.

497
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,481
If I run away, Ihwaru will be harmed.

498
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:32,732
However,

499
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,194
if only I take the blame,
Ihwaru will be fine.

500
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,365
That's what I learned from Madame Seo.

501
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,200
And I shall live that way.

502
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,997
The reason I don't tell you to run

503
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,959
is I know that you'll never run away.

504
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,169
So,

505
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,214
don't ever tell me to run away.

506
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,399
The soup's been boiled down
to a paste, you know.

507
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,902
Don't you even care
about those waiting for you?

508
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,535
You're going to the safe first?

509
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,745
You greedy pig!

510
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:27,996
Just

511
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,623
wait right there.

512
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,101
Let's go.

513
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,186
What?

514
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,444
I'm sorry, Madame Han.
This is out of the blue.

515
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,946
What is going on?

516
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,744
For the past 20 years,

517
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,914
this is all money I tenaciously earned

518
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,958
while people calling me greedy.

519
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,128
Are you asking her to look after
because you can't trust me?

520
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,421
Please terminate

521
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,299
Hwa-wol's contract.

522
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,099
I don't want to see her smiling
and dancing in front of other men.

523
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,935
I don't want to see her
suffering from neck pain

524
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,313
because of this heavy hairpiece.

525
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,443
If this isn't enough,

526
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,113
I'll do anything to compensate.

527
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,992
Please terminate the contract. Please.

528
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,159
I beg you, Madame.

529
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,164
We don't have such a thing in Ihwaru.

530
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:55,834
What?

531
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,962
After living such a hard life,

532
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,798
now you're leaving
since you've met someone special.

533
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,801
The contract can't hold you down.

534
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:05,969
So,

535
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,722
I got rid of it.

536
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:37,208
If you add this money,
it'll be enough to get a house.

537
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,047
Thank you, Madame Han.

538
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:54,559
Didn't it hurt to give away your money?

539
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,395
Money means nothing to me.

540
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,235
I had a sister

541
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:08,239
just as beautiful as you.

542
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,700
A cold took her life.

543
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,832
I couldn't even buy her
the most common medicine

544
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,004
which is why I saved up my whole life.

545
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,050
One shouldn't have to die
because of a cold.

546
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,932
Going through all that

547
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:38,645
made me want to give you a life of luxury.

548
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,443
Will you take it off me then?

549
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,724
My goodness.

550
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,144
What a beauty you are.

551
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,604
Even an angel can't hold a candle to you.

552
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:35,994
What are you trying to say?

553
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,079
I'm saying

554
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,332
that we should live together.

555
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,398
You should rest.

556
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,324
The Jurchens only know two things.

557
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,951
Stabbing and slashing.

558
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,537
They do not play defense.

559
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:21,915
If you bring your guard up,

560
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,541
that's all you'll be doing.

561
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,210
So stab and slash as well?

562
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,461
In order to slit his throat,

563
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,796
you'll have to sacrifice an arm.

564
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,345
An arm? Gladly.

565
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,228
Executing my order means

566
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,440
that...

567
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,902
you'll die by Prince Jeongan's hands.

568
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,154
Serving you was an honor, Your Majesty.

569
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,490
Then hear my order.

570
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,832
Kill them all.

571
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,293
I shall oblige, Your Majesty.

572
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:10,713
Move out!

573
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:11,756
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

574
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:30,275
Who knew that you could cook, Hwi?

575
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,695
I know how to make
vegetable side dishes and pickles.

576
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,282
I've been cooking since I was eight.

577
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:41,995
That's amazing.

578
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,290
You're still recovering, so sit down.

579
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,416
I'll soon bring your meal.

580
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:47,375
I'm fine, but...

581
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,295
Hold on. What's gotten into you?

582
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:52,755
You're making me nervous.

583
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,883
I just wanted to treat you
to a home-cooked meal.

584
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,010
That's all.

585
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,315
And why are you being so weird?

586
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,317
Notice anything different?

587
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,651
People are trying to eat here.

588
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,696
You're not a mole, so stop digging.

589
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,448
You'll only end up poking yourself.

590
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,867
Seriously? Have you gone blind?

591
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,452
Is food all you care about?

592
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:23,828
What's gotten into you?

593
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,371
Even I'm satisfied with the news.

594
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,789
Congratulations.

595
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:27,957
See?

596
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,003
It's only one meal.

597
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:35,298
One hearty meal used to make my whole day,

598
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,259
but I had forgotten about that.

599
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:44,015
I don't care about anything as grand as
a nation built by the abandoned.

600
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:47,435
All I want is a home
and a table to eat on.

601
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,147
Living in a place that I can call home

602
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,982
and sharing meals with those I love.

603
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:56,027
Yes, you're right.

604
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,446
I had forgotten about that too.

605
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,577
Run!

606
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,274
It smells delicious.

607
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,193
I should get it to him
before it gets cold.

608
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:54,836
What are you doing here?

609
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,295
I ordered you to go your own ways,

610
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,672
so why are you back here?

611
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,382
Ihwaru's not just yours, you know.

612
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:00,717
It's ours too.

613
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,512
How could we sleep properly
when you're here alone?

614
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,890
It's dangerous here, so leave immediately.

615
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:10,101
You don't own us
which means you can't give orders.

616
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,562
You burned all our contracts, remember?

617
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,188
This was my choice.

618
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,274
The consequences are mine to bear.

619
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:18,067
And this is our choice too.

620
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,902
So--

621
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:27,368
Run!

622
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,467
It was me.

623
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,135
It's me you want.

624
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:45,636
Slay me instead!

625
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,722
Kill them all!

626
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:00,359
They are the palace guards.

627
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,861
It's the King's revenge.

628
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,863
He must have sent them to others as well.

629
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,157
It's bad!

630
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:11,788
Ihwaru...

631
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:21,297
Hui-jae blocked the King's path.
That must be why.

632
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,659
Madame Han.

633
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,073
Hui-jae, stay with me.

634
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,950
Hui-jae!

635
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,717
Identify yourself.

636
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,596
I am Eohachu of Eastern Jurchen,
here to see your chief.

637
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:52,972
For what reason?

638
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,273
Hey.

639
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:16,871
The one with the tiger skin is the chief.

640
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:19,206
The one with the leopard skin
is his deputy.

641
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,503
Slay them.

642
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:06,379
Next.

643
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,116
The King will buy us the time,

644
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:38,160
and we will use Bang-gan
to corner Bang-won.

645
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:39,787
Then I shall kill him.

646
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:43,708
According to Jeongan who claimed
the rules of primogeniture,

647
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,126
the next Crown Prince

648
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,211
is you, Jeongan's older brother.

649
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,256
Money makes one seek booze

650
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,508
and being intoxicated by power
makes one dance.

651
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:54,593
I see that you're both.

652
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:57,888
My sword.

653
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,057
Bang-gan has stopped suspecting me now.

654
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:04,145
Is this an opportunity or a trap?

655
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:07,106
Paths that can't be united
must be severed.

656
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,775
The beginning is His Majesty.

657
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,485
The end is Bang-gan.

658
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:14,530
Then I shall call this

659
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:16,741
the rebellion of Bang-gan.

660
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,122
