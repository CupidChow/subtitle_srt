00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,600
THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

2
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,144
SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARACTERS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,276
You punk!

4
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,951
You... How dare you!

5
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,874
My father is not a dog.
He's the best general in Goryeo, Seo Geom.

6
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,919
So tell me to fuck off again
if you dare, you bastard!

7
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,184
Someone told me that
I am the greatest swordsman of Goryeo.

8
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,804
PASS

9
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,764
Now, leave.

10
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,962
Aren't you coming?

11
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,548
What?

12
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:56,968
Yes.

13
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,439
Aren't you happy to see me?

14
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,818
Now, I can hope to get
that ten seom of rice again.

15
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,781
-That's great.
-Yes.

16
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,078
My gosh!

17
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,080
You have a good eye.

18
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:11,584
Daylilies symbolize a harmonious marriage
and help you conceive a son.

19
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,546
Fly this kite and conceive a healthy boy.

20
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,217
"Marriage"? "Son"?
Don't ruin someone's future here.

21
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,426
Whose future?

22
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,056
-Yours, of course.
-Who knows? It might be even brighter.

23
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,143
Why can't a beautiful lady
and a handsome man fall for each other?

24
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,979
-Enough.
-Are you taking the military exam?

25
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,023
This kite with lilies will help you
become a high-ranking military official.

26
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,567
Let's go fly a kite.

27
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,446
The kite will take all the bad luck away.
Bring Yeon. We'll go get some fresh air.

28
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,573
Forget it. She'll boss me around.

29
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,243
Don't give me that.
I know how much you care about her.

30
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,037
Bring her.
I'll let her boss me around instead.

31
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,165
Well, if you insist...
Shall I bring her, then?

32
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,336
I'll take this cherry blossom kite.

33
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,840
Beautiful cherry blossoms.
Here's your cherry blossom kite.

34
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,633
Here.

35
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,176
Me?

36
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,847
Tomorrow at Yeseongjeong.
Let's fly it together.

37
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,977
I should get you guys one too, then.

38
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,525
Why the squid kite for me?

39
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,193
See you guys tomorrow.

40
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,655
Why the squid kite?

41
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,241
Hey!

42
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,917
Hui-jae.

43
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,211
-Hui-jae.
-Mom.

44
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,343
Sweetheart!

45
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,764
Give this to Madame Seo.

46
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,599
Don't look back. Just go, okay?

47
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,309
I'll come for you...

48
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,228
Mom!

49
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,400
Cut it out, you bitch.

50
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,450
Find it.

51
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,597
Look at this kid.

52
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,518
She's panting like a goldfish.

53
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:34,894
This little rat...

54
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:50,076
Your movements tell me
that you learned proper sword fighting.

55
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,414
And you have the straight sword,
which the military uses.

56
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,166
I bet you are wearing
your uniform underneath.

57
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,334
Identify yourself!

58
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,586
Someone told me that

59
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,047
I am the greatest swordsman of Goryeo.

60
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,261
I am the Commander in Chief of
the Northern Punitive Force, Seo Geom.

61
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,804
Now,

62
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,808
I shall slash you.

63
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:35,455
I have built thousands of stone tombs
in battlefields.

64
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,293
These will never come apart
even if the mountains collapse.

65
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:50,511
Do not let anyone oppress you.
That's the only way you won't collapse.

66
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,974
Don't let anyone intimidate you
even if they're stronger than you.

67
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,102
Only then can you hold out.

68
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,026
I will be sure

69
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,906
to repay you for this.

70
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,408
Sure, repay me.

71
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,829
With high interest.

72
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,477
My gosh!

73
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,854
No!

74
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,357
-My goodness.
-Father...

75
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,109
No, don't do this to me.

76
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,403
No! You said...

77
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,840
Hwi means "to shine."

78
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,343
And Yeon means "beautiful."

79
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,478
I heard a well-made bow
sounds like the geomungo.

80
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,605
It was true.

81
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,950
Let's go fly a kite tomorrow.

82
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,036
So I can get rid of bad luck
before the big day.

83
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,871
"The big day"?

84
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,498
The military examination.

85
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,667
What?

86
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,470
Sir, why did you pretend
you didn't notice them earlier?

87
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,930
What do you mean?

88
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,601
Those two guys and that girl.
I know you saw them.

89
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,728
Did I?

90
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,274
What is the reason, sir?

91
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,652
Why must you pretend you didn't see them?
We nearly caught them.

92
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,820
Watch what you say.

93
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,614
I will report this to Chief.

94
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,075
I will be sure to seize this opportunity.

95
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,120
-Colonel Choe.
-Make your decision by tomorrow.

96
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,465
Jeez.

97
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,145
Did you put that blush on with your foot?

98
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,440
Don't laugh. If you do, I'll kill you.

99
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,568
I'll really kill you.

100
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,909
I clearly told you not to laugh!

101
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,572
Who is she?

102
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,491
What?

103
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,702
My boss.

104
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,288
She's my sister.

105
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,212
You must be Yeon.

106
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,425
I didn't know this good-for-nothing guy
had such a beautiful sister.

107
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,178
You are quite beautiful yourself.

108
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,681
My name is Hui-jae.

109
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,182
I am Yeon,

110
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,851
Seo Yeon.

111
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,855
Did you crush safflower petals
and mix them with water to make the blush?

112
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,190
How else can you make it?

113
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,277
Water is no good as it dries quickly.
Use camellia oil instead.

114
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,362
It absorbs easily and doesn't smudge.

115
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,864
Shall I show you how it's done?

116
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,243
Shall I?

117
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,664
Well, you can show me if you'd like.

118
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,434
Do clothes make the woman?

119
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,810
I'd say it's the makeup.

120
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,245
The poster pasters are at Yeseongjeong.

121
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,914
The word must not get out.

122
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,583
You and I are the only ones
that know about it, sir.

123
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,668
Let's go.

124
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,095
Don't try to fight the wind.

125
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,431
Let the kite move with the wind.

126
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,683
Move with the wind instead of fighting it.

127
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,686
You'll live long if you unwind the spool
all the way to the end.

128
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,105
I want to live long enough
to die of old age.

129
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,872
I can't believe the string broke
because of the wind.

130
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,582
I can fix it.

131
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,961
Hwi, just leave it!

132
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,462
I said, just leave it.

133
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,534
Don't.

134
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,662
You might fall and die.

135
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,000
The broken kite string
and a white butterfly

136
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,294
seem like it's foreshadowing
an early death, don't they?

137
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,503
It's all just a myth.

138
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,839
Worrying about things
won't cure her illness,

139
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,924
just like how pus will never become flesh.

140
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,595
You need to be indifferent about it
in order to tame it.

141
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,930
I guess you've figured it out.

142
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,057
She looks so pale,
and her hands are ice-cold.

143
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,475
How could I not know?

144
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,646
I also know that she's wearing a ton of
rouge to cover her purple lips.

145
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,069
She has epilepsy.

146
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,030
It's getting worse.

147
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,785
Yeon would've been much better off

148
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,913
with a sister like you
than a brother like me.

149
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,373
She can find many sisters like me,

150
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,792
but no one can replace you.

151
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,840
All right. I shall go get that kite.

152
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,595
Wait, gosh.

153
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,555
Hey.

154
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,781
-You are one fearless girl.
-Hold tight.

155
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,534
You said a broken kite string
doesn't mean death.

156
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,994
I said it to make you feel better.

157
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,458
Darn it. Why are you so heavy?

158
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,585
I got it.

159
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,217
People are flying sky lanterns.

160
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,177
-Where is Seon-ho?
-What?

161
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,929
He went to find you. You didn't see him?

162
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,609
There he is. I will get him.

163
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,330
What are you doing?

164
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,457
Don't you worry.
I will take you in one piece.

165
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,804
-You rat.
-Lose your sword.

166
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,722
Let's see who deserves to be called a rat.

167
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,871
Nam Seon-ho, you are arrested
for putting up those posters.

168
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,957
Does the Capital Patrol arrest
just about anyone?

169
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,584
Just wait.
I will arrest that bitch at Ihwaru too.

170
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,670
Don't you dare lay a finger on her!

171
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,713
Just worry about your family.

172
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,173
Your father is next.

173
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,711
Gosh, where did he go?

174
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,673
Let's just go.
I am worried Yeon might catch a cold.

175
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,222
I envy Yeon.

176
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,099
She has someone who can carry her home.

177
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,434
That's what I am saying.

178
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,898
You are two peas in a pod.

179
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,192
Didn't you call me
a good-for-nothing earlier?

180
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,985
I am not talking about Yeon.

181
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,702
"Do not let anyone oppress you.
Only then will you not collapse."

182
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,913
That's random.

183
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,664
"Don't let anyone intimidate you

184
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,917
even if they're stronger than you.

185
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,294
Only then can you hold out."

186
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,421
What is this about?

187
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,634
I figured you probably
never got to hear it.

188
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,219
I heard it just now.

189
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,429
Don't let anyone oppress or intimidate me.

190
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,976
-Then it's all good.
-Let's go.

191
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,424
I did not kill him,

192
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,302
and you did not see anything.

193
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,556
The one who lets out this secret
will die first.

194
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,979
I did not save you for your sake,

195
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,898
nor was it because of your father.

196
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,317
Thus,

197
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,361
do not kid yourself into thinking
that I am on your side.

198
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,859
Why you?

199
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,614
Why is it that you are the one
who made it out alive?

200
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,830
-You should have died instead of him.
-My lord.

201
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,748
Please spare his life.

202
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,294
You should have died instead of my son!

203
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,955
This was your brother's.

204
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:46,169
With this, you will always hit your target
unless the bowstring quivers.

205
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,338
Your brother did.

206
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,726
Prosperous times are ruled by scholars,

207
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,853
and turbulence is overturned
by the military.

208
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,814
An era of sword will come.

209
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,940
The sword will not

210
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,901
discriminate against you
for being an illegitimate son.

211
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,444
It will

212
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,364
accept you into this family.

213
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,702
Hence, the sword

214
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,622
will show you a world
that you have never even imagined.

215
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,459
Then promise me one thing.

216
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,004
If I pass the military examination,

217
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,340
you will not talk about Min-ho
in front of me ever again.

218
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,096
I wish to live my own life from now on.

219
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,559
You have my word.

220
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,624
Who is the best swordsman in Goryeo now?

221
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,667
It is swordsman Seo Hwi.

222
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,887
It's not Father's fault.

223
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:24,142
I ended up with this illness
because of the person who framed Father.

224
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,895
His stipend was so little,

225
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,272
yet he never hesitated
to give rice to his subordinates

226
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,691
who ran out of rice
or whose family member was sick.

227
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,528
We had to live on millet because he gave
all the rice to his subordinates.

228
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,490
And what?
He siphoned off military rations?

229
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,866
He was corrupt?

230
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,660
Do you really believe that?

231
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,620
No, I don't.

232
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,047
HWI
YEON

233
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,185
Bang-gan.

234
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,855
Born on July 2, 1364,
in Gwiju-dong in Hamhung.

235
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,234
He is the fourth son of Yi Seong-gye.
His mother is from the Anbyon Han clan.

236
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,152
He's skilled in martial arts,

237
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,655
and he seems brave,
but he is actually rather vicious.

238
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,952
I am utterly speechless.
Did you memorize this whole thing?

239
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,079
From the junior 9th rank
to the 2nd State Councillor.

240
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,330
All of their family members.

241
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:31,751
"Knowledge is gold, and gold is power,"
said Madame Seo.

242
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,629
Next.

243
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,965
Nam Jeon's son, Nam Seon-ho.

244
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,800
Next.

245
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,468
"Born on April 5, 1368.

246
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,971
Illegitimate son of Nam Jeon,
the head of the Royal Stables.

247
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,558
Officially, he's not considered a member
of the family as his mother was a slave.

248
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,018
He is well-read, skilled in martial arts,
and handsome."

249
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,062
He is.

250
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,690
Enough, okay?

251
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,901
Let's see. Seo Hwi?

252
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,040
-Begin.
-We will now begin.

253
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:53,958
Aim.

254
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,919
Shoot!

255
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,639
The wooden arrow, iron arrow,
and short arrow.

256
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,475
Miss the target even with just one,
and you are disqualified.

257
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,602
Horseback spearing decides
whether you pass.

258
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,066
The sword duel is the final round.

259
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,612
You said you would change your destiny.

260
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:24,572
Go for it.

261
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,493
Do that and change this corrupt world.

262
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,120
I know you can do it.

263
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,456
And I, too, will see

264
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,502
how high I can climb.

265
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,971
I will fight to the death,

266
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,014
even if you're my opponent.

267
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,601
See you in the final round.

268
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,038
SEO HWI
NAM SEON-HO

269
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,890
The final round.

270
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,770
-Begin.
-We will begin now!

271
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,054
What?

272
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:02,563
Stop.

273
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,524
You'll die.

274
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,443
"Don't joke about swordsmanship.

275
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,030
There is no such thing as friends
before swords."

276
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,157
Seon-ho.

277
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,283
I...

278
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,329
came here,
determined to kill you if I must.

279
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,792
So do it properly.

280
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,837
Don't be such a do-gooder.

281
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:54,861
It's over.

282
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,242
It's over.

283
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:03,578
The end.

284
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,456
Nam Seon-ho wins.

285
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,560
Did you not say it was over?

286
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,979
All I did was nod my head.

287
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,647
All civil service examinations

288
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,192
don't come to an end
before the examiner calls time.

289
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,777
How...

290
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,572
How could you do such a thing?

291
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,866
Your question is wrong.

292
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,952
You should first figure out
why I couldn't do such a thing.

293
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,455
Get rid of him.

294
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,593
Do you want me to cancel your pass?

295
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:04,138
Is it because my father was sentenced
to death by boiling?

296
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,599
Was he?

297
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,684
If not, why...

298
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,603
If you are that curious,

299
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,397
you should go ask the cauldron
your father was dipped in.

300
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,189
First place,

301
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,276
Nam Seon-ho.

302
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,942
Smile.

303
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,113
This is the moment your life is changes.

304
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,031
What is going on?

305
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,701
Go to the ice room and get me some ice.

306
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,078
And some thick cotton cloth.

307
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,788
Ice?

308
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,373
It's prohibitively expensive.

309
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,999
Bring some hemostat too.

310
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,170
Hurry.

311
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,089
Do as she says.

312
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,412
What's your relationship with him?

313
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,334
What's up with you two?

314
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,005
We are meant to be together.

315
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,798
That's what it is.

316
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,680
Does it answer your question?

317
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:54,757
Are you feeling better?

318
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,802
What do you think?

319
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,890
I guess you are all right.

320
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,818
What about Seon-ho?

321
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,115
He was getting an appointment.

322
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,457
So why did you give me the squid kite?

323
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,876
The one with lilies was pretty.

324
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,426
I'll give you the lily kite next time.

325
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,192
Stay still. Let me cover your wound.

326
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,985
Yeon would be frightened.

327
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:14,920
Seo Hwi.

328
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,506
His father was sentenced
to death by boiling.

329
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,633
His sister has epilepsy.

330
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,053
And he's a penniless fool
who just failed the state exam.

331
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,222
He sounds the worst.

332
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,809
So?

333
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,522
What's wrong with that?

334
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,633
Once this guest leaves,
you'll enter the big room.

335
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,427
However, don't close the doors.

336
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,388
Sorry?

337
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,977
You heard me.

338
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,450
Wait, Yeon...

339
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,248
Right, Yeon, of course.

340
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,542
She'll be worried.

341
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,503
I guess I should go.

342
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,259
Get changed then.

343
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,456
It's for your cuts.

344
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,750
Sprinkle it whenever you can.

345
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,961
Pus will only make it worse.

346
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,716
Why does a courtesan house
have this medicine?

347
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:51,345
Apart from the prisons, this place

348
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:52,888
sees the most blood.

349
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,100
It makes sense.

350
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,156
Don't cry in front of Yeon though.

351
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,742
I never even shed a tear at birth.

352
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:23,502
I'll get going.

353
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:48,151
-Please have another.
-Why not?

354
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,613
Please enjoy, my lord.

355
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,950
-Could I have one too?
-Sure thing.

356
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,373
Is it because my father was
sentenced to death by boiling?

357
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,001
You should go ask the cauldron
your father was dipped in.

358
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,379
My, that's good.

359
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,425
Isn't it?

360
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,408
My lord,

361
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,160
please help.

362
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,288
Both the mortician and bier-carrier

363
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,999
are turning a blind eye.

364
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:45,625
Please...

365
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,961
let me at least bury him.

366
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,297
My father is still rotting!

367
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,300
Although I feel bad for you,

368
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:59,014
I will be considered just like him
if I take his body.

369
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:00,891
So,

370
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,643
go home.

371
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,105
Please, I am begging you.

372
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:11,735
Please bury my father beside my mother.

373
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:16,114
What if they don't cross paths
and miss each other?

374
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,825
What will happen then?

375
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,247
You were his friend!

376
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,958
This isn't how friends treat each other!

377
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:32,339
My lord, please!

378
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,299
My lord!

379
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,051
Please help me.

380
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,719
My lord!

381
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,494
Hwi...

382
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:30,272
Stomping in here
without announcing oneself?

383
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,023
You must be Hui-jae.

384
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,067
The message I gave Nam Jeon...

385
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,319
Was it from the state exam examiner?

386
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,740
What if it was?

387
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,245
That single message ruined a man's life.

388
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,706
How can you not be ashamed?

389
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:50,542
The gold bought us a year's worth of rice.

390
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,128
-That's why I am not ashamed.
-Seol!

391
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,005
I told you to end that relationship,

392
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,883
but you didn't listen to me
and got tangled up.

393
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,635
Don't make friends.

394
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,263
Love? Stay clear from that too.

395
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,266
It's only your heart that'll break.

396
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,854
That may be how you lived your life,

397
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,566
but I can't.

398
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:16,818
I...

399
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:18,862
won't.

400
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,127
What is this?

401
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,089
You are confined to our walls
until this blows over.

402
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,174
Seol!

403
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,095
You need more lessons on life.

404
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,744
I have something to ask.

405
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,248
Let me answer first.

406
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,085
Yes, I bribed the examiner.

407
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,841
How are you not ashamed by any of this?

408
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,304
If that's the case, why didn't you tell me
you bribed him before the exam?

409
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:29,057
"I bribed him, so you'll be
in first place no matter what."

410
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,154
That's why I bribed him.

411
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,826
Even with the bribe,
you still needed to do your best.

412
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:51,204
That's why... I am only telling you now.

413
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,251
I still could've won on my own.

414
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,044
Maybe so,

415
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,880
but I couldn't afford a loss.

416
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,135
You said you fight for your own sake,

417
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,471
but I put you in first place for my sake.

418
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,890
Things never go in your favor.
That's life.

419
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,602
Painful memories
must be subdued and buried.

420
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,026
You ruined my only friend.

421
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,112
I can never forget that.

422
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,363
Then take it back!

423
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,533
Admit that I bribed the examiner.

424
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,372
Do it! What are you waiting for?

425
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:38,835
Your friend?

426
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,087
When you are poor,
you run out of rice first

427
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,548
and then your friends leave you.
Are you saying

428
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,259
that such a friend means more to you?

429
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,053
Is that so?

430
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,976
You are the one who betrayed your friend.

431
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,271
You may use me as an excuse,

432
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,440
but don't blame me.

433
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,077
Congratulations, by the way.

434
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,310
By the looks of it, you flunked.

435
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,439
I couldn't have flunked it harder.

436
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,524
I knew it.

437
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,860
A military officer, my ass.

438
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:32,073
I'd rather live quietly
hammering at metals and weapons.

439
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,075
And a hairpin for me?

440
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,994
That wouldn't be all.

441
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,955
I'll even make you a silver ring
and a gold norigae.

442
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,511
Are you trying to burn a hole in my face?

443
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:07,192
How did you get beaten up during the exam?

444
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,944
I tried to duck,

445
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:11,654
but I got smashed.

446
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,450
Oh, dear.

447
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,369
The scars will ruin your handsome face.

448
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,467
You did well,

449
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,220
my brother.

450
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,895
You did well.

451
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,664
What's gotten into Ms. Stubborn?

452
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,541
Hunger crumbles just about anyone.

453
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:47,959
Anyone.

454
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,470
Unless you want trouble,

455
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,806
you'll shut this trap.

456
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,391
-Got it?
-Yes.

457
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,208
Come with me.

458
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,128
Now!

459
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,894
You asked for us, General?

460
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:50,438
Follow me.

461
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,662
When I was surrounded
by enemies in Mount Huang,

462
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,538
you alone came to my aid.

463
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,791
I still remember

464
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,086
how you stood by me when
I had cuts and bruises all over my body.

465
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:14,629
I am in your debt

466
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:16,673
and I will pay you back until I die.

467
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,966
I was only fulfilling my duties.

468
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:22,303
And now I am fulfilling mine.

469
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:48,454
Office of the Inspector General received
an anonymous letter before breakfast.

470
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,165
It was to inform the court
of a rigged state exam

471
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,084
and request a retake.

472
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,628
Wasn't your son

473
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,339
in first place?

474
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,097
Who else knows?

475
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,515
Just him...

476
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,434
and me, General.

477
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,394
Is it true?

478
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,865
No one else knows.

479
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,622
Rumors have been spreading
all over Capital Patrol that your son

480
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,541
is associated with those
putting up posters.

481
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:37,128
In this case though,
it's true and not just a rumor.

482
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,549
Consider my debt paid.

483
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,885
This all happened because of you.

484
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:29,597
When you can't untie a knot,
you must sever it.

485
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:32,600
You do not cover a mouth to shut it up.

486
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,268
It only shuts with death.

487
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:38,523
Sever this knot,

488
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,859
or you two will both die right here.

489
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:49,760
I severed it

490
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:51,762
with my own hands.

491
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,391
Let it get tied again

492
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,476
and I'll sever it myself.

493
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:01,272
From this day on,
all blood will be on my hands.

494
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,608
You do not need to worry.

495
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,616
You said you admired me.

496
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:17,204
Finally, that seems remotely true.

497
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,059
There is one more who knows.

498
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,436
What will you do?

499
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,031
Military duty.

500
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:56,661
The law can make him serve until 60.

501
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:00,039
He will serve until the day he dies.

502
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,166
You can't kill him, is that it?

503
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:05,127
Where he's going,
it won't be considered as living.

504
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,338
Are you trying to buy time?

505
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,173
I am saying I'll trap him in time.

506
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:14,845
Can I trust you?

507
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,808
Hwi has been my lifelong friend,

508
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,978
but I will not die for him.

509
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,064
You can trust me.

510
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:06,981
Let's eat.

511
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:14,447
You did quite a good job.

512
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,741
I can make anything taste good, you know.

513
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:17,867
Let's eat then.

514
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:39,930
I have an upset stomach.

515
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:42,558
When you can even digest metal?

516
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,936
You just have to irritate me, don't you?

517
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,773
Don't argue with me and eat up.

518
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:50,107
Got it.

519
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:01,994
Are you Seo Hwi?

520
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:04,622
I am.

521
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:13,464
You have not paid the military cloth tax
which means you are up for enlistment.

522
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:16,217
As of this moment, you have been drafted.

523
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:20,304
What are you talking about?

524
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,765
My father is absent
and I have a sister to care for.

525
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:23,891
This doesn't make sense.

526
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:24,975
Drag him out of here.

527
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,354
You can't suddenly order this.

528
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,272
-At least give me some time.
-Hwi!

529
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,942
-I will pay the tax soon.
-Hwi!

530
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:35,194
Let go. Let go of me!

531
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:00,010
Yeon!

532
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,688
I will not resist.

533
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:14,900
Just let me care for my sister first!

534
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:17,444
She'll die if no one holds her.

535
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:21,866
If her tongue rolls back to her throat,
she won't be able to breathe.

536
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:24,118
Yeon!

537
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:27,705
Yeon...

538
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:29,415
Yeon!

539
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,126
Yeon!

540
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:34,795
Yeon...

541
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:38,090
Sir, please.

542
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:41,594
Please, I am begging you.
At least give her a gag.

543
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:44,847
Just a gag!

544
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,224
You bastards!

545
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,145
Yeon!

546
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:56,108
Yeon, don't die.

547
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,153
Yeon, don't you die.

548
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:02,656
Can anyone please help her? Yeon!

549
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,909
Yeon!

550
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:10,831
Yeon...

551
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,542
Please wake up. Please.

552
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:16,587
No...

553
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,639
Please relay this message for me.

554
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:30,309
Nam Seon-ho, the winner of the state exam
is my friend.

555
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:36,106
Please tell him
to look after my sister for me.

556
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:37,733
Please.

557
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:42,154
Please let him know that.

558
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:44,782
Please...

559
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,536
Please!

560
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:54,041
Please!

561
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:00,381
Please...

562
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:05,636
What's going on?

563
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:13,644
Get me the physician. Now!

564
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,116
Who is she?

565
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:30,953
She's Hwi's sister.

566
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,872
-Remove her.
-My lord.

567
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,250
Step back!

568
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,127
Quiet.

569
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:42,339
You are too loud.

570
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:58,647
How many times have I told you
to threaten instead of yell?

571
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,920
One more person
knows you bribed the examiner.

572
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,465
And who's that?

573
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:26,425
Me.

574
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:29,178
I know the truth.

575
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:36,226
What if I told General Choi?

576
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:39,938
You won't be able to.

577
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,862
I only shoot arrows for my own sake.

578
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,366
Why should I care about
who becomes my target?

579
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,453
Yeon...

580
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,289
I will not let her die.

581
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:02,169
So do not provoke me today.

582
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,061
Help her get well.

583
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:21,605
However,

584
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:24,233
keep that fact hidden.

585
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:26,777
No one can know.

586
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:29,363
If anyone finds out,

587
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,783
I'll kill them.

588
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:14,032
Sir, what happened to my sister?

589
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,536
Is she alive or not?
At least tell me that.

590
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:22,875
Let go of me, you bastards. Let go!

591
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:25,502
Did you say that
Nam Seon-ho is your friend?

592
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:27,004
Yes, sir.

593
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:29,840
Nam Seon-ho, son of Nam Jeon,
is my friend.

594
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:32,426
If you give him word,
he will run over here.

595
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:40,809
He's the one who sent you here.

596
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:43,645
What?

597
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:44,771
He's the one

598
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:47,483
who's sending you to the military,

599
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,735
you idiot.

600
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:28,357
Seol!

601
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,401
I won't stand in your way anymore.

602
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:34,571
At 2 p.m.,

603
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,407
a boat will ship
soldiers to the battlefield.

604
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,202
One of its passengers,

605
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:42,955
goes by the name Hwi.

606
01:15:49,169 --> 01:15:50,796
Go and witness

607
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,423
the outcome of your foolishness.

608
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:41,007
3 MONTHS LATER, 1388,
YEAR OF THE WIHWADO RETREAT, LIAODONG

609
01:19:06,783 --> 01:19:09,035
SPECIAL THANKS TO YU OH-SEONG,
KWAK SUN-YOUNG, AND KIM YOON-SEO

610
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:30,056
Send this to Bang-won and have him
escort his mothers to the northeast area.

611
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,767
Your fifth son Bang-won?

612
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,060
Who cares of the order
my sons were born in?

613
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:36,104
I will always consider
Bang-won as my first child.

614
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,190
Will Goryeo be turned over?

615
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,776
The King comes first
and the country comes second.

616
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:43,111
Time is not on our side anymore.

617
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:45,113
One leader will show his competency.

618
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:48,575
Do you even know any of our names?

619
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:50,076
If you do, tell me.

620
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,995
What's my name?

621
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,206
You'll only end up dying.

622
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:55,540
Since we're lowlifes,

623
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,417
we can afford to die?

624
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:59,127
I will survive and return home.

625
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:02,756
There's one I must save
and one I must kill.

626
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,759
You cannot achieve anything
unless you are willing to make sacrifices.

627
01:20:05,842 --> 01:20:07,969
There's no such thing
as a rightful sacrifice.

628
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:10,347
And there is no revolution
without sacrifices.

629
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,937
