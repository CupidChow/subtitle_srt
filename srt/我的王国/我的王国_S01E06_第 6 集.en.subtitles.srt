00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,391
THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

2
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,852
SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARACTERS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,666
Bang-won's private army
has thousands of men?

4
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,045
Grand General Jung

5
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,923
will die tonight.

6
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,500
Hwi.

7
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,359
EPISODE 6

8
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,178
It's been a long time.

9
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,473
You're alive.

10
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,358
When I fell asleep for a moment
and saw you,

11
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,028
I stayed up all night
because I missed you.

12
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,908
I wanted to close my eyes again
so I could see you,

13
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,287
but you were just a dream.

14
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,752
This isn't a dream, right?

15
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,757
I never

16
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,426
dreamt about you.

17
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,845
Not even a nightmare.

18
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,227
Just surviving was more
than I could handle.

19
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,604
I erased you from my mind.

20
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,982
I don't believe you.

21
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,441
You're lying.

22
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,655
Thank you...

23
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,995
for staying alive.

24
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,561
Jung Sa-jeong will die?

25
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,189
You should kill one of
your meritorious subjects first.

26
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,776
That will teach them their place
and make them fear you, Your Majesty.

27
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,862
And if one of them has to die,

28
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,031
it should be Jung Sa-jeong.

29
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,827
However, I never ordered his death.

30
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,120
You cannot.

31
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,913
Hence, I read your thoughts.

32
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,917
My job is to understand your thoughts
and put them into action.

33
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,340
Then tell me how you think I feel
about Jeongan.

34
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,924
You fear

35
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,094
the possibility of him
stealing the throne from you.

36
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,929
-How dare you--
-But at the same time,

37
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,890
you miss having him around

38
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,060
for he used to dirty his hands with blood
in your place.

39
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,940
Please grant me access to everywhere
and the authority to order anyone.

40
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,859
Then you will no longer need to

41
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,236
fear or miss Prince Jeongan.

42
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,660
Then tell me your thoughts on this.

43
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,456
I let the meritorious subjects
and royal relatives have private armies,

44
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,918
and even mere clerks
are hiring private soldiers now.

45
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,798
What should be done about it?

46
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,217
I understand, Your Majesty.

47
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,718
I will take care of it.

48
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,316
What are you waiting for?
We must report this immediately.

49
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,110
No, we can't.

50
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,949
If we do,
they'll turn this place upside down

51
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,243
and try to convict us of
aiding and abetting at all costs.

52
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,161
Ihwaru won't be safe.

53
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,288
Aren't you the one that left
without any hesitation?

54
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,040
Now you act like you care?

55
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,378
Is it because of him?

56
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,215
Then what should we do?

57
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,884
Madame Seo.

58
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,728
Both the body and the bloodstain
will be gone.

59
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,898
No one saw or heard anything.

60
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,236
Nothing happened at Ihwaru.

61
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,408
Hui-jae is right.

62
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,662
Get moving!

63
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,746
Yes, ma'am.

64
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,086
You must be happy that you finally saw
the man whom you missed so much.

65
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,224
What's wrong?

66
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,851
Were you not that happy to see him?

67
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,480
What is it, then?
Just tell me, you silly goose.

68
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,191
I felt as if

69
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,072
hell was engraved all over Hwi's body.

70
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,913
I felt like I could hear
each one of his scars screaming.

71
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,586
It broke my heart.

72
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,884
His sad eyes broke my heart more

73
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,430
than all the cruel words he said.

74
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,352
They pierced my heart like sharp blades.

75
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,609
I have no power.
I should not have stepped in.

76
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,615
I shouldn't have let him go like that.

77
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,534
The last audience for the day is over.

78
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,037
This is regarding an urgent matter.

79
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,122
His Majesty heard everything
he needed to hear.

80
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,291
You must've told him something
you never told me.

81
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,505
Bang-won's weaknesses, for example.

82
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,342
Please don't get the wrong idea.

83
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,677
It was just a routine briefing.

84
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,139
A sixth-rank official having a one-on-one
with the King is unprecedented.

85
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,018
You are trying to fly
before you can even jump.

86
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,479
That is what all birds do.

87
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,523
You are being hasty.
You will be used and abandoned.

88
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,025
Do not be concerned.

89
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,944
Whether I fly or fall,

90
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,614
I will handle the consequences.

91
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,305
-So what's going on?
-Jung Sa-jeong died at Ihwaru.

92
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,016
Eight guys went in,

93
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,518
and only Hwi came out.

94
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,314
-Anything else?
-The skirt-clad minister

95
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,066
was at Ihwaru as well.

96
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,527
Where is she now?

97
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,771
I saw Hwi.

98
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,442
You...

99
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,610
knew, didn't you?

100
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,196
Yes.

101
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,157
I knew.

102
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,450
How could you--

103
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,160
It was Hwi's choice.

104
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,579
He chose to avoid you.

105
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,247
It wasn't me.

106
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,458
What choice did he have?

107
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,211
Did he choose to be drafted
and sent to the deadly battleground?

108
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,757
Or you mean, having a friend like you?

109
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,510
Hwi and I

110
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,806
are no longer friends.
I don't want to hear that name anymore.

111
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,267
You walk and trample all over others.

112
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,228
Now, I know where else
I've seen that type of behavior.

113
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,942
You're just like your father.

114
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,195
Like two peas in a pod.

115
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,773
Your Highness, there is--

116
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,459
We took care of Jung Sa-jeong.

117
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,835
What about the corpses?

118
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,879
They never left Ihwaru.

119
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,589
Ihwaru...

120
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,591
Can we trust them?

121
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,969
There are hundreds of treacherous plots

122
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:09,139
that were schemed at Haegeomdang
in Ihwaru but were never carried out.

123
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,391
Do you know

124
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,353
about any of them?

125
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,412
We must find out who killed Jung Sa-jeong.

126
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,248
We need to know who ordered his death
to prepare for their next move.

127
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,502
Is that the only reason?

128
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,425
Only two people
in this country can dare to kill

129
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,176
a founding contributor at Ihwaru.

130
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,469
Nam Jeon is one of them,

131
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,763
but he'd never hire lowborn swordsmen.

132
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,141
Who is the other one?

133
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,436
-It's Bang-won.
-Stay out of it.

134
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,646
If not, neither you nor Hwi will be safe.

135
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,815
I must step in
because Hwi is involved in it.

136
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,781
Then you will have to
bear the consequences.

137
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,493
Will you still step in?

138
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,204
Yes, I will.

139
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,629
If you are seeing me off,
you can go back in now.

140
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,466
No, I came out to greet someone.

141
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,304
I will give you
an invaluable piece of information.

142
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,639
Would you accept it?

143
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,474
Yes, please tell me.

144
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,393
Bang-seok will be named Crown Prince,
but the throne is Bang-won's.

145
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,520
Do not doubt it. It won't change.

146
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,858
Hello, there.

147
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,653
You old lady with diseased lungs.

148
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,280
It is quite impressive
that you are still alive.

149
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,033
Here.

150
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,411
With the right medicine,

151
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,497
you can outlive those who caught the flu.

152
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,415
Is that so?

153
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,964
It's been a while.

154
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,883
I do not want to interrupt
your conversation, so I'll get going.

155
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,970
I've been meaning

156
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,931
to meet with you.

157
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,294
Oh, dear. I forgot for a moment.

158
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,589
You said you're not a kisaeng even though
you grew up in a kisaeng house.

159
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:04,148
My father always reeked of blood.

160
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,902
Even when I was a little boy,
I could tell that he had just returned

161
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:14,366
from one of his expeditions
before his stubble touched my cheeks.

162
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,162
But this place

163
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,749
also reeks of that putrid smell of blood.

164
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,420
The assassins that killed Jung Sa-jeong...

165
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,672
I sent them.

166
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,267
Do they

167
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,146
work for Your Highness?

168
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,442
They just looked like roughnecks to me.

169
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,947
I will abandon them
when they are no longer useful.

170
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,200
And if they cause trouble,

171
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,535
I will just kill them.

172
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,624
But why at Ihwaru?

173
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,417
It is the only place
where I can assassinate

174
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,503
a founding contributor
without any trouble.

175
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,297
Ihwaru is not a burial ground.

176
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,883
I hope things like this
never happen again.

177
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,551
I am afraid it will keep happening.

178
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,554
Then the earth will spit out the corpses.

179
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,016
If that happens, you will be buried
in that very spot.

180
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,769
I do not have much time left
to live anyway.

181
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,354
Such threats won't work.

182
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,355
Oh, boy.

183
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,273
Then I suppose that sword

184
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,275
will be sent to someone else.

185
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,570
Your Highness.

186
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,116
Do you remember the time
when you were on the run?

187
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,326
I helped the Queen up
when she was exhausted

188
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,161
and carried Bang-seok when he fell asleep.

189
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,248
I voluntarily got the least amount
of food and sleep.

190
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,582
And even when...

191
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,628
I was threatened at knifepoint,

192
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,756
I didn't even flinch.

193
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,258
How could I forget that time?

194
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,010
I should have killed you back then.

195
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,390
I'm sure

196
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,725
I'll get another chance though.

197
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:10,399
I will give you that chance now.

198
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,068
Work for me.

199
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,989
But you must continue to work
for the Queen and be Nam Seon-ho's friend.

200
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,159
Observe everything
they say, hear, and think about

201
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,995
and report it to me.

202
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,080
In return,

203
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,379
I give you my permission to kill me
anytime you wish.

204
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,759
What will happen if I decline your offer?

205
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,896
We'll see about that
when and if it happens.

206
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,702
JUNG SA-JEONG

207
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,916
YI BANG-WON

208
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,302
Our next target is Bang-won's arsenal.

209
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,472
I'll confiscate all the weapons,

210
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,807
so you can take over the arsenal.

211
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,060
Start out as a guard at the arsenal

212
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,853
and move up
to the support and elite squads.

213
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,521
Then you'll approach Bang-won.

214
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,815
I'll grow old and die
before I can even meet him.

215
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,943
Bang-won doubts everything and everyone.

216
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,861
You must do it step by step.

217
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,279
That is the best way.

218
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,086
You stay here. If you get caught,
Yeon will be put in danger as well.

219
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,244
Follow me.

220
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,836
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't be here.

221
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,180
First, you should be asking
how I found this place.

222
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,099
The fact that I found it

223
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,893
means Bang-won can come here too.

224
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,439
I don't know your plan,
but you're in danger.

225
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,565
Leave.

226
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,692
And do not come back.

227
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,822
You can't stop me.

228
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:05,866
Are you blind?

229
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,493
You saw me killing someone.

230
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,705
You're no exception.

231
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,505
Leave.

232
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,216
I said, leave!

233
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,740
You said you forgot it all.

234
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,660
You said it's meaningless.

235
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,544
I will

236
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,755
protect you from now on.

237
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,508
I'll never lose you again.

238
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,561
The world you live in...

239
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,981
I'll have to die to get there.

240
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,498
Forget the girl
who used to put up the posters.

241
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,877
In front of Bang-won,
we're complete strangers.

242
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,171
And I won't step in
without your permission.

243
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,217
Then I'll go

244
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,762
to where you are.

245
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,100
No one will find out.

246
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,735
Thank you

247
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,113
for seeing me off.

248
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,847
-Let me pour you a glass.
-All right.

249
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,955
They say the first drink
should go to your elder,

250
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,457
and the last one is
for the one in your heart.

251
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,378
This is the last one.

252
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,881
My last one already went to Hwi.

253
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,051
You walk and trample all over others.

254
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,971
You're just like your father.

255
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,056
Like two peas in a pod.

256
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:44,978
Sir.

257
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,278
Sir.

258
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,828
Hey, you're that inspector!

259
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,585
Don't you remember me?

260
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,087
We met at the meeting
with the Three Offices.

261
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,922
Who is he?

262
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,258
He is the son of the powerful man,

263
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,261
Lord Nam Jeon.

264
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,347
That illegitimate son of his?

265
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,061
Oh, no. I should watch
this flippant mouth of mine.

266
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,356
Be careful! If you get on his nerves,

267
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,399
he'll dig up dirt
on everyone in your family.

268
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,778
There is no way such a fine,
distinguished man knows who I am.

269
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,530
Your mother was a lowborn,
but you obtained the sixth rank.

270
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,699
I'm truly impressed.

271
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,827
I could not choose my parents.

272
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,413
Could you?

273
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,458
You were just lucky,

274
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,461
so be grateful for your good fortune.

275
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,546
Do not mock the unlucky ones.

276
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,508
I was just joking,
so don't get all riled up.

277
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:01,638
It is not my fault that you were born
out of wedlock to a lowborn mother.

278
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,601
We'll meet again.

279
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,187
And when we do, that hand of yours

280
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,690
will be crippled beyond use.

281
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,609
Gosh, I'm so scared.

282
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,987
Hey, enough.

283
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,364
Let's just go in.

284
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,866
-Look at that mutt on the throne.
-Gosh.

285
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,119
That mutt needs to know his place.

286
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,016
Seon-ho.

287
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,186
Hey, why aren't you in bed?

288
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,689
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

289
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,068
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

290
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,362
Did you drink?

291
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,948
Yes, just one glass.

292
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,414
You must've had more than one glass.

293
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,300
Don't wait for me from now on.

294
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,887
People are watching,
and it makes me uncomfortable.

295
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,181
You also don't need to leave

296
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,435
a glass of water by my bed at night,
so don't go into my room.

297
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,439
Did I do something wrong?

298
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,360
No.

299
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,920
With its fierce eyes
The dragon soared through the sky

300
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,671
What is that?

301
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:02,258
This is called Mabihwan.

302
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,427
When you take this pill,

303
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,221
your entire body becomes paralyzed.

304
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,765
Even if you are to be flogged 100 times,

305
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,100
you won't even feel it.

306
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,394
-You're so silly.
-Did you laugh at me?

307
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,857
Those who get flogged for others
for a living always have this handy.

308
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:21,611
Jeez, who keeps spewing
total gibberish over there?

309
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,322
Why must he provoke me like that?

310
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,700
What about you? What are you doing now?

311
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,328
My goodness,
look at these squiggly earthworms.

312
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,998
If we had some chickens here,
they'd eat them all.

313
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,708
Beom, are you taking the state exam?

314
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,169
I'll become a nobleman
when I can buy a family register.

315
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,713
A nobleman must know
how to write his name at least.

316
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,715
Oh, that's right. My gosh.

317
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,301
I forgot about that dream of yours,

318
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,719
but it'll never come true.

319
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,974
-Come here for a second.
-Okay.

320
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,308
Shall I crush your bones?

321
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,476
Don't mess with me.

322
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,853
Which one of the Jeong clans?

323
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:59,691
The Dongnae Jeong clan.
And "Beom" means "to run."

324
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,151
Let's see.

325
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:11,953
Jeong.

326
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,080
Beom.

327
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,298
This is my first time seeing my name.

328
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,759
Chi-do.

329
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,511
Thank you.

330
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,020
Where are you going?

331
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,898
I'll go catch a few pheasants,
so boil some water.

332
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,150
You need to corner them to hunt them.
I'll go with you.

333
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,359
There's no need.

334
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,612
Just stay here.

335
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:28,112
Gosh, it's like you have nine lives.

336
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,073
How did you survive alone
when everyone died?

337
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,824
That's what I'm good at.

338
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,826
Fine. I'm so proud.

339
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,245
I didn't know it was here.
I've been looking all over for it.

340
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,414
Were you looking for a grave site?

341
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,000
No, I was looking for that straight sword.

342
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:44,128
I noticed you use the straight sword
while everyone has curved ones.

343
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,508
The sword that can pierce body armor
and the long spear to skewer troopers?

344
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,385
Are you fighting in a war or something?

345
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,513
How would a mere hunter
like you know about long spears?

346
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,100
Kill him.

347
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,150
Tear him off!

348
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,296
Shoot the arrows.

349
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,182
You jerk.

350
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,246
Leave him be. I might need him later.

351
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,018
Confiscate all the weapons

352
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,519
and kill those who defy.

353
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,730
Dismiss all the soldiers on duty

354
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,565
and arrest those who disobey.

355
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,608
What is going on?

356
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,694
How dare you show your face here.

357
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,948
Kill them all.
I will take full responsibility for this.

358
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,630
You're the inspector.

359
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,049
How dare a bastard son like you...

360
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,682
Do you know who my father is?

361
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,687
I once used my father's name
for my advantage.

362
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,107
That's what

363
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:10,900
I regret the most.

364
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,200
You can file an appeal
or report treason if you want.

365
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,120
But I assure you,

366
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,916
you won't even be able to mess
with my collar to the death.

367
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,171
If you don't believe me, bring it on.

368
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,882
You'll see who's slaughtered first.

369
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,687
I speared and cut,
just enough not to kill you guys.

370
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,231
Whether you leave or stay, it's up to you.

371
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,899
But you can never come back.

372
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,192
If you do,

373
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,361
I'll kill you all.

374
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,706
You damn punks.

375
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,916
They are just leaving like that.

376
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,130
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay at the tavern.

377
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,215
You're the one who lied to me first.

378
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,633
Where on earth is a pheasant here?

379
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,719
Let him explain what he's doing here.

380
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:48,915
What?

381
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,292
Gosh, what's all this?

382
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,919
Did a war break out or something?

383
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,504
Are they about 300 swords?

384
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,925
If it's ten nyang per sword,
it will be about 3,000 nyang in total.

385
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,053
It's worth ten houses
with servants' quarters.

386
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,472
We can find any house we want.

387
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,807
Did we just win a fortune?

388
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,100
Who do these belong to?

389
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,937
It doesn't matter.
I called dibs on them already.

390
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,484
That's what I was going to say,
but I won't.

391
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,695
People just believe whatever I say.
It makes me feel guilty.

392
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,662
Prince Jeongan, Yi Bang-won.

393
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,664
This is his weapons storehouse.

394
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,628
I've got more tricks up my sleeve.

395
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,798
If we go further,
it will put you in danger.

396
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,634
So let's just stop here.

397
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,427
Tell me what you're up to.

398
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,054
Let's just go our separate ways.

399
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,098
Tell me.

400
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,724
Are you deaf or what?

401
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,142
You might die.

402
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:56,232
My gosh. The sword is all nicked.

403
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,109
Is it a sword or a taffy?

404
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,944
Hey, take a look at this.

405
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,659
Even a sorghum straw
wouldn't snap like this.

406
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,412
Hwi, do you think we've survived the war

407
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,247
because we're good warriors?

408
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,749
It's all because of our quick wits.

409
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,669
Just tell us what you are up to.

410
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,170
I think Mun-bok has a point.

411
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,596
There's something

412
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,224
you need to see.

413
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,917
YI BANG-WON

414
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,632
Soldiers are divided

415
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,217
into three groups.

416
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,720
In Group A, there's Tae-ryeong,
the greatest swordsman

417
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,764
and Cheonga who uses a pair of sickles.

418
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,558
Tae-ryeong manages Group B,
and Cheonga manages Group C.

419
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,062
Only Group A can stand near Yi Bang-won.

420
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,607
Group B has 24 soldiers or more.

421
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,234
They stand guard over Bang-won's house.

422
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,320
Ganggae's party we just defeated
belong to Group C.

423
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,615
They are outsourced soldiers in charge
of weapons and intelligence.

424
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,786
They are usually seen as roughnecks
or gamblers at other times.

425
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,541
Was it Yeon or something?

426
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,795
Your sister

427
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,838
is just like my sister.

428
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,508
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for my sister.

429
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,551
Don't you agree?

430
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,513
Nam Jeon, that little bastard.

431
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,807
I'd just poke his eyes out

432
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,975
and squeeze them all out dry.

433
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,268
What are you doing?

434
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,938
I just feel bad for Yeon.

435
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,524
That poor thing.

436
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,611
She lost her parents, her brother,

437
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,780
and even her memory.

438
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,907
I mean, she's...

439
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,117
Darn it.

440
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,958
You said you should get on the right side
of Yi Bang-won to save Yeon, right?

441
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,836
We even managed to

442
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,255
come back alive from Liaodong.

443
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,924
You can do that.
What's the big deal about it?

444
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,761
Right.

445
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,179
I'm going to

446
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,390
kick Jeon's ass.

447
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,058
Let's do this.

448
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,520
Even if we die alone,

449
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,855
we will survive together.

450
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,528
Thank you.

451
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,656
Well...

452
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,950
On a day like this,

453
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,369
we need a drink or something.

454
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,789
Do you want me to go boil some eggs?

455
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,923
The gambling den is robbed?

456
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:09,967
And even the forge?

457
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,470
But we managed to catch the mutt.

458
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,184
What about the weapons storehouse?

459
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,687
It's fine.

460
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,731
I'll be dead if it's robbed.

461
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,113
If you move, it'll cut your neck.

462
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,700
You were a mere assassin.

463
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,036
Who do you think made you the leader here?

464
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,579
It's not like I was an assassin.

465
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,333
I was just ordered to kill him.

466
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,501
What?

467
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,377
I asked who did it.

468
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,254
It's you, sir.

469
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,925
I had your back for the den
and let you take care of the forge.

470
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,761
-Why is that?
-For protection money.

471
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,555
And you got it all robbed?

472
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,098
I'll get them back tomorrow.

473
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,808
I'll do it as soon as possible.

474
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,977
So, please! Please!

475
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,029
Ganggae.

476
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:15,407
We don't need a flag to die for
or patriotism to be a soldier.

477
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,535
It's all about money.

478
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,037
We just get a lot of money for our lives.

479
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:24,500
Now that he cut the purse strings,
I'll have to cut something.

480
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,672
I'd like to see the face

481
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,093
of this Hwi.

482
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,232
Don't just stand there.

483
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,901
-Pardon?
-Look for him!

484
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,956
That fucking little weasel.

485
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,963
Why are you puckering your mouth
like a little fish?

486
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,214
You little bitch.

487
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,718
And who might you be?

488
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,678
Whatever. I'll tear you apart.

489
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,939
Go and tell your master

490
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,651
that if you ever hurt this little girl,

491
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,404
he'll have to answer to me.

492
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,204
If it weren't for Seo Geom back then,

493
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,582
I wouldn't be treated like garbage.

494
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,587
Secret surveillance?

495
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,173
Would Hwi be the one watched?

496
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,469
I won't lose him again.

497
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,137
I will

498
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,097
protect Hwi.

499
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,767
And what can you obtain?

500
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,102
Tributes are given to Ming
three times a year.

501
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,021
I will get my hand on the deal.

502
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:13,942
Ihwaru can have 20 percent of the profit.

503
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,113
And how can I trust you?

504
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,283
I don't make deals that could go sideways.

505
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,705
The official in charge of the trade

506
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,290
is one of the Queen's people.

507
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,209
You can trust me.

508
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,671
On one condition.

509
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,715
I will hear the deal
from the Queen herself.

510
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,479
Why here?

511
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,564
Others have joined me back at home.

512
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,233
Speak.

513
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,944
As you suspected,
there was an arsenal at the smithy.

514
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,197
I counted about 300 swords and spears.

515
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,783
They will be confiscated tomorrow.

516
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,743
Wait for your next assignment.

517
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,456
Do not forget

518
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,667
that plans crumble

519
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,669
if the right steps aren't taken.

520
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,847
Is anyone here?

521
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,251
Are you a physician?

522
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,628
A physician?

523
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,339
My gosh, you...

524
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,008
So what I mean...

525
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,801
I'm trying to say...

526
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,804
Is there something on my face?

527
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:07,890
Prettiness.

528
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,563
You're like a living doll.
What's your name?

529
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,939
Why do you ask?

530
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,357
To call you, that's why.

531
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,902
A name's no good if you don't call it.

532
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:24,823
It's Hwa-wol.

533
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,577
Moonlight shining on petal.

534
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,413
Your name is as pretty as your face.

535
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,418
So what brings you here today?

536
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,378
I can take a look if you want.

537
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,925
I think my wound has gotten a bit worse.

538
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:43,967
Wait.

539
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,928
Don't.

540
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:54,770
Right here.

541
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:04,613
Are you kidding me?
This buffoon just slathered on medicine.

542
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,698
My dear goodness.

543
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,408
There's puss.

544
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,078
-Puss?
-It's all right.

545
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,454
Hold on.

546
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,710
Swallow one of these 30 minutes

547
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,379
after breakfast and dinner.

548
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:27,094
Melt some of this in water
and put it on your wound.

549
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,846
It's gluey, so it'll stick right on.

550
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:34,810
There isn't anything I can't give you,

551
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,395
so do not hesitate to ask.

552
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,523
Are you sure you're a physician?

553
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:44,027
The blettia rhizome powder
and these pills were mixed up--

554
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,445
What's this?

555
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,033
Are you pretending to be a physician
in my pharmacy again?

556
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,910
Just shut it...

557
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,079
It's not what you think.

558
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,915
Could I even ask you for some salt?

559
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,750
Of course. I have some.

560
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:03,046
I have the most precious kind
from the coast of Taean.

561
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,260
You pig.

562
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,556
PHARMACY

563
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,851
My name is Mun-bok. "Mun" as in door

564
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,894
and "bok" as in happiness.

565
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,896
It's Mun-bok!

566
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,024
Now get out of here.

567
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,483
Why you little...

568
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,453
Did you take the wrong medicine

569
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,662
or spot a wild ginseng?

570
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,749
Hwa-wol!

571
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,084
A beauty must've stopped by the pharmacy.

572
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,461
That's right.

573
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,381
Why can't you start up
a logical conversation

574
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:50,344
instead of coming at me
with jealously or crude comments?

575
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,512
-What?
-I'm off.

576
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,973
Wait, don't forget the pills for numbness.

577
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,644
Your whole body will go numb
so don't take them when shooting arrows.

578
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,437
Take them before you receive a beating

579
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,065
so that you won't feel a lot of pain.

580
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,400
Are you wishing me luck or not?

581
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,152
Good luck.

582
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:12,824
I don't know if you'll be
as good with an arrow though.

583
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,161
Don't worry. From a close distance,
my shooting is as good as his.

584
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,835
When it comes to Hwi,
he doesn't want to lose.

585
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,755
You're supposed to always aim high.

586
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,298
I heard that!

587
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,640
Bang-won doesn't let his guard down.

588
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,308
Are you sure about this?

589
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,643
It's like I said.

590
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:42,437
I'll use Bang-won to get rid of Nam Jeon.

591
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,232
I'm only saying
since both seems difficult.

592
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,276
A bait for Bang-won
and a trap for Nam Jeon.

593
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:49,695
I have both.

594
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,199
Can you promise me something?

595
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:59,079
If something goes wrong
and I'm about to die,

596
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,622
don't get in the way.

597
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,583
That I can't do
as long as I see you danger.

598
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,670
I'll go alone
if you can't promise me that.

599
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,176
Fine,

600
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,386
I promise.

601
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,435
Nam Seon-ho is disbanding
the ministers' private armies.

602
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,937
Jung Sa-jeong's men
are already in the wind.

603
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,315
He's disbanding armies?

604
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:31,236
Well, bring in those
that have been let go.

605
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,613
That includes swordsmen,
warriors, strong men,

606
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,325
as well as thugs and outlaws
on the streets.

607
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,535
Even at this time?

608
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,328
We can't give in to what they want.

609
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,622
His Majesty commands
the official army now,

610
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,166
so I should at least have my own.

611
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,501
I need it to survive.

612
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,129
Only then will I be able
to turn the tables.

613
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,840
Yes, Your Highness. So where to?

614
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,341
The Palace.

615
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,011
When suppressed, we must shake things up.

616
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,497
Who is that man?

617
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,920
He is the man who'll protect you.
Keep an eye on him.

618
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,342
Inspector Nam Seon-ho
may only be of sixth-rank,

619
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,136
but he chased all those
that fled the army during the war.

620
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,722
His contribution is as great as the rest.

621
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,099
It's why I invited him
to celebrate with us,

622
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,726
so do not question my decision.

623
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,938
You are absolutely right.

624
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,290
Don't you dare hide from him.

625
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,961
Shoulders back, chin up.

626
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,630
Prince Jeongan will be beneath you.

627
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,465
Face him bravely.

628
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,092
I also escorted the Queen

629
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,511
while the army retreated from Wihwado.

630
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,972
Prince Muan and Prince Uian
were also under my care

631
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,808
which makes my contribution
just as worthy.

632
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,478
So please

633
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:32,023
allow my presence too.

634
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,411
Crown Prince.

635
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,708
You will refrain from such comments.

636
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,043
He must not be called that
until he has been appointed.

637
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,211
Then...

638
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,589
how's this?

639
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,133
I congratulate

640
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,303
our future Crown Prince.

641
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,262
Prince Jeongan!

642
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,266
Uian,

643
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,477
even after you take
your place on the throne,

644
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,605
do not forget about your brother.

645
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,398
I'm sure you remember

646
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,277
that we survived vicious times
and had fun together.

647
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,907
We may have survived tough times
but never did we have fun.

648
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,534
How dare you mock us
with such audacious comments?

649
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,705
Jung Sa-jeong's seat is currently vacant.

650
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:31,541
Take it.

651
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,543
You're the one who made it so anyway.

652
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,048
I'm flustered to hear--

653
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,257
Now!

654
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,264
Your Majesty,

655
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:50,060
how can you ask me to sit
in the seat of a founding contributor?

656
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,228
Put me in the lowest seat

657
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,231
and have me crawl out of here.

658
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,444
You dare try to fool me?

659
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,447
His seat is vacant because you--

660
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,531
Your Majesty.

661
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,752
From relatives of the Royal Family to
petty officials all have private armies.

662
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,421
They are the reason
why there is so much disorder.

663
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,257
Please abolish all private armies

664
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,344
and lay grounds for a peaceful country.

665
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:32,936
That is impossible.

666
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,689
Without His Majesty's Gabyeolcho,

667
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,358
this nation wouldn't have been founded.

668
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,946
The time of confusion is over
and the official military now stands.

669
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:46,491
Why would one need a private army
unless it was for an uprising?

670
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,204
An uprising?

671
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,791
I urge you to refrain from such comments!

672
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,668
Why the hostility?

673
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,714
You sound as if I saw right through you.

674
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,943
How can your shallow insight

675
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,905
see through my thick layers of loyalty?

676
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,366
How can one see what doesn't exist?

677
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,410
The days of disorder are gone, you say?

678
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,249
The Japanese are still invading us

679
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,877
and the barbarians
are still out for blood.

680
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,505
Also, what if the Wang Family
decided to rebel?

681
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,219
Who will stop them?

682
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,138
With your witty words

683
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,932
or your dried up brushes?

684
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,394
How do you expect to defend us

685
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:58,938
with your silly words

686
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,941
that carry no weight or consideration?

687
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,443
Threats against the nation

688
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,780
will be handled by the nation,

689
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,448
not you.

690
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,328
Who do you think you are

691
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:16,915
to question Prince Jeongan's loyalty?

692
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,210
Do you think
we've been holding our tongues

693
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,462
because we are incompetent?

694
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,258
Your Majesty,

695
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:32,180
a decision regarding private armies
shouldn't be made so easily.

696
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,892
Please consider all the ramifications

697
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:39,729
and decide on the best course of action
for the people of this nation.

698
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,607
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

699
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:47,278
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

700
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,628
Why did you cut me off?

701
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:07,173
Prince Jeongan came here to be humiliated.

702
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,968
It was to have his contribution recognized

703
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:13,429
and be pitied by other officials
for the treatment he receives from you.

704
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,472
That is why

705
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,016
I cut off your words.

706
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,269
So did today go as you planned?

707
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,857
Jeongan left with a smile on his face

708
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,608
while you're sitting here stiff.

709
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,528
In my eyes,

710
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,448
he got the best of you.

711
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,657
Actually,

712
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,619
he got the best of me.

713
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,790
From this moment on,
you will not act recklessly.

714
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,835
Cut me off when I'm speaking again

715
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,754
and I'll have your head.

716
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,484
Seeing how your head is still on

717
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,112
proves that His Majesty is getting old.

718
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,241
You were right to cut him off.

719
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:20,747
You made the ministers point
their arrows at you and not the King.

720
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,917
His Majesty doesn't realize it though.

721
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,044
He's just pretending not to know.

722
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,508
You're disbanding private armies, I hear.

723
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,760
Officials below third-rank are my targets.

724
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,221
Don't dirty your blade with useless blood.

725
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,641
Taking out someone high
is how you can rise up.

726
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:47,899
Bang-won is where he is now
because he killed Jeong Mong-ju.

727
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:52,028
If that's how far he's willing to go,
who else wouldn't he kill?

728
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,323
That is fear.

729
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,244
Spread fear upon your adversaries,

730
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,621
not anger.

731
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,666
Bang-won was able to kill Jeong Mong-ju

732
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:08,086
because he had His Majesty on his side.

733
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,256
When I take Bang-won on,

734
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,051
where will you be, Father?

735
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,251
Couldn't you be less in the way?

736
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,378
Kneel.

737
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,962
Who are you to make me kneel?

738
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,547
Your lowly knees--

739
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,093
As if knees have social statuses.

740
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,021
Damn it.

741
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,525
A blind arrow ruined the skin.

742
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:39,112
So you purposely aimed for the neck?

743
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,200
Its ear, not its neck.

744
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,787
Only that way can you preserve the skin.

745
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,332
So what's your name?

746
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,875
I hear it's rude

747
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,586
to ask one's name
without saying yours first.

748
01:01:55,670 --> 01:02:00,174
You fool. The Kangmujang
is not open to the public.

749
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:03,136
Since you're trespassing,

750
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,012
you should be punished, right?

751
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,056
Wrong.

752
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:10,977
Tigers and wolves from the Kangmujang
have been killing in the villages.

753
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,187
It's the nation's job
to stop that from happening.

754
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,274
So punish whoever is responsible first
and then come find me.

755
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,234
I'd gladly take my punishment.

756
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,114
How dare you!

757
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:33,207
Sure thing. You are right.

758
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,417
You're right.

759
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,169
I am

760
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:40,840
Prince Jeongan, also known as
Bang-won of the Yi Family.

761
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,427
I introduced myself, so now I ask you.

762
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,345
What's your name?

763
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,348
It's Hwi.

764
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:50,600
Seo Hwi.

765
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,688
Seo Hwi...

766
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,447
Bang-won went to the Kangmujang.

767
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,157
Round up the men.

768
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,951
We'll strike his arsenal.

769
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,377
If you get bored of the mountains,

770
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,171
seek me out.

771
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,964
I'll put you to good use.

772
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:22,965
I decline.

773
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:25,968
I'd rather be a rooster's head
than a bull's tail.

774
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,178
Besides,

775
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,639
you have enough tails as it is.

776
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,682
Your Highness.

777
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:33,851
There's no doubt you have talent,

778
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:35,937
but you first must learn how to kneel.

779
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,820
-Cheonga?
-Swords aren't used to slaughter chickens.

780
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,615
This is more than enough.

781
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,868
One might think this is
an actual slaughterhouse.

782
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,537
At least give me a sword.

783
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:06,008
Thanks.

784
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,764
He wants me to teach you how to kneel.

785
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:13,474
Who will teach whom?

786
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,393
I will teach you.

787
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:29,323
You're the one who raided the tujeon.

788
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:30,992
Rumors travel fast.

789
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,451
You bastard.

790
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,333
I guess that's enough fun.

791
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,168
Fine, I'll not take your head.

792
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,629
You don't get it, do you?

793
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,131
You're the one who'll die, not me.

794
01:04:58,352 --> 01:04:59,645
It's an ambush!

795
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:29,133
What a shitfest. You have to fire back
for the shooting to stop.

796
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,053
Southwest, end of the hill,
behind the old pine tree.

797
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,184
About 20 steps to the right of the tree.

798
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,193
Want to know how to stop being targeted?

799
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,737
Follow me.

800
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,177
You're good.

801
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,317
I must be getting old.

802
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:40,538
Guards are posted in all
eight directions 100 steps out

803
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:44,709
and the same again in four directions
50 steps out.

804
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,169
So how did you get through?

805
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:51,549
I was already well inside the perimeter.

806
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,052
To hunt wolves, it's better to
lie in wait instead of giving chase.

807
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:57,513
I owe you one.

808
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:00,599
Then let me take the wolf.

809
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,310
That was always yours.

810
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,647
So tell me what you want.

811
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,316
Its skin is enough.

812
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,402
You fool.

813
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:14,989
Aren't you greedy enough
or do you never aim high?

814
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:19,201
How about this then?

815
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,121
Beg for your life.

816
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,423
Bundle him up.

817
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:20,971
-Why is Hwi at Bang-won's residence?
-He was dragged there from the Kangmujang.

818
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,976
-Something must've gone wrong.
-We'll postpone today's raid.

819
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,273
I must see for myself.

820
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,608
He...

821
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:35,111
won't live.

822
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,278
Just cut him loose.

823
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,073
Whether he lives or not
is my call to make,

824
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:41,659
not yours.

825
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:13,440
Cheonga's double scythe is as
threatening as a top warrior's sword.

826
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:18,571
However, some lowly hunter
fought with him for over 20 moves.

827
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,906
However,

828
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,993
even though you can shoot a wolf's ear,

829
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:27,204
you didn't even manage
to wound the assassin.

830
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,585
Is that a coincidence?

831
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:36,130
They say coincidences add up to fate.

832
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,466
Show some mercy, will you?

833
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,680
Then let's find out if we're destined

834
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,432
to cross paths.

835
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:51,395
How did you get here?

836
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,147
On foot.

837
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:55,941
Don't tell me you think
I rode a palanquin.

838
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,152
Stop playing games
and answer me truthfully.

839
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:00,696
Who sent you?

840
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:02,323
Damn it.

841
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,617
How many times must I tell you?

842
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:19,089
Tell me why I shouldn't

843
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:21,842
kill you.

844
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,097
Who are you?

845
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,726
A hunter.

846
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,833
I'll ask you one last time.

847
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,049
Who are you?

848
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:13,769
I guess

849
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:16,563
we weren't meant to be.

850
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,718
Your Highness.

851
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:49,054
You must have something important to say

852
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:51,765
considering how you came all the way here.

853
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,892
I'm not here for you, Your Highness.

854
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,813
I'm here for him.

855
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:47,863
Time is on Bang-won's side now.
Disband all private armies.

856
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:50,032
Sambong is one
who designed a dynasty of 1,000 years.

857
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:51,617
That is your price to pay.

858
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:55,662
I will kill you and all your brothers
and eliminate all threats of the nation.

859
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:58,123
You will never be King.

860
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,584
My sword will only aim at you.

861
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:02,086
I hope

862
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:05,255
you keep watching from your grave.

863
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:09,176
You crossed a line you shouldn't have.

864
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:11,637
Your bravado will cost me a lot.

865
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,846
It could be my life.

866
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,473
How you survive is up to you.

867
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,059
I regret that I tried to save you.

868
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:18,268
I truly do.

869
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:19,853
All I want

870
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,272
is to live one single day in peace.

871
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,652
That is my ultimate dream.
