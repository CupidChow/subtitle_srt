EPISODE 10

4
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,554
Yeon!

5
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,909
Yeon.

6
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,037
Yeon, stay with me.

7
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,081
Yeon.

8
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,501
Hwi.

9
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,211
Don't talk.

10
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,422
If you talk, the bleeding won't stop.

11
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,846
I'm okay.

12
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,849
I'm not in pain.

13
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,809
I said you shouldn't talk.

14
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,396
Don't...

15
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,527
get hurt anymore.

16
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,948
I don't want you

17
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,828
to suffer anymore

18
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,581
because of me.

19
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,143
Where is Seon-ho?

20
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,729
Don't worry.

21
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,439
He's fine.

22
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,199
Hwi.

23
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,160
Yes, Yeon.

24
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,996
You see,

25
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,835
I was happy

26
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,384
because I was your sister.

27
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,312
I was

28
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,234
truly happy.

29
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,728
Yeon.

30
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,486
Yeon.

31
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,539
Yeon.

32
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,586
Yeon.

33
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,673
Yeon...

34
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,692
Don't go.

35
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,278
If you go there,

36
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,823
you'll die too.

37
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,222
Gosh! What the heck?

38
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,987
Nam Jeon!

39
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,599
The poison on the blade is now
spreading through your bloodstream.

40
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,771
Your body will corrode

41
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,232
while your sister's corpse rots.

42
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,112
Why are you so angry?

43
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,907
Are you not the one who got Yeon killed?

44
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,661
You broke your promise.

45
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,955
Hence, she got killed because of you.

46
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,584
I am the one who broke the promise.
Why kill Yeon?

47
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,172
Why her and not me?

48
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,176
Because I know

49
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,514
this will pain you more.

50
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,279
You know nothing about me.

51
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,408
How will you kill me when you do not know
what I am capable of?

52
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,172
I stomped and trod on
countless corpses of my enemies

53
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,510
to come this far.

54
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,595
Do you truly think

55
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,056
that you can take me down?

56
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,645
You puny weakling, how dare you.

57
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,648
Shut up, you son of a bitch!

58
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,404
You had brought your father's corpse to me
and begged me in tears to bury it.

59
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,824
Why did you not bring
your sister's corpse?

60
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,744
If you die as well,

61
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,288
who will bury your sister?

62
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,506
Back off!

63
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,277
Back off,

64
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,534
or I will slay you.

65
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,459
Why put your life on the line
for this little punk?

66
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,918
He is my man.

67
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,671
He protected me,

68
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,506
so I must protect him now.

69
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,678
You were lucky enough
to be born the King's son,

70
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,057
whereas I, unfortunately, wasn't.
That is simply all.

71
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,937
Thus,

72
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,442
I will spare his life.

73
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,452
If you lay even just a finger on him,

74
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,580
I will shred you to pieces
with all the swords that I own.

75
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,540
This is

76
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,126
how I protect my people

77
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,046
and the reason I live.

78
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,643
I do not think you're cut out
to be a swordsman.

79
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,228
Who are you to dare say such a thing?

80
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,191
I told you that I am your teacher.
I am here to teach you swordsmanship.

81
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,901
I pick my own teacher!

82
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,945
Don't step back to avoid my sword.

83
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,655
I told you to block it at an angle.

84
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,117
Use long strokes for stabbing
and short strokes for cutting.

85
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,289
How many times must I tell you?

86
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,917
Just like you said, I pick my own student.

87
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,461
You do not qualify.

88
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,715
You're pretty good.

89
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,639
I am the greatest swordsman of Goryeo.
What? "Pretty good"?

90
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,433
Are you pretty good at archery as well?

91
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,315
Shall I teach you how to avoid being hit?

92
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,274
Sure, tell me.

93
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,775
Shoot.

94
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,786
Why didn't you dodge?

95
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,207
I figured you wouldn't accept me
as your student if I did.

96
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,640
So am I your first student?

97
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,892
My first student

98
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,895
is at home now. It's my son.

99
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,232
I envy him for having
such a great teacher.

100
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:57,915
-Hwi!
-Hwi!

101
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,083
Hwi!

102
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,546
We'll take care of him from here on.

103
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,131
Hey, Beom.

104
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,226
Make sure he recovers.

105
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,406
What?

106
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,117
-Why does the wound look like that?
-Poison.

107
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,204
It's venom from the most venomous snake,
gloydius saxatilis.

108
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,415
We must save

109
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,874
Hwi.

110
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,043
We cannot let him die like this.

111
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,087
We certainly cannot.

112
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,215
I will save him even if I have to suck
all the venom out of him.

113
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,050
Beom, bring me that thing.

114
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,781
Yeon...

115
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,745
waited for you until her last breath.

116
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,520
Nam Jeon

117
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,689
put venom on the dagger.

118
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,025
That son of a bitch.

119
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,117
Will he live?

120
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,494
He is barely breathing at the moment.

121
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,664
Whether he can live or not is up to him.

122
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,985
We should send Yeon off first.

123
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,761
As the chief mourner,

124
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,973
you should go in and say goodbye.

125
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,203
Hwi.

126
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,457
Don't trade the flower patterned shoes.

127
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,876
I'd...

128
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,920
rather hold onto them until they fit.

129
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:21,923
That means

130
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,843
I will at least live until I am older.

131
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,954
My dear sister, Yeon.

132
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,960
I hope this pair of floral shoes
takes you to a good place.

133
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,178
See all the things
that you never got to see

134
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,308
and travel freely.

135
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,836
NAM SEON-HO

136
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,882
I have seen only one facial expression
on your face.

137
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,802
When you're tired, you smile.
When you're annoyed, you smile.

138
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,513
And sometimes, you just smile.

139
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,640
I do?

140
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,060
You can cry on my shoulder.

141
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,771
You have nowhere else to cry.

142
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,887
Yeon...

143
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,368
How is it?

144
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,455
It is quite serious, Your Majesty.

145
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,375
Your Majesty cannot hide this illness
any longer.

146
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,918
How much time

147
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,254
do I have left?

148
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,927
Thank you anyway.

149
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,519
How is the preparation
for the tea party going?

150
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,772
It's...

151
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,204
So six of them suddenly fell ill,

152
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,082
and four of them have
urgent matters to attend to.

153
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,751
Two of them are dealing
with family matters, and three of them

154
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,712
did not even bother to tell us
why they couldn't attend.

155
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,467
What are you waiting for?

156
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,552
Summon all of them at once.

157
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,305
That is why your life was spared.

158
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,349
I received a royal order that I must

159
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,354
distance myself from the Crown Prince
in return for having my life spared.

160
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,819
Hence, the other meritorious subjects
are also distancing themselves.

161
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,948
Half of them have joined hands
with Bang-won,

162
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,575
and the other half

163
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,579
will tiptoe around me.

164
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,794
It lists their weaknesses.

165
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,130
Threaten or report them if you have to.

166
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,881
Do whatever it takes to win them back.

167
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,102
What on earth are you doing?

168
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,020
Bang-won is about to slay you,

169
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:55,316
yet you have all this time to threaten me
with the meritorious subjects' weaknesses.

170
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,282
There is only one way
the Crown Prince can ascend the throne.

171
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,326
You must kneel before Bang-won.

172
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,539
Let His Majesty and the people see
a mother who is desperately doing

173
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,667
everything in her power to save her son?

174
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,795
Only then can you buy yourself some time.

175
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,840
Time for the Crown Prince to grow up

176
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,887
and for me to rise up again. It will also

177
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,601
help you make full use of
the little bit of time

178
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,605
that you have left.

179
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,676
Your Highness,
it looks like it will rain soon.

180
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,763
If I let the Queen stand in the rain,

181
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,641
the people of this country

182
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,935
will pity her, I suppose.

183
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,184
What brings Your Majesty

184
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,729
to this humble place?

185
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,692
This is the first memorial ceremony
of the deceased queen.

186
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,445
I should be here
to pay my respects, of course.

187
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,947
"Queen"?

188
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,576
You were the one who said
she can't be called "Queen"

189
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,787
for she passed away
before the new kingdom was established

190
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,958
and that she can only obtain
the insignificant posthumous name.

191
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,044
That is why I have no choice
but to hold her memorial ceremony

192
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,921
separately like this.

193
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,715
I was simply following the customs.

194
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,717
The kinds of customs
that allow a mere concubine

195
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,844
to become Queen and an illegitimate son

196
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,430
to become Crown Prince?

197
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,687
I asked His Majesty to consider you
one of the founding contributors.

198
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,857
I will attend her memorial ceremony
every year,

199
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,402
and I will send you a heartfelt letter
every month.

200
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,529
I wish to be a good mother to you.

201
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,573
-So--
-Is that why

202
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,784
you tried to assassinate me?

203
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,830
A good mother

204
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,876
would never kill her son.

205
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,389
I beg you.

206
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,975
Give me a chance.

207
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:30,531
Admit your wrongdoings in front of
the people and step down from the throne.

208
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,244
Then Bang-seok will be ousted,

209
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,164
but not killed.

210
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:40,792
How dare you

211
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,836
make such a wicked remark?

212
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:58,351
You only care about the Crown Prince,

213
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,396
but this country is everything to me.

214
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,274
I will gladly endure a bloodbath

215
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,694
if it is necessary to solidify
the foundation of this kingdom

216
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,154
so that it can thrive
for the next 1,000 years.

217
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,492
So don't you dare

218
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,123
denounce me.

219
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,043
Even if

220
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,588
I beg you on my knees

221
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,216
for mercy,

222
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:32,719
you will

223
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,764
kill my son in the end.

224
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,700
This is the medicine you asked for

225
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,869
and some clothes.

226
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,704
I also packed some side dishes.

227
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,457
Thanks, Hwa-wol.

228
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,375
There's no need to thank me.

229
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,798
Is something the matter?

230
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,759
What? Of course not.

231
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,929
Tell me.

232
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,847
What's going on?

233
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,171
Madame Seol...

234
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,008
Hwa-wol...

235
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,306
She never could keep a secret.

236
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,811
Forgive me, Madame Seol.

237
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,523
How could you?

238
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,901
How beautiful is this place you're going

239
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,322
that you wanted to leave
without saying goodbye?

240
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,879
It's a fine place.

241
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:19,343
A place where I don't have
to wear my heavy hairpiece,

242
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,975
and a place where I don't
need to worry about Ihwaru.

243
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,400
It's also where my old friend is.

244
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,120
When I meet her,

245
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:52,168
I'll tell her that her daughter
grew up to be a fine young woman.

246
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,840
A beautiful young lady.

247
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,433
Hui-jae,

248
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,394
I'm sorry...

249
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,147
and grateful.

250
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,489
Help me sit up.

251
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,457
Read it.

252
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,450
"From this moment on,

253
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,455
the head of Ihwaru

254
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,916
is Hui-jae of the Han Family.

255
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,882
You will clear out what no longer exists

256
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,344
and the new head will lead with dignity.

257
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,224
Help your new Madame

258
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,978
and protect Ihwaru.

259
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,441
Cha-su...

260
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,069
Cha-su,

261
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,739
all I can do is apologize.

262
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,161
Help Hui-jae manage Ihwaru."

263
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,371
Madame Seol...

264
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,582
"Hwa-wol,

265
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,586
you will also aid the new head.

266
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,923
Being the talebearer you are,

267
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,719
I suggest you stay clear of trouble
by watching what you say."

268
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,847
I'm good at keeping secrets, you know.

269
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,434
Why are you always on my case?

270
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,648
"Gyeol..."

271
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,362
Madame Seol!

272
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,322
-Madame Seol...
-Madame Seol.

273
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:21,377
Poppy capsules are known
for their wicked ability

274
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,087
that puts you in a state of oblivion.

275
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,256
What is it that you

276
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,341
desperately wish to forget?

277
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,810
I lost someone.

278
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,649
The one person who liked me,

279
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,611
and...

280
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,869
trusted me.

281
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,706
Well, we all have our sob stories.

282
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:42,291
NAM SEON-HO

283
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,153
NAM SEON-HO

284
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,370
You made the right choice.

285
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,414
Do not get attached
to those who aren't worthy.

286
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,416
The world you built for yourself

287
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,753
is for sure a formidable one.

288
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:32,091
I ran around like a silly boy
not realizing it though.

289
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,594
How foolish must I have looked.

290
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,638
Rest.

291
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,103
A world where all deaths are meaningless.

292
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,149
I wish to see that for myself too.

293
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,614
I will rise to the top of that world

294
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,035
and look down
as you die a meaningless death.

295
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,497
Your mother's lowly blood

296
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,418
has finally left your system.

297
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:10,963
And so...

298
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,926
I am left with only your noble blood.

299
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,894
Okay, Yeon.

300
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,690
I'll stick around

301
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,235
a little longer.

302
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,990
Just a little longer.

303
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:30,621
6 YEARS LATER, 1398,
THE FIRST STRIFE OF THE PRINCES

304
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,089
Where are the King's bodyguards?

305
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,800
They'll arrive soon.

306
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,512
The Crown Prince has grown up now

307
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,764
and Bang-won disbanded his private army.

308
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,974
You seem to be going
to unnecessary lengths.

309
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,354
The Crown Prince's heart
continues to weaken

310
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,773
and we don't know
when Bang-won will attack us again.

311
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,485
If the King doesn't
vacate the throne right away,

312
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,530
In the end,

313
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,367
we will all be slaughtered.

314
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,917
You have pledged your loyalty
to the Crown Prince in words.

315
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,297
I will add my seal to it.

316
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,471
And with the support of the royal family,

317
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,849
we will dethrone the King.

318
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,060
I...

319
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,438
will make a nation ruled by the subjects.

320
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,359
That will be...

321
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,448
our nation.

322
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:57,040
NAM JEON

323
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,632
Who is it?

324
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,837
Even though my hearing
isn't what it used to be,

325
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,255
I still hear things.

326
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,677
Your nickname is a king with a gat?

327
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,971
It's only a rumor.

328
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,849
Please don't be bothered by it.

329
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:59,311
From meritorious subjects
to members of the royal family,

330
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,812
many have joined his side.

331
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,650
I hardly doubt it's just a rumor.

332
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:09,446
There is even a rumor going around
that Prince Jeongan will be the next king.

333
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:10,906
Only the one who spread it

334
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,575
would be aware of such absurdity.

335
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:19,247
You must be wishing for me to die soon.

336
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:24,002
Only then, you can fight for the throne.

337
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,212
Your Majesty, that is--

338
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,339
It is why I'm warning you in advance.

339
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:30,008
Anyone who mentions
my abdication of the throne

340
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,513
will have its family torn to pieces.

341
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,516
So...

342
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,811
I urge you

343
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,689
to refrain yourselves.

344
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,155
An abdication?

345
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,867
No, His Majesty must live out a long life.

346
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,244
I'm sure

347
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,287
that will only make you

348
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,915
nervous by the second though.

349
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,711
The fact that he is well

350
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,463
is a blessing to me and our nation.

351
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,717
So why would you say I'm getting anxious?

352
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,597
My lord!

353
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:21,852
Your Highness.

354
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,187
Right, then.

355
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,499
They were all slayed?

356
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,128
-What about the bodyguards?
-They disappeared.

357
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,796
This is now the second time.

358
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,178
We have a leak.

359
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,765
The people who knew about it are us three

360
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,349
and...

361
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:07,063
Assistant Director of the Privy Council.

362
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,329
How dare you!

363
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:30,629
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

364
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,235
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

365
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,653
THE PRIVY COUNCIL

366
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,030
What...

367
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,659
Did you eliminate the Assistant Director
of the Privy Council?

368
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,999
Would you have liked to
handle it yourself?

369
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,169
The royal bodyguards...

370
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,088
Was it Bang-won's doing?

371
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,298
Bang-won may be rampageous,

372
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,260
but unlike someone,
he doesn't bribe people.

373
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,263
I was hoping to

374
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,390
wrap up this deal myself.

375
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,810
There's a guard coming from Ming today.

376
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:28,770
Via which quay?

377
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,607
I can't say.

378
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,776
He will be there

379
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,946
and another guard will be slayed.

380
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,531
I have it under control.

381
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,034
You don't need to be concerned.

382
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,870
I think I must.

383
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,497
I don't care how many guards you intend

384
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,875
to shove into the mouths
of the royal family.

385
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,335
A dethronement is all I need.

386
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,672
If anyone gets in the way of that,

387
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,302
I will slay my way through them.

388
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,830
Is this a coincidence?

389
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,790
No, I was waiting for you.

390
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,084
You waited for a lowlife like me?

391
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,587
You must have a lot of time on your hands.

392
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:38,340
Your father

393
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,801
slaughtered his comrades
to win a spot at His Majesty's side.

394
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,013
Meanwhile, you achieved your title

395
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:48,266
at the expense of
your best friend and his sister.

396
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,018
It's like a mutt

397
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,646
gave birth to another mutt.

398
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,274
A mutt, did you say?

399
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,906
You and I are alike.

400
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,701
We both tried to harm our own fathers.

401
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,788
You did what you could
to give your father the throne.

402
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,498
And now, you're trying to steal it.

403
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,083
Actually,

404
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,670
you put him on the throne
to steal it away.

405
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,172
It's what I plan to do as well.

406
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,219
You have changed a lot.

407
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:25,845
Finally,

408
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,098
you've become an interesting adversary.

409
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,686
Your Highness.

410
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,524
Could you go as far

411
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,654
as to killing His Majesty?

412
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:56,918
I will...

413
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,422
never do that.

414
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,217
Then it seems like

415
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,595
we have our differences.

416
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:19,190
Guards that were carefully selected
for the job were slayed mercilessly.

417
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,904
He's a skilled swordsman.

418
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,991
How many quays

419
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,077
are in Hanyang again?

420
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,113
Stop!

421
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,074
Treat them with care.

422
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,286
These aren't just broads but commodities.

423
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:21,336
I hear that Joseon women
are worth more than gold in Ming.

424
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,714
Who knows? She might be my jackpot.

425
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,724
-Please...
-Get in.

426
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,651
Please don't do this, my lord!

427
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,992
We have the gold vase, so we just
need to load the silk and the women.

428
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,287
I see we don't have company today.

429
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,832
Only a crazy buffoon
will dare attack us here.

430
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:07,549
Don't get your hopes up.

431
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,551
None of you will survive this.

432
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,094
Kill him!

433
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,214
Do you have any idea who I am?

434
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,300
I am the Minister of Military Affairs.

435
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,135
So?

436
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,642
The Minister of Military Affairs is dead?

437
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,570
-What about the gold vase?
-They're gone.

438
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,740
If we can't deliver
the gold vase before the blood ceremony,

439
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,409
the members of the royal family
will turn their backs on us.

440
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,287
BLOOD CEREMONY: A RITUAL OF DRINKING BLOOD
TO PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE

441
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:07,872
Find them.

442
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,961
Search every corner of Hanyang
if you have to and just find them!

443
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:20,718
I bet you're as feeble
as a 90-year-old man.

444
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,553
How long has it been since you got it up?

445
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,846
Three to five years maybe?

446
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,765
How did you know that?

447
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,686
Let me tell you about this.

448
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,563
It's a pill that'll
even erect a rotten pole.

449
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,732
Take one and see
your urine go over the fence.

450
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,526
-Take two and--
-You'll die.

451
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:37,694
Yes, you'll die.

452
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,864
You're an army physician now,

453
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,158
but you're still selling drugs.

454
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,368
Leader.

455
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,078
Don't call me that.

456
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:50,164
Private armies were disbanded
and we're here as servants.

457
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,379
Look at you high up in the ranks.

458
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:57,922
It's a nice look.

459
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,425
Whatever.

460
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,594
They say where you stand
changes what you see.

461
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:06,973
How is it?
Do you get dizzy from way up there?

462
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:10,601
Wait, where are your yellow teeth?

463
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,228
Enjoy it while you can

464
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,357
because your heads will soon be cracked.

465
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:19,444
Are you jealous of
what I have achieved for myself?

466
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,945
You know,

467
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:24,532
in a war, half of the men die
after being stabbed in the back.

468
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,785
Don't forget that
I'm always watching you from behind.

469
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,204
Why you bastard--

470
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:31,748
-No...
-Enough!

471
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,334
Your Highness.

472
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,795
Good day to you too.

473
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,883
I hear that many have
sword wielding servants

474
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:43,342
instead of private soldiers.

475
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,635
The rumors must be true.

476
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:47,847
Look at you, big man. You're like a bear.

477
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,474
You must be Jeong Beom.

478
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,142
You know me, Your Highness?

479
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,602
How could I not know you?

480
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,939
They say you have flawless skills
and can patch any wound up

481
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,733
without leaving scars.

482
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:01,527
How do you know about us all?

483
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,321
Do you have a spy among us?

484
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,534
From what I hear,
there's a man who ended Nam Jeon.

485
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:13,498
He's not only a deadly archer
but a skilled swordsman too.

486
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,751
We don't know anything.

487
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:21,589
You don't?

488
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:26,302
When you do...

489
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,055
Seo Hwi.

490
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,686
Let him know that I wish to see him.

491
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,693
Bang-won, there you are!

492
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:45,780
Bang-won, it's your brother.

493
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:54,705
So,

494
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,083
how is Chi-do doing?

495
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,252
You have no idea.

496
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:02,046
Do you know who's the busiest
in all of Joseon?

497
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,465
It's Chi-do.

498
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,031
I won, so give me a spot too.

499
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,201
If these were real swords,
you would've died first.

500
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,246
If they were real swords,
I would've fought another way.

501
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,550
Graze even my clothing and you're in.

502
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,779
Those who are stupidly bold
die first on the battlefield

503
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,739
just like you.

504
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,283
Go home.

505
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:18,205
The rice I get paid with will be enough
to feed me and my mother for a year.

506
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,584
This is all that I can do,
so please give me a chance.

507
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,588
Your mother

508
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:28,674
will want you to live
more than she wants that rice.

509
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,400
This...

510
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:50,112
is wild ginseng of 100 years.

511
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:52,907
Try it.

512
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:06,921
Are you out of your mind?

513
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:08,839
You toss something so precious?

514
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:11,175
This is a balloon flower root.

515
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:13,761
Goodness.

516
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:15,638
You have eyes of a hawk.

517
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,184
I don't think I asked you to come.

518
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:23,938
I hear that someone
has been choking Nam Jeon's throat.

519
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:26,357
He lost something important.

520
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:29,360
You talk too much, you know.

521
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:30,528
And you...

522
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,866
are hiding too many things.

523
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,036
Cut it out with the jokes

524
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:42,039
and hand over your private army
you've been hiding.

525
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,089
This time, you could die.

526
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:52,008
The King won't show mercy

527
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,884
even though you're his son.

528
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,764
By father or by brother.
Dying is dying, isn't it?

529
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,810
What I do is for survival.

530
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:05,896
I wish to survive this.

531
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,398
Bang-gan.

532
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,863
Kneel before me

533
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:17,116
and I will make sure you don't die.

534
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,632
This is way better than
the one in Gaegyeong.

535
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:36,302
They must've earned a lot of money.

536
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,732
What's so good about these dried grass?

537
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,903
On a warm sunny day like this,

538
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,280
nothing is better than a drink.

539
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:58,240
Yes, I also like drinking in the day.

540
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,910
After one or two,
you don't recognize your parents.

541
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,955
You must be lost.
The courtesan house is that way.

542
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,124
No, I'm in the right place.

543
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,710
Could you perhaps
look after my money for me?

544
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:11,462
I can't trust anyone these days.

545
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:12,671
But you don't know me either.

546
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:16,884
Have we...

547
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,303
met before?

548
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:22,848
It's me.

549
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:24,809
I'm a neat man.

550
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,939
And my teeth are all white and clean.

551
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:34,110
My goodness.

552
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:36,278
Oh dear.

553
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:41,659
You look as cute as a bunny
when you're surprised.

554
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:47,289
What happened? Did you sharpen
your teeth on a whetstone or what?

555
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:50,751
I rubbed them my ass off with this brush.

556
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,503
What is this?

557
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:56,006
It's wild-boar hair glued to a stick.

558
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:59,677
You should try brushing your teeth
with some bamboo salt.

559
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,803
Three times a day.

560
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,559
Your breath smells good too.

561
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:08,894
It used to stink.

562
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,020
So...

563
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,690
do you want to come closer and smell it?

564
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:35,004
I almost fell for his cute face.

565
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,799
Well...

566
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:40,718
Wait.

567
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:46,557
I like a man who tries hard.

568
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:59,945
Shuffle the dominoes and exchange hearts.

569
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,031
And make out?

570
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:07,036
All right.

571
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:10,915
Did you hear
about Minister of Military Affairs?

572
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:13,626
How would a mere woman like me know
what happens out there?

573
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:20,299
Then you might not know
that Lord Nam is being considered.

574
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,301
He is?

575
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,012
You seem displeased about it.

576
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:27,598
Do you...

577
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:29,934
want me to get rid of him?

578
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:35,356
Madame Han, why would you say that?

579
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:38,692
I already eliminated
all his political opponents.

580
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,570
It's a shame that you are
pretending not to know about it.

581
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,240
Not just his political opponents.

582
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:47,952
She took care of gossip about your affairs

583
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:51,121
and settled your gambling debts.

584
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,040
Gosh, I'm out of breath.

585
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,086
That's not true.

586
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,588
Why would I pretend
not to know all about it?

587
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:03,133
So what is it you want?

588
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:08,597
I want to take charge
of signal-fire soldiers and policies

589
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:10,391
of the Ministry of War.

590
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:11,850
Is that it?

591
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:15,521
It's an unimportant post where you light
signal fires and bring tidings.

592
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,982
Sometimes an unimportant post
becomes important.

593
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:34,540
SEO YEON

594
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:56,770
Before her death,

595
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:59,481
Her Highness used to
make a wish like this.

596
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:02,860
Whatever it is,

597
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,029
it can't come true.

598
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:11,160
I only hope

599
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,413
they rest in peace up there.

600
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,618
Did you

601
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:36,662
see his face?

602
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:41,834
I barely recognized the shape of him.

603
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,794
There's someone who saw him.

604
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:56,181
She hurt her leg,
so she couldn't run away.

605
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:14,450
Please spare me.

606
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,171
Have you not found him yet?

607
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,256
I apologize, my lord.

608
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:53,030
Is it the missing golden vase?

609
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:08,879
TODAY IN BAMBOO GROVE AT 4 P.M.

610
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,152
Are you sure?

611
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:16,863
Yes, I am.

612
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,962
If it's a lie, you and your whole family

613
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:34,798
will be slaughtered in cold blood.

614
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:41,888
I'm asking you one last time.

615
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:46,560
Is this correct?

616
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:58,280
I'll take you in

617
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:00,699
without your underlings.

618
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:36,336
Once I step down,

619
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,964
Nam Jeon will leave
the Crown Prince by the nose.

620
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:41,591
And Bang-won will try to kill him.

621
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:45,345
Now Nam Jeon and Bang-won will
attempt to kill each other.

622
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:49,391
All you need to do is
set up the battlefield, Your Majesty.

623
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:52,102
I will readily douse myself with blood

624
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:54,187
if someone has to do so.

625
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:56,106
Only I can do it.

626
01:18:56,648 --> 01:18:58,692
Be honest for once in your life.

627
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:02,529
You just wanted to have your own country.

628
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:04,990
I don't care about a nation
or a great cause.

629
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:06,199
I'm not even interested.

630
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:09,202
All I want to do is destroy Nam Jeon.

631
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:10,871
I never keep my enemies alive.

632
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:13,874
I guess you're probably my next enemy.

633
01:19:13,957 --> 01:19:15,625
Let's wait and see

634
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:18,837
which of us will be slaughtered first.
