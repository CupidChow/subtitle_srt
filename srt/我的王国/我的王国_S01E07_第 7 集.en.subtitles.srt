00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,475
THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

2
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,977
SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARACTERS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,032
Your Highness.

4
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,160
You must have something important to say

5
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,746
considering how you came all the way here.

6
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,873
I'm not here for you, Your Highness.

7
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,794
I'm here for him.

8
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,102
Step aside. I am carrying a sword
from the Office of the Inspector General.

9
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,395
Here,

10
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,773
that sword is nothing special.

11
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,238
Let's see.

12
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,329
It will be

13
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,414
fun to watch.

14
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,551
I know

15
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,053
that you killed Jung Sa-jeong.

16
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,228
Who ordered you to kill him?

17
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,407
You will die here
if you keep your lips sealed.

18
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,950
But if you tell me,

19
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,286
I will put my position on the line
to keep you safe.

20
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,665
If that person is here,

21
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:47,959
point at him.

22
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,516
This is the only way
your life can be spared.

23
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:05,977
Say it!

24
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,663
Who are you to talk about killing me
or even keeping me safe?

25
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,757
I will figure out a way to survive myself,

26
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,136
so stop sticking your nose
into others' business and get lost.

27
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,328
Will you be able to handle
the consequences?

28
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,376
Your Highness will be the one

29
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,879
that has to deal
with the consequences later on.

30
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,404
If you're going to kill me,
just do it now.

31
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,406
If you plan to keep me alive,

32
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,826
get me a glass of water.

33
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,457
EPISODE 7

34
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,209
That was reckless.

35
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,878
Had he told us,
you would have been killed on the spot.

36
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,964
Things are going according to our plan.

37
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,257
Don't you get it?

38
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,635
Because of that lowly punk,
everything could have been over

39
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,929
for both you and me,
who's putting everything on the line.

40
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,222
Don't whine.

41
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,682
Personal feelings

42
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,267
make your sword dull.

43
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,647
What will you do about the arsenal?

44
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,317
We even got the Capital Patrol involved.
If things go south,

45
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,028
you will be held accountable
for everything.

46
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,989
We will stick to our plan.

47
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,378
He could not have done it alone.

48
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,796
He must have

49
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,132
people helping him.

50
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,342
Catch them all.

51
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,320
So you killed Jung Sa-jeong?

52
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,783
Eighty percent of my support squad
soldiers used to be roughnecks.

53
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,118
They are vicious and decisive,

54
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,204
but I cannot entrust them
with important tasks.

55
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,664
Men like you who can devise plans

56
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,459
and read others' moves are rare.

57
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,460
It sounds like

58
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,796
you find me suspicious.

59
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,297
You pique my interest.

60
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,132
That is another way of putting it.

61
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,470
Let's hear it.

62
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,473
Why did you approach me?

63
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,768
This lowborn man thought Your Highness

64
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,062
was a rope that will lead him
to better things.

65
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,690
I wanted to turn my life around,

66
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:43,111
but it turns out that the rope is rotten,
and so are all the weapons.

67
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,155
Everything's rotten. Damn it.

68
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,418
The weapons are rotten?

69
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,671
The swords are bent out of shape,

70
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,464
and all the spears
are practically useless.

71
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,634
Why don't you go check
if you don't believe me?

72
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,681
You are

73
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,226
trying to lure me.

74
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,644
But I'm just wondering...

75
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,729
What if those weapons are seized

76
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,107
by the Office of the Inspector General?

77
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,740
It's a trap.

78
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,242
Let's go to the arsenal.

79
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,160
Your Highness.

80
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,705
We'll take him.

81
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,555
Break it down.

82
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,248
What are you doing?

83
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,132
Having a private arsenal
is considered treason.

84
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,843
Anyone who refuses to give it up
must be executed on the spot

85
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,012
as per His Majesty's orders.

86
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,889
I bet you trust
someone will look after you

87
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,641
for you to act up like this.

88
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,851
I only trust myself.

89
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,232
Behead anyone who rebels,
regardless of their ranks.

90
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,735
Attention!

91
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,904
The moment they open the door,

92
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,240
we shall slaughter them all.

93
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,503
I will open that door.

94
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,217
You can all be slaughtered in fear.

95
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,077
I was amused

96
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,121
by how you dared to slay my horse

97
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,457
and even come to my residence
all by yourself.

98
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,709
I give you credit for your bravery.

99
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,461
However,

100
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,838
this was out of line.

101
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,174
There will be

102
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,051
consequences.

103
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,511
I won't avoid it.

104
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,484
Let's go.

105
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,237
It is pure iron, not even cast iron.
And both the hammering

106
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,905
and tempering were done so clumsily.

107
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,449
Just go exchange it
with some taffy or something.

108
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,703
Where did you move all the weapons?

109
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,959
I asked you where the weapons are.

110
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,757
"The treacherous ministers

111
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,718
are deliberately distressing His Majesty
using private armies as an excuse,

112
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,012
and they are even threatening me,
a prince,

113
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,723
which is beyond deplorable.

114
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,683
Hence,

115
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,061
I send all the weapons I own
to the Office of the Inspector General,

116
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,730
so do not doubt my loyalty any longer."

117
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,984
Said His Highness Prince Jeongan.

118
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,489
You offered them up
to the Inspector General?

119
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,201
Not exactly. I discarded them for you.

120
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,120
Just dump those useless pieces of junk

121
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,122
and get yourself
properly made swords and spears.

122
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,623
How dare you.

123
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,544
By dumping the useless weapons,
you managed to

124
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,173
help me regain His Majesty's trust

125
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,675
and made Nam Seon-ho appear guilty

126
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,849
of falsely accusing me?

127
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,560
Correct.

128
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,110
What should I do

129
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,529
with this punk?

130
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,586
IHWARU

131
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,299
This must be your second visit to Ihwaru.

132
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,218
Why is that important?

133
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,223
This might end up being your last visit.

134
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,314
They should all leave.

135
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,565
Yes, Your Highness.

136
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,454
Hui-jae.

137
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,760
Your Highness.

138
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,852
I know that man.

139
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,488
Right, the two of you
have probably met before.

140
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,241
This place still reeks
of Jung Sa-jeong's blood.

141
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,618
Will there be another bloodshed?

142
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,246
Today, I am just here to enjoy some wine.

143
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,789
Do not be concerned.

144
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,029
Why are you not eating?
It melts in your mouth.

145
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,656
Are you made of rock

146
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,783
or steel?

147
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:11,911
Or did your mother

148
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,331
feed you wild ginseng
instead of breastmilk?

149
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,208
I am talking about you.

150
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,294
I've seen people dying of starvation,

151
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,129
but never from eating too much.

152
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,424
Food helps lessen the pain
when you are getting beaten up.

153
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,635
They say everyone who gets beaten up
surrenders.

154
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,137
I suppose you are an exception.

155
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,890
They say you grow pitiful of the one
whom you beat up. Who knows?

156
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,850
We may end up becoming quite close.

157
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,317
You seem to live
as if there is no tomorrow.

158
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,736
Who can live tomorrow
when tomorrow isn't even here yet?

159
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,697
I asked you a silly question,
yet you gave such a wise answer.

160
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,120
Your Highness.

161
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,751
You said you are a hunter.

162
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,045
Then I am curious.

163
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,922
How do you catch a tiger?

164
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,591
You have to corner it.

165
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,469
Corner it toward a dead-end
and distract it with dogs.

166
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,306
Then immobilize it with an arrow
and pierce its throat with a spear.

167
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,558
Is that right?

168
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,562
I see. I should use that method as well.

169
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,839
How odd.

170
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,967
You were unfazed even when you had

171
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,094
a sword pointed at your neck.

172
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,887
They didn't do anything. Let them go.

173
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,681
They seem to have had a hand in it.

174
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,266
Your Highness!

175
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,000
This arrowhead and pheasant feather.

176
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,336
This is mine.

177
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,971
I shall lead this game from now on.

178
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,058
Lying will cost you your lives.

179
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,143
You will also die
if your words don't match.

180
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,730
Thus, if you wish to live,

181
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,649
you must tell the truth.
There is no other way.

182
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,486
Now, let me ask you.

183
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,906
Who sent you?

184
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,962
You will be beheaded if you do not answer.

185
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,465
I will ask you one last time.

186
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,134
Who sent you?

187
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,308
Behead them.

188
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,320
Cover me!

189
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,585
We were the advance troop
dispatched to Liaodong.

190
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,589
We were abandoned after being used
and trampled all over.

191
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,924
In my eyes,

192
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,551
you are no different.

193
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,846
We dirtied our hands with blood
for this country,

194
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,807
but that blood is only used to deride us.

195
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,225
That is your and our situation.

196
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,020
So?

197
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,188
Your Highness' country.

198
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,190
The country of the abandoned.

199
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,151
I wished to see it with you.

200
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,363
That is my answer. Now, it's your turn
to give me your answer.

201
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,886
The country of the abandoned?

202
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,222
You wish to see my kingdom?

203
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,725
That is correct.

204
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,066
What you just said

205
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,695
saved your life.

206
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,256
Stop by my residence.

207
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,092
I shall give you my answer then.

208
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,700
Hwi!

209
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,914
Take him to the room. Hurry.

210
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,168
They ambushed you, Your Highness.

211
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,545
Why spare their lives?

212
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,217
They devised a plan,
incapacitated my soldiers,

213
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,678
and even got an inspector involved

214
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,305
and took him down.
Not many people can do that.

215
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,017
That is why I spared their lives.

216
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,360
There seems to be a hidden story
behind all this.

217
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,570
Find out.

218
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,079
Be honest.

219
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,582
How many of those paralytic pills
did you take?

220
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:14,958
Ten.

221
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,045
Jeez, has he completely
lost his mind or what?

222
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,005
I wanted a painless death.

223
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,673
I have to say,

224
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,092
Bang-won scares me.

225
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,346
I couldn't help but take those pills
when I saw his eyes.

226
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,638
This won't be an easy fight.

227
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,348
I could almost see,

228
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,601
"I will become King of this country,"

229
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,478
engraved on his forehead.

230
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,856
I think he's certainly capable
of shaking things up.

231
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:38,899
Beom, it sounds like

232
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,068
you've taken a liking to Bang-won.

233
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,238
Who knows?

234
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,491
He may get me a family register
when he's in a good mood

235
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,909
after ascending the throne.

236
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,330
I brought you some water.

237
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,500
My, how dazzling.

238
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,169
They say that fairies have wings.

239
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,712
Where are your wings?

240
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,343
Well, I guess your tongue isn't paralyzed.

241
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,762
Hwa-wol, can you

242
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,432
get me the antidote from my chest pocket?

243
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,893
Goodness, what the heck?

244
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,394
Don't be like that.

245
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:20,023
It's inside my left chest pocket.
Take it out for me.

246
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,691
Goodness.

247
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,401
Unbelievable.

248
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,779
-Get a taste of this.
-Gosh, it's cold!

249
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,864
Jeez, I'm so embarrassed for you.

250
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,658
Hwa-wol, please.

251
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,619
Just die, you fool. Goodness.

252
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,832
Hwa-wol, wait.
You pig, what is your problem?

253
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,667
-You lunatic!
-You embarrass me so much.

254
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,711
By the way, the medicine you gave me
worked quite well.

255
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,464
Thanks to you, scabs have already formed
on my head.

256
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,593
How is Hwi doing?

257
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,179
He's asleep, so don't worry.

258
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,978
Hwa-wol, wait.

259
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,397
-You lunatic!
-You embarrass me so much.

260
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,660
Don't disappear like that ever again.

261
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,083
I do not want to lose you again.

262
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,966
There are so many things
that I never got to do with you.

263
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,597
I want to walk through
the plum blossoms with you in spring.

264
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,936
In autumn, we'll walk
on dry fallen leaves on the ground.

265
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,899
And I want to walk in the snow
with you in winter.

266
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,488
Is it because we met
and parted ways in summer?

267
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,034
I want to experience

268
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,747
other seasons with you as well.

269
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,590
I mean, we should have something
to remember each other by.

270
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,472
That much we can do.

271
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,935
I don't think

272
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,814
I'm being greedy.

273
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,111
But I remember everything.

274
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,701
All the colors I saw
on the day I first met you,

275
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,625
the pleasant breeze on that happy day,

276
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,673
and even the rain on the day that I left.

277
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,681
I kept reliving all those memories
over and over in my head

278
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,647
but still couldn't stop missing you.

279
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,422
Are you going to begin now?

280
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,424
I've already begun.

281
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,303
I am not intervening because I cannot cut
the unrelenting ties between you two,

282
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,474
but I will not forgive you
if Hui-jae gets hurt because of you.

283
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,394
You must keep your promise.

284
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,148
That is why I'm doing this.

285
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,855
Keep your distance from Hwi
and just watch him from afar.

286
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,065
That is why I allowed you to not

287
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,984
give up your feelings for him.

288
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,277
Hwi and I

289
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,030
go way back
to when General Seo Geom was alive.

290
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,284
I will continue to try
to get close to him,

291
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,370
and I will get my hands
on the information about my mother,

292
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,540
which General Seo made sure to protect.

293
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,545
It is out of my hands now.

294
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,214
It went to someone
who needs it more than you do.

295
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,260
Who is that person?

296
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,512
Who is more desperate than I am?

297
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,222
Your goal is revenge,

298
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,558
but that person is trying to save a life,

299
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,435
so he needs it more desperately.

300
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,728
Madame Seol.

301
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,033
Bring me a fresh set of clothes.

302
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,328
Hui-jae, you may leave.

303
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,413
Madame Seol.

304
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,624
Go on!

305
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,175
Go ahead and give me your excuse.

306
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,594
You are the one who told me
to earn Bang-won's trust.

307
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,846
I simply did what I had to do.

308
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,140
I have no reason to list excuses.

309
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,770
You crossed a line you shouldn't have.

310
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,898
Your bravado will cost me a lot.

311
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,651
My position, my rank,

312
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,612
and perhaps even my life.

313
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,572
Whether you can survive or not
is up to you,

314
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,033
just like when I was deserted in Liaodong.

315
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,333
You said Liaodong was like hell to you.

316
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,879
To me, every day was
a battleground and a living hell.

317
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,006
All the mockery and contempt.

318
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,511
I gritted my teeth and endured it all
to come this far.

319
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,222
So listen up now.

320
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,432
If you get in my way,

321
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,561
don't expect mercy
because even you will be slain. No...

322
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,939
I will have to slay you because it is you.

323
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,408
I regret that I tried to save you.

324
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,035
I truly do.

325
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,668
Survive.

326
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,422
I mean it.

327
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,804
I only see one name in all these petitions
that are pouring in.

328
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,349
"Inspector Nam Seon-ho
must be interrogated, punished,

329
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,560
removed from his post, and executed."

330
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,897
Look at this. I see your name as well.

331
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,649
"He is using his son
to persecute the royal relatives.

332
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,360
He deserves a harsh warning
and must be reprimanded.

333
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,154
He should be dismissed at once."

334
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,656
I truly apologize, Your Majesty.

335
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,491
Your job is to deliver my orders

336
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,285
and oversee all military matters.

337
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,579
Why can't you keep
your personal matters separate

338
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,997
and let your son affect your work?

339
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,042
I would like to execute you and your son

340
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,669
to set a deterrent example,

341
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,630
but I will decide otherwise

342
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,758
due to all your contributions and the fact
that you are deeply repenting.

343
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,218
Inspector Nam Seon-ho
will be removed from his position,

344
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,929
and he will be demoted to the ninth rank.

345
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,097
The Ministry of Law Enforcement

346
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,891
will continue to investigate this matter.

347
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:20,688
Your Majesty, how could you reprimand
the Director of the Privy Council?

348
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,774
He abused his power.

349
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,442
He deceived the royal family.

350
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,986
He must be punished severely.

351
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,614
Please reconsider your decision,
Your Majesty.

352
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,742
-Please reconsider your decision.
-Please reconsider your decision.

353
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,121
That is impossible.

354
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,834
Your Majesty, why would you
side with the Chief Secretary?

355
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,628
His disrespect must be punished severely

356
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,089
to prevent any trouble in the future.

357
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,340
That is impossible.

358
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,926
So stop pleading.

359
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,144
My title should have been taken as well.

360
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,941
Without you, who would dare
to fight against Prince Jeongan?

361
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,859
Sambong?

362
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,113
He can't.

363
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:14,033
Sambong must direct
the transfer of the capital

364
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,369
and establish the laws and institutions
of this country.

365
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,416
You saved my life at Mount Huang

366
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,794
and you saved my life again
from those who plotted to murder me.

367
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,755
That's why it's you.

368
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,841
You are the only one I have.

369
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,858
Time is on Bang-won's side now.

370
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,652
Disband all private armies.

371
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,404
Otherwise,

372
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,449
Bang-seok won't be the crown prince.

373
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,591
Because Sambong is the one
who designed a dynasty of 1,000 years.

374
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,178
I'm supposed to do the dogfight?

375
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,565
Fine.

376
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,028
If that is what you want so badly,
I will remove them.

377
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,913
The child's fault is the father's flaw.

378
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,625
But you are making
a pretext of your title,

379
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,837
let alone giving it up.

380
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,800
I may be the son of a concubine,

381
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,968
but I'm still his son.

382
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,347
What do you think

383
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,142
would have happened if the King resigned

384
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,313
when you beat Poeun to death?

385
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,024
Do you remember

386
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,693
what I said?

387
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,448
The new country isn't yours.

388
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,325
It's my father's.

389
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,828
It's my father's nation.

390
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,496
And...

391
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,499
also mine.

392
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,169
Of course I do.

393
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,507
How can I forget the arrogance?

394
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,438
This country is not a King's country.

395
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,607
So...

396
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,820
do not dare to call this country yours.

397
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,948
Then whose country is it?

398
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,000
It's the subjects' country.

399
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,960
Only then,

400
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,090
even a foolish king or a tyrant king
can't bring down the country.

401
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:18,801
You...

402
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,762
will never be King.

403
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,639
Why can't the fifth son be the King

404
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,683
when the mere eighth son tries to become

405
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:27,977
the crown prince?

406
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,688
You just

407
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,150
watch it in your grave.

408
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,530
Watch who will be

409
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,533
the King.

410
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,637
INSPECTOR

411
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,398
Go straight home and find Yeon.

412
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,777
Tell her I won't be home for about 15 days
because of the inspection.

413
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,906
She will worry. Ask for enough clothes
to change to calm her down.

414
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,616
But it's not the inspection period.

415
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,036
I got it, sir.

416
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,043
Go.

417
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,924
You're arrested for personally commanding
Office of the Inspector General,

418
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,594
Nam Seon-ho, and the Capital Patrol, and
threatening the royal family with a sword.

419
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,485
The longer you endure the whipping,
the longer the torture will be.

420
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,030
You had better spit out a few names
to make it easier for the both of us.

421
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,491
There is no name to spit out.

422
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,910
That's why I'm enduring it.

423
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,664
You do what you have to do.

424
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,125
Well, then...

425
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,210
This bag has underwear in it,
and this has outer clothing.

426
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,133
Actually, I think I should give them
to him myself.

427
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,843
Where do you think you are going?

428
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,690
I told you to refrain from going out.

429
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,859
Did you forget?

430
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,779
I will just deliver them
to Seon-ho, my brother.

431
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,238
Your brother?

432
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,118
You are not his sister.

433
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,080
Sir.

434
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,415
Do you know why
Seon-ho can't come back home?

435
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,834
It's because of you.

436
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,379
You are the cause.

437
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,551
From now on, don't do anything
in this house but breathe.

438
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:48,886
Actually,

439
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,224
ask for my permission when you breathe.

440
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,230
Lock her up in the shed.

441
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,481
Yes, sir.

442
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:10,199
Did something happen to my brother?
I mean, Young Master Nam?

443
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,201
Please tell me. Please!

444
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,496
What has happened?

445
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,874
Did he get hurt?

446
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,211
Just tell me he's fine!

447
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,257
Open the door! Open it!

448
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,053
Open the door.

449
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,362
Stop.

450
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,544
Do you know what you did?

451
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,796
It was the only and the quickest way

452
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,465
to support Bang-won.

453
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,009
Seon-ho was removed
from his position, and I...

454
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,553
got humiliated.

455
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:58,057
You are alive and well,
and all Bang-won's weapons are seized.

456
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,267
You didn't lose anything.

457
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,357
Bang-won

458
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,985
must be killed by his own soldier.

459
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,239
That way, I won't suffer a disadvantage

460
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,366
and will have a good reason
to remove his soldiers.

461
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,952
So hold in and hide your anger

462
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,912
until you get a command.

463
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,040
Just like now.

464
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,794
I will keep that in mind

465
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,838
and never forget it.

466
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,259
You can hold in your anger pretty well.

467
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,553
I barely manage to hide it.

468
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,057
About Yeon...

469
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:45,104
You said you would take good care of her
as if she was your own.

470
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,608
Are you keeping your word?

471
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,662
I told you to live and die for me.

472
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,124
Have you been keeping your word?

473
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,468
You need my confirmation
regarding the trade?

474
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,179
I'll be offering you Ihwaru's information.

475
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,641
It is why I even dare to ask.

476
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,517
That information you receive

477
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,480
is nothing but rumors said by drunks.

478
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,192
What information could be valuable enough
to request for my audience?

479
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,782
How is your atrophy?

480
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,119
I hear you've been barely sleeping

481
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:27,956
and that rice porridge
is all you can stomach.

482
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,252
Only the royal physician
of the Directorate of Medicine

483
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,296
is aware of my condition,

484
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,800
so how could you possibly know--

485
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,144
What else do you know?

486
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,313
I know what it is

487
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,856
you desire.

488
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,734
You sly old fox.

489
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,239
There's more to this
than the tribute and border trade.

490
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,202
Hui-jae, leave us.

491
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,927
I couldn't possibly

492
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:26,682
thank you enough for taking Hui-jae in
and looking after her.

493
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,608
Please use it when you need it most.

494
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,777
You don't know what I'll do with this.

495
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,489
Nam Jeon could have you killed.

496
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,532
Still,

497
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,618
it will save Hui-jae.

498
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,791
So what did you learn?

499
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,420
Know an opponent's weakness
but don't be intimidated.

500
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,089
You must not corner
the other party either.

501
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:03,093
Take a step back and let your opponent
think that he or she has won

502
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,888
before you reveal your hand.

503
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:08,140
The Queen doubted you for a second.

504
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,642
Did you see that too?

505
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,644
I did.

506
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,230
The fire burns all firewood in its path.

507
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,567
The Queen is the fire

508
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,155
while you are only one
of the many firewood lying around.

509
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,787
I now formally request
the team of private investigators.

510
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,666
I'll allow it.

511
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,699
Dig up anything you can

512
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,117
but without Hwi knowing.

513
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,036
Do not interfere.

514
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,164
The investigation will end
if anyone is caught.

515
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,041
Go.

516
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,891
Do not dare to call this country yours.

517
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:34,810
You...

518
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,354
will never be King.

519
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,409
Your Highness.

520
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,753
Those four names
were among the casualties.

521
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,672
They were part of the advance party.

522
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,673
And?

523
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,759
Hwi's father was killed
by the dipping in a cauldron.

524
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,227
I find the other three suspicious too.

525
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,874
Is this the tiger's mouth?

526
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:41,251
Becoming Bang-won's loyal servant might

527
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,669
upgrade our lives forever.

528
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,546
The payment is 20 seoms of rice.

529
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,757
I'd rather build a tower with that.

530
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,303
Are you ready?

531
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:55,724
Let's go.

532
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,688
Come near the prince
while holding a weapon

533
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,106
and you'll be sliced open.

534
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,399
Even if it's the King?

535
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,485
Yes.

536
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:07,944
How savage.

537
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,572
Oh, you're finally here.

538
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,742
Well, it's good to see you.

539
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,370
You must have nine lives.

540
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,996
I need to live

541
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,915
if I'm going to rip you apart one day.

542
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,750
You should worry more about yourself.

543
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,044
I'm no match for someone
who can't see an arrow coming.

544
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,754
You little bastard.

545
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,093
Cheonga.

546
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,261
I'm a soldier too, you know.

547
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,848
Being a former palace guard
makes you high and mighty,

548
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:40,185
but I never get that respect
since I'm of lowly origins.

549
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,729
Take it outside if you wish to see blood.

550
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,106
I won't allow it indoors.

551
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,777
Fine.

552
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,324
I'll be the one to kill you,

553
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,828
so stay alive until then.

554
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,968
Here's my answer.

555
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,887
Be my weapon.

556
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,516
Before you do though,
you will dig two graves.

557
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,643
One for me

558
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,353
and one

559
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,397
for you.

560
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,193
Your life must be on the line

561
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,488
to be able to change the world.

562
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,450
I already died in Liaodong.

563
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:37,909
I do not need

564
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,995
another grave.

565
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,663
Then what about you?

566
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,916
You once led the subjugation up north,

567
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,501
didn't you, Park Chi-do?

568
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:52,549
Those memories are already long gone.

569
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:53,884
I now

570
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,303
serve you as my only master.

571
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,597
A mortician who played doctor

572
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,182
and a slave who killed his master.

573
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,392
You four sure are an interesting team.

574
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,395
Follow me.

575
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,554
I hear your father was punished
by the dipping in a cauldron.

576
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,599
He was an official who stole rations.

577
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,356
Is that so?

578
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,151
Yes.

579
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,633
This is where

580
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,718
I killed Poeun.

581
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,558
He had to be eliminated
to erect this country,

582
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,811
but no one would do the job.

583
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:30,981
No one

584
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,526
wanted to go down in history

585
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,487
as the evil who killed a loyal servant.

586
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,123
This is where

587
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,584
my family was saved

588
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,795
but also where I was abandoned.

589
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,382
However,

590
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,969
this is also where this nation began.

591
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:06,391
It hasn't even been a year
since Poeun's blood was splashed over me.

592
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,977
I can't allow

593
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:14,316
more blood on my hands
that'll paint me as pure evil.

594
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,407
From this moment on,

595
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,993
you will answer only to me.

596
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,996
You will have to die
unless you become King.

597
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,458
The way to become one

598
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,002
is for you to kill the King himself.

599
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,837
The blood that'll bounce off my sword

600
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,465
will make you a King.

601
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,343
If that scares you,

602
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:44,179
beg for Bang-seok's mercy
or pretend to have gone insane.

603
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,306
Who knows?

604
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,642
He might pity you enough to not kill you.

605
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:52,395
You mock me, speak about the King, and...

606
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,398
show hints of rebellion?

607
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,735
You already spoke of a new nation
and an act of rebellion.

608
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,529
Right here, where you killed Poeun.

609
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,075
No matter whose blood you shed,
always remember this.

610
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,036
If any of that blood splatters in my way,

611
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,956
I will kill you...

612
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,132
and every one of your friends.

613
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:26,513
I wouldn't have come to you
if that scared me.

614
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,139
So it's now your turn

615
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,767
to dig those two graves.

616
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,233
Your Highness.

617
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,145
YI BANG-WON

618
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,362
YI SEONG-GYE

619
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,140
When it comes to archery,
no one can hold a candle to you.

620
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,808
Is it just the archery?

621
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,690
I know you well.

622
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:04,611
You'd do anything to get what you want

623
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,738
and crush things you couldn't have.

624
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,492
I learned that from you.

625
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:15,080
You crushed Choi Yeong
and took this nation for yourself.

626
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:19,084
The man I wanted wasn't Choi Yeong
but Poeun.

627
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,504
However, you brutally murdered him.

628
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,473
It's an ambush!

629
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,725
Find the scoundrel!

630
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,352
Charge!

631
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,774
He's 400 steps away,
so what good could a search party do?

632
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,963
He wasn't aiming to kill me.

633
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,508
It's as if he has something to say.

634
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,061
A feather of a pheasant on a red arrow.

635
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,021
It's the same as yours.

636
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,483
The blood that'll bounce off my sword

637
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,819
will make you a King.

638
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,495
November 23, 1380.

639
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,252
Bring me Nam Jeon.

640
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,422
You, follow me.

641
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:12,280
Four assassins who tried to kill me
died in 1380.

642
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,908
You revealed their crimes
and had them executed.

643
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:19,621
You also said that
no one but us knew of it.

644
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:21,998
Is that true?

645
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:25,919
It is.

646
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,798
It seems like

647
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,759
another knows about it too.

648
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,319
It's simply just a random date.

649
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,654
Tear it into pieces.

650
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,829
Whoever it was
had the nerve to aim at my target.

651
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,416
It just so happens
that you were there too.

652
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,418
Is it really just a coincidence?

653
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:10,505
The only archer skilled enough
to hit a target from 400 steps away

654
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,383
is you, Your Majesty.

655
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,929
It seems like

656
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,558
someone is trying to frame me.

657
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,852
Then how must I handle
this mockery of an action?

658
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,437
You must...

659
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,607
kill who's responsible.

660
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,528
Those who lie and mock this court

661
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,321
will be executed.

662
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,908
I will never draw my sword
without contemplating,

663
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,952
but that sword

664
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,706
won't return to its scabbard
without seeing blood.

665
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,829
Are you here to mock me?

666
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,043
I'm here to get you out.

667
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,211
I'll see you around, Father.

668
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,213
Someone is after my head.

669
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,924
I doubt it's just one person.

670
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,009
That person

671
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:41,512
will kill me, you, and ruin our family.

672
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,016
Apart, we won't survive.

673
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,352
Our only chance is to fight together.

674
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,623
If that person is Bang-won,

675
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,377
then we must kill him.

676
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,937
Mom, let's run.
We'll live somewhere far away.

677
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,149
So that you can get caught

678
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,193
as a runaway slave
and have your face branded?

679
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,111
Or

680
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,531
would you prefer to be beaten to death?

681
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,199
We'll die together then.

682
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,702
That's what we'll do.

683
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,748
Stop being so stubborn!

684
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,459
Now, listen to me carefully.

685
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,753
If you pity me at all,

686
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,047
work hard to become someone of power.

687
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,300
Then make a country

688
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,219
that even allows

689
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,848
a decent life for lowlifes like me.

690
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,244
It must be nice to have a father high up.

691
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,047
What are you doing here?

692
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:06,342
Could I please talk
to Inspector Nam Seon-ho?

693
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,135
Please.

694
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,731
He was stripped of his position
and has been clubbed.

695
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:24,652
I hear that they torture
just till the brink of death.

696
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,516
Yeon.

697
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,115
Don't come near me.

698
01:07:58,199 --> 01:07:59,450
Stay right there.

699
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,410
Come any closer and I'll scream.

700
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,212
Listen to me.
Don't tell anyone you came here.

701
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:12,880
Especially not Nam Jeon.

702
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:14,757
Got it?

703
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:16,801
Do you understand me?

704
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:05,766
Seon-ho...

705
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,399
Was it my father?

706
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,796
Yi Seong-gye,
General-in-Chief of the Three Provinces,

707
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,340
after defeating the Japanese raiders,

708
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:23,177
showed evident signs of rebellion
against the current regime

709
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:25,846
and has been conspiring
an uprising ever since.

710
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:28,390
We vow to

711
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:31,727
eliminate the traitor Yi Seong-gye

712
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:35,731
and fulfill our duties
as Goryeo's loyal servants.

713
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,196
We swear upon this vow at Haegeomdang

714
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:44,240
and will execute our mission
on November 23, 1380.

715
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:47,326
Kim Yeong-su, Park Seon-min,

716
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,995
Noh Gyeong-cheon,

717
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:52,039
and Nam Jeon.

718
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,329
Where's the secret letter?

719
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,499
Where is it?

720
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,042
Why?

721
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:40,379
Are you scared
that Yi Seong-gye will find out?

722
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:45,342
Are you terrified
since he might rip you into pieces?

723
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,225
Tell me.

724
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:57,062
You will pay for betraying our vow.

725
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,439
You...

726
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:01,734
will die from having your blood

727
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,862
drained from your body.

728
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,550
Twelve years ago in 1380.

729
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,969
Is it true that you

730
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,473
made a pact to assassinate General Yi?

731
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,813
If it is, it will destroy this family.

732
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:52,326
He's involved.

733
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,383
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM YOON-SEO

734
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,819
Was it Hwi who received

735
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:28,070
my mother's letter?

736
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:30,781
Protect those you need to protect.

737
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:32,241
Meanwhile, I will protect you.

738
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:33,659
Prince Uian.

739
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:36,578
I hereby announce you
as the new Crown Prince.

740
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,706
I will not back down
until I have what I want.

741
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,458
I will not give up either.

742
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:43,544
I will...

743
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:49,091
not even take a step out of Gaegyeong.

744
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:52,136
Please let me serve you by your side.

745
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:55,013
I will protect your throne with my life.

746
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,182
I used the King
to put pressure on Nam Jeon

747
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,767
and had him doubt Bang-won.

748
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,395
Him looking for me is part of my plan.

749
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:02,646
Kill Bang-won.

750
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:04,481
I don't care

751
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,733
whatever it is he has anymore.

752
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:08,026
Kill him.

753
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:12,364
