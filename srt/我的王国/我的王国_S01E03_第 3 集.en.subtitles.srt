1
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,850
THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

2
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,352
SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARACTERS
ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,975
Let me ask you one thing.

4
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,813
Was Hwi taken there

5
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,650
because of your father?

6
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,029
-No.
-Then what?

7
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,616
Was it your doing?

8
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,409
That's right.

9
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,078
It was me.

10
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,579
I did it.

11
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,625
I asked him to bribe the examiner,
and even Hwi--

12
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,879
Do you seriously expect me
to believe such a lie?

13
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,215
He enlisted in the army,
just like everyone else.

14
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,343
So forget him.

15
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,263
-Erase him from your mind.
-How?

16
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,767
Can you forget him?

17
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,728
I will.

18
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,982
I must.

19
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,198
What if it had happened to you?

20
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,368
What do you think Hwi would've done?

21
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,663
He would've gotten you out of there
no matter what.

22
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,334
Even if you had been dragged to hell.

23
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,735
EPISODE 3

24
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,491
My gosh.

25
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,123
I heard you were promoted to Commander
of the Liaodong Army.

26
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,208
Congratulations, sir.

27
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,626
I'm being kicked out.

28
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,252
What?

29
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,672
"Promoted"? "Congratulations"?

30
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,219
Are you trying to provoke me?

31
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,849
I'd like to fight in the war.
Please hire me as your deputy commander.

32
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,020
Do you really mean it?

33
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,940
I will guard you with my life, sir.

34
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,549
The army consists of
about 40,000 soldiers,

35
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,093
about 12,000 backup soldiers,

36
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,970
and 20,000 horses.

37
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,473
I will take your wife and family to
a safe place as soon as the army leaves.

38
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,225
If my family goes into hiding,

39
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,851
Choi Yeong will suspect me.

40
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,064
But what about your second wife?

41
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,402
Choi Yeong will send a knife
to Lady Kang first.

42
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,160
The Pocheon Kang clan.

43
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,630
SEO HWI

44
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,014
Any word about Yeon?

45
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,978
I've been looking for her
for the past three months,

46
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,188
but I've found no traces of her.

47
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,275
She must've probably died
while looking for her brother.

48
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,696
You said she was ill.

49
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,114
It's not your fault.

50
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,033
You've done your best.

51
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,584
Must you leave?

52
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,588
What about your mother though?

53
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,382
You're almost there.
You'll be able to see her soon.

54
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,677
-So--
-I will find out on my own.

55
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,722
I will no longer let Seol drag me around.

56
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,024
Your friend is in the main room.

57
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,778
Not the one you miss.

58
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,272
Are you finally heading off to war?

59
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,942
I thought I should have a drink
before I leave.

60
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,659
Then I should pour you a drink
before I say goodbye to you.

61
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,668
Don't be too brave.

62
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,712
You need to be a little cowardly
in order to survive.

63
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,718
Although you're already cowardly enough.

64
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,227
Will Goryeo be turned over?

65
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,147
The King comes first,
and the country comes second.

66
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,232
So you really meant it.

67
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,028
And I mean this too.

68
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,909
The first drink
should go to your elder,

69
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,620
and the last one is
for the one in your heart.

70
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,210
This is the last one.

71
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,380
What do you mean?

72
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,510
Men tend to become unnecessarily brave
before going to war.

73
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,723
Because they don't want to die
with unsaid words left in their hearts.

74
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,865
My last one

75
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,910
already went to Hwi.

76
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,580
I know.

77
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,541
But that doesn't mean
I shouldn't give you mine.

78
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,505
I heard the King and Choi Yeong

79
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,008
sent advance troops to Liaodong
without consulting anyone.

80
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,430
The main troops should be there
if advance troops are there.

81
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,725
The King is pressuring us
to expedite the conquest.

82
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,979
-Choi Yeong is trying to trick us.
-We have all the elite troops.

83
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,482
The advance troops
consist of criminals and roughnecks.

84
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,860
They are a mob of rogues.
They can't even hold out for three days.

85
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,122
Snap out of it!

86
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,212
Take this bow.

87
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,631
Shoot them!

88
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,851
Another dead one.

89
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:54,977
You're now dead too.

90
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,103
Another dead one...

91
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,271
My goodness.

92
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,857
-Another dead one.
-Dead.

93
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,401
Gosh. Stay here, okay?

94
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,527
Take this.

95
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,988
-Oh, dear. Just a moment, okay?
-Dead.

96
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,532
-Another dead one.
-Dead.

97
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,034
Another dead one.

98
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,872
Dead.

99
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,628
Sir, I think this one's still alive.

100
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,174
Dead.

101
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,176
He's still breathing.

102
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,394
We need to stop the bleeding. Get me
Himalayan ginseng and orchid.

103
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,357
-Hurry!
-Okay.

104
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,278
They're more valuable than our rations.

105
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,155
We cannot waste them.

106
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,658
But he's alive.
Can you not see that?

107
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,909
Is that so?

108
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,912
To me, this just looks like a corpse.

109
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,208
I'm in too much pain.

110
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,834
Don't talk.

111
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,670
Please...

112
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,880
Please help me.

113
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,800
I told you not to talk.

114
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,429
My grandmother can't even relieve herself
on her own.

115
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,640
What is she going to do if I die?

116
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,810
I, too, have a sister,
whom I have to look after.

117
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,355
So let's live.
Let's survive this war and return home.

118
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,649
I want to live...

119
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,493
Dead.

120
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,334
You'll probably die soon as well.

121
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,086
Shall I put you on the list early?

122
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,796
You just wait and see.

123
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,757
I will be sure to outlive you
by at least a day.

124
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:49,883
What?

125
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,845
How dare a mere foot soldier
speak so rudely to the commander?

126
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:57,474
You must have a death wish.

127
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,102
If we die, we'll just be strokes

128
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,604
on the death roll, regardless of rank.

129
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,149
If you wish to kill me,

130
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,317
draw a stroke for yourself first.

131
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,488
That rude punk.

132
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,367
You guys over there!
Bring that punk to me at once!

133
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,454
What are you waiting for?

134
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,733
You'll live long if you unwind the spool
completely.

135
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,402
I want to live long enough
to die of old age.

136
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,815
He has dysentery.
He needs to be quarantined at once.

137
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,109
No. I'm totally fine, sir.

138
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,403
You have a high fever
and a lot of eye discharge.

139
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,280
And there is mucus in your stool.

140
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,323
It's dysentery with bloody diarrhea.

141
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,034
No! Please, sir. I'll die
if I'm quarantined.

142
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,246
I heard people are torched to death there
when they're still alive.

143
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,415
You might end up killing 50,000 people.

144
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,125
My job is to prevent that.

145
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,502
Burn everything that he touched.

146
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,589
You son of a bitch!

147
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,092
Then you need to be torched too.
Go burn yourself to death!

148
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,918
Dysentery is spreading.

149
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,213
Deserters are also on the rise.
We beheaded 20 today alone.

150
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,090
Dysentery is very common
during the rainy months.

151
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,719
And as for the deserters,
20 is a negligible number.

152
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,642
A cold can't kill you,

153
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,393
but dysentery can.

154
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:34,233
We can burn the corpses but not the ill.
It is not a negligible matter.

155
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,276
This is not your place to step in.

156
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,322
It's my duty to candidly inform
him of the situation.

157
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,116
Your duty is to fight with your sword,
not your sly tongue.

158
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,244
-How dare you--
-He is right.

159
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,746
Behave yourself.

160
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,584
What else?

161
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,462
The bowstrings are becoming loose
because the glue is melting.

162
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,339
Half of the soldiers are archers.

163
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,258
We won't win if we can't shoot arrows.

164
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,135
The river has risen.
It'll be hard to cross it.

165
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,054
You will have to be very careful.

166
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,640
That, too, is true.

167
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,017
Do not hesitate to give me
your candid advice.

168
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,531
My gosh.

169
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,784
Here. This is liver, which you guys love.

170
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,204
That liver is huge.

171
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,207
Oh, my.

172
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,210
The head of the enemy general?

173
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,879
Are you deaf or what?

174
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,757
Bring it before the sun goes down.

175
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,343
Must I infiltrate their camp
in broad daylight?

176
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,845
Just tell me to kill myself--

177
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,519
Now, you're listening.

178
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,814
We must behead the enemy general
to buy some time.

179
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,358
You have to do it
to get one more day to live.

180
00:21:58,942 --> 00:21:59,943
I'll get a team.

181
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,862
Do it. If you can, that is.

182
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,954
I'll watch him.

183
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,044
-You'll watch him?
-He might surrender to Ming, you know.

184
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,172
Behead him if he shows any signs.

185
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,340
No.

186
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:25,010
Cut his head off
and hang it in front of his tent.

187
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,718
It's a buffalo horn arrow.
It can go as far as 400 steps.

188
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,398
Why did you follow me?
Are you really afraid I might surrender?

189
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,942
When you kill the commander,
the deputy takes over.

190
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,652
As for the Japanese, they flee.

191
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,862
-And Ming?
-They report it to the higher-ups.

192
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,866
If we capture the enemy general,
we can buy some time. That's why I'm here.

193
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,288
The general's tent. The red armor.

194
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,876
Feel the wind behind your ears.
Add five more steps.

195
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:46,508
Add five steps when you can feel the wind
touching your hair behind the ears.

196
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,177
And add ten more
when your bangs flutter in the wind.

197
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,554
What about for 400 steps?

198
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,764
Four hundred steps...

199
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,474
Even I fail half the time.

200
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,688
The wind has changed. Add ten more steps.

201
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,119
-What?
-It's quivering. Breathe slowly.

202
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,454
But what if we lose him?

203
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,510
Retreat.

204
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,068
It's a narrow trail.

205
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,196
-It'll shorten--
-The horses' stride length.

206
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,536
Are you all right?

207
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,979
Who are you?

208
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,148
Identify yourself!

209
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:17,325
The leader of the Black Snake Unit,
from the former Northern Punitive Force.

210
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,078
My name is Park Chi-do.

211
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,006
-Goodness.
-Do you have more?

212
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,676
We'll see in the morning.

213
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,470
-Just a little more.
-Jeez.

214
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,024
Here.

215
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,694
They're back.

216
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,738
-They came back in one piece!
-What?

217
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,032
-What's going on?
-My gosh.

218
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,909
Who is this? What happened to him?

219
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,828
Put him down slowly. Be careful.

220
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,123
Where's the general's head?

221
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,211
I shot him.

222
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,885
But there's no proof,

223
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,054
and the only witness is as good as dead.

224
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,765
Judging from the wound...

225
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,600
I wonder who did this to him.

226
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,606
Goddamnit.
Can you stop spewing so much bullshit?

227
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,733
My ears can't stand your bullshit.

228
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,778
What are you doing?
Stop blinking your eyes and hold this.

229
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,863
You punks...

230
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,532
Goodness. Finish your meat

231
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,826
and go burp over there.

232
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,087
Move!

233
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,052
Thank you.

234
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,554
No, we should thank you.

235
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,806
And I feel bad.

236
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,142
Me too. I feel the same way.

237
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,356
We can't treat him here. Pick him up.
Let's treat him inside.

238
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,233
-Pick him up.
-Hold him.

239
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:32,961
Parents would tattoo their sons
on their backs before they went to war

240
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,047
so that they could find
their sons' corpses.

241
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,094
That's what

242
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,763
the tattoo means to us.

243
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,112
It's the general's armor.

244
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,908
He told me to give it to you

245
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,160
when it would fit you.

246
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,996
He was always so proud of you,

247
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,957
and he always missed Yeon.

248
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,913
HWI
YEON

249
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,293
Hwi means "to shine."
And Yeon means "beautiful."

250
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,574
Where is yours?

251
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,367
I didn't bring any.

252
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,245
And I never will.

253
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,914
What do you mean?

254
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,125
What I mean is,
I will no longer let you use me.

255
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,297
You killed my friend

256
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,675
with the information I acquired.

257
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,304
And you mocked my sincerity
by criticizing me for being foolish.

258
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,557
You may have managed to save your face
by trampling all over me,

259
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,560
but you've lost my respect.

260
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,604
I did it for Ihwaru.

261
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,815
What did you do for Ga-hwa's sister
who lost her liver?

262
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,235
And how was Hwa-wol's stepfather punished
for selling her?

263
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,447
-Those who killed my mother--
-I do not have such power.

264
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,783
Do you?

265
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,245
No, I don't.

266
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,414
However, I will become powerful.

267
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:42,919
So I can receive such information
instead of collecting it for others.

268
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,589
I will continue to grow my power
so that I can get back

269
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,801
at everyone for what they did to me
and much more.

270
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,846
Not at Ihwaru. If you refuse
to be a kisaeng and get me information,

271
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,890
there's no reason for you to be here.

272
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,978
I will leave.

273
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,904
I will die outside the premises,

274
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,491
so I hope you live a long, healthy life
here at Ihwaru.

275
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,500
Madame Seol!

276
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,388
All of this happened
because you wanted it to,

277
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,433
so don't blame anyone or regret anything.

278
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,980
I won't.

279
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:46,899
I'll have no regrets,

280
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,735
and I'll blame no one.

281
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,468
When did that start?

282
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,053
About ten years ago.

283
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:18,765
But,

284
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,267
I've never heard her cough.

285
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,313
She held in her coughs
in front of you.

286
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,700
I killed the man with leprosy
who ate her liver.

287
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,665
As for Hwa-wol's stepfather,

288
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,918
he died of a lung disease
the following year.

289
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,963
And the scoundrels
who killed your mother...

290
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,343
I will find them at all costs.

291
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,934
Take good care of her.

292
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,537
IHWARU

293
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,714
Hui-jae.

294
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,143
I made a rice ball for you.

295
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,562
It'll go bad quickly,
so eat it right away.

296
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,481
And this is pumpkin taffy.

297
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,984
Suck on it when you're tired.

298
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,319
You might break your teeth
if you bite into it.

299
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,076
Thanks.

300
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,373
You heartless girl.

301
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,335
You're so coldhearted

302
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,380
and utterly heartless.

303
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,009
I should get going.

304
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,261
Sure, whatever.

305
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,263
You won't look at me?

306
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,472
No, I won't.

307
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,766
Hwa-wol...

308
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,685
I won't.

309
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,496
If...

310
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,459
Hwi ever comes by, tell him where I am.

311
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,777
It's already been a month.

312
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,572
The King is at Pyeongyang Castle
encouraging our soldiers.

313
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,409
Dysentery is getting worse
and over 200 have left the army.

314
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,413
Time is not on our side anymore.

315
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,500
Brave soldiers won't win us this war.

316
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,834
I suspect

317
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,587
there will be a competent leader
among them.

318
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:40,258
The most incompetent leader we have
is leading the advance party.

319
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,887
I never said it had to be him.

320
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,814
It's an ambush!

321
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,440
An ambush!

322
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,694
There are dozens in the cavalry,
you morons.

323
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,820
It's an ambush!

324
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,697
Head out.

325
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,699
To the battlefield.

326
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,158
Captain!

327
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,037
Please come on out.

328
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,542
-Where's the commander?
-He's still recovering.

329
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,336
-And the lieutenant?
-You're the captain.

330
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,422
Go and encourage your men!

331
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,631
Damn it.

332
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,342
Prevail!

333
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,679
Anyone who cowers will die at my sword.

334
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,222
What's with the speech?

335
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,769
Die!

336
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,307
Use long spears to fight the horsemen.

337
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,352
What? Long spears?

338
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,937
What the hell...

339
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,826
Do you want to die? Get closer!

340
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,662
Don't you think I know that?
It's the hooves I'm scared of.

341
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:25,881
Cover me.

342
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,052
Cover the lieutenant!

343
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,311
Close.

344
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,402
Shit, you're good. Close!

345
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,552
Wait...

346
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,441
No, Hwi!

347
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,552
He did it. He slashed his neck.

348
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,388
The enemy general is down!

349
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:02,311
The enemy general is down!

350
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,065
He's gone.

351
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,331
The enemy general is dead?

352
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,503
Soldiers, charge!

353
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,131
Charge!

354
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,056
I told you to charge!

355
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,766
Are you all right?

356
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,436
I gave you an order.

357
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,316
Jeez, him and his yelling.

358
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,776
Come on.

359
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,570
Accept his order.

360
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,132
Soldiers,

361
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,801
charge!

362
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,696
Damn.

363
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,333
Shit.

364
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,919
I scored! Look.

365
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,923
We're at the gates of Hell,
so what good will gold do?

366
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,926
Don't talk about what you don't know.

367
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,180
Those with money get the best seats
when crossing the River Styx.

368
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,527
He's picking his ears with a pestle.

369
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,279
Why would one do that?

370
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,365
It means his wasting his time.

371
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,461
Are you wasting your energy again?

372
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,631
You can't possibly bury
all of these dead men.

373
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:40,094
If I don't, the crows
would mercilessly pick at them.

374
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,596
That I can't have.

375
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,100
Now that you're a fake lieutenant,
it seems like you want to join the army.

376
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,103
Look. It's Hwi, the success story.

377
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,896
A lowlife is playing lieutenant.

378
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,107
My duty will end if I make a contribution.

379
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,027
I'm going to do whatever it takes
to stay alive.

380
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,988
As if we'd believe that.

381
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,657
Running away seems faster.

382
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,492
Treason gets your family killed

383
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,703
and your children
will suffer the consequences.

384
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,163
Running away is the same.

385
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,750
I won't spend the rest of my life
living while hiding.

386
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,796
You're just a silly little kid.

387
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,590
How dare you talk back to me like that!

388
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,134
Do I look like a kid to you?

389
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,635
Well... No...

390
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,930
You have a really annoying way of
pointing out the obvious.

391
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,517
Look here, doctor. Quit the nonsense

392
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,811
and patch up his wound.

393
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,106
-That's enough.
-Follow me.

394
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:35,566
Let me look at that wound.

395
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,618
My gosh. Look at this hole.

396
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,204
Even a cow could fit in it.

397
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,249
A through-and-through is better.
It's worse if it's lodged in.

398
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,126
Right on, macho man.

399
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,425
Are you really a physician?

400
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,887
Out here, butchers are doctors
and robbers are commanders.

401
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,722
A physician stitches up the living

402
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,682
while a mortician
stitches up the dead.

403
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,059
So which one did you use to stitch up?

404
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,269
Corpses.

405
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,313
All right, fine.

406
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:17,274
Anyway, here we go. Bite down.

407
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,038
You're a relentless one, aren't you?

408
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,874
I'm stitching your flesh
but you didn't even groan.

409
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,793
Are you Guan Yu or something?

410
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,507
Here.

411
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,551
-I'm good.
-Take a sip.

412
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,805
Snake wine with arrowroot juice
is best for cuts like that.

413
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,186
My goodness.

414
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,647
Are you kidding me?
Why would you drink it?

415
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,567
My heart is cut deeply from
serving in the army for ten years.

416
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,568
Here.

417
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,987
I won't drink it.

418
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,490
As if. You don't have the stomach, right?

419
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,325
You should be ashamed of yourself.

420
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,585
-Satisfied?
-Well, good job.

421
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,466
Is he dead?

422
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,431
What now though?

423
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,975
My mother...

424
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,355
Status?

425
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,816
We have 44 dead and 55 wounded.

426
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,818
All we have now are only 75 men.

427
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,903
Not "only," but "still."

428
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,072
The main unit hasn't left Wihwado.

429
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,866
-At this rate--
-We'll all die.

430
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,661
That's what an advance party is to them.

431
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,830
Troops that come and die first.

432
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,208
-Commander--
-Only we want ourselves to stay alive,

433
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,751
so don't waver.

434
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:02,754
We can survive this.

435
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,298
No,

436
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,550
we must.

437
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,175
Lady Kang of Pocheon.

438
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,093
The State Councilor's Seoul wife.

439
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,554
Wise and beautiful.

440
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,973
Her spirit is as honorable
as any general's.

441
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,671
Who dares to trespass?

442
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,010
You should first light the furnace.

443
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,138
Unless there's smoke,
the house will look vacant.

444
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,307
Keep the gates wide open too.

445
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,601
If closed, they'll jump the wall.

446
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,271
They wouldn't dare
come through opened gates.

447
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,357
I told you to identify yourself.

448
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,068
I will serve you
until the conquest is over.

449
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,363
I may not be able
to always save your life,

450
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,408
but I'll never be the only one
to make it out alive.

451
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,630
You'll protect me

452
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,549
or die trying to.

453
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,259
Why?

454
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,636
Because you'll get me to a place

455
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,057
that seems too absurd to be true.

456
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,603
And where will that be?

457
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:08,231
Beside the Queen.

458
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,864
Protecting me

459
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,241
puts you in danger too.

460
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,868
All I hope is for Bang-won

461
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:22,370
to reach you
before General Choi's assassins do.

462
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:26,625
The State Councillor has six sons.
Why would he send Bang-won?

463
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:30,128
Because he's the only one
who can fight off the assassins.

464
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,672
Also, the State Councillor

465
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,967
doesn't have six sons.

466
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,928
He has eight.

467
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,432
Bang-beon, Bang-seok, you may come out.

468
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,982
What is your name?

469
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,320
It is Hui-jae of the Han Family.

470
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,081
-Are you all right?
-How can you enjoy

471
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,042
something so potent?

472
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,722
What if they decide to settle there?

473
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:26,726
No army settles on a battlefield.
They'll retreat if they can't pass.

474
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,146
Even though they've come
all this way? Why?

475
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,940
An expeditionary force only retreats

476
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:35,443
when the King dies,
if there's an assassination attempt,

477
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,571
or if...

478
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,115
one tries to take the throne.

479
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,092
What is the country I serve?

480
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,554
Is it Goryeo that's rotten from within

481
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,516
or the people who follow me?

482
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,102
If not,

483
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,734
is it

484
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,652
just me?

485
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:26,995
75 ALIVE, 425 DEAD

486
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,874
What's that?

487
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,627
An arrow is the messenger here.

488
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,075
There are 425 dead and 75 alive.

489
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,590
How much longer can you hold out?

490
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,354
Until everyone here dies.

491
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,949
I will relay the message
to the Deputy Commander.

492
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,993
What is your name?

493
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,512
The general will give his orders.

494
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,681
The presence of all officers is required.

495
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,118
And the Uiju Fortress?

496
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,746
We'll open the gates
to welcome the revolutionary troop.

497
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,080
And Pyeongyang Castle?

498
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,124
It'll be the same as Uiju Fortress.

499
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,251
-And Gaegyeong?
-Blood...

500
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,713
will be shed.

501
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,757
But that blood

502
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:48,219
may be mine and not Choi Yeong's.

503
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,473
Do not be afraid of blood.

504
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,226
How can evil which has been
rotting away for 400 years

505
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,063
be washed away without pain and bloodshed?

506
00:55:58,646 --> 00:55:59,898
What about the King?

507
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,983
Killing him outside the palace

508
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,985
is nothing but an assassination.

509
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,445
If he dies an honorable death,

510
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,531
the people will pity and long for him.

511
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,408
That we can't have.

512
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,535
We must paint him as a coward

513
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,079
and trample on his honor

514
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,747
to keep the people from resisting.

515
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,249
So I stand today and say

516
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,337
that I, Deputy Commander Yi Seong-gye,

517
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,923
will disobey the King's order.

518
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,258
Now, here is mine.

519
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:34,974
We will pull our men from Wihwado
and retreat.

520
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,492
I'll get a cramp waiting for a reply.

521
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,036
Jeez, just look how it's raining.
Let's head back.

522
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,582
I'll wait a while longer.

523
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,570
Soldier, Seo Hwi.

524
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,254
Who was it?

525
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,800
The arrow was shot from a messenger.
I'm sure he has a name.

526
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,057
The rain washed the ink away.

527
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,713
A message was sent by the advance party.

528
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:31,549
There are 425 dead and 75 alive.

529
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,760
The number of injured is unknown.

530
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,261
If they hold out,

531
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,722
the justification for our retreat
will lose ground.

532
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,390
If they don't though,

533
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:43,061
the King will be criticized
for starting an unreasonable war.

534
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,898
You must decide, sir.

535
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,818
Those men are either robbers or criminals.

536
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:53,404
Why give second thought to such lowlifes?

537
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,993
What do you think?

538
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,455
The greater good must
always be prioritized.

539
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,749
There will be no revolution
without sacrifice.

540
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,919
They too are people of Goryeo.

541
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,588
There is no such thing
as a justified sacrifice.

542
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:14,175
You can't have it all
if you aren't willing to give up anything.

543
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:18,179
In your mind, the 75 alive
are already dead anyway.

544
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,890
All you're looking for is justification.

545
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,601
It's why you're pitying the people
and being reluctant.

546
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,686
Aren't I right?

547
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:27,814
-You've crossed the line.
-Is that so bad?

548
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,108
No,

549
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,402
it's right.

550
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,864
Captain.

551
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:39,367
Yes, General?

552
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,327
Form a death squad.

553
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,163
Choose the best of the best
from Gabyeolcho.

554
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,373
How many do you need?

555
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:47,458
About 20 will suffice.

556
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,877
-It's not enough.
-It being a large number

557
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,337
will only slow us down.

558
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,006
We will enter when it's the darkest

559
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,009
and come out before dawn.

560
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,470
You must be discreet and organized.

561
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,389
Yes, General.

562
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,184
You will join him.

563
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,906
Accomplish a feat.

564
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,659
Then I'll keep you by my side.

565
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,207
You may stand.

566
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,592
I shall oblige,

567
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,302
General.

568
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,396
YI SEONG-GYE

569
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,614
We're not fighting officials.

570
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:03,785
They're like animals
that are hungry for blood.

571
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,162
Well, hunting is always easier.

572
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,539
We just have to round them up and kill.

573
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,876
You're a big talker for someone
who got the job because of his father.

574
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,962
You're a low-rank officer,
who thinks you're all that.

575
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,424
It won't be long
before you take orders from me.

576
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:29,394
All you'll do is head out and come back.

577
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,895
Are you afraid

578
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,231
I'll steal your thunder?

579
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:36,025
I'm worried
I'll mistake you for an animal.

580
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,747
Choi Yeong will probably
go after my family.

581
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,166
Send this to Bang-won

582
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,669
and have him escort his mothers
to the northeast area.

583
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,340
Why your fifth son

584
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,260
instead of your eldest Bang-u?

585
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:05,096
Who cares of the order
my sons were born in?

586
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:07,557
I will always

587
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,143
consider Bang-won as my first child.

588
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:20,611
Now that I've had my drink,
I should take a swing.

589
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,032
I wonder which one.

590
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,994
Yes, this seems good.

591
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,413
All right, here we go.

592
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,375
Shot!

593
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,585
Goodness.

594
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:42,049
Oh, well.

595
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:46,137
I guess I'm not drunk enough.

596
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:50,725
All right then.
Pour some in this bowl this time.

597
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,602
Sure.

598
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:56,689
Hold on.

599
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:01,027
Since when did such a beauty
live within the walls of Ihwaru?

600
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,905
I am Hwa-wol, the flower
that blooms under the moonlight.

601
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:06,699
Then...

602
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:12,079
What do you say we share love
underneath the moonlight?

603
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:16,125
My lord, you're embarrassing me.

604
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,044
Is that so?

605
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:22,298
This time, I'll swing it with my left arm.

606
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:28,679
This seems like the one.

607
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:31,516
Here it goes.

608
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,818
Damn.

609
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,528
His father went to war,

610
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:46,155
but here he is chugging down liquor.

611
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,616
What a rascal.

612
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,536
They all drank, but no one's drunk.

613
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:54,997
Their armor is at arm's length

614
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:58,501
and they have eyes on all corners.

615
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,717
To me, he isn't a scoundrel.

616
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,554
Right.

617
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:17,144
It's an urgent message from Wihwado.

618
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:21,566
Hand it over.

619
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,300
Leave us.

620
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,305
Gather!

621
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,105
Cheonga,

622
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,483
Head to Jaebyeok-dong immediately

623
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,277
and escort my mother to Hamhung.

624
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,070
Tae-ryeong and I

625
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,032
will escort the bitch in Pocheon
and meet up with you.

626
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:13,492
Choi Yeong will be following you,

627
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:16,329
so do what you can to escape from him.

628
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,372
If my family is captured,

629
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,459
my father's revolution will fail.

630
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,545
What if we're caught?

631
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:27,298
Kill yourselves.

632
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,760
General Yi's wives and sons too?

633
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:58,079
She's waiting for you. Please head inside.

634
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,039
You act like you know me.

635
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:02,833
Who else has eyes of a dragon

636
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:04,835
and wields red arrows?

637
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,338
The eyes can differ
depending on who's looking

638
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:08,798
and red arrows

639
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:11,467
are just arrows that are red.

640
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,928
The scoundrel who runs around with his men

641
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:16,639
committing impropriety,
stomping on crops while hunting,

642
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,307
enjoying booze and women,

643
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,810
all while not even feeling
an ounce of guilt.

644
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:24,063
He's right in front of me.

645
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,069
Lead the way.

646
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,672
I am Bang-won, the fifth son.

647
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:53,009
You came later than
the rumors of the retreat.

648
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,845
Is this the best you can do?

649
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:58,597
I will take you to safety.

650
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:02,601
"I will escort you to safety, Mother."

651
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:05,938
Show some respect.

652
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,483
Until you do, I won't take a step forward.

653
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,463
I will escort you to safety,

654
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:33,049
Mother.

655
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:46,520
-Which one of you is Bang-seok?
-Go ahead and greet him.

656
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:54,195
Brother, I am Bang-seok.

657
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:02,203
Who says I'm your brother?

658
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:07,750
It seems like

659
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,044
our road trip will be fun,

660
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:12,463
Mother.

661
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,716
Now I know why the General sent you.

662
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,469
You're an example

663
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:21,138
of how I am not supposed to raise my boys.

664
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,476
All right then.

665
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:26,811
Shall we?

666
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:28,979
Sure.

667
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,367
Jeez, what a shame.

668
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,912
If he had decent parents,
he would've become a general.

669
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:49,542
If he were that lucky,
he'd be a fool to join the army.

670
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,754
You just talk crap, don't you?

671
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,633
Choi Yeong, Wang Geon, and Yi Seong-gye.

672
01:08:57,716 --> 01:09:00,427
They all passed
the military state exam, remember?

673
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:03,013
General Yi isn't your friend, you know.

674
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,974
Is he your father then?

675
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:07,101
You want me to sew your lips together?

676
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,727
We're in trouble!

677
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:11,647
We're in trouble.

678
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:21,949
Why are they folding their tents?
What's going on?

679
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,994
The General's flag is on the move.

680
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,996
What the hell is going on?

681
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,123
They're retreating.

682
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:41,677
I have something to tell you.

683
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,928
The army is retreating.

684
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:45,055
They are folding their tents
and moving out.

685
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,977
They must be training.

686
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,604
Who trains on a battlefield?

687
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:52,897
How should I know?

688
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:54,440
Do you?

689
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,275
Look for yourself.

690
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,986
If the main troops retreat,
we'll be sitting ducks.

691
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:00,571
What?

692
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,032
You're full of yourself, aren't you?

693
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:06,118
You became a lieutenant
because none were left and that's it.

694
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,205
My job was to safely arrive here
and set up base.

695
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:12,583
It's yours to make sure
the main troops can get here. Got it?

696
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,044
Are you saying
that we're dispensable?

697
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:18,631
-What?
-You don't care if we're slaughtered?

698
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,966
Why you imbecile...

699
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:24,428
You crazy dog!

700
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:28,599
How dare you talk back to me.

701
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:29,767
Damn it.

702
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,653
Is this silk?

703
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:44,365
Give it back.

704
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:47,785
-Who did you steal it from?
-Give it back!

705
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,123
Suit yourself.

706
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,353
Don't just stand there. Stop him.

707
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:19,066
Look here. You know,
I've been taking an interest in you.

708
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,819
Once the conquest is over, I'll make sure

709
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:23,904
you're promoted to a real lieutenant.

710
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:28,367
How about an Eighth Rank Military Officer?

711
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,787
Eighth rank. You hear me, right?

712
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:34,748
You've been taking an interest in me?

713
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,083
You?

714
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:39,712
We only made it this far thanks to you.

715
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,755
Then what's my name?

716
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,011
Well...

717
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:53,225
Do you even know any of our names?

718
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:55,477
If you do, tell me.

719
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,897
I said, say it!

720
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:04,296
Do not let anyone oppress you.

721
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,382
Only then will you not collapse.

722
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:08,133
Don't let anyone intimidate you

723
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:10,260
even if they're stronger than you.

724
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,846
Only then can you hold out.

725
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:30,364
None of the advance party
shall cross Amnok River.

726
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,242
Kill every one of them.

727
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,328
If things go wrong,

728
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:38,705
burn the boat and die for honor.

729
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:41,083
Keep in mind

730
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,836
that you have never been to Liaodong.

731
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:51,135
Do not hesitate in front of your enemy.

732
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:53,137
During a war,

733
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:56,598
the one who hesitates to use his sword
is the first to die.

734
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:58,976
Go.

735
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:32,426
SEO HWI

736
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,448
I get why it smelled like piss.

737
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,575
Somebody put a diaper

738
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:58,702
on that punk.

739
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,413
Idiot.

740
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,876
Don't you think of pulling any tricks,

741
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:09,755
or your head will be
put on your father's dinner table.

742
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:43,664
Disobedience, insubordination, and mutiny.

743
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:45,749
They're all punished with decapitation.

744
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:49,753
Anyway, it happened. What will you do now?

745
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:51,004
I don't know.

746
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:54,424
You don't know?
Then death is our only option.

747
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:56,468
What can I do?

748
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:58,220
Kill the captain and flee?

749
01:15:58,345 --> 01:15:59,346
Why not?

750
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,431
Does being a slave,

751
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:04,226
and the son of a prisoner mean
you can die like this?

752
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:06,937
Why can't we just kill the captain
and spare our own lives?

753
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:08,897
That's what I mean.

754
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:14,236
Lieutenant Seo.

755
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,031
I'm not a lieutenant whatsoever.

756
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:20,867
I'm fighting to save myself.

757
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:24,997
That's all.

758
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:10,667
Are you sure there's a boat?

759
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:14,379
It's a tiny boat for the messenger.
But the river has risen so high...

760
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:17,507
Then you row the boat like hell.

761
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:24,973
Who's there?

762
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,316
It's you, Hwang. You came right on time.

763
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:36,026
The minions are trying to pull--

764
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:47,663
Go into the tent in the groups of two
and kill them all.

765
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:49,122
The sun is rising.

766
01:17:49,956 --> 01:17:51,625
Finish it before the day breaks.

767
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,331
What the...

768
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,132
What's going on?

769
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:01,445
Who are you?

770
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:02,946
I'm from the main troop.

771
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:06,867
I have Deputy Commander's command.

772
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,660
A messenger at the wee hours?

773
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:10,078
In a group?

774
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:12,205
We have been waiting
for the river to go down.

775
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:13,957
What's the watchword?

776
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:16,960
Watchword.

777
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:20,839
Slaughter.

778
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:27,888
It's a raid!

779
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:38,148
Kill them!

780
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:40,358
Die!

781
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,532
What the hell are they doing
in the middle of the night?

782
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,493
Kill them all!

783
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,544
Come here!

784
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:06,718
Damn it.

785
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:31,535
No!

786
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,127
I thought I had nothing to lose.

787
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,630
But I realized
I do have a thing I don't want to lose.

788
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,049
Hwi. I'm talking about you.

789
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:53,468
Let me ask you one thing.

790
01:22:53,593 --> 01:22:55,303
What is it that we did wrong?

791
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:58,348
What is it that we did so wrong
that they are out to kill us?

792
01:22:58,431 --> 01:22:59,557
It was 500.

793
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:02,852
It was a whopping 500 lives
that you killed for no reason.

794
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:05,647
There's nothing
that can be killed for no reason.

795
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:08,566
We'll all die trying to save them all.
Save at least one.

796
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:11,569
I'm not giving this to you to fight.
Do you know what I mean?

797
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,446
If you see anyone crossing the river,

798
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:14,823
kill them all.

799
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:16,324
What about your son, sir?

800
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:19,160
Accept that you are abandoned.
Only then can you live.

801
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:22,664
Just like how I accepted
that my father abandoned me.

802
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:24,499
Is it your country or your child?

803
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:27,794
Stand beside me

804
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:30,088
and do not dare to stand in front of me.
