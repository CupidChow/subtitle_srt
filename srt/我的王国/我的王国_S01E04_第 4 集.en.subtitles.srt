1
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,725
THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

2
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,935
SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARACTERS
ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,134
A beater?

4
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,848
You bastards schemed together.

5
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,517
All right.

6
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,104
Then I should take your head as well.

7
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,671
Seon-ho.

8
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,387
EPISODE 4

9
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,141
Goodness gracious.

10
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,769
I'm not Hua Tuo or Bian Que.

11
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,938
I can't bring a dead person back to life.

12
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,314
He's not dead.

13
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,941
He's still breathing.

14
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,610
He came here to kill us. Why save him?

15
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,071
If you have eyes, see it for yourself.

16
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,656
Everyone's dead.

17
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,950
Everyone got killed,
except for the four of us.

18
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,243
Mun-bok!

19
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,412
Damn it.

20
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,790
What will happen if we save him?

21
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,293
What will you do with a burden
that's as big as you?

22
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,714
Don't say that. He's not a burden.

23
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,798
He is.

24
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,592
He's a burden that will kill you
as well as all of us.

25
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,802
Shut up!

26
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:06,222
To you, he's a friend.
But to us, he's just an assassin.

27
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,683
If you don't agree, persuade us.

28
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,435
If you can't persuade us,

29
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,107
you must ask nicely
instead of throwing a hissy fit.

30
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,844
Please save him.

31
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,430
Goddamnit.

32
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,767
I beg you.

33
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,148
Jeez, this is ridiculous.

34
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:02,987
All right.

35
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,199
Let's see

36
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:10,286
if he's meant to die now
or if he's tough enough to survive this.

37
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,001
Seon-ho.

38
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,753
What are you doing? Put the shroud on him.

39
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,468
Send him off in nice clothes.
Your mother will smile.

40
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,931
Don't cry.

41
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,392
Yeon will be heartbroken if you cry.

42
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:07,987
Seon-ho.

43
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,241
Why did you come here?

44
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,662
You said you sent me here.

45
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,084
Then why are you in this mess?

46
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,214
What the hell

47
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,217
is happening?

48
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,641
Let me see your wound.

49
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,811
You are truly rambunctious.

50
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,148
I cannot outdo Father though.

51
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,360
He has mistresses all over the country.

52
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,821
Soon, I'll be confused as to
who's my mother

53
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,406
and who is a mistress.

54
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,865
What brings you here?

55
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,368
Did your father send you?

56
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,536
Or...

57
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,454
are you here to humiliate me?

58
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,207
Because you are the one

59
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,003
whom my father loves the most.

60
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,630
And who knows?

61
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,676
If I escort you safely,
he may praise me for it.

62
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,557
The wound is deep.

63
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,434
You need to get it treated.

64
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,105
Would you like a gag?

65
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,523
No, I don't need one.

66
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,034
What are those?

67
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,077
Sweetgum resin and draconis sanguis.

68
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,497
They're good for metal allergy,
so I brought them.

69
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,876
You know who I am,

70
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,629
and you also knew this would happen.

71
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,547
Who are you?

72
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,799
You can easily get geumsangsan
at apothecaries.

73
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,886
And these are usually used
at kisaeng houses.

74
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,763
So you're a kisaeng.

75
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,307
Are all your siblings tigers?

76
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,434
None of you is a dog?

77
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,895
What do you mean?

78
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,689
What I mean is, not everyone
at kisaeng houses is a kisaeng.

79
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,778
You did well, my lady.

80
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,703
Are we headed
to the northeast area?

81
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,080
That's right.

82
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,915
I think they know.

83
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,708
Let's change our route.

84
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,189
Shall we take turns?

85
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,691
You'll hurt your back.

86
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,777
She's as heavy as half a sack of rice.

87
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,490
I envy Yeon.
She has someone who can carry her home.

88
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,908
That's what I am saying.

89
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,616
The tides have died down,
and there is fog over the river.

90
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,660
We should cross the river now.

91
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,460
Let's...

92
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,003
go home.

93
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,425
We must leave now.

94
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,012
Sir.

95
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,473
What about the citadel in Uiju?

96
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,975
They let the main troops in.

97
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,936
The people wrote a song praising
General Yi and sang it for him.

98
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,981
Some of them even threw petals
at the troops to welcome them.

99
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,441
What about the King

100
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,319
-and Choi Yeong?
-They left Pyeongyang,

101
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,154
fleeing to Gaegyeong in a hurry.

102
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,076
You should stay here.

103
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,745
If you see

104
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,206
anyone crossing the river,

105
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,669
kill them all.

106
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,338
Including the slaughter squad?

107
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,841
I never sent it to their camp.

108
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,430
What about your son, sir?

109
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,411
Rest in peace.

110
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,539
Let's go.

111
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,256
-Here.
-Let us help.

112
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,907
Let me ask you one thing.

113
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,410
What is it that we did wrong?

114
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,746
What is it that we have done so wrong
that they are out to kill us?

115
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,749
We just need to survive.
That's how we can take revenge.

116
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,960
We mustn't let our guard down yet.

117
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,171
They even snuck into hell to kill us.

118
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,258
They won't let us live
that we're out of there.

119
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,194
They're coming.

120
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,039
It looks empty, sir.

121
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,917
You can't cross the Amnok
without an oar.

122
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,563
Who ordered you to be on watch here?

123
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,820
Whose order was this?

124
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,242
The Commander in Chief of the Right Army,

125
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,744
Nam Jeon.

126
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,206
That can't be.

127
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,958
His son is with us.

128
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,795
He told us

129
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,798
to kill his son first if we catch him.

130
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,030
What do we do now?

131
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,117
It's not like we can suddenly find gold
in a mire filled with manure.

132
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,952
Watch what you say, will you?

133
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,580
"Manure," seriously?

134
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,332
I'm just worried, okay?

135
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,753
You prick. How dare you glare at me?

136
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,087
Go on your way.

137
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,298
I'll go separately.

138
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,591
Can we really get going?

139
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,551
What the hell? You piece of...

140
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,720
You're so selfish.

141
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,846
What do we do, then?

142
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,515
It's not like we have a horse
or even a cow!

143
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,764
YI SEONG-GYE

144
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,073
UIJU

145
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,617
We'll be able to get
some medicine in Uiju.

146
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,286
But the enemy army must be there.

147
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,793
We are walking
into the tiger's mouth.

148
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,879
Do you wish to be eaten alive?

149
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,632
Do I sound like a dog barking?

150
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,551
Damn it.

151
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,344
This is nuts.

152
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,512
Let's hurry.

153
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,173
Jeez! What kind of rude bastard
is barging in like this?

154
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,761
Gosh! Who are you guys?

155
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,264
My goodness. What is going on?

156
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,662
If pus comes out,

157
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,083
it means your intestines are rotting,
which means you'll die.

158
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,585
You'll only live
if black blood comes out, okay?

159
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,642
Oh, my.

160
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,478
This guy will probably
have to gulp down five bowls of poison

161
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,646
if he wishes to die.

162
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,693
You're okay now. Well done.

163
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,337
Sir.

164
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,964
I never asked for backup.

165
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,924
I've been ordered to assist you.

166
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,135
What?

167
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,264
-Assist me?
-The Commander in Chief

168
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,100
told us not to return
until we finish them all.

169
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,814
Let's go.

170
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,703
Draw a mustache on ten

171
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,581
To make it a tree

172
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,417
A person holding a tree

173
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,003
Becomes the surname, Yi

174
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,339
Someone with the surname, Yi

175
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,923
Will become king

176
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,847
What does that song mean?

177
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,392
It means that someone whose surname
has the character for tree

178
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,062
will become king.

179
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,939
-What?
-In other words,

180
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,151
General Yi Seong-gye

181
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,903
will become king.

182
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,446
That's what it means.

183
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,448
That's ridiculous.

184
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,658
Who cares what the king's surname is?

185
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,745
Why bother making a song about it?

186
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,832
By the way, where did you learn

187
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,709
such incredible medical techniques?

188
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,340
-Enlist in the army.
-What?

189
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,051
In about ten years, you will master

190
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,386
how to stitch up intestines

191
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,346
as well as limbs

192
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,681
that are shredded to pieces.

193
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,476
Gosh, I...

194
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,936
No, please...

195
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,688
He hasn't even budged
in the last two days.

196
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,066
Doesn't he need to poop?

197
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,999
What's going on?

198
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,628
Halt.
Let me ask you something.

199
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,301
Did you see injured
or suspicious-looking men?

200
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,887
-I did.
-Where?

201
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,101
There are dozens of deserters

202
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,894
from Wihwa Island.

203
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,647
But they either got killed
or starved to death.

204
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,072
Halt.

205
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,383
MEDICINE

206
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,538
You woke up.

207
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,081
I woke up hours ago.

208
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,379
I dozed off for a few minutes
while looking after you.

209
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,549
Dozed off, my foot.
I even heard you grinding your teeth.

210
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,683
Consider yourself lucky.

211
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,394
The sword didn't go through
any major organs.

212
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,231
Whose fault is that I got stabbed?

213
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:25,690
Goodness.

214
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,609
The neck is three nyang,

215
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,111
so do you owe me
about 100 nyang for saving your life?

216
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,530
You must repay me.

217
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:35,242
I traveled over 100 ri while carrying you.
Let's call it even.

218
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,080
All right.

219
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,847
After all,
it is hard to turn your life around.

220
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,518
I thought I had nothing to lose.

221
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:06,439
But I realized
I do have a thing I don't want to lose.

222
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,358
You realized it just now?

223
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,651
Hwi.

224
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,195
I'm talking about you.

225
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,993
I tried my best to hold onto it,

226
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,663
but I can't hold out any longer.

227
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,375
So I'm just going to let it go now.

228
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,421
Get some rest.

229
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,256
Why aren't you asking?

230
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,260
The reason why you were dragged there

231
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,971
and why I went there.

232
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,890
Let's talk another time.

233
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,350
It was all me.

234
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,146
I was the one who bribed the examiner

235
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,358
and sent you here.

236
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,820
-Enough.
-I had to get rid of the advance troops.

237
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,864
That's why I went there.

238
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,658
To kill you guys.

239
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,285
-Enough!
-Just listen.

240
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,746
I'm not finished yet.

241
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,376
If you came to kill me,
why did you spare my life?

242
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,172
I was indebted to you,

243
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,299
so I repaid you.

244
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,508
That's all.

245
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,303
We fought

246
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,306
because we were ordered to. So...

247
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,516
So why...

248
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,102
That's what war is all about.

249
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,276
Where is Yeon?

250
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:40,909
Is she

251
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,912
still alive?

252
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,775
Where is Yeon?

253
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,410
She's dead.

254
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,213
What...

255
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,590
Come again. What did you say?

256
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,342
She's dead.

257
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,220
Yeon is dead.

258
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,223
Help her get well.

259
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,601
However, keep that fact hidden.

260
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,396
No one can know.

261
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,398
If anyone finds out,

262
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,693
I'll kill them.

263
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,492
Don't show yourself ever again.

264
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,996
That is the only way you can survive.

265
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,167
I don't believe that you sent me there.

266
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,837
I wasn't going to believe it
even if it were true, but...

267
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,423
But the thing is,

268
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,803
I absolutely can't forgive you
for what happened to Yeon.

269
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,603
I'll go to your father.

270
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,522
No, don't.

271
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,483
I will stop you.

272
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,776
If you dare to stop me,

273
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,195
I'll teach you a serious lesson.

274
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,322
Why don't you get it?

275
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,867
You'll die.

276
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,037
I said, you'll die.

277
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,372
You and I

278
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,167
are no longer friends.

279
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,839
We'll be enemies
if we ever cross paths again.

280
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,176
And I may kill you if that happens.

281
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,683
I guess you lost him.

282
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,520
The Commander in Chief doesn't forgive
warriors who have failed.

283
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,607
I must either get the job done
or take my own life.

284
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,858
I only have two options.

285
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,570
I shall hold you hostage just in case
I have to be ready for the latter.

286
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,031
I'll use you
to strike a deal with your father.

287
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,657
What if you get it done?

288
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,119
I'll move up to the senior fifth rank,
and you'll be a colonel.

289
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,458
How foolish.

290
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,463
The slaughter squad
consists of the Jurchens

291
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,882
because he doesn't care
whether you guys die or not.

292
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,676
Just like the advance troops
that consist of prisoners.

293
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,386
Shut up.

294
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,931
General Yi would never do that.

295
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,643
You can't see the truth

296
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,811
because you refuse to accept it.

297
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,440
That's why you don't even realize
he deserted you.

298
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,400
Then what about you?

299
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:26,986
I am

300
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,407
just a tool that he is using to test

301
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,451
my father's loyalty.

302
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,039
Your son is with the advance troops.

303
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,002
He'd make the perfect hostage
since he is your son.

304
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,380
I will take care of it.

305
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,048
No, I will handle it myself.

306
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,841
Both the chief guard and your son.

307
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,852
MILITARY CAMP OF CHOI YEONG,
THE COMMANDER OF EIGHT PROVINCES

308
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,356
I will go forward. What will you do?

309
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,069
Choose.

310
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,406
Is it your country or your child?

311
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,578
I choose our country, sir.

312
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,293
Accept that you are abandoned.
Only then you can live.

313
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,885
Just like how I accepted
that my father abandoned me.

314
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,740
You need a new master,

315
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,409
and I need a sharp sword.

316
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,829
Join hands with me.

317
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,707
How dare you tell me

318
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,001
to serve you?

319
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,879
My father will devour me,

320
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,883
but I will grow my power

321
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,260
to rip him apart and free myself.

322
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,513
If I cannot ascend the throne,

323
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,016
I'll become the ruler of the darkness.

324
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,726
Make your decision.

325
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,437
Will you die by his hand

326
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,607
or thrive in darkness?

327
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,920
Hey, I don't think
we're going the right way.

328
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,339
-We are.
-What are you talking about?

329
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,134
It seems we're going around
in circles here.

330
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,510
I feel so dizzy.

331
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,555
He's a head full of hot air.
How can I even trust him?

332
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,364
What do you think you're doing?

333
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,766
Who do you work for?

334
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,436
I used to serve Leader Nal-soe

335
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,729
in Mount Hambaek.

336
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,523
Nal-soe?

337
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,858
I've heard of that name.

338
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,279
He's a butcherly jerk who'd kill anyone
without distinction of age.

339
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,616
I heard his underling beat him to death.

340
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,660
Was that you?

341
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:45,995
Yes.

342
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,081
How did you know our birdcall?

343
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,376
There's no much difference
in robbers' birdcalls.

344
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,922
I thought I'd be eating some horse meat
today, but it's not going to happen.

345
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:57,840
Disperse.

346
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,599
Now that we're on your way,

347
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,893
can we owe you some food?

348
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,814
Let's call it a day.

349
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,695
All right. Let's go.

350
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,992
-Dad!
-Hey.

351
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,536
Dad!

352
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,347
Why aren't you eating?

353
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,517
Don't you like the food?

354
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,939
Why are you crying?

355
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,361
I haven't sat down to eat
for the past ten years.

356
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,530
It's just too precious to eat.

357
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,244
Go ahead and eat.
Eat till your stomach bursts.

358
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,300
Good gracious.

359
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,761
This isn't a chicken. It's a phoenix.

360
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,556
Is this your first time to eat chicken?

361
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,891
Thank you.

362
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,144
Let's eat.

363
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,816
Here. Have some more.

364
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,702
Slow down.

365
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,026
We travel only at night.

366
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,862
We haven't eaten all day.

367
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,156
-We have plenty of water.
-My lord.

368
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,991
We can't afford to get caught.

369
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,160
No.

370
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,537
There are mulberries
and cherries in the vicinity.

371
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,247
It won't take long.

372
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,166
Mulberries sound good.

373
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,250
I like cherries.

374
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,258
They seem to have been overindulged.

375
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,135
They've been starving only a day.

376
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,513
If it were two,
they'd eat their own flesh.

377
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,559
I give you 15 minutes.

378
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,605
Time it.

379
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,061
It's them. They are going up the mountain.

380
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,104
How many?

381
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,606
They were about eight to ten.

382
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,741
-Hui-jae, you take care of Bang-seok.
-Ma'am.

383
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,869
We might all die
trying to save them all.

384
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,579
We have to save at least one.

385
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,331
Mother.

386
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,209
Stop crying.

387
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,962
A man shouldn't cry before a sword.

388
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,522
If you...

389
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,359
If you're held hostage, use this.

390
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:35,367
I'm not giving it to you so you can fight.
Do you know what I mean?

391
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,876
Do you understand?

392
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,297
Yes, Lady Kang.

393
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,554
Go. Hurry.

394
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,079
Forgive me.

395
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,040
Please forgive me.

396
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,558
I'm at your service, Young Master.

397
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,907
The Goryeo capital has gone under.

398
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,038
We're going back.

399
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,812
You're so distracting. Will you stop?

400
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:12,066
What? Are you nervous?

401
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,615
Do you want to live here?

402
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,741
No way.

403
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,951
You've lived on hillsides
and not on flatland.

404
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,536
There's nothing down there.

405
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,581
Why care if the country is overthrown?

406
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,875
It won't make any difference.

407
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,712
What are you talking about?

408
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,005
Is the country overthrown?

409
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,800
You know even less than me
living in the heart of mountains.

410
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:41,553
That jerk named Yi Seong-gye
or something overturned the nation.

411
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,015
Leader Kkae-kku.

412
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,435
You must've heard
about the advance party of Liaodong.

413
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,645
The advance party?

414
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,271
What's that?

415
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,525
Well...

416
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,735
Never mind.

417
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,055
Tae-ryeong.

418
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,349
Take my mother

419
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,186
and brothers back home.

420
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,313
Yes, sir.

421
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:17,191
I will dare ride on horseback

422
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,277
carrying a sword and enter the palace.

423
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,863
I must see

424
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,948
the overturned nation

425
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,701
for myself.

426
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,963
I, Left Private Secretary Nam Jeon,
address you, Deputy Commander.

427
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:43,801
Speak.

428
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,513
The King's family including his relatives
have been imprisoned.

429
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,557
Commander Choi Yeong resisted intensely,

430
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,643
but he is being transferred here.

431
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,144
This nation...

432
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:57,940
is now yours.

433
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,526
Watch your mouth.

434
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,278
The Royal Family and the regime
are intact.

435
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,656
How dare a vassal speak of such rebellion?

436
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,918
If that is true,
then why aren't you taking my life?

437
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,088
Let me inform you once again.

438
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,090
This nation

439
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,009
is now yours.

440
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:27,970
Nam Jeon.

441
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,894
I was top of my class
but I was never awarded with a decent job.

442
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:39,273
I led the troops
and defeated the Japanese raiders,

443
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,400
but I was stuck managing
the royal stables.

444
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,985
All because...

445
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,446
I swore my allegiance to you.

446
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,198
How is that right?

447
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,743
You retreated from Wihwado
to put an end to those evil,

448
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,871
but my reason was different.

449
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,873
And what might that be?

450
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,375
A new country.

451
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,964
Killing Choi Yeong
won't end this atrocity.

452
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,257
Kill the King,

453
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,594
his entire extended family,
and those who follow him.

454
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,305
You must wipe out the entire royal family

455
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,515
and give birth to a new world
for this to end.

456
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,351
May you reign, General.

457
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,812
And let me be your sword.

458
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:22,608
If my idea is an act of treason,
go ahead and kill me.

459
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,730
You must learn to watch your mouth.

460
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,249
"May you reign, General.

461
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,586
And let me be your sword."

462
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:30,509
Who are you? Han Xin or Bai Qi?

463
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,263
Chief of royal stables,

464
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,892
you should bow down lower from now on.

465
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,228
Learn to be more modest.

466
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,439
-How dare you--
-Now that you successfully retreated,

467
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:48,318
King U and Choi Yeong
will die while in exile.

468
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,655
You'll have some ditsy others
take the throne only to take it away.

469
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,616
A new nation will be born
and you'll receive

470
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,327
an honorific appellation
for your contribution.

471
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:03,834
You, the mere Chief of royal stables.

472
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,295
Do not forget though

473
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,548
that Seo Geom

474
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,551
was supposed to be at my father's side.

475
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,645
Stand beside me

476
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,064
and do not dare to stand in front of me.

477
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,200
The new country isn't yours.

478
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,871
It's my father's.

479
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,998
It's my father's nation.

480
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,292
And...

481
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,046
also mine.

482
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,784
I have returned safely, Father.

483
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,787
-Both mothers are unscathed--
-Kneel.

484
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:26,917
The Minister of Personnel
dares to address me while standing?

485
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,678
Assessing those only by their rank

486
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:42,057
makes you
a lowly sixth rank officer as well.

487
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,517
Is that who you are?

488
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,768
No, Father.

489
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,436
When commanding underlings,

490
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,272
it's more important to know
when to discard them.

491
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:53,944
Even if the gat itself is good,
you can't wear it if there's no ribbon.

492
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,571
A vassal at your feet is of no use

493
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,533
but one at your knees is most useful.

494
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,327
Nam Jeon is at my shoulder now.

495
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,163
He is of grave importance,
so do not belittle him.

496
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,583
If that's the case,
then where do I stand with you?

497
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,086
At your feet

498
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,797
or at your knees?

499
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,216
You are my blood.

500
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,928
How could I possibly assess you
in such a way?

501
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,472
Then,

502
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,308
why did you make me kneel like this?

503
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,025
I never told you to stand.

504
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,527
You never told me

505
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,445
not to either.

506
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,572
Bang-won...

507
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,823
All you had to do

508
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,701
is commend me for the work I did.

509
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,789
Then I would've believed

510
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,584
how you don't think of me

511
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,631
as one of your subjects.

512
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,891
Like I said, he's an insolent bastard.

513
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,858
Even thieves say goodbye

514
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,610
after robbing you blind.

515
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,404
I live at the foot of the mountain
in Bihyeongol.

516
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,074
You're always welcome.

517
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,618
Thank you for everything.

518
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,079
You kept me alive.

519
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,372
Whatever you do,

520
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:11,873
stay safe.

521
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,381
Stay safe.

522
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,229
Heartless prick.

523
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,508
Hwi...

524
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,676
You call me way too much.

525
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,347
Don't trade the flower patterned shoes.

526
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,141
I'd...

527
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,144
rather hold onto them until they fit.

528
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:40,980
That means

529
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,067
I will at least live until I am older.

530
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,870
Soldiers will listen
and officers will take this to heart.

531
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:40,206
I, Deputy Commander Yi Seong-gye,

532
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,293
didn't retreat from Wihwado
for my personal gain.

533
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,547
It was to save the people
from getting slaughtered at war

534
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,426
and to save the court from its enemies.

535
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,928
Bear this in mind

536
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,639
and do your best

537
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,975
to console the people.

538
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:02,145
Was it truly for the people?

539
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:05,857
Then how do you explain
the deaths of the advance party?

540
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,735
Are they not our people too?

541
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,071
Advance party?

542
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,948
One even existing is news to me.

543
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,452
Everyone knows about it but you then.

544
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:19,579
But it's also said
that you sent a death squad

545
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,248
to eliminate all those
that were still alive.

546
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,334
Please watch what you're saying.

547
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,669
No, you're the one
who should hold your tongue.

548
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,463
How dare you kill innocent people!

549
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,924
How do you expect
to deal with the aftermath?

550
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,551
Why are you ardently focused on a rumor?

551
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,011
It's not a rumor.

552
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,180
The King dispatched an advance party.

553
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:40,016
If the Deputy Commander didn't kill them,
who did?

554
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:43,102
If Choi Yeong did wrong
by planning an unnecessary war,

555
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,605
then you are too
for getting those men killed.

556
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,398
I dare you to say that I'm wrong.

557
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,014
I, Adjutant Nam Seon-ho,
address Deputy Commander Yi.

558
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,103
-Speak.
-Soldiers fleeing from their duties

559
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,604
are considered as felons.

560
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:30,233
They were making their way to Ming,
so I killed them by means of military law.

561
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:41,119
Here are the list of escapees,
a letter that was circulated among them,

562
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:43,705
and a written surrender for Ming.

563
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:47,458
Show it directly to Mokeun.

564
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,383
Plot of treason, immorality,

565
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,051
murder, and even rape.

566
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,221
Which of these men
do you think is innocent?

567
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,768
Keep it...

568
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,272
for light reading.

569
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,692
How dare a mere lieutenant...

570
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:15,862
While you were here
being manipulated by rumors,

571
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,781
I risked my life on the battlefield.

572
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,701
I, this mere lieutenant.

573
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,244
Why you...

574
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,064
I'm happy you're back.

575
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:52,899
I'm glad.

576
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,319
We've been blessed.

577
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,457
Father,

578
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,419
I apologize for worrying you.

579
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,546
Do not say that.

580
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,131
I'm...

581
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:22,011
just happy that you're back in one piece.

582
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,979
You will not talk to your mother
from now on

583
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,564
and speak down to her

584
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,108
if you need to.

585
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,487
You will reside in the sarangchae

586
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,572
but will not call me Father.

587
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,493
You aren't a noble or a slave,
just a bastard son.

588
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:49,706
Disobey my orders

589
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:54,585
and I will brand your forehead
and kick you out on the street as a slave.

590
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:01,968
Come.

591
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:09,350
Now!

592
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:17,984
Go.

593
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,362
Mom.

594
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,615
Please go.

595
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,264
Hwi...

596
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,601
will come for you.

597
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:43,898
Come in.

598
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,110
Should I get the door for you?

599
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,013
How did you know it was me?

600
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:17,723
Because you're the only one.

601
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,684
Who'd come for you?

602
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,061
No, who'd save Seon-ho.

603
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,486
Because of you, he's alive.

604
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,280
Thank you.

605
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:36,784
I'm here to ask a question.

606
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:39,328
-Answer untruthfully--
-People only lie

607
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:41,998
because they're afraid
of what the truth will reveal.

608
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,291
I'm not scared of you,

609
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,337
so there's no reason for me to lie.

610
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,632
I shipped you off to the military.

611
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:55,970
However, the death squad wasn't formed
to eliminate you.

612
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,889
You just happened to be there.

613
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,641
It was 500.

614
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,729
It was a whopping 500 lives
that you killed for no reason.

615
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:09,483
There's nothing in this world
that can be killed for no reason.

616
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:10,651
In our hearts,

617
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,989
we bury the sacrifice of individuals
for the greater good.

618
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:17,616
That's all.

619
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:23,456
My lord.

620
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:26,667
Come in.

621
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,389
He's a subject of mine.

622
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:24,058
Greet him formally.

623
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,397
It's nice to meet you.

624
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,365
Come on now.

625
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,991
Why are you staring at her?

626
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:44,120
Have you met her before?

627
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,335
I'll excuse myself then.

628
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:31,458
Yeon,

629
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,044
are you awake?

630
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:35,629
It's me.

631
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:42,511
Who...

632
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:44,513
are you?

633
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,812
So my name is Yeon

634
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,356
and I'm 16.

635
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,693
I had Epilepsy and my father was
punished by being dipped in a cauldron.

636
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:01,322
And on top of that,
I even lost my memories?

637
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:03,866
That's right.

638
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:10,122
Her life must've been

639
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:13,417
so difficult.

640
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,294
My life,

641
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,213
I mean.

642
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,553
How did you manage?

643
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,935
Just hearing about your life
is suffocating enough,

644
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:36,023
so how did you endure the pain
all those years?

645
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:49,119
Oddly enough, her epilepsy
vanished since that day.

646
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:52,414
It probably went away
along with her bad memories.

647
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,793
Don't you dare talk about her.

648
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:57,044
Then here's my question.

649
01:10:57,461 --> 01:10:59,713
Why didn't you tell her the truth?

650
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:03,133
Tell her that you're her brother
and that she's your sister.

651
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,429
It's your sister whom you love dearly.

652
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,683
Try pleading or begging with her.
Who knows?

653
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,977
Her memories might come back.

654
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:16,397
-That's enough.
-You still don't get it.

655
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:20,234
We hold back the truth
because we're afraid of the consequences.

656
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:23,112
Just like you are doing now.

657
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:24,947
I said that's enough.

658
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:27,783
Killing me will be
as good as killing Yeon.

659
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,244
There's no way to leave with her either.

660
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:32,538
Even if you succeed,
where will you take her?

661
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:35,165
Will you hide in the mountains
or on an island?

662
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,169
Yeon will have to be on the run
with a man she doesn't know.

663
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,838
Is that what you want?

664
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:42,881
Then go ahead.

665
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:46,844
Do it!
What are you waiting for?

666
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:48,637
Enough!

667
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:18,834
I will care for her
and make sure she lives decently.

668
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:21,378
She might end up marrying into
a noble family.

669
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:26,717
What is it that you can do for her?

670
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:29,511
As if I don't know your intention.

671
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,599
You're holding her hostage.

672
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:37,311
You're threatening me with her life.

673
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,485
Finally, we're on the same page.

674
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:56,288
Devote your life to me

675
01:12:57,831 --> 01:12:59,124
and Yeon

676
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,835
will live a life of luxury.

677
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:16,392
Can we talk?

678
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:26,902
Have we...

679
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:29,822
Have we met before?

680
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:41,375
Not before today.

681
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:46,839
It seemed like you knew me.

682
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:50,801
I'm sorry then.

683
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,265
Does Lord Nam...

684
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:02,146
treat you well?

685
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:05,899
He's like a father to me.

686
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:13,991
I'll...

687
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:16,076
see you around then.

688
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:49,067
Killing me will be
as good as killing Yeon.

689
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:51,945
Devote your life to me...

690
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,332
This is how people are.

691
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,043
Those who left came back willingly.

692
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:51,255
They will never leave again.

693
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:53,757
Of course.

694
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:55,509
They shouldn't have to.

695
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:09,022
This is your room
and these are your possessions.

696
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:10,649
It's too much.

697
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,526
I only wish I could give you more.

698
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:14,361
My lady--

699
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:17,030
You will always be by my side.

700
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,283
Unless you abandon me yourself,

701
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,785
I will always have you by my side.

702
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:09,082
Stop.

703
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:19,092
You are now beneath me.

704
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,053
That right there is your spot.

705
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:24,389
It's your father I made a deal with.

706
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,392
My father's orders go to you through me.

707
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:30,354
Once the deal is final, you will be paid.

708
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:39,029
And is that price

709
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:41,365
my sister?

710
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,450
Back out of the deal

711
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,369
and a blade will be thrown

712
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:47,996
at your sister.

713
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,123
You bastard!

714
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,045
You listen to me.

715
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,506
If you lay a single finger on her--

716
01:17:57,589 --> 01:18:00,217
You're the one
who failed to protect her, not me.

717
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:04,179
If you keep this up,
you won't be able to yet again.

718
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:12,813
What do you want from me?

719
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:27,577
He is Bang-won,
the fifth son of General Yi.

720
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,250
Take a good look at him.

721
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:35,502
He will steal this nation.

722
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:38,004
You are to gain his trust.

723
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:39,881
And then?

724
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,843
You'll kill him.

725
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,902
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM YOON-SEO

726
01:19:18,962 --> 01:19:22,466
I finally know
that powerless justice is of no use.

727
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:24,176
You were reckless today,

728
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:26,011
but you won't be tomorrow.

729
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:28,346
There's an uncomfortable truth
and a white lie.

730
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,640
Keep an eye on those
who seem too kind to you.

731
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,517
You're called
a minister in a frock.

732
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,187
And I hear you're called
the King wearing a gat.

733
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:36,438
Don't you know me?

734
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:42,360
Keep in mind that
it's the country that changed,

735
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,737
not the world.

736
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:47,199
Roughnecks and officials
all have the same colored blood.

737
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:50,243
Bloodshed is inevitable.
What follows is the real issue.

738
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:52,370
Get him to talk and win over the King.

739
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:55,457
I will kill him and win over Bang-won.

740
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,751
Some are bound to shed blood.

741
01:19:57,834 --> 01:19:59,711
It just won't be us.

742
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:01,880
Who else knows?

743
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:06,051
Now and for years to come,
it will only be you.
