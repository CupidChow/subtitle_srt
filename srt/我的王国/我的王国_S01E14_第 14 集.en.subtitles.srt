THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,977
SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARACTERS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,813
EPISODE 14

4
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,441
Hui-jae blocked the King's path.

5
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,318
That must be why.

6
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,786
The one with the tiger skin is the chief.

7
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,621
The one with the leopard skin
is his deputy.

8
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,624
Slay them.

9
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,924
Next.

10
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,139
Hui-jae, stay with me.

11
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,141
Hui-jae!

12
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,616
Your Highness,

13
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,370
His Majesty has moved his guards.

14
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,625
But the Consolidated Army Command
is mine now,

15
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,544
so how...

16
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,588
He moved the men
under the chief guard's command.

17
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,965
The chief guard left the palace

18
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,136
when the King is still inside?

19
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,235
Your Majesty, it's Prince Jeongan--

20
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,327
I never said you could come in.

21
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,871
Call in the palace guards.

22
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,332
Private armies were declared illegal,

23
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,208
and I ordered them to be disbanded.

24
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,543
But still,

25
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,338
they go around in groups

26
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,173
wreaking havoc across the land.

27
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,802
However, you're telling me
to turn a blind eye

28
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,055
and withdraw the punishment.

29
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,765
Your Majesty.

30
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,100
You don't have a private army of your own,

31
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,353
so why are you agitated?

32
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,772
This is my last request, Your Majesty.

33
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,650
Please revoke your order.

34
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:54,943
Your request?

35
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,862
Consider it denied.

36
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,532
Tonight,

37
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,870
everyone will die.

38
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,664
From this moment on,

39
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,792
Gangnyeongjeon will stay closed.

40
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,629
You will not be able
to take a step outside.

41
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,551
I, who once ruled the world,

42
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,597
will now be confined to one tiny room.

43
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,017
Do as you wish.

44
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,562
The more you persecute me,

45
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,357
the more the people will curse you.

46
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,784
You're wrong, Your Majesty.

47
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,413
Everyone in this nation

48
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,833
will forget you existed.

49
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,670
Once off his throne,

50
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,463
a King

51
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,926
becomes a mere old man.

52
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,130
This way!

53
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,308
Head to Mount Bukak.

54
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,934
There is a village over the hill.

55
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:52,852
What about you?

56
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,353
Just go!

57
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,279
Stop!

58
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,932
Stay alive.

59
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,968
Ihwaru...

60
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,178
I must go back.

61
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,013
Everyone's still back there.

62
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,349
No, you'll only die.

63
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,600
Move.

64
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,968
Hang in there.

65
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,845
There's a village over that hill.

66
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,551
Wait here for a moment.

67
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,011
It won't take long.

68
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,513
Enough!

69
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,110
There is no scenario where you survive.

70
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,405
Run, beg for mercy, or fight against me.

71
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,948
Whatever you do,

72
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,451
you

73
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,746
will all die today.

74
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,274
You did well.

75
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,735
Thank you.

76
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,292
The nation you dream is too grand for me,

77
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,003
and my nation

78
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,465
is too humble for your ambition.

79
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,177
That's why I was going to leave.

80
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,598
But I can't

81
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,269
see the people I care about
die or get hurt.

82
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,606
Not anymore.

83
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,822
I will protect them.

84
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,870
The people are my nation.

85
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,499
What about you?

86
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,884
Protecting those like you

87
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,596
is the nation I wish for.

88
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,828
I will make you King.

89
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,957
If you abandon us afterwards,

90
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,212
I'll be sure to come for your head.

91
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,314
You said that they'd surrender

92
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,608
once the chief and his deputy dies.

93
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,277
It seems like we have more blood to shed.

94
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,030
Slaying one's loyalty

95
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,324
brings on wrath.

96
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,706
This is the sword of Yi Seong-gye.

97
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,587
You were abandoned
by the owner of this sword.

98
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,923
Just like me.

99
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,136
I will use Yi Seong-gye
to slay Yi Bang-won and...

100
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,771
leave him to rot.

101
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,570
Will you die here as the abandoned

102
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,865
or will you join me and seek revenge?

103
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,617
If not,

104
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,915
you can either fight with me here
to your death.

105
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,334
After we get our revenge,

106
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,339
will you take us in?

107
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,425
That is a promise...

108
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,678
I can't make.

109
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,724
If you had,

110
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,851
I would've killed you.

111
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,270
Because it would've been a lie.

112
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,701
I thank you for killing the chief.

113
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:11,869
He...

114
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,081
killed his people more
than he killed his enemies.

115
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,023
Live.

116
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,151
That's one last favor I ask you.

117
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,081
Keep drinking like that

118
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,750
and you'll be slayed in your sleep.

119
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,503
I'm sure you'll protect me.

120
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,133
It's not like we were doing
anything grand,

121
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,719
so why did we never sit down for a drink?

122
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,562
You'll use Yi Seong-gye?

123
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,691
I will fool him
by pretending to be loyal to him again.

124
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,276
The King will buy us the time,

125
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,196
and we will use Bang-gan
to corner Bang-won.

126
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,826
Then I shall kill him.

127
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,104
Thank you, doctor.

128
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,772
Actually,

129
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,941
Prince Jeongan
is the one you should thank.

130
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,575
Doctor, just a moment.

131
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,827
Blood seems to be pooling inside the body,

132
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,829
but it's hard to take it out.

133
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,748
If you teach me how to do it,

134
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,542
I will never forget your generosity.

135
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,753
Do you know how to apply acupuncture?

136
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,422
Of course.
I can stick a long one in the head.

137
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,133
I even have the skill
to attach a nose to the back of a head.

138
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,470
However, I don't know
the exact pressure points.

139
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,354
You haven't slept for three days.

140
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,981
Are you all right?

141
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,026
I should do what I can to keep him alive

142
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,696
so that you and Madame Han
can live in peace.

143
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,159
I drew the clotted blood out
just like the doctor taught me.

144
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,329
I did everything that I can,

145
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,372
so all he has to do is wake up.

146
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,168
Gyeol has been protecting Hui-jae and me

147
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,128
since he was 12.

148
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,005
He'd rather get hurt himself

149
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,134
than to let anyone speak ill of us.

150
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,305
Then he is my savior too.

151
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,068
Should I give you something
to keep you awake?

152
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,903
As if there's any pill for that.

153
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,543
Gosh, a witch must've
cast a sleeping spell on me.

154
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,711
Why the hell am I so tired?

155
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,053
-What...
-Are you all right?

156
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,847
How are you?

157
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,598
Are you fully awake?

158
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,893
Hold on. Wait a second.

159
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,993
What about Gyeol and Cha-su?

160
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,995
Thankfully, they're fine.

161
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,123
And Ga-hwa?

162
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,428
What about Park?

163
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,140
Our caretaker?

164
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,901
We'll stay like this.

165
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,112
Just for a while.

166
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,114
I should've protected them.

167
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,869
It's why Madame Seo put me in charge.

168
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,833
They died because I wanted revenge.

169
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,519
Prince Yeongan,
you are the next Crown Prince.

170
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,398
You will do everything in your power
to correct the order of this court

171
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,317
and subside the mayhem from the revolt.

172
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,778
I will faithfully execute your order.

173
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,864
I hope that His Royal Highness

174
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,325
is never intimidated by the King

175
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,578
and do what's best for
the people of this nation.

176
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,372
Those same people

177
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,583
fear the atrocious and cruel sword.

178
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,797
Do not forget that your brother
is the one who slayed your brothers.

179
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,340
Tragedy...

180
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,134
begins with the greed from up top

181
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,471
and ends with the bloodshed at the bottom.

182
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,639
It wasn't me

183
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,476
who started this war.

184
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,853
A nation may be built with a sharp sword,

185
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,147
but it cannot be ruled with one.

186
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,734
You will be...

187
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,071
its demise.

188
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,657
Whatever position I'm given,

189
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,410
I will only be keeping the seat warm.

190
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,412
That's it.

191
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,339
His Majesty said what?

192
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,967
He has asked you
to discreetly enter the palace.

193
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,969
Me?

194
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,975
See?

195
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,312
He's not the type
to let someone walk all over him.

196
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,443
He plans on using me this time.

197
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,657
How is it

198
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,203
that you let Jeongan
persuade you into participating

199
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,205
in the revolt?

200
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,750
I am ashamed you see it that way.

201
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,752
I was too scared of Jeongan's threats

202
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,296
that I had to agree with his plans.

203
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,965
Tell me what your true intentions were.

204
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,676
You may be imprudent and vicious,

205
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,553
but you'd never fear such threats.

206
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,686
When a dragon and tiger fights,

207
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,190
a wolf awaits for it to end.

208
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,692
Getting involved

209
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,653
or taking a side would lead to its death.

210
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,947
So you're not on Jeongan's side?

211
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,992
I'm also saying I'm not on yours either.

212
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,870
But you must pick one though.

213
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,456
Once your younger brother becomes King,

214
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,918
he will never let you live.

215
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,128
Jeongan is a dutiful son.

216
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,049
I doubt he'll kill the brother
born from the same mother.

217
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,259
You could be sent to an island

218
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,847
or you could keep living
by pretending to have gone crazy.

219
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,432
But let me ask you this.

220
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,143
Can you truly call that a life?

221
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,980
The current Crown Prince has no son.

222
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:25,195
According to Jeongan who claimed
the rules of primogeniture,

223
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,696
the next Crown Prince

224
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,826
is you, Jeongan's older brother.

225
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,914
I have now given you
the justification you need.

226
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,544
So act on it

227
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:41,837
or...

228
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,757
keep living as a bat.

229
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,484
You should hang in there
a little bit more.

230
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,532
It's still too early
to let the burden fall on me.

231
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,020
Madame Han!

232
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,815
Madame Han, are you all right?

233
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,986
We heard the news.

234
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,197
I never revoked the disbandment order.

235
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,240
So why are you all back here?

236
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,367
You can't stop someone from leaving

237
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,912
nor reject one's heart.

238
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,248
We'll do this together.

239
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,627
Let us help.

240
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,082
Are you ready?

241
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,104
It's like he's already the King.

242
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,587
What is the meaning of this?

243
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,506
The chief guard

244
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,466
slayed others outside the palace.

245
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,469
The same could happen within the walls.

246
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:40,181
It's why he's here to protect you.

247
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,697
I know you.

248
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,992
The path you paved for me

249
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,286
led me here.

250
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,331
This isn't what I had in mind
when I paved it.

251
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,294
This isn't where
I intended to end up either.

252
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,921
When I tried to pass the state exam,
bribery was involved.

253
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,216
Then I was sent to fight in Liaodong.

254
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:19,512
I was abandoned along with
the other 500 men there.

255
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,223
I ended up losing everything.

256
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,726
I wanted to ask you.

257
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,187
Were we abandoned

258
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,273
because we dared to try and walk
when we weren't worthy enough

259
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,194
or was it because
we shouldn't have walked at all?

260
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,446
Paths are sometimes blocked

261
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,990
due to floods and heavy snow.

262
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,785
That is the nature of them.

263
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,119
So do not...

264
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,707
expect me to apologize.

265
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,628
The one who flooded the path
and laid snow on it was you.

266
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,256
I don't expect an apology,

267
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,386
but I will make Prince Jeongan my King

268
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,306
and have you regret ever abandoning us.

269
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,518
On the path that I've laid out...

270
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,398
lies no place for Jeongan.

271
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,359
The same goes for all of you.

272
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,486
That is why

273
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,863
I will

274
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,908
sever your path and block your way.

275
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,202
That is...

276
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,748
what I believe.

277
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,365
One's belief cannot be defeated

278
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,576
with emotions.

279
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,496
I only wanted to confirm his belief.

280
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,582
And?

281
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,667
Paths that can't be united

282
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,003
must be severed.

283
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,421
This is how

284
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,132
I plan on doing so.

285
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,134
The beginning is

286
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:22,969
His Majesty.

287
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,180
The end is Bang-gan.

288
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,142
Then...

289
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,569
I shall call this
the rebellion of Bang-gan.

290
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,389
It's no fun if you find me so quickly.

291
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,141
A while ago, you were mad I took too long.

292
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,144
-Hey!
-Okay, fine.

293
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:32,205
SECOND STRIFE OF PRINCES, 1400

294
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,920
GAEGYEONG

295
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,673
Your Majesty,

296
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,969
it's about time you chose a Crown Prince.

297
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,722
Please do not hesitate any longer.

298
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,518
It's not that I don't know.

299
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,437
The former King holds the Royal Seal
and voices his objection,

300
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,481
so who am I to go up against him?

301
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,609
How is it that the current King

302
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,571
still

303
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,658
walks on eggshells around the former King?

304
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,951
Brother,

305
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,996
he is not just the former King.

306
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,041
He is the founder of this nation.

307
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,503
We owe him our names as princes.

308
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,090
By the way, Your Majesty,

309
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,052
who do you have in mind
as the Crown Prince?

310
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,846
Well,

311
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,308
living a carefree life in luxury
is my dream,

312
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,311
but I ended up being born
before Prince Jeongan.

313
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,734
It's not what I want,

314
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,778
but that is the way of this nation.

315
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,574
It's...

316
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,661
what you claimed
when you killed Bang-seok.

317
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,456
Bang-gan.

318
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,375
"The eldest son being
first in line for the throne

319
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,630
is a rule that governed for centuries."

320
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,800
So that

321
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,554
also applies to the order of you and me.

322
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,655
Hoean.

323
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,573
Jeongan.

324
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,588
Do you still

325
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,383
have the written promise I gave you?

326
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,979
I cherish it like a pot full of honey

327
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,773
and bow down to it day and night.

328
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,150
You only get one chance

329
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,320
to cash in that promise.

330
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,619
I hope

331
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,123
you keep that in mind.

332
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,791
A single chance is enough.

333
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,753
I have two lives

334
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,089
while you have one.

335
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,968
That makes me a lucky bastard.

336
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,528
This is the nation
I built from the ground up.

337
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:58,453
I won't let history remember it as one
that can be obtained by bloodshed.

338
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,746
I must punish him.

339
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,497
No one should ever...

340
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,169
be able to

341
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,339
covet the throne by wielding his sword.

342
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,145
The former King is trapped in his quarters

343
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,605
and goes nowhere.

344
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,068
He will someday,

345
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,154
and I will be there to block him.

346
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,906
No,

347
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,533
Ihwaru will block his way.

348
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,499
What's his status?

349
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,584
He hasn't picked up his sword in a while.

350
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,586
Why are you so worried about him?

351
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,388
Seo Hwi.

352
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,768
He slayed all of the palace guards
outside Sajeong Gate

353
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,562
and crushed those at Chwiwoldang.

354
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,319
The thorn lodged in my throat

355
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:18,199
isn't Bang-won but Hwi, you idiot.

356
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,792
All right.

357
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,506
Nice!

358
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,675
Gosh.

359
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,935
My lord, I almost forgot.

360
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,362
It was made with
the finest soil from Tamjin.

361
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,656
This is too precious to receive.

362
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,867
Look at the color and its shape.

363
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,077
Its value does not match
that of yours though.

364
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:50,291
Prince Jeongan is adamant about
doing right by the Minister of Personnel.

365
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,792
Goodness.

366
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,463
So which rhythm should we dance to next?

367
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,089
The gutgeori rhythm.

368
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,428
Right.

369
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,556
Give me the gutgeori rhythm.

370
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,327
A dog is taken in and lives in clover.

371
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,246
What is the world coming to?

372
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,830
What do you mean?

373
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,707
He's Bang-won's dog.

374
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,876
I hear he's the one
who killed the Crown Prince.

375
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,128
You bastard. Take that!

376
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,423
Gosh, let's go.

377
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,398
Goodness.

378
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,566
Prince Hoean, is that you?

379
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,490
Money makes one seek booze

380
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,909
and being intoxicated by power
makes one dance.

381
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,162
I see that you're both.

382
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,916
That's too kind.

383
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,460
I'm nothing compared to how you are.

384
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,753
Are you

385
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,840
actually drunk or just pretending to be?

386
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,676
Sorry?

387
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,847
What was that?

388
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,936
You'll now scream
only after one cuts your head off.

389
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,813
What happened to you?

390
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,983
I coveted two swords.

391
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,153
You and your friend Nam Seon-ho.

392
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,448
One stands rotting

393
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,366
while one disappeared.

394
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,077
No one even saw his body. Is that true?

395
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,996
He's not my friend anymore,

396
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,457
so ask elsewhere.

397
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:55,958
Is that so?

398
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,631
Well,

399
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:06,635
you did join the man
who killed his father.

400
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,430
I doubt you even care about

401
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,766
what happened to him.

402
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,516
My sword.

403
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,283
How did it go?

404
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,536
Bang-gan has stopped suspecting me now.

405
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,955
He has soldiers
inside the prostitution house.

406
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,164
I will keep an eye on them.

407
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,125
And we'll keep checking the market shops.

408
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,459
Please.

409
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,544
What about you?

410
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,379
Are you going for another dance?

411
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,882
This time, with my sword.

412
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,387
Hwi...

413
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,225
Has he truly given up being a swordsman?

414
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,272
So?

415
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,942
Did you find out how many times
Bang-won goes to the lavatory?

416
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,694
He doesn't go often.

417
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,571
It's because he's greedy.

418
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,657
He keeps everything within
not wanting to let anything go.

419
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,493
Let's hear it then.

420
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,078
Only Tae-ryeong and Jeong Beom

421
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,038
guard Bang-won closely.

422
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,041
Also, his army hasn't trained in a while.

423
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,295
Even I'll be kicked out at this rate.

424
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,630
Power can sure be scary.

425
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,633
It changes the likes of almost everyone.

426
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,761
-And?
-Your deceased mother--

427
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,929
Hey.

428
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,140
Queen Sineui?

429
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,558
Yes.

430
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,770
The day before the anniversary
of Queen Sineui's death,

431
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,566
he will go hunting wild animals
for the memorial ceremony.

432
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,613
Hunting?

433
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,114
Yes.

434
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,450
Only with a few guards?

435
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,623
Let me see.

436
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,541
Is this

437
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,878
an opportunity or a trap?

438
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,226
Where are you rushing off to?

439
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,729
Hey.

440
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,273
Have you been tailing me?

441
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,150
I couldn't help it.
You have such a long tail.

442
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,195
You should've cut
your tail off to be a spy.

443
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,155
I know.

444
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,493
I should've learned that from you sooner.

445
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,745
You damn spy.

446
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,638
You're done being a bat.

447
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,162
Illegitimate sons are always the problem.

448
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,291
Both Bang-seok and Jeong Do-jeon
were born out of wedlock.

449
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:08,085
Your case is worse
because your mother was a lowborn.

450
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,884
The fact that I discriminate against them
is what saved your life.

451
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:20,180
You are not Nam Jeon's son,
just an illegitimate offspring.

452
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:24,643
It's why you're not even worth killing.

453
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,834
Let's go.

454
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,805
I will head to the hunting field.

455
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,768
The hunting field is right here.

456
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,103
We will wait in ambush
at the foot of Mount Janam

457
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,481
which is 10 lis away
from the hunting field.

458
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:14,693
I will draw Bang-gan into the ambush.

459
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,279
You should be careful.

460
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,032
If something happens
before you get to the ambush,

461
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,492
try to stall some time.

462
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,952
I'll place guards along the route.

463
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,329
In the worst-case scenario,

464
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,792
you will become the spearhead.

465
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:38,842
Now we should wait for Bang-gan
to meet with His Majesty.

466
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,595
We need His Majesty's royal permission.

467
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,891
Only then Prince Hoean will be
able to meet with His Majesty.

468
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,853
Don't worry. It's about killing me.

469
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,983
His Majesty has no reason to hesitate it.

470
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,917
No one even saw his body. Is that true?

471
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,045
Well,

472
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,799
you did join the man
who killed his father.

473
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:24,304
I doubt you even care about
what happened to him.

474
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:33,856
Did you find him?

475
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,942
Ever since he went off the grid
in Hanyang, he's been missing.

476
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,903
At the very least,
he's not in the south of Gaegyeong.

477
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,304
Why is it so huge?

478
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,975
I just can't get used to it.

479
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,691
He must've been lonely.

480
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,592
Gosh, what was that?

481
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:58,815
You damn punks. You're so done.

482
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,692
Do you know whom we serve?

483
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,111
Prince Hoean, Bang-gan.

484
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,699
Go tell him.

485
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,327
That I'd like to meet him.

486
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,335
What's next?

487
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,552
Gosh, this street is so crowded.

488
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,971
Please come and take a look around.

489
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,681
Take a look at this before you leave.

490
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,849
-What is all this?
-This is very nice.

491
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,488
Gosh, I must say
the mirror is so generous.

492
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,491
It even shows your filthy face.

493
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,577
Don't you even feel sorry for the mirror?

494
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,953
My goodness.

495
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,665
Hey, you octopus-looking jerk.
Will you shut your mouth?

496
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,626
-Octopus? Did you say octopus?
-Yes, I did!

497
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,837
Do you want to taste my ink or what?

498
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,505
I do. Go ahead and show me.

499
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,258
-You idiot!
-You damn punk!

500
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,220
Hey, you jerk.

501
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,638
My gosh.

502
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,602
It looks fun.

503
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,772
What was that?

504
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,774
How dare you...

505
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,278
You stupid idiot.

506
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,030
You just hit me in the eye.

507
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,073
-It's okay.
-You bastard!

508
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,492
Darn it.

509
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,048
It's not creative at all.

510
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:50,385
I'm going to kill you, damn octopus.

511
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,845
You...

512
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,806
-You damn idiot...
-Hey, it's done.

513
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,183
Chi-do is out. Stop it...

514
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,562
You idiot. Why would I stop?
I got one more blow.

515
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,481
Are you crazy?
Are you picking a real fight?

516
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,691
Life is all about fighting.

517
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,694
Hey, you stupid octopus.

518
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,949
-My gosh.
-What is going on?

519
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,162
Go ahead and make up.

520
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,500
No way.

521
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,127
He just went too far with octopus.

522
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,090
You're the one who insulted me
with a mirror first.

523
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,549
Damn it!

524
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,969
I'll just let this go for Bo-gum.

525
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,346
Who's Bo-gum?

526
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,764
It's my son.

527
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:37,516
Bo-gum means a precious sword.

528
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,851
What if it's a girl?

529
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:45,440
If it's a girl, it should be
Bo-yeong which means

530
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,483
a precious flower.

531
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,070
Bo-yeong sounds cute.

532
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,489
What a bullshit.

533
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,537
Now that Chi-do got me
a pretty name for a girl,

534
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:00,414
it'd be great to have a girl, right?

535
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,792
Whether it's a boy or a girl,
just have one.

536
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,127
I'll take care of your kid.

537
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,213
Just make sure not to punch me.

538
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:15,762
How was it?

539
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,473
As expected, it was full of arms.

540
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,561
Now Bang-gan will try
to sound Prince Jeongan out.

541
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,871
My gosh.

542
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,499
-Tae-ryeong.
-Yes, Your Highness.

543
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,209
Don't laugh at me.

544
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,587
I'll do this for sure this time.

545
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:54,926
Watch carefully.

546
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,641
Gosh, it just flew away.

547
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,520
Hey, Brother.

548
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,066
You're here, Bang-gan.

549
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,028
Why did you shoot an arrow to the ground?

550
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:16,239
The target wouldn't budge,

551
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,033
so it's not that fun.

552
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:22,245
Why don't you go jump around?

553
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:27,000
I'll make sure to hit you
right on the head.

554
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,804
What about your topknot?

555
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,809
I just want to see you...

556
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,773
with messy hair.

557
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,694
Bang-gan.

558
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,198
I guess you are going
to use that written promise today.

559
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:05,664
Why are you always thinking
about going after me?

560
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:11,169
Don't you even care
about how Mother feels up above?

561
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,349
Bang-gan.

562
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,228
The anniversary of her death is coming.

563
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:33,191
I'm planning to go hunting
for food for the memorial service.

564
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,829
I'm doing it.

565
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,539
No.

566
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,876
You're busy with a lot of things.

567
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,753
Let me take care of it this year.

568
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,384
It's like you've suddenly become
a devoted son or something.

569
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,470
Speaking of which,

570
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,143
I'm thinking of bringing
my soldiers with me for hunting.

571
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,146
Oh.

572
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,275
I knew you'd give me that look.

573
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,528
That's why I'm asking for your permission.

574
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,240
Is it only for hunting?

575
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,659
If it's hard to believe,

576
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,078
you can spy on me.

577
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,762
Gosh.

578
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:49,100
Hey, get me another target.

579
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,832
Move the arms to the hunting field.

580
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:34,854
Who are you?

581
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,800
Your Highness. Your Highness!

582
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:07,595
-What?
-The armory is robbed.

583
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,141
And the soldiers...

584
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,562
They were from Jurchen.

585
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:18,148
And the leader wanted to meet you.

586
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,493
Me?

587
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:41,129
I'm here to meet your leader.

588
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,850
That was pretty good.

589
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,492
Look who's here.

590
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,662
Aren't you Inspector Nam?

591
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,873
Did you get a new family register?
Are you Jurchen now?

592
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,708
Do you remember?

593
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,503
I said I'd kill those who bring me out.

594
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,423
It's Bang-won who brought me out.

595
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,928
So I'm going to kill him.

596
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,639
Is that why you took my arms and soldiers?

597
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:15,765
Only then

598
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:19,394
you will belong under me.

599
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:33,741
Stop trying to be treated
as Prince from now on.

600
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,954
I will be your only way to survive.

601
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,540
Just shut up and follow me.

602
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:43,668
What if I refuse?

603
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,044
You can't refuse.

604
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,923
If you do, you'll be killed

605
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,342
by either Bang-won or me.

606
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,179
If I accept, Bang-won will die
and I will survive?

607
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,306
Yes.

608
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:01,436
Good. I like the plan.

609
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,231
But you know what? You underestimate me.

610
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,872
Once Bang-won dies,

611
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,042
I'll be the King.

612
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,463
Will I still belong under you?

613
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:29,839
I don't care...

614
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,595
who becomes the King.

615
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:40,683
I'll bring Bang-won to his knees
and laugh at him.

616
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,354
Just like what he did to me.

617
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,691
And then, I'll kill him.

618
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,156
Good.

619
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,625
All right then.

620
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,213
So what's up your sleeve?

621
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:12,799
Let me tell you
what Bang-won is up to first.

622
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,052
He's waiting for you to attack him
pretending to be off guard.

623
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,931
He'll let you rise up in rebellion

624
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:25,019
and strike at you and your father.

625
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:50,670
Pretend to fall for his plan
and go to Mount Janam where they ambush.

626
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,383
I'll wait there after defeating
the ambush troop.

627
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:00,972
I knew it.

628
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:02,432
Before that,

629
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,560
I need to meet with His Majesty.

630
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:26,497
I'd like to see them up close.

631
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,626
Go pick a lotus for me.

632
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:53,733
They say a lotus in the mud.

633
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:59,030
A lotus stays clean even in the mud

634
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,867
because it doesn't lose its dignity.

635
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:07,038
A lotus can stay dignified
only with the sacrifice of Buddha.

636
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:08,748
Are you telling me

637
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,751
to put myself in mud?

638
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:15,046
Please hold onto the Royal Seal
and stall some time.

639
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,757
Once Prince Jeongan comes to the throne,

640
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:19,801
the whole thing will go down the drain.

641
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,471
I don't mean to make
Prince Hoean the King.

642
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,264
I know.

643
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,309
Although Prince Hoean fails,

644
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,853
you will succeed, Your Majesty.

645
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,022
Prince Jeongan...

646
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,777
will be killed by me.

647
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:42,281
Take down the current King
and take your throne back.

648
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,492
It's to kill tomorrow's tyrant,

649
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,328
not today's blood.

650
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,873
You must do that.

651
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,877
And I must succeed.

652
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,846
A tyrant

653
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,224
must die.

654
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,614
You're wrong, Your Majesty.

655
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,285
Everyone in this nation

656
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,288
will forget you existed.

657
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,583
Once off his throne,

658
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,921
a King becomes a mere old man.

659
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,051
Come on in.

660
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,639
Yes, Your Majesty.

661
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:51,642
I'm leaving the palace. Get prepared.

662
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,478
Where are you headed?

663
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:57,398
Buying time isn't enough.

664
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,069
I will collect my scattered soldiers.

665
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:05,948
Prince Hoean is...

666
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,037
just a bait.

667
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,635
Bang-gan...

668
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,722
got involved with the Jurchen?

669
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,393
We should change our ambush site
just to be on the safe side.

670
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,939
Majeong-dong is on the way.

671
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,610
That place should be
a perfect replacement.

672
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,111
Majeong, it is.

673
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:45,947
What about you, Madame Han?

674
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,659
I will just sit back and watch.

675
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,338
Make sure...

676
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,550
to keep your word you said.

677
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,885
Just sit back and watch.

678
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,431
I don't want to see you
collapse ever again.

679
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:17,103
Give me a chance. This time, I'll do it.

680
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:19,230
I'll protect you.

681
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:21,732
I'm the mistress of Ihwaru.

682
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,152
I only do things for Ihwaru's sake.

683
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,115
So...

684
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:32,618
don't worry.

685
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:51,679
I found the Jurchen's base.

686
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,222
-Where is it?
-The prostitution house.

687
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,057
They got back three days ago.

688
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,270
Does this ring any bell?

689
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:38,476
They must have figured out.

690
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:02,041
NAM SEON-HO

691
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:40,621
Hey!

692
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,140
But he was supposed to be dead. How...

693
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:02,393
What is it?

694
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,437
Nothing.

695
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,522
Have you found any of their traces?

696
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:08,858
No.

697
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,051
Seo Hwi came to the prostitution house.

698
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:37,011
And?

699
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:38,763
Again, Bang-won's spearhead is

700
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:41,766
Seo Hwi.

701
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,730
You said you would decide
whether he should live or die.

702
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:50,274
What will you do this time?

703
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:22,681
He went to the prostitution house
this afternoon?

704
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:24,850
Yes, Your Highness.

705
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:28,270
Find out what happened.

706
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,823
Today,

707
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,243
we are hunting.

708
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:46,622
Kill all the winged animals you see.

709
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,879
I will catch the tiger.

710
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:59,593
Then I'll join you in Majeong-dong.

711
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:02,513
You seem to

712
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,099
have a lot in your mind.

713
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,658
I'm prepared to kill my own family.
That's how determined I am.

714
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:24,869
How far can you go?

715
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,790
I'm going to go to the end.

716
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,172
I will see you there.

717
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,232
In my country,

718
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,361
Bang-won doesn't exist.

719
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:46,617
And...

720
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,212
you don't either.
