00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,433
THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

2
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,977
SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARACTERS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,647
In my country,

4
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,817
Bang-won doesn't exist.

5
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,656
And...

6
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,748
you don't either.

7
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,432
You saved me,

8
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,853
and Bang-won chose not to kill me.

9
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,899
I'm sorry, but I'm not grateful
for what either of you did.

10
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,451
I'm returning the favor.

11
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,872
Seon-ho.

12
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,589
You see,

13
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,886
I thought I could use the King's power

14
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,683
to change the world.

15
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,272
But I was wrong.

16
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,609
To them,

17
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,740
I was just a sword they could use

18
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,244
and dispose of whenever they wish.

19
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,373
I may not be able to change

20
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,042
their world,

21
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,129
but I can destroy it.

22
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,388
I'm going to kill Bang-won.

23
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,641
Bang-gan too.

24
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,269
The King

25
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,396
and the former King as well.

26
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,941
You'd better stop intervening.

27
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,486
This is the last thing I can do for you,

28
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,407
and it's also the last warning.

29
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,514
But I will

30
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,975
save you.

31
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,071
Everything is ready.

32
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,199
Tae-ryeong.

33
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,285
I am about to go hunting,

34
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,829
but why is it that I feel so anxious?

35
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,998
Prince Hoean

36
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,876
will relentlessly try
to kill Your Highness.

37
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,880
It is a fight that you cannot avoid.

38
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,133
It cannot be avoided?

39
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,761
I suppose I am doing this

40
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,638
because it can't be avoided.

41
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,733
Hwi is late.

42
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,152
He'll come.

43
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,612
I know he will.

44
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,658
By the way, why did the prince
change the ambush location?

45
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,743
Did Bang-gan figure it out?

46
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,371
There must've been
some unexpected changes.

47
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,081
Chi-do.

48
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,293
You see, I really can't forgive that man.

49
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,461
I'm talking about Yi Seong-gye.

50
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,005
He's taking it all out on us

51
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,549
because he can't kill his son.

52
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,677
He destroyed Ihwaru and whacked
the private soldiers. He went apeshit.

53
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,597
From our Liaodong days to until now,
nothing has changed.

54
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,850
Actually,

55
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,935
things will never change.

56
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,486
The ambush location has been changed
to Majeong-dong.

57
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,241
We'll change our plan as well.

58
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,370
We'll wipe Bang-won's soldiers
lying in ambush

59
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,957
and strike at Bang-won immediately.

60
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,922
You have my permission

61
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,217
to kill them all.

62
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,738
What's happening?

63
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,977
What are you doing? Snap out of it!

64
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,195
Mun-bok!

65
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,240
God damn it.

66
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,575
The well-sharpened sword
pierced through my chest armor.

67
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,702
-Mun-bok.
-You've got to run.

68
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,955
-Don't say anything.
-Are you deaf?

69
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,289
I said, you've got to run.

70
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,707
Shut it!

71
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,475
Chase them!

72
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,103
Don't let any of them escape alive.

73
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,237
You're here.

74
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,489
I have to say, you're bringing

75
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,867
a lot of soldiers
for a mere pheasant hunt.

76
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,327
You should know better
as you've been hunting for years.

77
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,788
You may catch a tiger

78
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,832
even when you go on a pheasant hunt.

79
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,167
Who knows?

80
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,502
We might catch a white tiger.

81
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,800
To catch a tiger, you need to corner it,

82
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,635
distract it with dogs,

83
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,471
immobilize it with an arrow,

84
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,098
and pierce through its neck with a spear.

85
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,976
But I don't see any spears.

86
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,770
Well, you're wrong.

87
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,981
To catch a tiger, you first need

88
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,233
to feed it some dogs and even humans.

89
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,445
You need to fill it up
before you catch it.

90
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,533
You never disappoint me, Bang-gan.

91
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,496
Let's get going. Let's go!

92
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,503
Hang in there.

93
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,100
Mun-bok, stay with me!

94
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,521
Gosh, I would've worn five chest armors
had I known this would happen.

95
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,730
Goodness.

96
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,274
You're bleeding a lot.

97
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,652
This helps stop bleeding.
Put some on right away.

98
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,946
No, I'm okay. My stab wound isn't deep.

99
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,073
Bullshit. You're not okay.

100
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,991
-Come on. Put some on now.
-Mun-bok!

101
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,535
I can't die,

102
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,161
so don't worry about me.

103
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,830
I can't die
because of my adorable children

104
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,332
and beautiful wife.

105
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,919
Chi-do, why can't I stop crying?

106
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,802
Seon-ho went to where the prince is.

107
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,388
I'll go bring the royal guards
who are on standby.

108
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,723
Take good care of Mun-bok.

109
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,561
Hwi.

110
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,187
Who are you trying to save?

111
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,648
Bang-won or Seon-ho?

112
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,277
I'll save both of them.

113
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:36,284
I'm suddenly reminded of what
our swordsmanship teacher, Seo Geom, said.

114
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,453
"Utilize an ambush
for the most efficient battle.

115
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,122
A raid comes in second.

116
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,125
The last resort would be
an all-out battle."

117
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,127
I'm surprised you still remember that.

118
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,422
I admired him very much, you know.

119
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,799
I'm just realizing
that I haven't seen Hwi.

120
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,219
He uses the exact same sword techniques.

121
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,974
He is Seo Geom's son, isn't he?

122
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,646
Aren't they the Jurchens?

123
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,940
Shouldn't they be
in the Northeastern Township?

124
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,444
What are they doing in Gaegyeong?

125
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,364
Don't you think it's strange?

126
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,495
They can go anywhere they wish
with their two legs.

127
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,122
What's strange about it?

128
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,587
That man.

129
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,422
Isn't he one of your soldiers?

130
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,760
Bang-won.

131
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,598
Goodbye.

132
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,607
Don't you dare step in!

133
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,367
Drop your sword.

134
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,122
You left me with no choice
but to unsheathe my sword.

135
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,792
If you ascend the throne,

136
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,627
will our elder brothers be safe?

137
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,381
They will be.

138
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,640
Who'd believe that?

139
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,975
Then let me ask you.

140
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,812
If you ascend the throne,

141
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,980
will I be safe?

142
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,693
Answer the question even if you must lie.

143
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,364
If I become King,

144
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:44,703
your neck will be on the chopping block
before anyone else's.

145
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,354
Then,

146
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,440
bring it on.

147
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,862
You want a sword fight with me?

148
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,115
You could barely pick up a wooden sword

149
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,367
when I was already fighting
with my real sword.

150
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,661
You never got to see what I've learned

151
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,956
since picking up my first real sword.

152
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,044
Let's see it, then.

153
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,818
You're trying to buy time, aren't you?

154
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,131
But you know what?

155
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,093
I think your time's up.

156
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,848
Kill

157
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,559
all of them.

158
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,838
Inspector Nam, that bastard.

159
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,355
You're alive. I'm impressed.

160
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,399
I owe it all to you.

161
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,569
I had no reason left to live,

162
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,779
but you gave me a reason to survive.

163
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,199
Do you know why I spared your life?

164
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,704
To mock and trample all over
the child of a lowly concubine.

165
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:33,956
Am I wrong?

166
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,167
No, because you're like me.

167
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,128
Also,

168
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,630
because you're Hwi's friend.

169
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,010
Now, here's what you get
for sparing my life.

170
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,947
Do you know what our difference is?

171
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,490
Stop with the bullshit.

172
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,910
You only look at me,

173
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,079
while I look at the entire picture
including you.

174
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,125
That is why you can't beat me.

175
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,102
Chase those traitors!

176
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,814
I'll catch them.

177
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,361
Come at me.

178
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,865
Save Seon-ho first.

179
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,618
There's a cave at the bottom of the cliff
in Mount Bukak.

180
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,869
Take him there.

181
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,079
How could I trust you?

182
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,915
I've been friends with him for longer
than you have. Trust me.

183
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,599
This man here is a criminal
who orchestrated a coup.

184
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,269
Double-tie him to a horse

185
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,605
and make him walk barefoot.

186
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,861
If anyone spits on him, let them.

187
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,780
And if anyone tries to help him,

188
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,117
kill them on the spot.

189
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,910
One more thing.

190
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,957
You should hold my hand and wail
on the streets.

191
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:49,962
That way, the people will be moved
by your tears.

192
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,068
Your wound is deep.

193
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,089
How did it go?

194
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,133
I lost him.

195
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,808
Are you sure you didn't let him flee?

196
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,353
Seon-ho will return to me.

197
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,356
And when he does,
I will slay him without any hesitation.

198
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,401
What will you do?

199
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,489
I will protect my friend.

200
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,202
So you will try to stop me?

201
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,914
Then I will

202
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,834
slay you as well.

203
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,517
It feels like it was only yesterday that
we were in the northern region together,

204
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,812
but only my hair has turned gray.

205
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,859
I miss Seo Geom.

206
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,571
When I picked up my bow,

207
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,199
he unsheathed his sword

208
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,326
and protected me.

209
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,787
He killed the enemy commander

210
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,956
and slashed horses when I told him to.

211
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,666
I will probably

212
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,794
never meet a general like him again.

213
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,839
He embezzled military rations?

214
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,175
I do not believe that.

215
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,302
But King Woo did,

216
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,722
so there was nothing I could do
to save him.

217
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,641
It was Nam Jeon's doing.

218
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,520
Nevertheless,
you took him under your wing.

219
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,690
It wasn't Nam Jeon.

220
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:20,737
And that is why I came to see you all
in person.

221
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,240
I would like to

222
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,744
avenge Seo Geom's death now.

223
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,426
Are you headed to Anju?

224
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,219
Such impudence!

225
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,059
You may raise your head.

226
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,190
You are Queen Sindeok's confidante.

227
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,985
I am Han Hui-jae.

228
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,945
Hui-jae...

229
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,658
Where do you think I'll be headed
after Anju?

230
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,995
Maengju. After that, Deokju.

231
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,706
Anbyon, Yeongheung, Hamju.

232
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,292
Shall I keep going?

233
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,795
Give us some privacy.

234
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,600
Why do you think I am headed there?

235
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,227
You are going there
because there are warriors

236
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,104
who aren't under
Prince Jeongan's influence.

237
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,982
You plan to gather
the warriors in the North

238
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,359
in order to take down Prince Jeongan.

239
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,529
Prince Jeongan must have sent you.

240
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,367
I am here as the head of Ihwaru.

241
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,082
I'd like to offer you a word of advice.

242
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,125
As you probably expected,

243
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,544
Prince Hoean's coup failed.

244
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,255
Do not take advantage
of this turbulent time

245
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,217
just to raise the armed forces
in the North.

246
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,510
What will happen

247
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,553
if I do?

248
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,680
You will not obtain the title
of Grand Abdicated King.

249
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,725
Instead, you will be dethroned
as a mere former King.

250
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,687
For the first and last time
in this dynasty.

251
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:26,029
Now, I see why the Queen chose you
as her confidante.

252
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,489
At the same time,

253
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,408
I can also see why
she decided to desert you.

254
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,829
Get out of my sight before I drag you out.

255
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,372
Return to the palace at once

256
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,082
and protect the throne.

257
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:42,963
That is the best thing
Your Majesty can do at the moment.

258
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,204
Just be the quack that you are.

259
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,040
Why get involved in a sword fight?

260
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,126
You're a coward,

261
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,545
and you can't even tolerate pain well.

262
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,632
They messed with Ihwaru.
How was I supposed to just let it slide?

263
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,510
This is like your home, you know.

264
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,345
Thank you.

265
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,640
Gosh, don't cry.

266
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,935
My dear, I want to make you smile
all the time,

267
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,687
but you look pretty even when you cry.

268
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,356
Perhaps I should make you cry
once in a while.

269
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,443
Stop joking around.

270
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,738
Come on. I joke around all the time.

271
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,865
I'd call myself Park Chi-do
if I never told any jokes.

272
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,659
It seems like you're okay now.

273
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,369
By the way, Chi-do,

274
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,164
I think Hwi and Seon-ho

275
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,417
were the sun and the moon
in their past lives.

276
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,545
I bet that's why
they seem so inseparable in this lifetime.

277
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,131
Then what about you and me?

278
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,260
-We were probably a married couple.
-Right?

279
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,096
That's why we met again as enemies.

280
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,349
You must be in pain. I am too.

281
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,517
-What's with you? Hey.
-Mun-bok.

282
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,937
Hwi is here.

283
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,147
Are you guys all right?

284
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,357
Don't even get me started.

285
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,109
I barely managed
to escape the Grim Reaper.

286
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,028
What about you?

287
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:30,946
I'm all right.

288
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,155
Good.

289
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,492
What about Hui-jae? Did she go somewhere?

290
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,131
Are you okay?

291
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,686
I had to stop His Majesty.

292
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,689
If we sit back and do nothing,

293
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,774
we'll be hit by something
even worse than a coup.

294
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,902
That's why I went to see him.

295
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,197
I'm sorry.

296
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,536
Even if I tell you to just watch
and do nothing

297
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,290
and that I will protect you,

298
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,793
you have no choice but to do these things.
I know that.

299
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,213
But promise me this one thing.

300
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,841
Whatever you do,

301
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,927
make sure you always tell me.

302
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,138
Only then

303
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,308
can I come to your rescue
when you're in danger.

304
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,646
I will.

305
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,707
You must be exhausted.

306
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,135
Hang in there just a little longer

307
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,597
because it'll all be over soon.

308
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,219
Stay still,

309
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,638
or your wound will open back up.

310
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,099
I can't believe the one who stabbed me
is saying that.

311
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,644
What about the venom?

312
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,773
Is there still some left?

313
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,108
It's stuck with me for good.

314
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,361
I'm just going to live with it.

315
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,077
Will you continue

316
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,789
to fight?

317
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,751
Ask my sword.

318
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,775
NAM SEON-HO

319
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,610
Thanks

320
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,946
for protecting me.

321
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,006
And I'm sorry.

322
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,597
I was so absorbed in my own anger

323
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,935
that I couldn't see your pain.

324
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,985
How's Bang-gan?

325
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,154
His Majesty has examined him himself,

326
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,989
and Bang-gan is now in prison.

327
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,283
What about the former King?

328
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,285
He returned to the palace
from the hot spring.

329
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,915
He will have to choose
either the Royal Seal or Bang-gan.

330
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:03,504
It's going to be
a pretty long night for him tonight.

331
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,176
What should we do with Cheonga?

332
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,013
He's a double agent.

333
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,182
Keep him in prison.

334
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,060
He will be of use one day.

335
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,039
NAM SEON-HO

336
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,679
If Seon-ho goes to Bang-won,
he will be dead.

337
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,431
Stop him.

338
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,560
The most insignificant thing Seon-ho has

339
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,024
is his life.

340
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,651
I can't stop him.

341
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,738
Can you stop him?

342
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,366
I will.

343
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,910
I must.

344
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,296
The deputy leader is alive.

345
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,923
Didn't he burn to death?

346
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,760
I thought so too. Until I saw him.

347
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,472
He framed General Seo Geom
for embezzlement of provisions

348
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,515
and even testified falsely.

349
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,604
Search through prostitution houses
near Gaegyeong and places nearby.

350
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,939
He's addicted,
so he should be near those places.

351
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,357
What do we do when we catch him?

352
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,194
There must be a wire puller.

353
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,237
We will find that person.

354
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,531
And...

355
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,702
kill that person.

356
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,479
If it isn't my little brother.

357
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:10,733
You're a felon who raised a rebellion.

358
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,570
Please excuse me
for dropping honorifics from now on.

359
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,573
You're disgracing me.

360
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,334
You have only one way

361
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,129
to survive.

362
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,172
So

363
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,342
think carefully before you answer.

364
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,847
Who is pulling the wire?

365
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,559
I just got into a tussle while hunting.

366
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,018
I raised a rebellion?

367
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,023
And someone is behind me?

368
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,484
I asked who it is.

369
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,202
This is my last question.

370
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,419
Whose order

371
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:16,132
did you have to carry out?

372
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,606
The former King.

373
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,113
The father of you and me.

374
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,583
Officer of Inspector General,
did you write that down?

375
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,668
Yes, Your Highness.

376
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,087
You just

377
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,217
saved your life.

378
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,163
What brings you here?

379
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,667
I need to see the former King.

380
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,257
You requested an audience.

381
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:44,387
I heard you made a great contribution
to the country again.

382
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,099
Your path is severed here.

383
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:52,645
I dare came to tell you that.

384
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,355
Listen.

385
00:37:55,856 --> 00:38:00,152
Whether to connect or severe the path
is up to me.

386
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:04,448
And you're a mere man walking on the path.

387
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,701
That will not happen.

388
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,413
In order to protect my precious people,
I can severe the path

389
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,623
as many times as needed.

390
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,168
You're indeed the son of Seo Geom.

391
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,004
Isn't blood amazing?

392
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,715
You're just like your father.

393
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,885
Don't you think so, Jeongan?

394
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,517
As far as I know, my father took
a different path from yours.

395
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,771
Why are you bringing up my father's name?

396
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,940
Do you also know

397
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,404
that your father was
Prince Jeongan's sword teacher?

398
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,000
I was behind the rebellion?

399
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,795
That's what Prince Hoean said.

400
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:06,719
The former King
raised a rebellion with a prince.

401
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:12,641
Should we let the historian write that
and hand the word down to our descendants?

402
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,480
What is it that you want?

403
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,899
Be the Grand Abdicated King.

404
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,320
Then all this

405
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,823
will be wrapped up here.

406
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,710
The current King recommended you

407
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:44,882
as the first Crown Prince,
not the second Crown Prince.

408
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,760
So I may grant you permission.

409
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,429
Thank you,

410
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,433
Your Majesty.

411
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:59,188
I will grant you a pardon

412
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,566
and wish for your success.

413
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,484
Therefore,

414
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:08,155
I will clear Seo Geom of the charges.

415
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,160
A general respected
by the royal family and people

416
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,287
took his own life
because of a false charge.

417
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,877
How disturbing is that?

418
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,936
Your friend, your mentor,

419
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,771
and the man you considered
as another father.

420
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,065
Was it my father?

421
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,568
Yes.

422
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,404
Why did you never tell me?

423
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,410
Could it be

424
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,706
because of the circumstances
surrounding his death?

425
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,543
You should rest.

426
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,336
We'll talk some other time.

427
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,194
Yeon,

428
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,115
I'm going to leave.

429
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,789
Don't you worry though.

430
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,293
I'll be somewhere

431
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,796
reachable by this river.

432
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,133
Hwi...

433
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,555
He can only live if I die.

434
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,655
I must find out the truth
regarding my father's death.

435
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,699
There's more to it.

436
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,201
The fact that the former King
is making his move

437
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,745
means that he's luring you
into the battle.

438
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,247
I'm aware of that.

439
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,874
The case files of Goryeo were mostly lost.

440
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,459
You'll have to be very lucky.

441
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,878
You stay out of it. This is my fight now.

442
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,589
Find one with a red cover.

443
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,674
Punishment by cauldron dipping
is written in those.

444
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,428
I don't want you to get involved in this

445
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,972
nor get put in danger.

446
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,266
This isn't for you.

447
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,310
It's for Yeon.

448
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,571
So shut up and just find the book.

449
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,329
We have two hours until sunrise, so hurry.

450
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,419
Thank you.

451
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,767
Up until this moment,

452
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,313
I thought it was my father
who framed yours.

453
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,196
Your father

454
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,990
never lied.

455
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,492
Sounds about right

456
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:24,995
since there were even times
when I wished he was lying.

457
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,419
Your wound...

458
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,755
How is it?

459
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,678
Have you heard of numbing medicine?

460
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,932
Well, you could strike me
and I'd only feel a tickle.

461
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,316
You should rest.

462
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,151
You could die if you keep going.

463
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,903
Did you know

464
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,239
that whenever I'm in pain,

465
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,741
you're always beside me?

466
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,487
"Witness,

467
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,700
Black Snake Unit of
the Northern Region Exhibition.

468
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,202
Deputy Leader Kim Do-su."

469
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,518
NAM SEON-HO

470
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,526
I'm sure you're aware

471
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,612
that the interrogation
of the Black Snake Unit

472
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,280
will make you wish you'd rather be dead.

473
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,865
We will now begin.

474
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,409
Please don't...

475
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,747
There is no scenario where you live.

476
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,374
It's better to beg for a painless death.

477
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,466
Who is giving you the orders?

478
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,427
I don't know.

479
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,725
Who is it?

480
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,269
Who told you to frame the general?

481
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,275
Prince Jeongan!

482
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,530
It was Yi Bang-won.

483
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,500
Is it true?

484
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,379
Was it really Bang-won?

485
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,476
I will clear Seo Geom of the charges.

486
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,395
In addition to that,

487
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,648
I will find who framed him

488
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,651
and punish him by dipping in a cauldron.

489
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,906
Half of the warriors in the Northeastern
and Northwestern Townships

490
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,700
were under Seo Geom's command.

491
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,120
What will happen
when they find out the truth?

492
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,873
That's enough!

493
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,751
You have committed so many crimes.

494
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,463
You taking the throne

495
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,174
indicates you will have committed another.

496
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,137
So how can I stand by
and let it happen again?

497
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:18,562
I know you very well, Your Majesty.

498
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,814
You are not one

499
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,359
to ever lay out your cards.

500
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,861
So

501
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,157
why is it that you did this time?

502
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,327
Doubt.

503
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,662
Doubt and doubt again.

504
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,623
And kill those around you.

505
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,420
Those deaths...

506
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,342
will one day haunt you to your demise.

507
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,721
Whatever it is that you want

508
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,808
will never come true in this lifetime.

509
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,981
Even though

510
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,401
your curse lays upon me,

511
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,070
I will

512
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,531
become King.

513
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,627
He not only killed Hwi's father

514
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:28,131
but also used Hwi and had Hwi
take the fall for the blood he spilled.

515
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,428
Hwi must not know this.

516
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,430
Once he does, he'll go to Bang-won.

517
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,809
And Bang-won buries secrets
by wielding his sword.

518
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,521
Hwi will never know.

519
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,691
I'll end it before he learns the truth.

520
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,069
Don't.

521
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,612
What he wants

522
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,865
is for you to live, not revenge.

523
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:57,327
It's how he's always been.

524
00:49:58,704 --> 00:49:59,705
Please

525
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,874
look out for him.

526
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,682
Sir, let's leave.

527
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,644
And then what? Where would I go?

528
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,898
I have a boat and a place for you to stay.
Come on!

529
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,942
And then what?

530
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,571
Where would I go from there?

531
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,617
You will die.

532
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,870
Unless you escape right now, you'll die.

533
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,371
Chi-do.

534
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,209
If I run,

535
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,753
my children

536
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,715
will have to live as fugitives forever.

537
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,926
And if you don't,

538
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,512
they'll live in sorrow forever.

539
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,973
They will have you.

540
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,938
Hwi and Yeon. I leave them in your hands.

541
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,316
My children...

542
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,778
are my everything.

543
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,490
Please.

544
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,786
Please come with me!

545
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,749
Sir...

546
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,936
The Black Snake Unit never lives in debt.

547
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,772
Bang-won must die.

548
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,732
Silence.

549
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:33,733
But sir...

550
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,987
Do not make a move until I give orders.

551
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,614
If we move hastily,

552
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,659
Hwi and the Northern Village

553
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,995
will be in danger.

554
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,051
You're indeed the son of Seo Geom.

555
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,762
Do you also know

556
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:06,558
that your father was
Prince Jeongan's sword teacher?

557
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:38,548
I see you came to see me in disguise.

558
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,761
Do not use me or my father anymore

559
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:47,557
and please do not try to play
Prince Jeongan and I against each other.

560
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,437
In order to do so,
I'll have to be telling you lies.

561
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,731
However,

562
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,903
all I said was the truth.

563
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,198
Who is responsible

564
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,743
for my father's death?

565
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,377
It's Prince Jeongan.

566
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,864
Your father

567
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,160
is in contact
with the warriors Seo Geom commanded.

568
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,542
Master Seo,

569
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,336
Goryeo...

570
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,464
is no longer a nation.

571
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:07,095
It is a living hell where
a foolish King and those evil

572
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,390
feed on the blood of the people.

573
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:17,063
So I urge you to change your mind.

574
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:22,485
Dismantle this godforsaken nation
and build a new world.

575
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,197
That is the only way...

576
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,702
for you to live.

577
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,122
Goryeo may be godforsaken to you,

578
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,376
but it is the nation I serve.

579
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:44,716
It is my country
that I and my men protected

580
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,552
with our blood.

581
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,804
How is this a nation?

582
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,849
Are you truly blind?

583
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,811
Can't you see

584
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,939
that Goryeo is rotten inside and out?

585
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,777
And what about you
who framed me for embezzlement?

586
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:08,281
What about your father
who's using his own son

587
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,451
to kill me?

588
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:14,829
In my eyes,

589
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,959
you are the ones rotten to the core.

590
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,338
So listen.

591
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:28,009
I will die tonight.

592
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,512
And you

593
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:35,517
will engrave my blood on your flesh
like a tattoo

594
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:40,271
and live in pain
for the rest of your life.

595
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:44,400
Those who will forever live in pain

596
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,281
are your children
who will be treated less than animals.

597
00:56:57,413 --> 00:57:00,250
What code can you say you lived by

598
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,919
when you

599
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,256
even failed to protect your own children?

600
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:20,061
Keep your eyes on Hwi.

601
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,356
I will check on

602
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,109
the Consolidated Army Command.

603
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,005
Get lost.

604
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:48,798
This is my business.

605
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,717
And this is my choice.

606
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,553
Being beside you

607
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,224
wasn't all that bad.

608
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,272
I figured it'd be

609
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,150
my only chance to say it.

610
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,740
Bang-won will order Hwi to be killed.

611
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,409
I must not let that happen

612
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,579
and this is the only way.

613
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,627
I want to be able to look her in the eyes.

614
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,702
Nam Seon-ho is here.

615
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,172
Bang-won!

616
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,057
Bang-won!

617
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,425
Kill him.

618
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,134
Enough!

619
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,696
Bang-won.

620
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,825
I'm right here, you know.

621
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:57,732
Why is it you though...

622
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,610
and not Hwi?

623
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,821
I wanted people to laugh at you

624
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,658
for dying at the sword
of a concubine's son.

625
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,369
It's...

626
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:14,415
what I truly wanted to see.

627
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,876
You made this far by yourself.

628
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,211
I'll already

629
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,713
be laughed at.

630
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:22,673
It's why

631
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,760
you will be punished.

632
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:29,138
And who will punish you for your sins?

633
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,725
You beat a loyal servant to death

634
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,937
and boiled a general alive in a cauldron.

635
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,565
You even killed our own brothers.

636
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,278
Hwi fought for you with his live

637
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,698
just so that you could have your nation.

638
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,870
But who will punish you
for trying to kill him too?

639
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:56,916
I...

640
01:03:58,793 --> 01:03:59,961
I...

641
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,882
will not kill Hwi.

642
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:06,717
You,

643
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,929
who never trusts anyone

644
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:14,058
and doubts everything?

645
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,402
Even a dog would laugh at that statement.

646
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:26,654
Actually,

647
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,077
it wouldn't even
bring out a laugh in a dog.

648
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:36,038
It is easy to die while taunting others.

649
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,957
However,

650
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,711
living by your code

651
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,796
while enduring the taunting

652
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,508
is as painful as
having your flesh peeled off.

653
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,970
But I will gladly

654
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:55,766
endure all the taunting
that comes my way...

655
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,230
and own up to it.

656
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:17,997
Slay me.

657
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,834
I've had enough

658
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:25,546
of your hypocrisy.

659
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,602
You

660
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,105
may now rest.

661
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,968
Let him in.

662
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:18,474
Damn it.

663
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,565
You're here to stop me?

664
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,112
Didn't I say...

665
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,283
that I'd kill you too if you tried?

666
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:41,247
Go ahead then.

667
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,000
Kill me like you killed my father.

668
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:54,593
How you framed my father

669
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:56,887
and how you used me...

670
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:59,098
I will forget all of that.

671
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:03,102
However, the fact that you saved my life

672
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:04,937
and the comfort you offered...

673
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,482
I will forget all of that too.

674
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:14,405
So please let him go.

675
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,908
He is my dearest friend.

676
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,289
Please let me save him.

677
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,751
Don't and consider yourself dead too.

678
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:31,130
You'll shoot me?

679
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,592
You'll kill me?

680
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,178
This

681
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,222
is where our alliance ends.

682
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:07,083
Go.

683
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,421
Consider it a reward
for your contribution.

684
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:15,591
Run away...

685
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,011
as far as you can.

686
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:46,247
Why are you making it so hard to die?

687
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:48,415
I will keep you alive with all my might.

688
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:49,959
In fact,

689
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,502
we will both stay alive.

690
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,164
