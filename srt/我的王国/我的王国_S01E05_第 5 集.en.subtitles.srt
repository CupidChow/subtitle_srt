SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARACTERS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,190
EPISODE 5

4
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,791
-Whoa, slow down.
-His Highness Prince Jeongan is entering!

5
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,846
HWAPYEONGJEON

6
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,309
1ST YEAR OF TAEJO'S REIGN
YEAR OF 1392

7
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,569
As I have informed Your Highness,

8
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,155
His Majesty is feeling distressed
at the moment.

9
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,491
Please visit again another time.

10
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,744
Since he is feeling distressed, I'd like
to pay my respects and comfort him.

11
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,412
Ask him again.

12
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,207
-However--
-Ask him.

13
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,209
One more time.

14
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,711
"Master Confucius said,

15
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,714
'A young man should be filial at home

16
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,509
and respectful toward
his elders in public.

17
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,678
He must be cautious of
his words and actions,

18
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,848
love everyone, befriend the good-hearted,
and act on this advice.'

19
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,432
Zixia said,

20
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,810
'If a man who is charmed by the wise,

21
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,854
does his best to filial duty,

22
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,189
serves the King with all his heart,

23
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,441
and always keeps his promises,
says that...'"

24
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,570
The senior eunuch is waiting anxiously.

25
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,738
It has been over four hours, Your Majesty.

26
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,700
Since people are watching,
it'd be better to just let him in.

27
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,702
I want everyone to see it.

28
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,038
Only then will the people
become aware of my intentions.

29
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,919
HWAPYEONGJEON

30
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,766
Prince Jeongan, Bang-won,

31
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,978
is here for an audience with you,
Your Majesty.

32
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,479
Your Highness.

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,150
I am aware that I should pay my respects
in person inside your chamber.

34
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,277
However, I cannot do that

35
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,447
since Prince Uian's audience with you
is taking longer than expected.

36
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,616
I hope you understand, Your Majesty.

37
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,952
I heard you are distressed.

38
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,746
I am concerned

39
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,497
that it might affect your health.

40
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,833
I am truly concerned.

41
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,175
Your Majesty.

42
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,971
Your filial love for me
is admirable and beautiful.

43
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,599
I understand how concerned you are,
so you may leave now.

44
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,101
You banned everyone from talking about
choosing a crown prince.

45
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,604
That is not a topic we can discuss
with shoes on.

46
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,315
I've no choice as you're not
allowing me the chance to remove mine.

47
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,945
You stand up when I tell you to kneel

48
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,489
and assemble your soldiers
when I tell you to disband your army.

49
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,952
So why don't you break down the doors
and enter with your shoes on?

50
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,371
Do it.

51
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,387
The throne can only be passed down
to your legitimate sons.

52
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,223
Prince Uian is the youngest
of your eight sons,

53
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,891
and he was born out of wedlock.

54
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,227
Why consider crowning him?

55
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,687
How dare you.

56
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,565
You had the nerve to peep into my mind?

57
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:39,821
I heard the Queen is begging you in tears
to select Prince Uian as Crown Prince.

58
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,157
You even heard about
what the Queen is thinking?

59
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,952
How could you let a woman interfere
when you are laying

60
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,871
the foundation for a kingdom
that will last thousands of years?

61
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,123
Jeongan!

62
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,919
A dog that barks grows gaunt,

63
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,171
whereas a dog that eats grows stout.

64
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,508
I am now noticing
that you look quite gaunt.

65
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,996
Prince Jeongan

66
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,416
must have scared you.

67
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,543
What about you?

68
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,464
The one who is afraid of Prince Jeongan

69
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,924
is you, not Prince Uian.

70
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,474
I defeated 10,000 soldiers all by myself.

71
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,309
Why would I be afraid of my own child?

72
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,436
You may be able to kill 10,000 enemies

73
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,813
but not your own child.

74
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,733
The deeper your frown lines grow,

75
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,526
the weaker your courage will be.

76
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,737
That is

77
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,948
what I see in you now, Your Majesty.

78
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,301
Did I run into you by chance?

79
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,345
Or are you intentionally blocking my way?

80
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,806
I was waiting for you, Your Highness.

81
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,478
Identify yourself.

82
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,814
I am Nam Seon-ho
from the Office of the Inspector General.

83
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,649
-And?
-I must speak to you about two things.

84
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,317
One is more important than the other.

85
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,361
Start with the one
that is not as important.

86
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,780
Please wear your uniform
when you visit the palace.

87
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,699
Even princes can be impeached
for deriding such customs and rules.

88
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,831
I heard there is a sword
in the Office of the Inspector General,

89
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,415
which used to be filled with bookworms.

90
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,084
That sword must be you.

91
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,669
I will take that as a compliment.

92
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,837
No,

93
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,588
I am mocking you.

94
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,552
Illegitimate sons are always the problem.

95
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,555
Both Bang-seok and Jeong Do-jeon
were born out of wedlock.

96
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,224
Your case is worse
because your mother was a lowborn.

97
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,560
Now that the new kingdom has begun,

98
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,270
I bet you think
you can turn things around.

99
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,397
That is why you had the audacity
to stop a prince

100
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,607
when you are a mere inspector.

101
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,902
Times have changed,

102
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,071
so those born out of wedlock
should be treated equally.

103
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,615
I will incarcerate them.

104
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,616
You won't be able to.

105
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,870
I will ban them from obtaining
any positions in the government.

106
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,705
Those who already have one

107
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,248
will be removed from their positions.

108
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,503
Keep in mind that

109
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,883
it's the country that changed,

110
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,676
not the world.

111
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,889
Now, may we discuss the important matter?

112
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,391
Sure, let's hear it.

113
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,435
Please get off your horse
when entering the palace.

114
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,895
What if I refuse?

115
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,854
Then

116
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,647
you will lose your horse.

117
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,208
I slew it in your place, Your Highness.

118
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,502
The world has changed.

119
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,712
And in this new world,
you are nothing more

120
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,506
than a mere subject of His Majesty.

121
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,549
So please act accordingly.

122
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,098
Your father would have slain

123
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,685
a gatekeeper instead of that horse.

124
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,229
I must say,

125
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,232
you are different from your father.

126
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,817
-Are you mocking me again?
-No, I am not.

127
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,111
This time, you may take it
as a compliment.

128
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,845
HYEGEOMDANG

129
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,522
There's one condition.

130
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,192
Hui-jae can't know about
the information you know.

131
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,736
Move far away from Hui-jae.

132
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,197
If she gets involved,
she'll be exposed to danger.

133
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,116
You can neither be her friend
nor her lover.

134
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,953
Will you promise me?

135
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,457
Yes.

136
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,710
I give you my word.

137
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:16,991
YI SEONG-GYE

138
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,414
YI BANG-WON

139
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,749
He is Bang-won.

140
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,752
Take a good look at him

141
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,046
for he will steal this nation.

142
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,465
You are to gain his trust.

143
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,395
HAN HUI-JAE

144
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,993
General Jung Sa-jeong.

145
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,995
A founding contributor
and Bang-won's close aide.

146
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,831
He's killed so many people,

147
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,792
and he rapes women for fun.
He is a scoundrel.

148
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,754
Get him to talk and win over the King.

149
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,675
I will kill him and win over Bang-won.

150
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,889
We'll whack Jung Sa-jeong
and get rid of those Ganggae bastards.

151
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,320
Two fives.

152
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,660
-Excuse me.
-Gosh, don't touch me.

153
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,663
Yes, I'm coming!
With your wine, of course.

154
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,791
Let me pour you a glass

155
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,044
-Here.
-All right, let's see.

156
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,134
Gosh, let me explain.
Please hear me out first. You're mistaken.

157
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,890
What, then?

158
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,270
Shall I go ahead
and relieve myself right here?

159
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,439
Shall I? Is that what you want me to do?

160
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:21,031
My goodness, I have to deal with that
every time I need to relieve myself.

161
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,079
Pay me first.

162
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,915
Great.

163
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,175
Now, tell me.

164
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,803
At the moment...

165
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,138
Yes.

166
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,307
Two outside and eight inside.

167
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,017
-Where's he?
-In the secret room.

168
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,685
There are two armed men in that room.

169
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,061
There are so many of them.

170
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,063
The bet is over 2,000 nyang,

171
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,065
so they obviously have to guard the money.

172
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,570
By the way, who are these guys?
That's enough money to buy ten mansions.

173
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,197
I don't have a good feeling about this.

174
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,908
-You don't need to know.
-I need to know who we're dealing with.

175
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,285
-One of the founding contributors.
-I see.

176
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,747
-Hey!
-Have you gone mad?

177
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,373
The sane are considered weird nowadays.

178
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,541
I can't go. I refuse!

179
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,667
Think about the money.

180
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,587
-Let's go.
-Okay.

181
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,599
-Gosh.
-What is going on?

182
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,100
Hey, you'll have to wait.

183
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,436
-He's got eight.
-Damn it.

184
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,563
You two don't look like guests.

185
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,440
We're here to steal your money.

186
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,942
Just the two of you?

187
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,527
No, there are four of us.

188
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,812
My lord, you should get out of here.

189
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,482
Happenings like this are very common
at tujeon dens.

190
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,067
All right.

191
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,819
Place your bets.

192
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,321
But what if the authorities raids us?

193
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,783
We'll kick them out.

194
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,327
Have you forgotten who I am?

195
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,287
You're just

196
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,205
a gambling addict.

197
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,419
Gambling addiction is scary indeed.

198
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,588
You won't budge even if a fire breaks out.

199
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,631
You must be one of them.

200
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,115
This is paradise.

201
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,867
This is heaven.

202
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,711
Let's go.

203
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,550
Hey, you look like a bird picking up food
with its beak. Enough already.

204
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,427
-Let's go.
-Wait, this is gold.

205
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,012
-Hey, just a second.
-Come on.

206
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,555
Wait, it's gold!

207
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,631
Untie me at once.

208
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:19,687
Oh, my. At this rate, we'll become so rich
that we'll make kimchi with wild ginseng.

209
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,398
I'll wipe my butt with silk.

210
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,401
And we'll find a nice lady for Chi-do.

211
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,570
No, thanks.
I'm much happier living with you guys.

212
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,659
-I didn't hear that.
-Same here.

213
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:41,083
Hwi, these petty gigs won't do.

214
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,960
Let's be bold.

215
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,254
We'll raid all the tujeon dens
in Gaegyeong.

216
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,798
Let's crush them all like this.

217
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,554
My, this guy is strong.

218
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,396
Jeez, do I not even
deserve to eat or what?

219
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,029
Here. Shall I go rinse this
in water for you?

220
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,364
This came out of
a chicken's butthole, you know.

221
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,741
My mouth is cleaner. Have this.

222
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,578
Your breath smells like poop.

223
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,788
Why you little...

224
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,628
How beautiful.
Look how gorgeous these are.

225
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,547
Look at these cherry blossom kites.

226
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,008
Sir! Where are you going, sir?

227
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,219
This kite with lilies will help you
become a high-ranking official.

228
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,349
And this kite with daylilies
will help you conceive a boy.

229
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:43,353
Go to Yeseongjeong and fly a kite!

230
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,243
One of the deserters

231
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,412
was named Seo Hwi.

232
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,877
And I heard that name

233
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,797
was put on the death roll today.

234
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,141
SEO HWI

235
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,777
Rest in peace.

236
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,363
I won't forget you.

237
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:06,914
You're late.

238
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,374
I never asked you to wait for me.

239
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,668
I came here to welcome you,
but you're all cranky.

240
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,921
You neither need to welcome me
nor see me off, so--

241
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,006
Her Majesty ordered me
to welcome you in person

242
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,799
and see you off.

243
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,886
Hurry. Her Majesty is waiting for you.

244
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,103
His Majesty will soon choose a prince
to receive the title of Crown Prince.

245
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,855
If he chooses Prince Uian,

246
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,983
all the officials and the other princes
will strongly object.

247
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,110
We will find dirt on the other princes

248
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,071
and pressure the meritorious officials.

249
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,241
Some are bound to shed blood.

250
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,201
It just won't be us.

251
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,538
-What about you, Hui-jae?
-There is an uncomfortable truth

252
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,832
and a generous lie.

253
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,417
Let us hear the truth first.

254
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,962
His Majesty can neither tolerate
being pushed out of the throne

255
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,631
nor being a weak king.

256
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,928
The younger the Crown Prince is,

257
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,347
the longer His Majesty
can stay on the throne.

258
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,350
The only reason
Prince Uian would be chosen

259
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,769
is because he is young.

260
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,981
Then what is the lie?

261
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,108
It doesn't seem like His Majesty

262
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,988
is the only one
who wants a young crown prince.

263
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,117
Be careful of the kind ones around you.

264
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,706
I hear you're called
a minister in a frock.

265
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,458
And I hear you're called
the King wearing a gat.

266
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,965
You haven't changed one bit.

267
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,383
You haven't either.

268
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,970
Bang-won has revealed his claws,

269
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,347
and he will soon try
to shred everything to pieces.

270
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,018
We must act first to survive.

271
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,147
We will abolish private armies as soon as
Prince Uian is installed as Crown Prince.

272
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,817
Bang-won will lose all of his soldiers,
and he and his six brothers...

273
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,654
We will kill them all.

274
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,993
One side has to be completely exterminated
for this war to end.

275
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,662
Although a wench like you
probably has no idea.

276
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,551
There seems to be some hard feelings
between you and Nam Jeon.

277
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,554
I just think we should be careful.
That is all.

278
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,728
So you wish to participate
in the tributary trade?

279
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,521
I will buy information with that money

280
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,316
and use it to stop the
meritorious officials as well as Bang-won.

281
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,942
Can you do it?

282
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,570
If we can predict Bang-won's moves,
we will be able to stop him

283
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,864
no matter how sharp his sword is.

284
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,325
I can do it.

285
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,004
My father...

286
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,340
Your father is right.

287
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,843
This war won't end
until one side is completely exterminated.

288
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,137
I will keep his advice in mind.

289
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,931
Money is more dangerous than knives.

290
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,599
And that is precisely why I need it.

291
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,267
What do you wish to obtain with it?

292
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,855
The kind of power that can get
a mere inspector fired at once?

293
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,026
I should try to get on your good side.

294
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,404
It's because
I don't want to lose anything.

295
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,199
I don't want to lose

296
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,701
anyone else.

297
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,373
I know Hwi ended up like that

298
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,918
because of your father.

299
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,671
You keep saying it was you,
but I won't believe you.

300
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,673
You're not that cruel.

301
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,635
So don't mind me

302
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,763
and just do what you believe is right.

303
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,982
Word on the street is that

304
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,318
some of the deserters from Liaodong
returned in one piece.

305
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,031
-By any chance--
-That's impossible.

306
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,783
Not a single person

307
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,286
managed to cross the Amnok River.

308
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,621
Hwi was one of them.

309
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,124
I guess you don't care at all.

310
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,168
I was just answering your question.
That's all.

311
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,725
You punks!

312
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,144
Do you even know who I am?

313
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,148
You're one of the founding contributors,
General Jung Sa-jeong.

314
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,109
You have three mistresses
and two sons with different mothers.

315
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,988
You own 48 slaves and 185 pieces of land

316
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,575
as well as three horses and five dogs.

317
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,912
But one of them gave birth
to five puppies yesterday.

318
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,664
Shall I add them too?

319
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,374
Who are you?

320
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,173
I am Inspector Nam Seon-ho
from the Office of the Inspector General.

321
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,634
How dare such a low-ranking official
do this to me?

322
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:18,558
I will be sure
to shred you punks to pieces.

323
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,023
A little while ago, you got drunk
and harassed a woman.

324
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,026
Then you took your anger out on her
and beat her up to death.

325
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,154
However, you were never investigated,
let alone impeached.

326
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,074
She was just a worthless lowborn.

327
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,327
Beating a lowborn to death is forgiven,

328
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,413
but gambling is illegal.

329
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,707
That, to me, is amusing.

330
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,089
Now, you can choose

331
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,049
to live or die.

332
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,972
I know that you are like an uncle

333
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,140
to Bang-u, Bang-gan, and Bang-won.

334
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,773
Fill the paper
with the princes' weaknesses.

335
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,651
From top to bottom.

336
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,945
Only then will I spare your life.

337
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,541
He filled the whole sheet.

338
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,044
I suppose he really wants to live.

339
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,381
He will be executed
if he is reported for gambling,

340
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,467
and Bang-won will kill him
if he finds out about his betrayal.

341
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,469
Either way, he will die.

342
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,888
I didn't think I'd see
a meritorious official shedding blood.

343
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,266
Roughnecks and officials
all have the same colored blood.

344
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,684
There's nothing different.

345
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,562
Bloodshed is inevitable.

346
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,356
What follows is the real issue.

347
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,609
Leave a bloodstain?

348
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,739
Or sever it completely?

349
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,285
So are we after Bang-won now?

350
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:25,602
Oh, dear. They made a real mess in here.

351
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,981
Cheol-du, who's the bastard that did this?

352
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:33,610
His name is Hwi.
That son of a bitch used to be a hunter.

353
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,571
I guess he jerks around with his buddies
in Madudong these days.

354
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,033
Is that so?

355
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,354
Excuse me.

356
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,941
This is the one day out of this month

357
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,234
that I get to go out.

358
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,973
My lady, have a look at this.

359
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,766
-Here, it's an umbrella.
-It's okay.

360
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,892
What about this one?

361
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,397
Have a look.

362
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,693
Come have a look at these umbrellas.

363
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,946
Feel free to browse around.
I have these floral shoes.

364
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,960
How can I give this to her?

365
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,942
Are you looking for this?

366
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,239
Thank you.

367
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,660
Are you blind or what?

368
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,955
You were just standing there smiling
even after that rogue pickpocketed you.

369
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,207
This is so frustrating.

370
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,337
I mean, how are you going to survive

371
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,798
in this tough world if you're that clumsy?

372
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,552
Don't you know me?

373
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,023
We've met before.
At the Lord's sarangchae.

374
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,239
You remember it.

375
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,658
Once I see something, I never forget it.

376
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,368
I remember everything.

377
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,038
You have a good memory.

378
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,498
Good for you.

379
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,546
You're about the height.

380
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,634
Let me borrow your foot.

381
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,345
What?

382
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,473
I heard comparing soles
makes people fight.

383
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,143
I need to compare the soles
so I can buy perfect-fitting shoes.

384
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:40,189
If you only measure it with your eye,
the shoes will be too loose.

385
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,780
Who is it for?

386
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,325
Tomorrow is my brother's birthday.

387
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,663
I'd like to buy this.

388
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,749
Okay. Five nyang please.

389
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,302
Go.

390
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,721
Pardon?

391
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,140
Run. And don't look back.

392
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,312
Yeon, hurry!

393
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,482
You know my name?

394
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,112
Are you Hwi?

395
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:34,202
Hey, Boss Ganggae.
I'm so honored to meet you.

396
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,705
What's going on?
Are you so scared you lost your mind?

397
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,499
Soldiers are everywhere
because of yesterday.

398
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,293
Let's go somewhere quiet and talk. Okay?

399
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,463
What a handsome face you have.

400
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,633
I'll rip your mouth

401
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,385
and make you smile even when you're sad.

402
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,013
That's so nice of you. Okay. Let's go.

403
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,657
TAVERN

404
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,704
Have a seat.
They have some nice soup and rice here.

405
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,332
You're unbelievable.

406
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,876
Do you carry around some nerves
in your pocket?

407
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,628
I had to be smiling back there.

408
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,965
She would have freaked out
if she saw blood.

409
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,758
Cheol-du, chop his head.

410
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,344
Don't pull it out. You'll hurt your knee.

411
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,100
-How many arrows do you have left?
-Twelve.

412
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,440
-That's more than enough.
-What happens if we move in a group?

413
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,525
Can a bow shoot two arrows at once?

414
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,327
You punks weren't that stupid after all.

415
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,132
Did you say you were a hunter?

416
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,636
I hunt tigers, bears, and dogs.

417
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,389
Say whatever you want to say.
It will be your will.

418
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,853
Why don't we put an end
to the bickering here?

419
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,021
What about the gamble?

420
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,856
What about Cheol-du?

421
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,360
Here.

422
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,198
Is that not enough?
Do you want one more piece of dogskin?

423
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,741
What is it that you want?

424
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,162
Let's live together. Like a family.

425
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,082
And share the gambling house
half and half.

426
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,667
You bastard. Stop lying!

427
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,052
-Did you say "half and half"?
-We will split the work half and half too.

428
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,054
Stop the bullshit and work for me.

429
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,098
How can a tiger work for a dog?

430
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,103
You're one good bullshitter.

431
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,611
Let me give it some thought.

432
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,664
Take the hides, will you?

433
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,217
Boss.

434
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,929
Are you going to leave them like that?

435
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,597
Of course I won't.

436
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,935
Wait and see.

437
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,147
I will cut those punks into slices.

438
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,595
Where's Grand General Jung?

439
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,513
I took him home.

440
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,820
-What about Bang-won?
-He wouldn't say anything

441
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,031
about Bang-won's weakness.

442
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,742
I made you an inspector to catch Bang-won.

443
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,495
If you can't catch him, you are of no use.

444
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,415
I'm sorry.

445
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,960
What about Hwi?

446
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,463
He has begun.

447
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:01,677
A dog that can run well,
bark well, and even bite well

448
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,056
thinks it's a wolf.

449
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:09,560
If you leave it alone,
it'll refuse your food and start hunting.

450
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,437
In the end,

451
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,857
it will starve to death,
get eaten by a tiger,

452
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,109
or come back and bite its owner.

453
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,113
Do you think it is right
to trust this dog?

454
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,825
As long as Yeon is there,
Hwi won't do that.

455
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,079
In this world, sons aim at their fathers
and mothers abandon their kids.

456
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,080
And do you think

457
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,999
he will risk his life for his sister
who doesn't even remember him?

458
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,542
He will.

459
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,088
I know you won't understand though.

460
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,130
Hwi...

461
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,217
met Yeon.

462
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,678
In a market where everyone can see.

463
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,851
If Hwi can't cut her off, you do it.

464
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,062
If you can't cut her off either,

465
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,022
I will cut her off.

466
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,784
What if someone saw you?

467
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,745
That's my question.

468
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,621
Yeon was in danger.

469
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,916
She got robbed by a pickpocket
and almost got involved with Ganggae.

470
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,002
Protect her properly.

471
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,212
If she gets hurt, I will not let it slide.

472
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,673
A servant saw you and told it to Lord Nam.

473
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,469
It's always you who puts Yeon in danger.

474
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,595
Not me.

475
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,432
Seon-ho,

476
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,559
are you awake?

477
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,250
I thought you might need some water
during the night.

478
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,669
Thanks.

479
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,382
Lord Nam seemed upset.

480
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,258
Is everything okay?

481
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,179
There are more days where he's upset
than he's happy.

482
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,472
It's okay.

483
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,934
There you are. Smiling again.

484
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,685
What?

485
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,605
I have seen only one facial expression
on your face.

486
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,775
When you're tired, you smile.
When you're annoyed, you smile.

487
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,444
And sometimes, you just smile.

488
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:07,988
I do?

489
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,324
You can cry on my shoulder.

490
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,119
You have nowhere else to cry.

491
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,416
Don't blame me for crying too much later.

492
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,549
Right.

493
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,969
This afternoon,
I met someone who knew my name.

494
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,805
He said he was Lord Nam's servant.

495
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,099
His name was something like Hwi.

496
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,727
I was surprised.

497
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,855
A name exists to be called

498
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,566
but I was fascinated to hear it
outside of this house.

499
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,235
Tomorrow,

500
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,779
let's go to the market.

501
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,239
Really?

502
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,323
Yes.

503
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,784
You promised.

504
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,342
You called her by her name?

505
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,472
Just tell her who you are, why don't you?

506
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,440
Tomorrow at noon,

507
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,734
market pavilion.

508
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,029
I'll bring Yeon there, so take care

509
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,363
of this mess you made.

510
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,494
Make sure she doesn't think of you again.

511
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,371
It's the best you can do for her.

512
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,179
You asked to see me?

513
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,555
Let's go for a walk.

514
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,476
In and outside the palace,
many are talking

515
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,478
about your actions the other day.

516
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,813
Please do not fret.

517
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,815
The truth can't climb walls

518
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,693
but rumors can pass mountain ranges.

519
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,279
So smile.

520
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,199
Only your smile

521
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,201
will subside these rumors.

522
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,078
Smiling is easy.

523
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:23,707
Pretending to smile is the hard part.

524
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,294
I hear that Prince Jinan
is living off his booze.

525
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,632
That's news to me.

526
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,385
The whole world knows, but you.

527
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,389
I'm worried to have
such a weak first-born.

528
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,266
And to hear it's because he's a drunk?

529
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,226
Well, I'm embarrassed
to even say it out loud.

530
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,234
My second eldest son Prince Yeongan
has 15 bastard sons.

531
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,361
I can already see them
fighting and arguing.

532
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,738
-Your Majesty--
-My third son Prince Ikan

533
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,408
can barely even function
in his current position.

534
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,743
-Your Majesty--
-My fourth son Bang-gan

535
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,620
spends most of his days
with woman and liquor.

536
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,622
How's that different
from your everyday thug?

537
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,083
-Father--
-So...

538
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,088
who must I have as the Crown Prince?

539
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,842
Should it be the drunk or a thug?

540
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,218
Should it be...

541
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,138
you?

542
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,808
Answer me.

543
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,311
I'll select the one you choose.

544
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,104
Don't you trust me?

545
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,817
Many have just heard me speak,

546
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,695
so how would I, the King,
go back on my word?

547
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,449
The historian will write this down.

548
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,619
Prince Jeongan will request
who will become Crown Prince,

549
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:45,080
so I will hear his wishes
and choose accordingly.

550
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,090
Who should it be?

551
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,272
Prince Uian

552
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,983
may be young and your bastard son,

553
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,110
but he is clever and wise.

554
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,572
His generosity seems to be boundless.

555
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,115
That is why...

556
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,871
you should proclaim him
as the Crown Prince

557
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,541
and lay a strong foundation

558
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,835
for a thriving...

559
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,922
nation.

560
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,267
Are you satisfied now?

561
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,062
I couldn't be happier.

562
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,148
That's what I call brotherly love.

563
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,838
Not many know about Bang-u's condition.

564
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,215
I silenced all that knew of it.

565
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,759
All except one.

566
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,763
Grand General Jung.

567
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,822
My lord!

568
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,992
Oh, Hwa-wol, it's you.

569
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,119
I didn't notice you without your hat.

570
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,454
Do I look uglier?

571
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,621
No, the opposite.

572
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,292
Well, my job as an escort is done.

573
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,396
Who's the bitch?

574
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,856
The Queen favors her.

575
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,025
She's not one to mess around with.

576
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,237
-What do you think?
-What about the other one?

577
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,284
Inspector Nam is mostly a decent man,

578
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,495
but I like him even more when he smiles.

579
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,497
Who says he's decent?

580
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:35,083
He's the only one
who shows interest in you.

581
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,378
You'll be punished
if you consider him as a pest.

582
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,464
I have my reasons.

583
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,341
Reasons you don't know.

584
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,638
Aren't you coming inside?

585
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:51,141
Greet Madame Seo when you can.

586
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,687
Even at that age,
she grows ten years older by the day.

587
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,232
She'll just make me leave, so why bother?

588
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,068
She's the one who made me seek you out.

589
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,862
She's been coughing blood for a while now.

590
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,365
Don't regret it after she's gone

591
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,367
and come to see her sometime.

592
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,369
I'll get going.

593
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,287
Wait.

594
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,249
What about Hwi?

595
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,002
I've been asking around but to no avail.

596
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:23,382
I would've heard already if he were alive.

597
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,842
Anyway, I'll get going.

598
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,280
What do you think?

599
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,657
How many more times are you going to ask?

600
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,159
I'm already sick and tired of this.

601
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,286
This is the 12th time.

602
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,413
Is the navy one better?

603
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,248
If only I can see how I look.

604
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,085
Here.

605
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,423
Where the hell did that come from?

606
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,967
Do you look into that when you get ready?

607
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,928
Are you kidding me? This is a weapon.

608
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,430
I can use it as one

609
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,849
or as a shield.

610
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,561
Don't laugh.

611
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,688
-Do you want your head bashed in?
-Shit.

612
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,523
Thank you.

613
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,775
Are you going on a date?

614
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,694
You've been dressing up
for almost 2 hours now.

615
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,655
This may be the last time I see her,

616
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,949
so who cares if it takes more than 20?

617
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,392
Are those new?

618
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,062
I found them on the terrace.

619
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:02,105
Maybe I have a secret admirer.

620
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:06,068
Whoever it is,
she probably is sweet and beautiful.

621
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,986
Then she wouldn't have left it
for me in secret.

622
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,329
Anyway, happy birthday.

623
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,456
You clean up really nicely.

624
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,542
I almost didn't recognize you.

625
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,253
Are you all right though?

626
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,963
There seems to have been an altercation.

627
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:10,632
That's not what it was.

628
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,468
Who's this?

629
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:17,639
He's the man working for your father
whom I told you about yesterday.

630
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:19,224
I see.

631
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:42,998
I know who he is.

632
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,210
He's a thug who's usually seen
covered in others' blood.

633
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,633
He can't protect what's his
so he barks to get what he wants.

634
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:57,387
When things don't go his way,
he uses violence to solve the situation.

635
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:59,890
How did you know her name?

636
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,643
Were you going to kidnap her for a ransom?

637
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,812
You think you'll be safe
if she was your hostage?

638
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:06,855
On the contrary.

639
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,150
You will be instantly found and killed.

640
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,027
You won't last a day.

641
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,280
That's you and your old man.

642
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,326
You threaten people
and treat them like your dogs.

643
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,912
How dare you.

644
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,749
Who are you calling old man?

645
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,542
Watch what you're saying.

646
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,669
Threaten? Treat people like dogs?

647
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:34,966
My brother

648
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:38,929
isn't someone you should
be running your mouth off to.

649
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,182
Keep living your life like this.

650
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,269
Seon-ho, let's go.

651
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,796
You did well.

652
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,718
That's how you sever relationships.

653
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,762
I had a good teacher.

654
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,391
You do so easily with

655
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,352
even your own blood.

656
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:13,773
What do you mean by that?

657
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,609
You know what I mean.

658
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,780
Is this about your mother?

659
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,992
Do you resent me for that?

660
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,370
You forget about your brother's death

661
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,289
but you only remember
how she hanged herself!

662
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,167
I didn't order her to do that.

663
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,336
She did because you couldn't let her go.

664
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,670
You're wrong!

665
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,175
It's because you pulled us apart.

666
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,386
It's because...

667
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,097
you stole me from her.

668
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,586
I, Hwa-wol, greet you.

669
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:26,972
You sure are a pretty one.

670
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:36,147
IHWARU

671
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,462
Get back here and pour my drink!

672
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,051
Just because you dance
doesn't make you noble.

673
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,762
-Hwa-wol?
-Hui-jae...

674
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:10,390
Being able to play the geomungo
doesn't make you a lady.

675
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:14,894
Wait.

676
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,187
Look who it is.

677
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,483
You're the one
they call the lady minister.

678
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,657
My lord, you're making a scene.

679
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:33,872
All right.

680
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,291
You can pour me my drinks instead.

681
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:37,751
Who knows?

682
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:41,046
I may take you in as my concubine.

683
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,506
They say you become a dog with alcohol.

684
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,050
How dare you!

685
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,801
A dog?

686
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,473
That's what you call
a founding contributor of this nation?

687
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,856
Gyeol, don't just stand there.

688
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,025
You're here to take care of men like him.

689
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,444
How dare you threaten
a founding contributor?

690
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,034
Fine, take a swing!

691
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,704
Let's see if you can assault me.

692
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,916
Come on! Handle that son of a bitch.

693
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,060
You crazy bitch.

694
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,190
Hui-jae!

695
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,913
How dare you threaten him with a blade?

696
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,249
Who do you think you are?

697
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,709
Madame Seo...

698
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,681
I apologize, my lord.

699
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,101
I should've taught my girls better,

700
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,270
but they got on your nerves instead.

701
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,274
Please subside your anger
and generously forgive them.

702
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,789
Madame Seo just saved your life.

703
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,635
Call the physician.

704
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:54,596
Now.

705
00:58:58,701 --> 00:58:59,661
How is Hwa-wol doing?

706
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,579
She just fell asleep.

707
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:04,874
What about you?

708
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,716
I should've held back.

709
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,262
If I couldn't punish him,

710
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,931
I should've turned a blind eye.

711
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,725
Being close to the Queen

712
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,353
made me think I had a higher status too.

713
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,897
I finally know

714
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,650
that powerless justice

715
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:34,028
is of no use.

716
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,406
You were reckless today,

717
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:38,908
but you won't be tomorrow.

718
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,662
You at least didn't let
the sword intimidate you.

719
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,041
Madame Seo...

720
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,630
A truth that's been cut with a blade
becomes a rumor.

721
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:56,175
I'm relieved to know
that you'll be able to handle yourself,

722
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,804
but that also worries me.

723
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,084
Who's out there?

724
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:37,675
-You called, Your Highness?
-There's a dog I need to slaughter.

725
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,068
Sir.

726
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:02,617
It must be a big one this time.

727
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,704
Select a few with sharp swords.

728
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,666
Ones that are dispensable.

729
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,335
Well,

730
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,756
I have a little mutt
that fits the description.

731
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:38,069
Hey, there.

732
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,407
Want to hunt down a dog?

733
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,076
A dog's after another dog?

734
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,912
-Enjoy as much as you want.
-It's a dog of the nation.

735
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:54,168
A government official that wields a sword.

736
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:58,339
Don't you want
to climb up the social ladder?

737
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,758
I'm not interested in that.

738
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,719
Do you even know whom I serve?

739
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,555
Quit the gibberish and go away.

740
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:06,681
We'll go hunting

741
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,766
and split the profit evenly.

742
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,271
Go back on your word and you're dead.

743
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,315
Lead the way.

744
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,901
Follow Seok-du.

745
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,361
However,

746
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,947
the kill must be yours.

747
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:51,642
Your Highness wishes to speak to you.

748
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,812
Bang-won?

749
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,398
I mean, Prince Jeongan?

750
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,372
Ganggae's people are on the move.

751
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,042
-And Hwi?
-Him too.

752
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,175
Keep an eye on them.

753
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,093
One day,

754
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,679
I'm going to kill him myself.

755
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,308
Then pray that you're alive until then.

756
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,044
You let him in here again?

757
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:01,671
It's not like I wanted to.

758
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,215
What can I do when he just barged in?

759
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,394
IHWARU

760
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:19,897
Masks on.

761
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:55,391
Bang-won's private army
has thousands of men?

762
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:58,769
If he joins forces with
people like Grand General Jung,

763
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,187
he'll command thousands.

764
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,940
This wasn't in your father's report.

765
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,734
That's because I didn't tell my father.

766
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:10,865
Who else knows?

767
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:13,284
Now and for years to come,

768
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:14,994
it will only be you.

769
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:51,906
My gosh!

770
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,158
Goodness.

771
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:23,938
Then

772
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,273
what should I do with Grand General Jung?

773
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,150
Grand General Jung...

774
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,237
will die tonight.

775
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,791
Who are you?

776
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:31,630
Hwi...

777
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:35,504
You knew, didn't you?

778
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,714
How could you--

779
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,382
It was Hwi's choice.

780
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,551
He chose to avoid you.

781
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:41,886
It wasn't me.

782
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,054
You're just like your father.

783
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,598
Like two peas in a pod.

784
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,642
Taking out someone high
is how you can rise up.

785
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,561
Spread fear upon your adversaries,

786
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:51,520
not anger.

787
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:52,897
When I take Bang-won on,

788
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,982
where will you be, Father?

789
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,069
I should have killed you back then.

790
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,070
I'm sure

791
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:02,615
I'll get another chance though.

792
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,326
The world you live in...

793
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,494
I'll have to die to get there.

794
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,248
Then I'll go

795
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,169
to where you are.
