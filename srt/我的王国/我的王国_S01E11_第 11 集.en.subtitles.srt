00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,814
EPISODE 11

4
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,308
It's been a long time.

5
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,604
So it was you.

6
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,363
It's as if a dog is sitting on the throne.

7
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,784
That hat and robe
can never conceal your lowly origin.

8
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:01,412
Nowadays, those who are even lowlier
than dogs act as if they're highborn.

9
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,713
What is it that you want?

10
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,466
Will you

11
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,177
join hands with me?

12
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,350
Then I will return the golden vase to you.

13
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,187
At what cost?

14
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,106
The business district
in front of Sajeong Gate.

15
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,529
You will return what is worth enough
to buy 100 houses

16
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,031
for a business district
that may not even be profitable?

17
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,576
It might generate enough profits
to buy 1,000 houses.

18
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,370
That district is not privately owned.

19
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,455
Thus, it is impossible.

20
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,875
That is why I caused such a scene.

21
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,169
After all, you can make the impossible

22
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,545
possible.

23
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,381
What are you scheming?

24
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,300
I'm trying to earn some money, that's all.

25
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,261
Those who are alive
must go on with their lives.

26
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,614
Your father made a move.

27
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,992
Where is he?

28
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,746
I do not trust you.

29
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,583
Then trust the money
that will end up down your throat.

30
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,882
How are you feeling by the way?

31
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,261
You still seem to have some of the venom
left in your bloodstream.

32
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,141
It's been circulating in my bloodstream
for so long that I'm used to it now.

33
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,438
About your sister...

34
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,364
I hope she can rest in peace.

35
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,956
But don't you think no one else
should die because of you?

36
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,881
I'll need your answer
by 10:30 a.m. tomorrow.

37
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,903
I'll go alone from here.

38
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,280
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,371
About your sister...

40
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,416
I hope she can rest in peace.

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,796
But don't you think no one else
should die because of you?

42
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,898
Why did you come back?

43
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,611
What on earth are you trying to do
in that state?

44
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,912
A merchant?

45
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,957
In Gaegyeong and Uiju,
he was quite well-known as a smuggler.

46
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,086
Even all the interpreters know him.

47
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,214
But why did he suddenly show up
in Hanyang?

48
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,924
He obviously wants to build connections

49
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,259
in Hanyang
now that we've relocated the capital.

50
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,097
Who cares whether he is a merchant
or a swordsman?

51
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,932
We must get the golden vase back first.

52
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,351
We need it to coax the royal relatives

53
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,645
into helping us enthrone the Crown Prince.

54
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,774
His Majesty's health
has visibly deteriorated.

55
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,985
Isn't this the perfect chance
to make him step down from the throne?

56
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,744
Build a marketplace outside Sajeong Gate?

57
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,246
Having the Six Ministries

58
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,581
and the Office of the Inspector General
outside Gwanghwamun

59
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,292
is helping the whole area thrive.

60
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,545
If we can do that with the area
outside Sajeong Gate,

61
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,465
the entire city of Hanyang will prosper.

62
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,093
Sambong named the gate "Sajeong"

63
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,138
wishing I'd be a sage king,
which is very typical of him,

64
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,348
whereas

65
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,935
you are just demanding rights
over the marketplace,

66
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,062
which is so typical of you.

67
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,565
It is for the sake of the people.

68
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,483
Now that you have power,

69
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,735
you are becoming greedy for wealth.

70
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,071
At this rate,

71
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,116
you will start coveting the throne as well
down the road.

72
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,079
If mocking me gives Your Majesty
peace of mind,

73
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,290
please continue to do so.

74
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,253
I will grant you the rights
over the district.

75
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,424
So you can just go there

76
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,553
and collect chump change
dropped on the streets.

77
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,933
I am much obliged, Your Majesty.

78
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,953
Your body can't function
because you're trying

79
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,122
to subdue the venom
using such harsh medicine.

80
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,709
I think your medicine is gnawing at you.

81
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,714
Who brought me here?

82
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,427
He was wearing a government uniform,
and his eyes looked empty.

83
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,306
It seemed like something
was eating away at his mind.

84
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,031
The face in the composite sketch...

85
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,741
It was Hwi.

86
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,539
Was it?

87
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,461
You'll be whacked if you protect him.

88
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,004
Do not

89
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,923
repeat the same mistake.

90
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,259
The biggest mistake I've made

91
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,513
is not doing anything
because of my fear of making mistakes.

92
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,640
Wrong. You did something.

93
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,350
It's just that it was

94
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,561
for Hwi and his sister, not for yourself.

95
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,354
And the moment his sister died,

96
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,940
everyone abandoned you.

97
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,363
Just come to terms with the abandonment.

98
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,991
Only then will you not
let it happen again.

99
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,922
What will you do now?

100
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,428
Hwi's return doesn't change anything.

101
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,059
My father took away
what is most dear to me,

102
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,354
so I will take from him as well.

103
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,525
In order to do that,
I need to let him have it first.

104
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,445
This country, which is
nothing more than an empty shell.

105
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,915
So? Have you finished vetting me?

106
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,044
I hear that you're a profiteer
who does anything and everything

107
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,338
to earn money.

108
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,131
You gain nothing

109
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,091
if you confine yourself to rules and laws.

110
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,763
I wish I had learned that lesson sooner.

111
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,580
Good. Now that we have a deal,

112
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,332
I suppose we can just wait
to rake in money.

113
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,645
Wait until he's alone

114
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,440
and kill him.

115
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,356
Get rid of all the corpses
and clean up the blood.

116
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,041
Follow me to the main hall.

117
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,809
When we finalize the date,

118
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,687
Suk-beon's troops will join us
in Sunhwabang.

119
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,397
Yes, Your Highness.

120
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,733
What about the messenger from the palace?

121
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,652
We will take care of that.

122
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,031
No information will get out.

123
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,451
Now, we just need ammunition.

124
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,577
A good enough one

125
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,579
to turn

126
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,248
a mere revolt into a revolution.

127
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,298
Nam Jeon will provide us with one.

128
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,842
It'll begin with the blood ceremony.

129
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,435
I got the marketplace.

130
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,979
We'll hide the soldiers and weapons there

131
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,191
and lie in ambush to catch palace guards
exiting through Sajeong Gate.

132
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,488
Long time no see.

133
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,095
You saved me,

134
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,474
so take responsibility for it.

135
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,972
Don't push yourself too hard.

136
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,473
Move aside.

137
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,976
I don't have time.

138
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,728
Recover first

139
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,272
so that you can kill him later on.

140
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,818
Do you think
Nam Jeon would be afraid of death?

141
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,530
Do you think he'll beg me
to spare his life in front of my sword?

142
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,159
Just killing that scoundrel isn't enough.

143
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,370
The world that Nam Jeon built with blood.

144
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,332
I will viciously stomp all over it.

145
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,003
That will be

146
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,590
my revenge.

147
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,153
Among hatred, resentment, and anxiety,

148
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,491
anxiety is the one
that is the first to arrive

149
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,117
and last to leave.

150
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,496
Nam Jeon is probably plagued by anxiety
at the moment.

151
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,790
Anxiety is only the beginning.

152
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,833
Unimaginable pain

153
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,462
awaits him at the end.

154
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,881
The country he dreams of

155
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,969
is a kingdom ruled by a puppet king.

156
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:15,307
He wants the King under his thumb
so that he can fulfill his selfish greed.

157
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,311
That's why Goryeo collapsed.

158
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,399
Goryeo's remains
haven't even fully decayed yet.

159
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,193
We cannot let this kingdom
end up like that.

160
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,991
I will shake hands with the devil
if I must in order to stop it.

161
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:37,037
History will write my name in blood,

162
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,753
but who cares?

163
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,425
I don't care about a nation
or a great cause.

164
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,634
I'm not even interested.

165
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,553
All I want to do

166
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,472
is destroy Nam Jeon.

167
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,733
I suppose you'll leave
when everything is over.

168
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,070
The day you leave,

169
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,615
let's enjoy delicious wine together

170
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,492
like we're doing now.

171
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,050
Well, then.

172
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,956
Be safe.

173
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,629
You be careful too.

174
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,923
Make sure you eat well, will you?

175
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,183
I can neither tell you

176
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,645
to keep going nor to stop.

177
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,998
If it is something that you must do,

178
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,171
I just hope it won't hurt you that much.

179
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,654
Inform the royal relatives of when
the blood ceremony will be held.

180
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,323
When the ceremony is over,

181
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,078
we'll ask the King to step down
and kill all the princes.

182
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,705
You mean, right away?

183
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,835
All the royal relatives
and ministers are on our side.

184
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,587
What is there to be afraid of?

185
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:00,133
If they wish to kill me, they'll have to
kill all the royal relatives first.

186
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,470
His Majesty won't be able to do it.

187
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,434
But there is one person we haven't
been able to win over to our side.

188
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,771
It is His Majesty's step-nephew,

189
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,856
Wanwon Buwongun.

190
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,861
Arrange a meeting with him.

191
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,365
I will meet him in person.

192
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,008
How dare you...

193
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,467
Gosh.

194
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,347
Do not say anything and just listen.

195
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,183
I, Inspector Nam Seon-ho,

196
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,562
am here to make an earnest request,
Wanwon Buwongun.

197
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,399
Please attend the blood ceremony

198
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,570
and do your duty
as a member of the royal family.

199
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,530
Such insolence!

200
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,367
I will shred you to pieces...

201
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,370
Don't think you can be condescending to me

202
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,875
just because of your old age
and the fact that I'm younger.

203
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,507
You're just lucky

204
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,093
to have an uncle
who is sitting on the throne, that's all.

205
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,472
So just grow old like this
and die naturally.

206
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,766
Why risk getting stabbed to death?

207
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,706
That punk!

208
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,211
Is anyone outside?

209
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,546
What were all the guards doing?

210
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:02,964
Gosh!

211
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,397
Sir, let me pour you another glass.

212
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,690
Sure.

213
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,571
The crane and the cloud are a pair.

214
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,199
How come there is only the crane
and not the cloud?

215
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,952
May I be your cloud?

216
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,079
Hands off.

217
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,997
Pardon me?

218
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,963
If you touch it one more time,

219
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,382
I will kill you.

220
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,106
Wanwon Buwongun is the most
senior member of the royal family.

221
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,400
How dare you threaten him with your sword?

222
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,154
Oh, no.

223
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,907
That old man's blood
is on this sword right now.

224
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,329
Don't you worry.

225
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,039
Wanwon

226
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,751
will attend the blood ceremony.

227
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,467
Why do you not look happy, my lord?

228
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,761
All the roadblocks have been removed,

229
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,306
so you should be dancing excitedly,
if anything.

230
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,308
Hwi.

231
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,019
He's back.

232
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,523
What about it?

233
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,650
I ordered my soldiers to kill him.

234
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,948
You want to help him
stop suffering from the venom?

235
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,077
You're such a kindhearted man.

236
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,246
I never keep my enemies alive.

237
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,957
I guess you're probably

238
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,461
my next enemy.

239
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,757
Then you'd better hurry

240
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,469
because you are my enemy now.

241
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,076
I'm impressed that you survived.

242
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,370
Step aside.

243
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,915
I thought my father
would breathe his last breath

244
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,834
the day you came back alive.

245
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,505
But he is still alive and well.

246
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:50,924
Why?

247
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,510
Is killing him not enough for you?

248
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,722
What the heck are you plotting?

249
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,140
You're right.

250
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:03,270
The fact that I can only kill
your father once makes me so furious.

251
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,689
Hence, I want to make sure

252
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,692
he will die
in the most painful way possible.

253
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:18,243
Whatever you do,
you'll fail in that state.

254
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,912
If one of us

255
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,582
must stop, it is you.

256
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,711
It is the only reason I'm alive.

257
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,713
And you're telling me to stop?

258
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,549
You'll do it in my place?

259
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,967
I must be the one to do it.

260
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,512
Only then will he be called a father
killed by his own son

261
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,931
and a traitor
who deserved to be assassinated.

262
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,392
I will make that happen.

263
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,273
My whole world has already fallen apart!

264
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,819
Why should I even care about such things?

265
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,202
I will die the day your father dies.

266
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,414
So please

267
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,417
do not try to stop me, Seon-ho.

268
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,789
-Hwi.
-Hey, guys.

269
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,043
My gosh. See that spot over there?

270
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,129
I think it would be perfect for
an apothecary.

271
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,172
And a surgeon can use the space next door.

272
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,590
Shut it, you fool.

273
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:40,343
Do you want those
that visit the apothecary to get sick?

274
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,719
Do you know what my wish is?

275
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,680
Shrouding your dead body.

276
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,517
-You prick, shall I teach you a lesson?
-I'll do my best to make it happen!

277
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:48,935
How did it go?

278
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,437
Everything arrived from Gaegyeong.

279
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,689
The one from Uiju arriving tomorrow
is the last shipment.

280
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,857
Thanks for your hard work.

281
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:55,942
Chi-do.

282
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,194
Shall we?

283
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,779
Let's do it.

284
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,614
-What are you doing?
-I got him.

285
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,242
What is this about? Why...

286
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,305
I'm telling you.
He's transcended all worldly desires.

287
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,182
Jeez, what if

288
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,059
he actually ascends into the sky
on a cloud or something?

289
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,395
Chi-do!

290
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,649
Did you get what I asked for?

291
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,903
You'll die because of this medicine,

292
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,571
not because of the venom.

293
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,366
It doesn't just get rid of the pain.
It severely damages your intestines.

294
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,536
You should only take it when
you're about to pass out due to the pain.

295
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,455
That's exactly what I'm doing.

296
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,584
This is really the last time.

297
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,253
I don't want to be the one
causing your death.

298
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:30,328
I will destroy the world
that Nam Jeon wanted so badly.

299
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,997
I will destroy it all.

300
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,042
And what happens after that?

301
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,337
Is it over when it's destroyed?

302
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,631
Will you die in peace
because you vented your spite?

303
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,552
You owe someone your life,
you pay back with your life.

304
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,930
That's what I learned from your father.
That's why I'm with you.

305
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,061
Just like how precious Yeon is to you,

306
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,815
you're precious to some people.

307
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,694
Don't forget that.

308
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,354
Sir.

309
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,524
-I told you to go.
-I won't. I can't.

310
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,027
I will be sticking to you like a leech.

311
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,613
Then, I will have to remove you.

312
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,998
You learn how scary a sword is
only after getting slashed.

313
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,083
Then you will run away.

314
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,005
Starving to death,

315
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,716
slashed to death. There's no difference.

316
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,760
You're persistent.

317
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,642
Sir.

318
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:43,753
A hello wouldn't hurt
before you look for the safe.

319
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,298
I need to see the money
to put a smile on my face.

320
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,468
I wanted to say hi to you with a smile.

321
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,182
Don't look.

322
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,143
Money gets lost when seen
and gets used up when touched.

323
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,853
You're so obsessed with money.

324
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,857
If you love money so much,
why do you keep it here?

325
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,527
If I could, I would spread it
on the floor,

326
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,821
and cuddle it while using it as a blanket.

327
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,864
You'd better pay the safe rental fee
on time.

328
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:15,118
Of course. I will pay good money.

329
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:28,172
Goodness, her wig
is as big as a tiger's head.

330
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,092
It must be really heavy.

331
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:40,101
The gold vase in a kist
was definitely in Bang-won's room.

332
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:44,647
Why did it go back to Nam Jeon?

333
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,482
Does the gold vase have legs?

334
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,192
I don't know.

335
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,485
How come you don't?

336
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,322
I made you a double spy
to dig up information like this.

337
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,574
Isn't there anything else?

338
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,367
I will see what happened.

339
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,790
He will go out

340
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,625
tonight.

341
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,840
It's a perfect day to spy.

342
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,468
Will you jump over a wall?

343
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,304
Thinking that princes won't jump over
walls is just a prejudice.

344
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,473
I might as well go on your behalf.

345
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,058
How can I trust you?

346
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,101
What if the word gets out?

347
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,853
What if you get caught?

348
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,730
There's no way they will kill me.

349
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,316
-Your Highness.
-Cheonga.

350
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,567
Bang-won

351
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,403
lives and dies for justification.

352
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,113
But I don't.

353
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,490
I...

354
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,786
desperately live to live.

355
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,179
Gosh, that stings.

356
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,405
Let me see.

357
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,285
Let me see it one more time.

358
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,921
They say even a mosquito's fart stinks.

359
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,716
Where is Bang-won's stink...

360
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,262
coming from?

361
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,899
"Right to the marketplace district"?

362
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,153
Hwi from Seo Family...

363
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,074
Hwi?

364
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,731
Hey.

365
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:36,527
If it isn't my brother, Bang-won.
I thought it was a thief.

366
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,571
You have not changed at all.

367
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,031
Come on.

368
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,408
This sword survived
ten bouts with Seo Geom.

369
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,784
So don't be so ashamed.

370
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:48,789
Right. You barely had
eight bouts with him?

371
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,802
When the blood ceremony is over,
Nam Jeon will attack us.

372
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,471
No.

373
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,680
The word is not "us,"

374
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,599
but "me," my brother.

375
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,768
Now is not a good time to joke around.

376
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,978
Listen carefully to me.

377
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,104
And?

378
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:16,108
I want you to go to the blood ceremony
on behalf of the princes.

379
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:21,030
Give way to Nam Jeon
and make a fool of us.

380
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,699
You want me to go to a party
thrown by a man who wants to kill me?

381
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,911
And to be the first to die
when the blood ceremony is over?

382
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,580
We must make him draw the sword first.

383
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,500
We can only kill him that way.

384
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,418
That's

385
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,629
our justification.

386
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,465
I guess Nam Jeon is just a beginning.

387
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,384
I wonder where this will end.

388
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,053
Will it be Bang-seok?

389
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,140
No way.

390
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,102
Nam Jeon is the beginning and the end.

391
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,271
Our father also started
with King Woo first.

392
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,233
Then he brought down a country.

393
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:00,987
Bang-gan.

394
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,743
Give me your answer.

395
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,829
I want a written promise.

396
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,666
A promise that you won't kill me.

397
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,420
Put both your signature and stamp on it.

398
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,730
Once the blood ceremony is over,

399
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,025
I'm sure you'll feel like
the whole Hanyang is in your hand.

400
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,236
You don't dare to have your own dream,

401
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,197
and yet you make fun of other's dream.

402
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,907
Because of that dream,

403
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,660
people are dying. That's why.

404
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,622
"The greater good must
always be prioritized."

405
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,709
That's what you said in Liaodong.

406
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,922
To me, a country of subjects
is a big pretext

407
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,508
and the sacrifice of the dead
is a small pretext.

408
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,262
Enough with the fancy talk.

409
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,057
Be honest for once in your life.

410
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,600
You just wanted

411
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,853
to have your own country.

412
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,775
That's right.

413
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,861
In my country,

414
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,114
King is just a figurehead.

415
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,700
It's a country
ruled by excellent subjects.

416
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,496
There aren't many great kings,
but there are many great subjects.

417
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,706
A tyrant has to be born with,

418
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,084
but treacherous subjects
can easily be removed.

419
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,713
What is wrong with that?

420
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,841
And is that wise subject...

421
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,219
you?

422
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,291
This is what I call a nice spot.

423
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,253
You'll rake in money for sure.

424
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,682
They say that if you yearn for someone
you will meet him someday.

425
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,725
It's true.

426
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,562
Do I know you?

427
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,731
Handsome with a voice as sweet as honey.

428
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,568
You have no idea how badly I desire you.

429
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,111
I asked you to identify yourself.

430
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,612
Me?

431
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,449
The surname is Yi.

432
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,577
"Bang" as in to shine
and "Gan" as in a pillar.

433
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,454
A shining pillar?

434
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,330
How embarrassing, is it not?

435
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:02,084
I, Seo Hwi, greet Prince Hoean.

436
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,795
No, that title isn't necessary.

437
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,340
I seem older,
so you can treat me like your brother

438
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,843
or "my lord" if the former sounds corny.

439
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,971
You know what?
Why don't we just stick to our names?

440
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,765
The joke's getting old, sir.

441
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,310
I've admired your swordsmanship
for a while now.

442
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,772
If I could have you,
I'd gladly even present a star.

443
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,357
You have the wrong man.

444
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,067
I'm only a mere peddler.

445
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,988
I'm dead serious right now.

446
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,993
If you laugh it off,
how will that make me look?

447
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,788
Well, that is no concern of mine.

448
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:09,777
See? How can I not desire you?

449
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,410
Like I said, it's a great spot.

450
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,539
A bustling market is a great place
to conceal things.

451
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,501
It's close to the palace too.

452
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,379
Right?

453
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,675
I'll see you around often.

454
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:44,562
His swordsmanship seems oddly familiar.

455
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,000
Madame Han.

456
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,376
What is it?

457
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,754
The new Minister of Military Affairs
went back on his promise.

458
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,841
The signal-fire soldiers
and others we were promised

459
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,759
have been replaced by his people.

460
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,937
You're back, my lord.

461
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,025
Who's there?

462
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:43,037
How dare a kisaeng bitch barge in here?

463
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:44,788
Make way.

464
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:59,136
Well, that same bitch
made you the Minister of Military Affairs.

465
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,348
I can tarnish your reputation in a day

466
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,892
and make you a traitor in two.

467
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,061
You think I can't?

468
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,480
Then try me.

469
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,318
Let's wait and see
which of us will be slaughtered first.

470
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,654
Hold on, Madame Han.

471
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,785
Signal-fire soldiers, horsemen,
and the stationmaster.

472
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,037
I want my people in those positions.

473
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,459
Follow my orders,
and you'll live when others don't.

474
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,211
Go against them,

475
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,881
and only you'll be the one who dies.

476
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,077
NAM JEON

477
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:25,055
Let our loyalty and spirit live forever.

478
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,976
I, Nam Jeon,

479
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:33,856
with the support of the royal relatives,

480
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:37,776
vow my loyalty to the Crown Prince.

481
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,612
NAM JEON

482
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,539
YI BANG-GAN

483
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,336
Somewhere in Bukak,

484
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,464
the royal relatives gathered
for a blood ceremony.

485
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:06,555
A blood ceremony
held without my permission?

486
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,515
Who held the ritual?

487
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,392
It was Nam Jeon, Your Majesty.

488
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:15,481
After the blood ceremony,
they will request for your removal.

489
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:19,234
He'll drag me down
with the support of the royal relatives?

490
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,988
I will not be removed from my position.

491
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,908
Once I step down,

492
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:29,828
Nam Jeon will leave
the Crown Prince by the nose.

493
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,207
And Bang-won will try to kill him.

494
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,250
Now Nam Jeon and Bang-won will

495
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,961
attempt to kill each other.

496
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,255
All you need to do is

497
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:44,134
set up the battlefield, Your Majesty.

498
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:49,014
No father kills his own son.

499
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,436
However, there are sons
who kill their fathers.

500
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,526
You must decide.

501
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,362
Set up a battlefield
so they'll fight to their deaths?

502
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,156
Even if Bang-won asks you
to punish those involved,

503
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,909
you won't be able
to reprimand the royal relatives.

504
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,787
That means Nam Jeon gets the last laugh.

505
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,997
And if Bang-won stays silent,

506
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,918
a bloodbath will be inevitable.

507
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,259
Let's see if it happens as you say so.

508
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:29,638
Only then will I make a decision.

509
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,770
Once we request
that His Majesty steps down

510
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,480
as planned,

511
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:42,192
we will have the sons
of his first wife killed.

512
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,405
Sambong,

513
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:51,118
if blood must be shed
to stabilize this nation,

514
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,413
then I will readily douse myself
with blood.

515
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:58,208
If one must take action,

516
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,337
then it shall be me.

517
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,226
Nam Jeon, I address you.

518
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,479
A blood ceremony
is first authorized by me.

519
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,773
The Ministry of Rites then picks a date

520
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,484
and appoints someone to carry it out.
Am I right?

521
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,445
Yes, Your Majesty.

522
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:30,657
Then how is it that
you performed evil behind my back?

523
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,995
Asking the heavens to watch over you

524
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,831
and vowing our loyalty to the Crown Prince

525
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,209
can be anything but evil.

526
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,086
Nonsense!

527
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,506
You had better watch what you say.

528
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:59,186
Your weakened physique
is of grave concern, Your Majesty.

529
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:03,398
Thankfully, the Crown Prince
now stands as a fully grown man.

530
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,985
It is only logical
that you share the weight of the crown.

531
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,074
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

532
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:15,369
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

533
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,583
You want me to step down?

534
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:25,837
A loyal subject
would never suggest such a thing.

535
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:30,884
Still, please reconsider, Your Majesty.

536
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:35,013
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

537
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,644
Prince Jeongan,

538
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,772
any thoughts?

539
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,704
Forgive me,

540
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,206
but I choose to

541
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,000
answer with my silence.

542
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,011
That's it...

543
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,141
for today's court audience.

544
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,193
Father?

545
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,487
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

546
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,323
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

547
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,533
What just happened?

548
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,368
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

549
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,242
The general who commanded the north.

550
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:26,625
The founder of this nation!

551
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,796
That man has now collapsed

552
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,299
because of the lies you continued to spew.

553
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:37,969
Are you satisfied now?

554
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,847
My heart aches

555
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,351
and I am stricken with grief.

556
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,813
You and I

557
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:51,024
have come a long way.

558
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,736
From comrades to adversaries,

559
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,279
from adversaries...

560
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:58,657
to mortal enemies.

561
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,582
Make no mistake.

562
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:12,796
There has never been a moment
when you and I were comrades.

563
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,006
Only for a brief moment,

564
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,845
we shared a common enemy.

565
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,888
I thought of you

566
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:26,226
as His Majesty's dog
and someone even below Sambong.

567
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,778
I guess I was wrong.

568
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,159
Then how do you assess me now?

569
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,723
You closed your eyes when it came to us.

570
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,269
When Bang-won discriminated against us,

571
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,608
when Nam Jeon tried to swallow us alive,

572
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,070
you never considered us a priority.

573
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,822
My Queen...

574
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,616
I...

575
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,412
can see the deaths of my sons so clearly.

576
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,498
It is why my heart aches even more.

577
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,336
It is why...

578
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,964
my heart is in pieces.

579
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,217
That will never happen.

580
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,804
I...

581
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,182
promise you that.

582
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,684
Then kill Bang-won.

583
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,063
Nam Jeon must be eliminated too.

584
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,982
Both of them must die

585
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,487
for the Crown Prince
and Bang-beon to live.

586
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,575
Why won't you answer me?

587
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,955
Nam Jeon will suck the life
out of the Crown Prince

588
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,667
and Bang-won will come at night
to assassinate him.

589
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,712
If that happens, it'll be all your fault.

590
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,507
It's because you thought

591
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,718
you could hold the throne
while keeping them by your side.

592
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,726
My Queen...

593
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,689
Mark my words.

594
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,984
Once they die,

595
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,865
so will you.

596
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,456
Bring me the Crown Prince
and Inspector Nam!

597
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,814
Even if you become King,

598
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,567
you will die.

599
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:07,697
Bang-won will kill you
and Bang-gan will come for you too.

600
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:12,535
If not, you will have
to bow down to Nam Jeon.

601
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,331
How is that any better?

602
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,249
Please save me.

603
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,293
I don't want to die.

604
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,215
A battlefield for Nam Jeon and Bang-won.

605
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:28,259
It's time we need it.

606
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,012
Let Nam Jeon deal with Bang-won first.

607
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,223
I will not stay

608
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,477
and see my own son shed blood.

609
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,604
Leave Nam Jeon...

610
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,856
to me.

611
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,469
From here,

612
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:18,184
all you'll probably be able to see
are our heads and not our hearts.

613
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,730
The fact that you think so little of us

614
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:27,902
is why you've become a stubborn man
only interested in keeping his throne.

615
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,116
Aren't I right?

616
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:06,774
Gather assassins outside the capital.

617
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:08,985
Tonight,

618
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,864
I will strike the princes.

619
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,658
Isn't it too soon?

620
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,327
Maybe you should reconsider.

621
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,995
Now that we have justification,

622
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,957
we will not waver.

623
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,936
Assassins have been ordered to gather.

624
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,397
Outside the capital.

625
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,282
Move! I am a messenger.

626
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,648
It's like you said.
He's gathering assassins.

627
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,358
If the assassins are stopped,

628
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:32,902
then he'll have to order
the palace guards instead.

629
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,781
Him ordering the palace guards
is the justification we need.

630
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,867
Be safe.

631
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,257
Nam Jeon made his move first.

632
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,093
The palace

633
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:00,179
will now reek with the stench of blood.

634
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,598
Guard.

635
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,057
Yes, Your Majesty.

636
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,185
Make arrangements
so that I can leave the palace soon.

637
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,792
Your assassins won't gather.

638
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,295
What now?

639
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,505
I knew it.

640
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,510
Bang-won's been watching your back.

641
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,762
I will now

642
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,598
crush your world.

643
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:53,191
It's the world I built
by shedding blood for 30 years.

644
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,402
It won't be crushed by the likes of you.

645
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,407
I will prevail,

646
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,661
and you will die.

647
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,915
This isn't the end, but the beginning.

648
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:15,129
How about I tell you the only way

649
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,468
you'll survive this?

650
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:28,017
Devote your life to me.

651
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:34,023
Bark loudly, run wildly,

652
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,610
and bite harshly like a dog
just like I did.

653
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:41,948
Shut it!

654
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,703
Even if you shove a blade down my throat,

655
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:51,457
I will never serve you as my master.

656
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,460
Is that so?

657
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,010
Then watch carefully from now on.

658
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:07,223
See how I crush you to pieces.

659
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,770
Nam Jeon has made his move.

660
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:55,938
His sword

661
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,649
will now come for our heads.

662
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,573
Your Highness,
His Majesty has left the palace.

663
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,243
He's heading to a temple
outside the capital.

664
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,079
Me and Nam Jeon.

665
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,541
He's telling us to settle things
once and for all.

666
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,545
There is no father

667
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,048
who'd try to kill his own son.

668
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,218
I will meet him in person

669
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,678
and see if it's true.

670
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,306
It won't change anything.

671
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,378
Nam Jeon's lookout is on the roof.

672
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:02,004
There's one more.

673
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:05,424
The leaves of a tree are rustling
even though there's no wind.

674
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,385
Go ahead. I'll be right behind you.

675
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,876
There's always someone
watching the lookout.

676
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,212
Didn't you learn that?

677
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,630
Hiding

678
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,507
should be reserved for rats.

679
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,093
You're the one
who has been operating in the shadows.

680
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,597
Nam Seon-ho should've
killed you a long time ago.

681
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,307
He's fooled again and again though.

682
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,767
What's so grand about
this friendship anyway?

683
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:15,286
See my scar? You'll soon have it too.

684
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,540
You fucking barbarian.

685
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,626
Why would you damage his pretty face?

686
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,628
Hold it!

687
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,672
Handsome faces should be treated nobly.
Who are you to leave a scar?

688
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,715
Don't you agree, Chi-do?

689
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:29,050
That I do!

690
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,350
We'll meet again

691
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,644
before dawn breaks.

692
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,273
What the hell is he blabbering about?

693
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,902
I told you not to travel in groups.

694
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:50,071
Well, we're a four-man team.

695
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,989
We have been since Liaodong.

696
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:54,909
Head to Sajeong Gate and hide there.

697
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,912
Chi-do and I will join you
after catching up with Prince Jeongan.

698
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:00,498
Sure. Be careful though.

699
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,343
His Majesty has left the palace.

700
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:13,970
I know.

701
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,597
We'll watch from a distance for now.

702
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,391
Bang-won went to see him.

703
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:20,101
Hwi's with him too.

704
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:25,106
Hwi is in league with Bang-won.

705
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:31,696
It kills me to think that
I can only kill your father once.

706
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,739
That is why

707
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,826
I intend to make it
as painful as it can be.

708
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,353
Prince Jeongan wishes to see you,
Your Majesty.

709
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,273
He came all the way here?

710
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:20,286
We're going to have to
shake things up a bit.

711
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,627
What brings you all the way here?

712
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:31,630
I couldn't sleep

713
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,341
because I was worried about your health.

714
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:38,971
So I thought seeing you in person

715
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,806
would ease my worries.

716
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:46,395
You are very filial.

717
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,691
I'm worried about Nam Jeon.

718
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:55,362
I told him to stay away from the Crown
Prince, yet he managed to do the opposite.

719
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,823
I told him to keep
the meritorious subjects apart,

720
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,075
yet he held a blood ceremony.

721
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:01,202
A mere subject

722
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:05,831
is trying to wear the crown.
So what should I do?

723
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:08,292
Right now,

724
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:11,378
who am I to you?

725
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,633
Am I still just a subject of yours?

726
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,180
Do you want me to answer that as a father

727
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:25,059
or a king?

728
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:26,977
Both.

729
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:33,651
To a king, you were a sharp knife
and a thick shield.

730
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,946
But to a father...

731
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,701
you were just

732
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,205
the fifth born son out of eight.

733
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,794
But do not despair.

734
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:54,380
There is nothing in the world
that does not change.

735
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,299
I loathed you
after what happened with Poeun,

736
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,635
but I will be proud of
what you will do to Nam Jeon.

737
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:03,222
Who knows? Maybe your contribution

738
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,642
will make you into a Crown Prince.

739
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:09,895
Until when will you keep doing this?

740
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,400
Until when...

741
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,444
are you going to keep using me?

742
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,072
Using you?

743
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,829
That's what you hear
because that is what you think.

744
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,956
It was the same with Poeun.

745
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:33,544
"Poeun must die in Goryeo.

746
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:37,173
Everyone knows that,
but no one is willing to do so.

747
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,591
So it has to be you.

748
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,093
It must be...

749
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:43,679
you."

750
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:49,518
I never gave you an order.

751
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,815
It was your choice.

752
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:56,483
I regret

753
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:01,030
and resent that decision.

754
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:04,074
Over and over.

755
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:07,828
Desperately.

756
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:33,395
All the blood and tears
that will be shed from here on out

757
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:38,901
will start from you.

758
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:40,819
So...

759
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:42,947
Do not regret

760
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,158
or resent it.

761
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:43,966
You did well.

762
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,807
All you had to do
is commend me for the work I did.

763
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:54,560
Then I would've believed

764
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,353
how you don't think of me

765
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:02,151
as one of your subjects.

766
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,427
Cut off the bridge.

767
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,137
Cut off the bridge!

768
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:39,123
The only path that could lead me
to the King is now cut off.

769
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:41,208
It will never be reconnected.

770
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,879
He wants to turn this country upside down.
I will return to the palace immediately.

771
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:48,132
Issue a royal order for the princes.

772
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:51,009
Tell them to come to the palace now
as His Majesty is critically ill.

773
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:53,846
I will kill them
the moment they enter the palace.

774
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,265
If a king is afraid of
sacrificing his subjects,

775
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,976
the people will suffer instead.

776
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:02,020
Only His Majesty can mobilize
the Consolidated Army Command.

777
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:05,441
If you fail to get it done before he
returns, you will be the one who suffers.

778
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:07,025
Hit them.

779
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,777
Nam Jeon is there.

780
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:12,739
This is the end of your path.
You mustn't even take a step forward.

781
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:15,909
I will kill your father
and take my life here,

782
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:18,078
so continue along
on the path carved by my blood.

783
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,080
I think we are finished.

784
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:27,337
