00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,641
THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

2
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,102
SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARACTERS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,485
MINISTERS DISCUSSED AMONGST THEMSELVES
AND TOLD THE FORMER GRAND KING,

4
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,613
"THE PEOPLE ARE OFTEN IN A STATE OF UNREST
AT THE BEGINNING OF ANY REVOLUTION,

5
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,449
SO LET SUBJECTS WHO HAVE MADE
NOTABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AND ROYAL RELATIVES

6
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,826
KEEP THEIR PRIVATE ARMIES
TO PREVENT UNFORTUNATE INCIDENTS"

7
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,120
AND THE FORMER GRAND KING SAID,
"YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT"

8
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,876
DAY OF THE FIRST STRIFE OF THE PRINCE,
AUGUST 1398

9
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,830
Is it the palace or Chwiwoldang?

10
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,209
Do we kill the Crown Prince first?

11
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,128
Or...

12
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,883
His Majesty is on his way back
to the palace.

13
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,969
We are all doomed when the sun comes up.

14
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,057
We can only win this fight with Hwi.

15
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,268
He's not that important.
Why must you be so stubborn?

16
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,062
Besides, who knows? He may have run away.

17
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,250
Aim!

18
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,533
I am sorry I am late, Your Highness.

19
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,786
Take charge of the Consolidated
Army Command and Deliberative Council.

20
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,164
Go to Chwiwoldang with your soldiers

21
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,082
and hit them.

22
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,462
Nam Jeon is there.

23
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,049
What will our watchword be?

24
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,508
Our watchword shall be...

25
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,890
sanseong.

26
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,563
Enter.

27
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,933
Make way.

28
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,269
This is the end of your path.

29
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,313
You mustn't even take a step forward.

30
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,273
You cannot be the end of my path.

31
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,902
I will kill your father
and take my life here,

32
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,781
so continue along
on the path carved by my blood.

33
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,121
Your blood on top of all the sins
I already have to pay for?

34
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,127
My father

35
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,088
must not die by your sword.

36
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,631
I think we are

37
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,385
finished.

38
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:14,225
10 YEARS AGO,
1388 THE YEAR OF WIHWADO RETREAT

39
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,572
Have you heard of buntangjigeom?

40
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,157
You're at it again.

41
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,117
"Bun" means "dust."
"Tang" means "to bewitch."

42
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,952
Gosh, how clever.

43
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,871
Don't make a joke out of swordsmanship.

44
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,081
Swords are like Confucius,
and arrows are like Mencius?

45
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,916
That is your problem.
You're way too serious.

46
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,585
It's better than being clumsy.

47
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,773
Be careful going down. You might get hurt.

48
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,567
Watch out for arrows!

49
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,321
One nyang.

50
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,657
Damn it, seriously.

51
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,788
Don't shoot while I am talking!

52
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,583
You shouldn't even breathe
when you're shooting arrows.

53
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,046
Two nyang.

54
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,018
If I must breathe silently and not talk,
I might as well be a carp!

55
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,771
That's why you got hit.

56
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,773
Shall I tell you what you must do
to not get hit?

57
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,774
Sure, tell me!

58
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,485
Bring it on!

59
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,204
Will you surrender?

60
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,791
Not a chance.

61
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,019
You're so stubborn.

62
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,938
Is it that hard for you to admit
that you lost?

63
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,856
Why should I say that I lost
when I didn't?

64
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,192
I will never lose to someone
who pulls tricks all the time.

65
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,783
Have some mercy on this lowborn,
you silver spoon.

66
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,244
Enough of that silver spoon talk.

67
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,998
Those who were born to concubines
are only considered half noble.

68
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,334
Actually, quarter noble
if your mother is a slave.

69
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,296
That insignificant incomplete piece

70
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,589
is me.

71
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,967
Right. But one that's made of silver,
whereas I am just a useless stone.

72
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,970
You spew total nonsense
every time you open your mouth.

73
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,307
Anyway, they say who you were born to
decides half of your fate.

74
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,769
I am jealous of you, Seon-ho.
You have a rich father.

75
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,442
I get triple points for consecutive shots,
so you owe me five nyang.

76
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,198
Darn it.

77
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:27,877
Stop.

78
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,462
Pass.

79
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,925
Jeez, I can't believe we have to do this
because of that stupid poster.

80
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,804
-"Poster"?
-Someone put up an unauthorized poster.

81
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,390
-Pass.
-The people are not allowed to speak up,

82
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,311
-so all they can do is talk to the wall.
-It's all useless.

83
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,688
Talking and shouting
only hurts your throat.

84
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,648
Stop.

85
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,571
Pass.

86
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,492
He's quite pretty, I must say.

87
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,256
Happiness and pain coexist in life.

88
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,926
As much as good things happen,

89
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,220
bad things also happen in life.

90
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,098
So be strong and...

91
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,018
Gosh, I told you to just throw it away.

92
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,144
Give me that.

93
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,022
I said, give it to me.

94
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,739
Who did that?

95
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,286
My gosh, Officer Park.
We've been crossing paths often.

96
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,459
Are they animals or what?

97
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,294
I must teach them a lesson.

98
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,340
If I were you, I'd coax and coddle her.

99
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,009
You'll need a hand to scratch your back
when you're older.

100
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,512
Okay, I heard you. So where is she?

101
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,893
-I will...
-Wait!

102
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,062
You have to pay me before you go.

103
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,355
Goodness.

104
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,197
If the word gets out,
that will be the end of both you and I.

105
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,825
I will keep my lips sealed
so that we can both live long.

106
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,121
That bitch. Where are they hiding?

107
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,874
-You rats!
-My gosh!

108
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,041
-Goodness!
-Honey.

109
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,585
-Jeez.
-Hey, get back here!

110
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,837
Where did this bastard go?

111
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,632
Stop! Stop right there!

112
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,217
-Hey!
-What a beautiful sight.

113
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,386
Stop right there!

114
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,897
Was that drawn with a foot or something?

115
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:14,502
KING U MUST STOP HIS PLAN
TO CONQUER LIAODONG

116
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,764
It's the first military examination
in 20 years.

117
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,225
They are planning to conquer Liaodong.

118
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,185
Platoon leaders will be
the first ones to die,

119
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,229
so they need to recruit
as many as possible.

120
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,148
A war when we don't even have
enough food to eat?

121
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,692
Commoners are dying
because the King is a scoundrel.

122
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,949
You'll take the exam, right?

123
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,117
If I pass it, I will get ten seom of rice.

124
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,787
It's the last string of hope I have,

125
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,289
so I must pass it no matter what.
What about you?

126
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,376
Just passing it won't do.
If I don't ace it, it'll be meaningless.

127
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,548
You are so blinded
by your selfish ambition

128
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,092
that you do not see
this country is falling apart.

129
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,097
What? What's your problem?

130
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,813
Innocent commoners will lose their lives

131
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,065
because of this war
started by the unscrupulous king.

132
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,609
You should try to stop it if anything,
but what?

133
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,236
Ten seom of rice?

134
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,446
It's meaningless if you don't ace it?

135
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,156
You rogues.

136
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,581
Where was I?

137
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,249
You said, "You rogues."

138
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,710
Come on.
I couldn't have said something so mean.

139
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,921
You did. You also said we are hot-eyed,
burning with selfish ambition.

140
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,548
Don't be silly.

141
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,467
"Hot-eyed" as in "red-eyed"?
Are you two rabbits or what?

142
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,433
Hey, you in the navy kerchief.

143
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,851
Damn it.

144
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,569
Comrades, I will see you there!

145
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,238
What the heck is he talking about?

146
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,907
They put up the posters. Get them!

147
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,909
-Damn it.
-Run!

148
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,327
-Run!
-You rats!

149
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,662
They put up the posters. Get them!

150
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,459
They just blew the horn.

151
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,295
A hundred silver ingots per person.

152
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,005
Behead them if you have to.

153
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,474
-Are you coming?
-Yes, I am!

154
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,447
Are you two leeches? Go away, will you?

155
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,491
-You got us into this mess.
-Let's split up!

156
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,504
Hey.

157
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,756
You put up the posters, and what?
"Comrades"?

158
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,799
You'd better let go.

159
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,676
What will you do if I don't?

160
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,807
You're dead meat.

161
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,490
-Let go.
-I can't.

162
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,993
-I have to punch you first.
-It's this way!

163
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,705
They are gone, sir.

164
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,331
-Search the whole place!
-Yes, sir.

165
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,650
They won't believe me even if I tell them
that I didn't put up the posters.

166
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,486
But if I get captured,
they'll take me in and twist my legs.

167
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,696
What should I do?

168
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,657
Don't you worry.
We are just going to take your head.

169
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,077
-Even if I am not the culprit?
-All we care about is meeting our quota.

170
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:19,955
In other words,

171
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,959
another innocent person will die
if I run away?

172
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,296
We will set up some lowborns
so there won't be any problems later on.

173
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,091
Problems...

174
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,970
-We've already got one.
-That's what I am saying.

175
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,346
Not me.

176
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,141
You guys.

177
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,092
That was one nasty encounter.
Let's never cross paths again.

178
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,145
It's not like you can prevent the war
by putting up those posters.

179
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,814
A tyrant can't turn
into a sage king overnight.

180
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:12,943
That's right.

181
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,987
Like you said, the war will happen,

182
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,281
and more innocent lives will be lost.

183
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,868
But is that right?
Is it the right thing to do?

184
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,832
Things will change if you continue
to speak out and fight head-on.

185
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,418
I am openly expressing my anger
because it is wrong.

186
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,753
Because it is not right.

187
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,886
Try hanging yourself with spiderwebs
all you want. You won't die.

188
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,847
Nothing will change
even if you do all that.

189
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,599
That's why they get trodden on.

190
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,934
They get beaten for spilling wine
on noblemen's robes,

191
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,227
get their legs twisted

192
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,855
and are hanged to death for rebelling
because of that mindset.

193
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,443
Stop.

194
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,403
You little...

195
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,822
-Who are you to tell me to stop?
-They are still there.

196
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,880
Move aside. Arrows can't see.

197
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,017
It's fine. It's just a scratch.

198
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,356
-Then you wouldn't have yelped.
-Are you deaf or what? I said I am fine.

199
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,900
I can't stand feeling indebted to someone,
so pipe down.

200
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,987
Why did you help me?

201
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,030
If you report me,
you'll get 100 silver ingots.

202
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,117
You shouldn't have to die
because you put up some posters.

203
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,743
You said nothing will change.

204
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,203
No one can read.

205
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,372
Things can only change
if people can read them.

206
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,750
Hey.

207
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,629
Let's get out of here first.

208
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,798
Forget it.

209
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,800
Let's go our own ways now.

210
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,594
If we run away, we will die. We must hide.
Follow me.

211
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,481
-How many?
-Three, sir.

212
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,774
Which way did they go?

213
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,421
IHWARU

214
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,672
"Ihwaru"?

215
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,013
Why are you standing there?
Have you never been to a kisaeng house?

216
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,492
-Please, my lord.
-Isn't this incredible?

217
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,468
Find them!

218
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,019
IHWARU

219
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,688
Set the table in the main room.
Bring in the geomungo too.

220
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,273
A dog or a tiger?

221
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,026
-A tiger.
-We are in trouble.

222
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,948
Set the table in the main room.

223
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,703
A dog? A tiger?

224
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,623
"Dog" refers to a roughneck. "Tiger" is...

225
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,960
The Capital Patrol. Open the door.

226
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,507
The Capital Patrol! Open up!

227
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,050
Break the door down.

228
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,809
-I am Su-hyang.
-I am Ga-hwa.

229
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:56,977
I am Hwa-wol.

230
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,068
Hwa-wol.

231
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,404
I don't know who you are,
but it's your lucky day.

232
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,997
What brings you here?
You cannot barge in like this.

233
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,415
The poster pasters are here.

234
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,084
It is a serious crime,
so do not interfere.

235
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,461
What will happen if I do?

236
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,129
I will behead you.

237
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,506
You cannot go in there with your sword.

238
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,508
Is that so?

239
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,756
I am the Deputy Chief
of the Capital Patrol.

240
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,717
We are trying to find the poster pasters.
Pardon our rudeness.

241
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,555
You barged in here
with your sword and shoes on.

242
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,266
Did someone cause trouble?

243
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,935
Someone will cause trouble very soon,
right here.

244
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,410
Bring the bamboo hat.

245
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,165
It'll be easier to find straw shoes
in the palace.

246
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,167
Bring it, before I cut your head off

247
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,711
and put the hat on it.

248
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,557
Such impudence.

249
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,894
How dare you cause a scene in front of me?

250
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:50,900
Who might you be?

251
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,821
High up in the ladder,

252
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,781
way above you,

253
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,909
there is Lord Nam Gyeong,
the Second Royal Secretary.

254
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,705
The head of the Royal Stables,
Lord Nam Jeon, is his brother

255
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,498
and also my father.

256
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,337
Do you think I am joking?

257
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,881
Then pull out your sword.

258
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:17,427
I can easily shred lowborns like you
to pieces.

259
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,956
-I apologize I failed to recognize you.
-Now you know who I am, so just get lost.

260
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,850
They are not here, sir.

261
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,395
Let's go.

262
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,876
He will join us.

263
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,339
This way, please.

264
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,805
I am impressed.

265
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,391
I learned it from my father.

266
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,684
What? Disciplining others?

267
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,227
No, trampling on others.

268
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,982
To be exact, intimidating them with ranks
and threatening them using titles.

269
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,360
If that doesn't work, I can tell on them
and use all my connections

270
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,903
to trample all over them.

271
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,989
-What about ruining the fun?
-I was born with that.

272
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,993
Except for the ranks and titles,
we are in the same boat.

273
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,495
It must've been hard.

274
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,126
I owe you one, so I shall repay you.

275
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:21,926
One must know how much alcohol one can
handle and never go beyond one's limit.

276
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,144
Well, men and women
cannot be in the same room.

277
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,062
Why not?

278
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,400
Because the classics say so?
Or because all the elders tell you so?

279
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,361
Because women are expected
to wear everything

280
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,323
from their underclothes to robes
even on sweltering summer days,

281
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,909
while men can go topless
and play in the water?

282
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,660
No, that's not what I meant.

283
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,662
Then what? What did you mean?

284
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,373
Why are you so prickly?
You're ticked off by everything I say.

285
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,960
You can never have
just one glass of drink.

286
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,671
Three are never enough,
and five are usually perfect,

287
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,673
but seven glasses are too much.

288
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,968
We are drinking together,
so let's be friends.

289
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:04,928
I am Nam Seon-ho.

290
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,520
I am Hwi. Seo Hwi.

291
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,691
So are we friends or what?

292
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,989
I am Hui-jae.

293
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,560
Only officials above the senior third-rank

294
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,728
and junior second-rank
may enter the main building.

295
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,190
They cannot be armed,
and no word can get out.

296
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,945
And a mere deputy chief
of the Capital Patrol went in there?

297
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,738
With his sword?

298
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,908
What were you doing?

299
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,743
I sincerely apologize, ma'am.

300
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,704
And who are they?

301
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,583
I heard Lord Nam Jeon's son
drowned a number of years ago.

302
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,836
-What about him?
-He is in the main building now.

303
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,889
Are you asleep?

304
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,016
Yes, I am.

305
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,602
You see,

306
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,189
I am not trying to become a military
officer just to catch some rogues.

307
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,569
I am sick of being labeled
as a concubine's son.

308
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,363
I will turn my life around.

309
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,198
Sure, of course.

310
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,035
You said who you were born to
decides half of your fate.

311
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,788
That means we can change the other half.

312
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,128
Your fate isn't something
you can change that easily.

313
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,464
It can be done
when the country is in turmoil.

314
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,177
Goryeo will fall apart.

315
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,056
When that happens, I will be
standing at the center of it all.

316
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,642
You'll stand at the center?
How exactly will you do that?

317
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,811
I will become
General Yi Seong-gye's sword.

318
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,315
I will become a sword only he can use

319
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,109
and destroy this rotten kingdom

320
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,320
of Goryeo.

321
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,239
They say a mirror shows what you look like

322
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,241
and alcohol reveals what you think.

323
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,786
Those posters
and now, your treacherous plan.

324
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,287
What a disaster.

325
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,165
I don't know what you guys mean
by "country,"

326
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,833
but food is my country.

327
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,627
If rice grows in the privy,

328
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,128
I will call that my country.

329
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,923
Food is your country?

330
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,802
What a ridiculously small-minded man.

331
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,138
It's better than
what you spoiled brats are doing.

332
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:58,184
You only pity your situation, don't you?
What everyone else is doing is useless.

333
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,437
You're the one who laughed
at my notion of "country" first.

334
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,652
I regret drinking with you guys.

335
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,159
I hope you pass the exam

336
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,620
so that you can stuff your face
with the ten seom of rice.

337
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,320
Hui-jae.

338
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:01,372
She used entertain troubadours
as a third-rate kisaeng.

339
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,208
Calling her a kisaeng wouldn't be right.
She was more like a prostitute.

340
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,171
Ga-hwa's little sister was found dead
without her liver.

341
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,341
Her owner with leprosy ate her liver.

342
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,969
Hwa-wol?

343
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,263
She was sold to a 70-year-old man
for just 10 mal of rice

344
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,723
when she was only 12.

345
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,938
Do you think your resentment
outdoes theirs?

346
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,901
If you must still put up those posters,

347
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,028
go ahead.

348
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,781
But die outside the premises.

349
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,701
Not at Ihwaru.

350
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,422
I heard the deputy chief
of the Capital Patrol backed down.

351
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,966
If he barks again,
I will stop him at all costs.

352
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,345
As for those guests you brought here,
you take care of them yourself.

353
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,059
You can't even hold in your anger,
so I doubt you can get anything done.

354
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,856
This is me doing my very best
to hold it all inside.

355
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,028
I understand they harbor
a lot of resentment,

356
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,823
-but that doesn't make mine insignificant.
-So?

357
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,951
Whether I cut ties with them,
I will decide what to do with them.

358
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,579
And if things go wrong, I will be sure
to die outside the premises,

359
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,623
so do not mess things up.

360
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,502
It is just a tiny room,
but it belonged to my mother,

361
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,462
and it is my room now.

362
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,010
No, it is no longer yours.

363
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,096
Move all her belongings
to the room beside the shed.

364
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,515
-Ma'am.
-You'll die soon anyway.

365
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,851
Who cares how you live until that happens?

366
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,628
You and your books.

367
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,338
Are you possessed by a bookworm?

368
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,466
I'd like that bookworm
to possess someone else.

369
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,010
The military exam will be held soon.

370
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,053
Don't military officers
have to read the classics?

371
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,181
The classics? Yes, of course.

372
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,640
The Four Books and Five Classics,

373
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,018
Seven Military Classics,
Elementary Learning, and so on.

374
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,061
See how I am out of breath?

375
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,105
Why do I even bother?

376
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,693
You'll ruin your vision.

377
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,070
You don't want
your pretty eyes to be squinting.

378
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,949
Someone deeply worried about me
wouldn't have stayed out all night.

379
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,795
-What's this?
-I bought them

380
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,506
in hopes that you
only tread on flowery paths.

381
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,176
The ones I have are still decent.

382
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,678
Here. Try them on.

383
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,347
Let's see.

384
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,938
Wait.

385
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,898
Did your feet shrink?

386
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,223
Here's your medicine.

387
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,687
Hold your nose.

388
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,898
Drink up.

389
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,950
From flower patterned shoes
to honey cookies.

390
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,536
Seon-ho must've let you win again.

391
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,996
As if. I won fair and square.

392
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,833
Take me to the marketplace.

393
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,628
It's kind of suffocating
to stay here all the time.

394
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,964
That's new coming from you.

395
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,184
-You lost them?
-My apologizes, sir.

396
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,394
FOUR, SEVEN

397
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,065
You didn't catch even one?

398
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,901
They were gone when I arrived there.

399
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,196
Then you should've run faster.

400
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,781
Bring me three by tomorrow.

401
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,950
Or pay 300 silver ingots.

402
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,411
It's what you get for losing them.

403
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,876
Be more diligent

404
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,712
even though that will never
get you a promotion.

405
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,264
Why did you say you lost them?

406
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,224
It was them for sure.

407
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,560
I lost them and we can't be sure.

408
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,899
Should I have us

409
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,776
side with General Choi?

410
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,779
Nam Jeon... No,

411
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,491
we can even bring Yi Seong-gye in
for charges on conspiracy.

412
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,369
This opportunity won't come again.
You must take it.

413
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,537
Find me three
to pin as the poster culprits

414
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,997
who can't read or write.

415
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:37,958
Sir!

416
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:48,969
Look how pretty this is.

417
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,346
The color will suit you.

418
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,894
Must you peck and chirp here and there?

419
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,480
But there are
so many pretty things to look at.

420
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,566
How pretty.

421
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,527
How do I look?

422
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,321
Should I steal one for you?

423
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,573
Buy me one

424
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,909
after you pass the state exam.

425
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,961
I knew you wanted to come here
for a reason.

426
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:25,464
You need to register first
in order to take the exam.

427
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,300
I couldn't miss
your first step as a general.

428
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,386
What if he flunks?

429
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,308
Oh, my.

430
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,187
Yeon, the one you've been
pining for is here. Say hello.

431
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:46,444
Seon-ho, how have you been?

432
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,738
Yeon, you look pretty today.

433
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,909
I hear that's how
squids twist when grilled.

434
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,414
Are you here to register too?

435
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,498
Yes.

436
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,876
The line is already long. Let's go.

437
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,935
-The name's Nam Seon-ho.
-Nam Seon-ho, let me see.

438
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,604
LOVE CHILD

439
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:23,898
A bastard, huh?

440
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,318
Go.

441
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,070
You may leave.

442
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,035
I am Seo Hwi of Bihyeongol.

443
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,287
Bihyeongol?

444
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:39,997
Seo Hwi...

445
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,791
PARENTS: DEATH BY BOILING

446
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,046
How do you expect to be
a military official with no feet?

447
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,551
Denied.

448
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,303
What was that?

449
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,847
Your father was dipped in a cauldron
and died.

450
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,518
He's dead, but then he isn't,
so he's nothing but a ghost.

451
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,353
Ghosts don't have feet,

452
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,522
and one can't join
the military without them.

453
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,609
Am I wrong?

454
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,403
My father was the one
who was punished, not me.

455
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,155
Well, dogs give birth to dogs.

456
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,533
Did you just

457
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,535
call us dogs?

458
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,578
I did.

459
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,751
How dare you call my father a dog!

460
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,506
Take that back. Take it back right now!

461
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,926
Now they come in pairs.

462
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:35,886
A ghost?

463
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,097
Look with your own eyes.

464
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,976
If these aren't feet, then what are they?

465
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,191
Drag them out of here.

466
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,028
Hwi...

467
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,738
It's back.

468
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,415
Even bullshit comes in spades now.

469
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,392
The criminal Seo Geom will be sentenced
to death by boiling

470
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,685
for stealing army rations.

471
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,770
It is an honorable sentence

472
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:30,566
where you will go in a hot cauldron
that isn't filled with water.

473
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,695
Father!

474
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,824
Father...

475
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,745
You can choose to step in the cauldron
to wander as a ghost

476
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,456
or honorably die by taking your own life.

477
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,501
You will be listed
as a dead spirit on your record

478
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,254
and your children
will be given an illegitimate status.

479
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,799
If you choose to take your own life,

480
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,844
your children
will not suffer the consequences.

481
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,267
Father!

482
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:08,103
Father.

483
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:10,981
Father...

484
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,692
Father!

485
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,986
Father...

486
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:01,365
-My goodness.
-Oh, dear!

487
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:04,868
Yeon, please wake up.

488
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,413
Yeon, wake up!

489
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,289
Yeon...

490
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:13,168
Father!

491
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,045
Father!

492
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,557
It's all right.

493
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,268
You're all right.

494
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,127
Are you done?
Jeez, even the daughter is nuts.

495
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,965
How dare you ghosts
pretend to be like people?

496
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,845
Them keeping their status
is the condition of an honorable suicide.

497
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:08,015
Their father killed himself
to prevent this from happening!

498
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,392
And the bastard speaks.

499
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:13,645
Is your mom a kitchen maid
or a royally granted kisaeng?

500
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,441
Is this what you want too?
Should I erase your name from here?

501
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,901
I'd like to see you try.

502
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,572
It's all right.

503
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,783
We are all right, Seon-ho.

504
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,912
You do what you need to do.
That's how it should be.

505
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,798
Hwi.

506
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,383
Yes?

507
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,468
I looked ugly, didn't I?

508
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,680
No, you're beautiful no matter what.

509
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,307
No one has a seizure
as prettily as you do.

510
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,353
What do I do now?

511
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,314
Seon-ho must've seen everything.

512
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,694
You don't know this,
but he's seen it about 100 times.

513
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,239
They say that wooden pillows
smack the epilepsy out of you.

514
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,074
I hear straw mats do the trick,

515
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,492
so let's spread one out.

516
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,665
Hwi...

517
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,334
You call me way too much.

518
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,882
Don't trade the flower patterned shoes.

519
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,759
I'd...

520
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,804
rather hold onto them until they fit.

521
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,682
That means

522
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,643
I will at least live until I am older.

523
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:23,692
Right.

524
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,113
Let's wait until then.

525
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:00,604
Got you!

526
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,564
Got you again.

527
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,819
I asked you to teach me swordsmanship,
not smack me in the head.

528
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,613
The lessons have already begun.

529
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,406
Are you sure you're a swordsman?

530
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,743
Someone said that I am the best in Goryeo.

531
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,206
-Father.
-Yes?

532
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,707
Got you!

533
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,840
Who is the best swordsman in Goryeo now?

534
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,884
It is swordsman Seo Hwi.

535
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,392
As if I really meant it. Got you!

536
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,894
No, I've got you...

537
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,772
Take that!

538
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,608
-Father.
-Yeon, my sweet daughter.

539
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,764
The best swordsman in Goryeo, my ass.

540
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,994
Hyangsayukgunjatang

541
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,580
for the Head Physician
of Directorate of Medicine?

542
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,082
Is his wife pregnant?

543
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,043
That's right.

544
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,003
At the age of 60?

545
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,547
I will be in big trouble if word gets out.

546
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,383
Confidentiality is a cardinal rule
of the pharmacy, isn't it?

547
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,385
Blurting out the secret
won't get me money.

548
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,220
It's better to let the rumors begin.

549
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,806
Let me see.

550
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,309
Geopoongjibodan?

551
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,896
The head master has palsy?

552
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,105
Don't you speak of that!

553
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,609
Something huge just got caught in my net.

554
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,694
I must've been out of my mind.

555
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,864
Why did I choose to sell the prescription?

556
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,365
Is anyone in?

557
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:20,202
Not that ghost of a boy again.

558
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,958
I can't give you your medicine
if you don't pay.

559
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,419
I will get you the money I owe you.

560
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,755
When? How?

561
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,758
I am taking the state exam.
I will pass too.

562
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,177
Passing alone will
get me ten seom of rice.

563
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,887
Is that so?

564
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,474
Well, when that day comes,
I will become the royal physician.

565
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,977
How about this then?

566
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,939
Why are you here?

567
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,524
You were begging me to interfere.

568
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:56,071
I was taught to break up fights
and help negotiate deals.

569
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,323
You'll get ten seom of rice
once you pass the exam.

570
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,492
You'll pay him back 20 yang with the rice

571
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:03,286
and pay me one for my services.
What do you think?

572
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,788
And the collateral?

573
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:06,915
Me.

574
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,086
Then I am gladly in.

575
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,754
What about you?

576
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,258
I take that as an agreement.

577
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,260
Let's make the deal.

578
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,520
Is someone sick?

579
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,277
Just so you know,
I am not taking the state exam.

580
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,488
I lied about the rice and everything.

581
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,534
Back there,
things were a bit urgent, so...

582
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,036
As if you would've passed.

583
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:48,248
You're not destined for greatness,
so I doubt you'll pass.

584
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:49,916
Then why did you trust me--

585
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,336
I don't. My plan
is to keep receiving interest from you.

586
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:57,716
I won't stop pestering you for it,
so brace yourself.

587
00:52:58,717 --> 00:52:59,843
You don't know though.

588
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,638
-Know what?
-All you know is my name.

589
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,891
You don't know where I live or what I do,

590
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,893
so how do you expect to pester me?

591
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,936
Well, that...

592
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,023
I live at the base of the mountain
in Bihyeongol, and I earn my keep

593
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:13,982
at the smithy.

594
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,943
I promise to pay you back.

595
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,405
And that you should

596
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,365
with a heap of interest.

597
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:44,804
Again.

598
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:56,983
Again.

599
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,785
Root your legs to the ground
and squeeze your back.

600
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,287
Pull back with your shoulder,
not your arm.

601
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,831
Inhale through your nose
and exhale through your mouth.

602
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,166
Hold your breath

603
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,710
and fire.

604
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:20,674
Get up!

605
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:24,511
Your knees aren't meant for kneeling.
It's so that you can walk and run.

606
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:33,311
Even a senior third rank
is laughed upon in our family.

607
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,106
Cows will cackle
if you barely pass the military exam.

608
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,358
It's not what I expect from my blood.

609
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,279
This isn't just for you own sake.

610
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,823
For your brother...

611
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,200
No,

612
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,911
you must surpass any of his achievements.

613
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,418
Anyway, you may rest now.

614
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,270
I don't shoot my arrows for your sake.

615
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,565
It's not for my brother either.

616
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,485
It is only for me.

617
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,284
Just...

618
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:31,953
for me.

619
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,426
There's a hunting event
at the Kangmujang.

620
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,011
Be prepared.

621
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,931
The Kangmujang

622
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,517
is the royal hunting ground.

623
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:58,146
There are two more people
who can enter those grounds.

624
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,232
The Left Chancellor
and the Right Chancellor.

625
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,443
Left Chancellor Choi

626
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,237
is too old to even pick up a bow.

627
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:07,697
So...

628
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,492
Who else?

629
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,953
The Right Chancellor

630
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,789
General Yi Seong-gye.

631
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,583
He is the new world itself.

632
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,252
Show him that you have what it takes.

633
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,672
Chasers will be needed.

634
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,009
Find men who run well
and can bark like dogs.

635
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,181
This is for your own sake?

636
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,727
Never have I heard
such proud words from you.

637
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,271
Do not forget though.

638
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,482
This opportunity you're getting

639
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,693
was at your brother's expense.

640
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,167
A chaser?

641
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,337
Frightening pheasants into the air
and luring deer blowing on a pipe?

642
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,798
I am not a servant, you know.

643
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,426
Guess who'll also be there?

644
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,553
Who?

645
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,555
Left Chancellor General Yi Seong-gye.

646
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,227
Catching his eye might
earn you a position in his private army.

647
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:22,063
The one that's supposedly
harder to join than the royal army?

648
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,400
Don't blow ideas my way.
It'll knock me over.

649
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,198
General Yi takes in men
regardless of their blood status.

650
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,827
His captain is a Jurchen
and his chief is of a low-class family.

651
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,205
Until when are you going
to run away from this?

652
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,541
You said this was
your last chance to become something.

653
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,710
You'll wake Yeon up.

654
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,345
Just don't be cheap with my payment.

655
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,557
Private army or what-not,

656
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,684
I'd rather fill up my rice pot first.

657
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,486
My lord,

658
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,571
have you been well?

659
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,242
You found one hell of a chaser.

660
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,077
He can run

661
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,872
and also bark.

662
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,504
Don't speak before he addresses you.

663
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,548
Don't ride ahead of him

664
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,967
but don't fall behind either.

665
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,053
Always stay at least three steps away

666
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,390
but don't fall behind
no more than five steps.

667
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,432
Minister of Royal Stables Nam Jeon

668
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,392
greets Right Chancellor Yi.

669
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:08,479
What's with the formalities?

670
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:12,442
This is a friendly event,
so do not worry about our statuses.

671
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,235
As you command, sir.

672
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,653
Go ahead and mount.

673
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,456
This is my son.

674
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:30,960
I am Nam Seon-ho

675
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,047
and I have admired
the sound of your horn, General.

676
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,051
It's too bad since I don't have it today.

677
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,511
I am honored just to be at your presence.

678
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,264
Let me see your bow.

679
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:07,288
The string will tighten in the mornings
and sag under the sun.

680
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:10,083
A bow with a taut string
is harder to manage

681
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,668
and you might get injured.

682
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:13,544
Use mine instead.

683
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,264
Kneel.

684
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:13,271
Snap out of it and be yourself.
The wind is from the west.

685
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,815
It can barely make ribbons sway,
so aim a step ahead.

686
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,025
Wait until the bird
stops flapping its wings.

687
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,278
Are you listening to me?

688
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,161
Chase it.

689
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,340
A clean hit!

690
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,650
Not bad.

691
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,360
That's too kind, General.

692
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,123
Can you shoot arrows too?

693
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,542
I lack skill, sir.

694
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,002
Give him a bow.

695
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,179
It is made of iron.

696
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:30,389
Want a horn bow instead?

697
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:33,768
Iron bows are better when it's windy.

698
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:47,782
Let me get you a target.

699
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,710
You have a rare talent.

700
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,879
One that's too good to be a chaser.

701
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,047
Have you applied for the state exam?

702
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,301
-I come from a low-class family--
-Are you from a hyang, so, or bugok?

703
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:49,760
No, General.

704
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,429
Then who cares?

705
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,730
Turn this in at the registry
and you'll be allowed to apply.

706
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:04,025
But how can someone like me--

707
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:06,277
If you pass the state exam,

708
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:09,530
it may even open up opportunities
for those even less fortunate.

709
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,826
What is only land becomes a path

710
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:15,995
if you walk on it.

711
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,581
Pave the way.

712
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,670
I accept your generosity.

713
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:34,388
The day has broken
which will have woken up the deer.

714
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,266
Do we quietly hunt or chase?

715
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,225
We will chase.

716
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:52,907
You brought a diva
to perform at the feast.

717
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,327
How did you expect to stand out?

718
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:58,913
Fool.

719
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:00,331
You only see

720
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,416
what you're willing to see.

721
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,793
Are you saying I am wrong?

722
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,629
You've clearly seen Hwi,

723
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:08,923
but not me.

724
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,637
On the day of the exam,
I will not lose to anyone,

725
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:16,555
so...

726
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:19,433
do not mock me.

727
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:30,277
The relationship of a father and son
is amusing.

728
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,738
You want your son to surpass you,

729
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,949
but jealously sweeps over you
when they do.

730
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:38,869
I felt that way
when Bang-won passed the state exam.

731
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,665
I still remember how
you were delighted enough to dance.

732
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,002
He was the first in my family
to pass the civil service exam,

733
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:50,339
but he's also a good swordsman,
so of course I was jealous.

734
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,133
I envy you, General.

735
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:56,095
Your son needs to train harder.

736
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,973
However, if he passes the state exam,

737
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:01,475
I will have him serve as my lieutenant.

738
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:04,562
Is that not enough?

739
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,188
It's more than enough, General.

740
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:19,243
I can no longer hold out
from obeying the King's orders.

741
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,371
We depart in April.

742
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,957
You'll take a leadership role by my side.

743
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:28,252
Once we reach the border,
it'll be winter in Liaodong.

744
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,337
Rather than an invade,

745
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,007
we will be digging our own graves.

746
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,802
The army won't cross the border.

747
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,305
My war...

748
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:42,558
will start and end at Gaegyeong.

749
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:48,022
I will carry out your order.

750
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:50,900
Good.

751
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,505
I am sorry about before.

752
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:15,007
I should have just stayed quiet.

753
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:21,722
You said that a chief state councilor
or a minister could be in your cards.

754
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:24,433
It all begins with that arrowhead.

755
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:30,731
Apply for the state exam.

756
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,150
May the best man win.

757
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:06,976
My lord.

758
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,325
I forgot to pay you for your service.

759
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,787
It's all right.
The invitation alone was enough.

760
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,330
It wasn't me who invited you.

761
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:33,627
I will pay you
if you bring me the arrowhead.

762
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,257
I think 100 silver ingots
should be more than enough.

763
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:42,178
You're right, it is.

764
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,220
Give up

765
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,014
on the military exam

766
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:48,976
and stay away from Seon-ho.

767
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,520
Is it still too much?

768
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:52,605
My lord!

769
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:55,191
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

770
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,318
Know your place and live accordingly.

771
01:09:58,694 --> 01:09:59,737
By barking

772
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,239
and running around, you mean?

773
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:10,164
I am glad you understand.

774
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:19,006
Don't you forget.

775
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:20,257
I am not asking.

776
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:23,469
That was an order.

777
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:20,192
The whole world already knows about this.

778
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:23,070
Considering your rank,
you should know better.

779
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:24,238
My apologies.

780
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,833
I don't accept rumors.

781
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:46,677
Are you sure?

782
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,554
I checked and double-checked.

783
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:50,556
I am sure.

784
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,266
This seems worth my time.

785
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:19,001
Forward this to Nam Jeon.

786
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,379
If he tries to reward,
refuse two times before you accept it.

787
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,340
Isn't it Hwa-wol's?

788
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:26,383
Why me?

789
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:30,012
I command and you obey.
That's why it's you.

790
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:34,975
Let's wrap up the morning meeting here.

791
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:41,899
Why won't you read mine?

792
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:44,610
"Don't put personal feelings
in the bottle."

793
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,612
That's what you said.

794
01:12:56,288 --> 01:13:00,834
The wife of Mr. Kim from Umi-dong
had an affair with a salt merchant?

795
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,169
What you see is what you get.

796
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:05,839
Hui-jae.

797
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:08,175
That Mr. Kim

798
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:10,928
works at the stable of the house
with a tall gate in Uhyeon-dong.

799
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:13,806
So?

800
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:17,184
The house owner's Ferghana horse stops
breeding four months before the dispatch,

801
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:18,977
gets shoed three months
before the dispatch,

802
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,313
and starts giving him rides
two months before the dispatch.

803
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,024
It always has been that way
for the past 30 years.

804
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,192
And?

805
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:28,278
The horse bred, didn't get shoed,

806
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,697
and didn't give the owner rides.

807
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:34,660
General Choi will not start any invasion.

808
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:40,332
The general that command
the whole army will stay in Gaegyeong?

809
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,961
Word around town is
that the king is desperate to stop him.

810
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,255
The late king lost his life

811
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:48,841
while General Choi went
to subjugate Tamna.

812
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:53,053
Thanks to the dumb king,
General Choi will die in Gaegyeong.

813
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:54,763
Will this count?

814
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:56,932
Yes, it will.

815
01:13:57,891 --> 01:13:59,476
This is the 93rd.

816
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:02,146
When I finish the 100th,

817
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:04,189
you must keep your word.

818
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:08,819
It's already been ten years.
What will you do with the secret bottle?

819
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:11,321
I will kill the person

820
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,241
who has the name in that bottle.

821
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:23,375
There are seven bottles left
until your death.

822
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:07,169
Give this to Seol.

823
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,796
She said she would only appreciate
your kindness.

824
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,840
Kindness can't be measured.

825
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:15,010
-Keep it.
-I can't accept it.

826
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:19,806
Stop embarrassing me.

827
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:23,060
Then...

828
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:30,234
It may be small, but it's not worthless.
I will send a guard to escort you.

829
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,736
I can handle it.

830
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:34,613
I am the one to decide, not you.

831
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,532
I am the one to take the responsibility,

832
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,408
not you.

833
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:51,505
What a nice house.

834
01:15:51,838 --> 01:15:53,507
No wonder he brags about it.

835
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:56,969
It's the master's house, not mine.

836
01:15:57,302 --> 01:15:58,845
Hey, Pancake.

837
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:03,141
-"Pancake"?
-You like flipping over.

838
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:06,728
You flipped over at the drinking
party, remember?

839
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:07,771
What brings you here?

840
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:15,445
You don't want to be involved
in this man's business.

841
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,739
I am not involved. Seol is.

842
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,449
And Seol got you involved?

843
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,078
What if I am involved?

844
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:25,664
What should I do then?

845
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,000
You should either be his enemy

846
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,002
or his friend.

847
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,587
What if I don't want to do both?

848
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,757
You'll be the first one to die.

849
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,096
Is that what you learned
from your master too?

850
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:42,180
No.

851
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,475
I saw it with my own eyes.

852
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,027
Let's go.
I will show you something interesting.

853
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,715
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

854
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,717
Know your place and live accordingly.

855
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:22,804
By barking and running around, you mean?

856
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,973
I am not asking.

857
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:27,100
That was an order.

858
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:49,498
What is only land becomes a path

859
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:51,166
if you walk on it.

860
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:53,960
Pave the way.

861
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:04,596
What's something interesting?
Flowers? Fire?

862
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:05,847
A mayhem.

863
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:07,766
-Hwi?
-Yes.

864
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,644
I don't get it. What about Hwi?

865
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:14,022
He called Hwi's father a dog.

866
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:18,860
A mere Nokmyeonggwan said

867
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:21,822
what even a King wouldn't have said.

868
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:25,659
He had to put up with it then,
but now he has no reason for it.

869
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:27,577
Then you should stop him, not watch him.

870
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,246
I can't stop him.

871
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:30,831
No one can.

872
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:34,000
He's the son
of the greatest swordsman in Goryeo.

873
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,840
The greatest swordsman in Goryeo...

874
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:42,634
-Seo Geom?
-Seo Geom.

875
01:19:10,036 --> 01:19:11,204
Stay right here.

876
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:14,291
-Where are you going?
-He messed with my friend.

877
01:19:14,374 --> 01:19:16,001
And he's a mere Nokmyeonggwan.

878
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:20,338
-Stay out of this.
-I am not here for you.

879
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,841
You have to register so that
I can crush you at the state exam.

880
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,469
-Snap out of it.
-Let's smash the door first.

881
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,065
What the...

882
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:44,321
I request a reappointment.

883
01:19:44,404 --> 01:19:47,449
Did your father
come out of the cauldron or what?

884
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:52,871
Why don't you dance next to him
while he writhes in pain?

885
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:54,831
Who knows?

886
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,416
Your effort might pay off

887
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:58,543
and we might reappoint him.

888
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:04,382
What are you waiting for? Kick them out!

889
01:20:58,436 --> 01:21:01,273
Gosh. Those idiots.

890
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:43,440
You punk!

891
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:51,948
You... How dare you!

892
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:55,952
My father is not a dog.

893
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:57,871
He's the greatest swordsman in Goryeo,
Seo Geom.

894
01:21:58,455 --> 01:22:00,874
So tell me to fuck off again
if you dare, you bastard!

895
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:30,820
SPECIAL THANKS TO
YU OH-SEONG AND LEE SANG-HOON

896
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,924
-Don't let anyone intimidate you...
-Even if they're stronger than you.

897
01:22:51,007 --> 01:22:52,217
That's random.

898
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,094
I figured you probably
never got to hear it.

899
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:55,261
What's your relationship?

900
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,430
-What's with you two?
-We are meant to be together.

901
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:58,932
Does it answer your question?

902
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:01,977
You said you would change your destiny.

903
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,105
Do that and change this corrupt world.

904
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:09,109
I will fight to the death,
even if you're my opponent.

905
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:11,152
Prosperous times are ruled by scholars,

906
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:13,154
and turbulence is overturned
by the military.

907
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:16,491
-An era of sword will come.
-How are you not ashamed by any of this?

908
01:23:16,574 --> 01:23:18,410
Things never go in your favor.
That's life.

909
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:21,746
-Painful memories must be buried.
-I told you to end that relationship,

910
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,790
but you didn't listen to me
and got tangled up.

911
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:25,625
That may be how you lived your life...

912
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:27,877
This all happened because of you.

913
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:30,422
You do not cover a mouth to shut it up.

914
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:32,298
It only shuts with death.
