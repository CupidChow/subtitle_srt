1
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,349
THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

2
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,810
SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARACTERS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,242
Where's the secret letter?

4
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,995
Where is it?

5
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,545
Twelve years ago in 1380.

6
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,839
Is it true that you

7
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,468
made a pact to assassinate General Yi?

8
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,935
If it is, it will destroy this family.

9
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,619
He's involved.

10
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,123
Verify it instead of just speculating.

11
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,048
EPISODE 8

12
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,734
My lord.

13
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,085
Find Hwi and bring him to me.

14
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,131
If you fail to find him before sunrise,

15
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,385
I will

16
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,848
slay you first.

17
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,562
There are only two people
who can hit the target

18
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,772
over 400 steps away from it.

19
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,608
One of them is His Majesty,

20
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,693
and the other one is you.

21
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,452
Are you the one
who hit His Majesty's target

22
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,163
with an arrow?

23
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,748
Please calm down.

24
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,500
"Hide your anger and hold it in."

25
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,669
It is what you told me in the past.

26
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,880
I asked you if you did it!

27
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,175
Yes, I shot the arrow.

28
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,181
However, the order

29
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,269
came from Bang-won.

30
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,069
Bang-won?

31
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,696
He ordered me to tie a letter
to the second arrow

32
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,990
and told me what to shoot with it.

33
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,161
Even a single lie will not be tolerated.

34
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,957
Yeon is with you, so I'd never lie to you
or do anything foolish.

35
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,543
I will report everything Bang-won does
to you,

36
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,712
so please do not doubt me.

37
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,055
I will obtain the information I need
through someone else.

38
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,473
You will only be used

39
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,726
as a sword.

40
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,373
This might destroy my family.

41
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,085
I will stop it at all costs

42
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,462
and slay the mastermind behind it all.

43
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,883
I truly hope that you aren't the one
who plotted all of this.

44
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,983
There was a young woman at Hwi's house,

45
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,609
and that woman

46
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,279
met with Nam Seon-ho?

47
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,573
They went to
Nam Jeon's residence together.

48
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,368
It is out of my hands now.

49
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,537
It went to someone
who needs it more than you do.

50
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,289
Your goal is revenge,

51
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,333
but that person is trying to save a life,

52
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,626
so he needs it more desperately.

53
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,057
Was it Hwi who received

54
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,975
my mother's letter?

55
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,897
I asked you if it went to Hwi.

56
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,901
Such a matter is always kept confidential,
and the recipient shall never disclose it.

57
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,155
Have you forgotten our rule?

58
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,033
The person he is desperately
trying to save.

59
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,119
Was it Yeon?

60
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,248
I cannot answer that question.

61
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,465
Take Gyeol with you.

62
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,931
You may kill anyone who tries to
harm Hui-jae, regardless of their ranks.

63
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,059
I will obey your orders, ma'am.

64
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,313
Protect those you need to protect.

65
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,857
Meanwhile, I will protect you.

66
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,793
Whether you can survive or not
is up to you,

67
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,129
just like when I was deserted in Liaodong.

68
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,005
It must be nice to have

69
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,799
a father high up.

70
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,177
However, the order came from Bang-won.

71
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,557
It is my fault.

72
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,978
My hesitation is to blame.

73
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,774
I let myself be bogged down
by friendship and family.

74
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,694
That is why this happened.

75
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,449
I won't hesitate any longer.

76
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,619
No more.

77
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,291
TAVERN

78
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,672
Jeez, you eat like a horse.

79
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,924
Look at you stuffing your faces.

80
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,137
Why are you holding a scythe
in the middle of the night?

81
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,513
Are you a praying mantis?

82
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,766
I'm going to chop your heads off
with this.

83
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,603
Hey, stop running your mouth.

84
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:02,315
Go chop some horse fodder,
you stupid mantis.

85
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,816
That's a perfect tool for it.

86
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,445
Where is Hwi?

87
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,322
Why do you ask?

88
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,365
His Highness wants us to track him down.

89
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,744
Do you know this saying?

90
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,748
"The silent shall be made to talk
by getting their mouths ripped open"!

91
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,964
Hey, hurry!

92
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,892
Catch them!

93
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,437
Did Bang-won break the deal?

94
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,940
-We'll see.
-This is so frustrating.

95
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,652
Can't we just send the secret letter
to the Office of the Inspector General?

96
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,113
Nam Jeon has full control over it,
the Privy Council, and the royal guards.

97
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,241
He'll snatch the letter.

98
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,659
Goodness gracious.

99
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,620
Even hares should be caught one by one.

100
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,165
How are we going to take down
Nam Jeon and Bang-won at once?

101
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,506
Hwi.

102
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,508
What brings you here?

103
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,968
Are you all right?

104
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,929
The Prince is trying
to track you down at all costs.

105
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,391
We barely managed to escape.

106
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,560
I used the King
to put pressure on Nam Jeon

107
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,311
and had him doubt Bang-won.

108
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,940
Him looking for me is part of my plan.

109
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,609
What will you do now?

110
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,904
The secret letter can only be put to use
through Bang-won.

111
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,864
I will make him use it no matter what.

112
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,993
That is the only way
we can take down Nam Jeon

113
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,995
and save Yeon.

114
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,373
The moment he finds out that you're a spy,
everything will be over

115
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,666
for you

116
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,835
as well as for us.

117
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,058
How may I help you?

118
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,060
I am here to see Inspector Nam.

119
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,406
I will wait here.

120
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,949
Sure.

121
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,022
Is anyone

122
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,857
inside?

123
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,340
Who are you?

124
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,264
Why are you lurking around my chamber
at this late hour?

125
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,356
I'm...

126
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,823
Do you...

127
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,951
know me?

128
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,958
I must have come to the wrong place.

129
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,168
I'll be off, then.

130
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,132
It doesn't seem to be the case.

131
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,759
If you know me,

132
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,762
please tell me anything you know.

133
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,182
Help me, please.

134
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,314
You two have never met before.

135
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,153
She is here to see me.

136
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,334
It was the best solution.

137
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,007
No, you're just giving an excuse.

138
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,342
Had you truly done your best,

139
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,761
Yeon would have been by Hwi's side
the whole time.

140
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,055
Then my father
would have killed them both.

141
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,308
This was the only way

142
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,561
to keep Yeon safe.

143
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,063
You are holding her hostage,
not keeping her safe.

144
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,317
You are holding her hostage
to control Hwi.

145
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,111
Now, I understand

146
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,573
why Hwi tried to hide everything from me

147
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,117
and why he seemed so desperate.

148
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,400
Are you sneaking out again?

149
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,659
My lord.

150
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,411
I clearly told you that you need
my permission to do anything.

151
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,081
I suppose you look down on me.

152
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,795
Where did you go when you snuck out?

153
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,464
Who did you meet?

154
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,929
Don't tell anyone you came here.
Especially not Nam Jeon.

155
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,098
Got it?

156
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,943
Why are you shaking?

157
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,698
Are you having a seizure again?

158
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,866
Or...

159
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,831
have you regained your lost memories?

160
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,334
Let her go.

161
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,926
You are such a fool.

162
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,566
Let's go inside.

163
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,823
Yeon.

164
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,185
I must

165
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,103
meet Hwi now.

166
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,564
I don't care where he is.

167
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,524
I must see him now.

168
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:57,331
You said that punk, Ganggae,
witnessed the secret letter, right?

169
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,625
Right, so we must not kill him.

170
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,461
We will take him to Bang-won in one piece
along with the letter.

171
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,837
Nam Jeon will also look for him

172
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,923
now that he knows about the letter.

173
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,226
You didn't find the letter?

174
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,395
No, my lord.

175
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,064
What about the girl?

176
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,608
I killed her to silence her for good.

177
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,155
Get ten men who are unlikely
to cause any trouble.

178
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,907
What should I do with them?

179
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,077
Find a man named Ganggae
who used to be a palace guard.

180
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,540
There is something I must hear from him
even if I have to rip his mouth open.

181
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,502
Hey.

182
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:48,298
You look like a mutt that just saw
a kennelman. Why do you look so scared?

183
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,594
You heard it too.
Bang-won wants us killed.

184
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,887
Don't you worry.

185
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,724
I'm sure we can find a way to survive.

186
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,851
Listen.

187
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,227
Back in 1380...

188
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,187
Must you bring it up again?

189
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,897
What if someone hears it?

190
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,107
I told you we'll be screwed!

191
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,278
I absolutely won't die alone.

192
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:23,208
Trust me. Nam Jeon can't kill me.

193
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,211
I saw everything

194
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,005
that happened.

195
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,773
It's a raid!

196
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,577
Jeez, those sons of bitches.

197
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,080
Kill them!

198
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,646
Why are you doing this to me?

199
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,315
What will you get for killing me?

200
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,691
Pipe down.

201
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,193
I won't kill you,

202
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,736
so just come with us.

203
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,840
Give this to Madame Seol.

204
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,716
Don't look back. Just go, okay?

205
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,569
Son of a bitch.

206
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,821
Is that him?

207
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,615
He's the man

208
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,326
who killed my mother.

209
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,259
-Hey.
-Gosh!

210
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,808
Don't move,

211
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,811
or I will cut her head off.

212
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,148
Shoot.

213
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,359
Just do it!

214
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,365
I remember now.

215
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,410
My, look at you all grown up.

216
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,786
I didn't even recognize you.

217
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,789
I guess I got lucky
because I didn't kill you back then.

218
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,590
Are you all right?

219
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,718
Hey, why are you being like this?

220
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,720
I was just following orders, that's all.

221
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,479
Nam Jeon.

222
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,481
It was Nam Jeon.

223
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,155
Nam Jeon ordered me
to bring the secret letter to him.

224
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,117
That son of a bitch told me
to kill everyone.

225
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,131
Spare my life. Don't kill me.

226
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,049
Don't kill me, please.

227
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,802
Don't. Please!

228
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,600
Your real enemy
is the mastermind behind him.

229
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,186
He will send another assassin,

230
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,522
and I won't be able to help you then.

231
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,444
Make your choice.

232
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,988
Will you deal with another assassin,

233
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,657
or will you stay alive

234
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,909
until you can assassinate your enemy?

235
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,049
Good.

236
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,760
I have

237
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,888
killed that man
hundreds of times in my head,

238
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,724
but I couldn't actually kill him

239
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,022
because you will need him to save Yeon

240
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,531
even though he killed my mother.

241
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,202
I'm sorry.

242
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,496
I did not know.

243
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,006
This is where I floated the lantern
for my mother.

244
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,801
I did it for you as well.

245
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,097
Your lantern floated away,

246
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,020
but you returned

247
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,022
like a miracle.

248
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,657
My mother's secret letter

249
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,244
is now yours.

250
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,538
I came to tell you this.

251
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,713
You must've been lonely all alone.

252
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,090
It's been tough, hasn't it?

253
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,598
Stop carrying all the burden by yourself.

254
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,850
Share the burden with me.

255
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,060
And let's be together.

256
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,400
You see,

257
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,821
I do not want to lose anyone ever again.

258
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,285
Especially you.

259
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,668
I've now entered

260
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,130
the world you're living in.

261
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,110
Bang-won's whistling arrow
was shot from the mountains.

262
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,611
Whistling arrow?

263
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,782
What does Bang-won get
from making His Majesty doubt him?

264
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,242
Nothing.

265
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,870
Even the slightest doubt will make His
Majesty cut ties with his own children.

266
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,498
The letter that was tied
to the whistling arrow

267
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,042
put both Bang-won and Father in danger.

268
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,549
Who is benefiting the most from this?

269
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,801
His Majesty.

270
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,470
Or...

271
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,015
the one who has the secret letter.

272
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,478
Do not forget

273
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,481
that plans crumble
if the right steps aren't taken.

274
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,567
Someone is after my head.

275
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:55,113
That person will kill me, you,
and ruin our family.

276
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,618
The one who shot the arrow
must have the secret letter.

277
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,143
Identify yourselves!

278
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,404
We are here to carry out the royal order

279
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,907
to temporarily confine
the Director of the Privy Council.

280
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,327
I will

281
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,373
obey the royal order.

282
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,084
My lord.

283
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,544
-Search the house.
-Yes, sir!

284
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,340
How dare they!

285
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,430
His Majesty is warning me.

286
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,394
The King is threatening me to show me

287
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,314
that he can trample all over me
and even kill me whenever he wishes.

288
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,196
Inspector Nam
was stripped of his position,

289
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,157
and you are threatening Nam Jeon now.

290
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,827
Bang-won is out of control.

291
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,079
Why only corner us?

292
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,332
When will you install Bang-seok
as Crown Prince?

293
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,251
Be patient.

294
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,170
There is a right time for everything.

295
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,548
When will that "right time" be?

296
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,800
What if something bad happens
to Your Majesty--

297
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,135
How dare you.

298
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,639
Since you are being awfully frank with me,
I will be straightforward as well.

299
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,558
Do you think I chose Prince Uian

300
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,227
because I am fond of him?

301
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,354
Not at all.

302
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,357
I chose him because he is the youngest.

303
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,402
The younger the Crown Prince is,
the longer I can stay on the throne.

304
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,281
So just be patient and wait quietly.

305
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,658
And do not

306
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,287
raise your voice in front of me
ever again.

307
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:12,375
I shall obey Your Majesty's orders
and lower my voice.

308
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,963
To Your Majesty, this may just be about
staying on the throne for longer.

309
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,968
But to me, this is something that will
decide whether my son can survive or not.

310
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:26,347
A mother can do anything
to protect her child.

311
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,266
Thus,

312
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,811
I will not wait quietly.

313
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,827
Who are you? Identify yourself.

314
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,079
I am Nam Seon-ho, a former inspector.

315
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,080
Let his Majesty know.

316
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,458
You cannot enter
as you've been stripped of your position.

317
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,377
You trespassed.

318
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,714
The secret letter
about assassinating the traitor!

319
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,133
I know where it is.

320
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,220
Go tell His Majesty.

321
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,682
Now!

322
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,322
"The secret letter
about assassinating the traitor"?

323
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,533
That traitor is probably me.

324
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,494
Who has the letter?

325
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,454
First, please promise me

326
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,959
that you will not harm me and my family
under any circumstances.

327
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,588
You dare to strike a deal with me?

328
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,464
No, I am begging you, Your Majesty

329
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,467
to please spare my life.

330
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,761
Go on and tell me.

331
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,681
The secret letter

332
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,809
is in Prince Jeongan's hands.

333
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,938
If that letter is disclosed,

334
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,774
Your Majesty will have to kill me
and my father.

335
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,361
Then who will fight
against Prince Jeongan?

336
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,740
Your Majesty
should install the Crown Prince

337
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,075
before Prince Jeongan
discloses the letter.

338
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,621
Use the letter to keep my father
under Your Majesty's thumb

339
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,373
and exile Prince Jeongan
to someplace outside of Gaegyeong.

340
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,919
I will take care of the letter.

341
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:05,131
What will I get from keeping your father
under my thumb

342
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,008
and ousting Prince Jeongan?

343
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:10,595
Me, Your Majesty.

344
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:16,809
You?

345
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,978
Prince Jeongan used to be
your closest aide,

346
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,980
but he was replaced by my father.

347
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,066
Please let me serve you

348
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,234
by your side.

349
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,238
I will protect your throne with my life.

350
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,120
If the letter is ever disclosed,
our deal will be broken.

351
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,623
I will accept it.

352
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,167
Anyone outside?

353
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,797
You called me in, Your Majesty?

354
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,591
Let Left Second State Councillor
Bae Geuk-ryeom,

355
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,343
Right Second State Councillor Cho Jun,

356
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,178
and Associate State Councilor

357
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,888
Jeong Do-jeon in.

358
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,057
I'll discuss with them

359
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,687
before proclaiming the crown prince.

360
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,580
Halt the plan.

361
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,624
Speak words I can understand.

362
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,501
The original copy of the secret letter.

363
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,837
I know you have it.

364
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,341
Bang-won wouldn't bring
the secret letter to His Majesty.

365
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,760
He will just use it to threaten
his father for a long time.

366
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,470
That's who Bang-won is.

367
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:38,099
You will only get manipulated and ditched
just like you did in Liaodong.

368
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,352
If they find out that you're a spy,
you'll be dead.

369
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,354
I'll be dead either way.

370
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,273
It makes no difference to me.

371
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,985
Just stake it on me.

372
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,113
I'll bring it to His Majesty. And...

373
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,199
I will save both Yeon and you.

374
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,701
Don't play the hypocrite.

375
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:00,329
You're just pretending to help us
to protect your family from extinction.

376
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,457
You just want to have it all.

377
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,876
I'm just trying my best.

378
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,378
You can either denounce me
as a spy or kill me.

379
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,088
It's your choice.

380
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,549
So you go ahead and try your best

381
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,134
just like you said.

382
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,891
Keep an eye on him.

383
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,977
I'll join you with Hwi at the mud hut.

384
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,479
Okay.

385
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,815
Chi-do.

386
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,778
I'm going to kill him.

387
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,783
He killed the mother in front of her kid.

388
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:40,369
And he tried to kill the kid
in front of the mother's dead body.

389
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,747
He's worse than a brute.

390
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,956
Jeong Beom.

391
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,793
Don't worry. I'm not doing it now.

392
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,046
If I kill him now,

393
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,174
I can't get Yeon out.

394
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,430
Mom.

395
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,268
Did I do the right thing?

396
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,981
Please tell me it'll be okay.

397
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,141
Did you...

398
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,144
know all about it?

399
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,732
How could you not tell me

400
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,651
when you knew it was Nam Jeon?

401
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,991
You said you didn't want to lose
a dear one ever again.

402
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,870
I feel the same way.

403
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,750
I already failed
to protect my only friend.

404
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,002
So I wanted

405
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,422
to protect you no matter what.

406
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,484
It's okay.

407
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,987
Everything will be okay.

408
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,083
You did the right thing.

409
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,523
NO ENTRY

410
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,853
How dare you

411
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,855
make me look like the enemy!

412
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,440
That's how

413
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,985
I got you in this game I set up.

414
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,488
And there's no way out now.

415
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,698
I can

416
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,576
simply kill you to get out of it.

417
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,162
Who is it you are after?

418
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,540
Me or Nam Jeon?

419
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,586
Director of the Privy Council,

420
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,005
Nam Jeon.

421
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,725
Why are you after Nam Jeon?

422
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,144
He shoved me off to Liaodong,

423
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,773
and even sent the death squad to kill me.
That's what Nam Jeon did.

424
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,442
You're the only one I can count on

425
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,235
to get rid of Nam Jeon.

426
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,029
That's why I brought you into this.

427
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,324
So you used me for your personal revenge?

428
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,993
There's no way Nam Jeon and I can coexist.

429
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,247
Is it possible for you?

430
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,293
His Majesty

431
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,588
will weigh Nam Jeon and you in both hands

432
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,217
and end up choosing Nam Jeon.

433
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,345
And you will

434
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:54,100
eventually meet your death
outside of Gaegyeong.

435
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,644
Who can...

436
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,654
dare to throw me away?

437
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,906
Who would

438
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,742
dare to ditch me?

439
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,165
Your Highness,
an urgent letter from the palace.

440
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,250
His Majesty commands

441
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,711
the princes, subjects, and officials
of the senior third rank to come to court.

442
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,047
I guess

443
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,300
my game has already begun. No,

444
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,470
I'd like you to go see it for yourself.

445
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,565
The lockout is off.

446
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,316
You may proceed to court.

447
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,610
What did you find out
searching through the place?

448
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,404
We didn't find anything.

449
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,990
We were just ordered
to turn things inside out.

450
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,786
We were ordered to make you feel uneasy.

451
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,344
Lord Nam.

452
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:16,348
Second State Councillors and Executive
Councilors proceeded to court last night.

453
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:20,186
It seems His Majesty has finally
come to his determination.

454
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,441
I'm also

455
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,277
curious about his decision.

456
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,323
Between Bang-won and me,
who will be thrown away?

457
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,949
Or...

458
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,784
both of us?

459
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,126
Hey, Bang-won.

460
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,718
Bang-gan.

461
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,852
I heard even the mutts in your place
are so disciplined, and I guess it's true.

462
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:06,273
Your soldiers seem so vigorous
that His Majesty wants to tackle them.

463
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,902
He can barely sleep wondering
when you'd throw him out.

464
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,289
Please watch what you are saying.

465
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,000
I mean,

466
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,963
my soldiers are about to be
wiped out because of you.

467
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,714
I'll take care of

468
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,841
the issue.

469
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,803
All I want you to do

470
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,930
is stay silent.

471
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,015
I'm telling you

472
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,685
to behave prudently.

473
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,895
Take it easy.

474
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,731
I'm a man of few words.

475
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,778
All right then.

476
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,246
Once he gets stabbed in the back,

477
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,665
he'll be afraid of me.

478
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,172
Proclaiming the crown prince

479
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,425
is setting up the basis of a nation.

480
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,385
And it's the same as laying

481
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,470
the foundation of a millenary dynasty.

482
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,556
Prince Uian.

483
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,266
Yes, Your Majesty.

484
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,103
As a talented warrior
and an outstanding scholar,

485
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,606
you will be able to assist
in this nation's formation

486
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,275
as well as preserve
the Royal Court and the nation.

487
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,236
I hereby announce you as

488
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,572
the new Crown Prince.

489
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,037
Thank you for your boundless generosity.

490
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:46,749
-Thank you for your boundless generosity.
-Thank you for your boundless generosity.

491
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,672
The Royal Family and my vassals,
hear my words.

492
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,594
Serve the young Crown Prince
with nothing but loyalty.

493
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,971
Up until the crowning event,

494
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,349
all crimes except treason,
conspiracy, and murder,

495
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:07,436
will be forgiven regardless
of the gravity of the offense.

496
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,480
Thank you for your...

497
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:14,735
boundless generosity.

498
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,405
As I have shown good faith,

499
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,659
you should disband your private armies

500
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,412
and show gratitude
by washing off your guilt.

501
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,875
If crimes are revealed
to have been committed

502
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,044
even after today's announcement,

503
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,546
I will not show such mercy.

504
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,144
I'm sure this is upsetting for you.

505
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,731
How may I appease your wounded heart?

506
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,111
You were never recognized
as a founding member of this nation,

507
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,988
so how about 500 men from Gabyeolcho?

508
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:00,948
What do you say?

509
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,908
Didn't you order us

510
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,078
to disband our private armies?

511
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,541
The King's men belong to the Royal Court.

512
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,046
How about Commander of Jeolla Province?

513
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,006
Are you chasing me away

514
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:22,052
now that I'm of no use to you?

515
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,346
What?

516
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,472
Your Majesty,

517
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,975
I have always been front and center

518
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,811
in the founding of this nation.

519
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,564
The blood I shed for you

520
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,733
has seeped into my skin like tattoo ink.

521
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,195
"The Crown Prince has been selected,

522
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,906
so I don't need you anymore.

523
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,202
You are to leave Gaegyeong
and preferably die there."

524
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,999
That's what you're saying.

525
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,626
Jeongan--

526
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,752
Your Majesty.

527
00:45:56,962 --> 00:46:00,132
What in God's name did I do so wrong?

528
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,800
I know you.

529
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,846
You crush and trample on
what you can't have.

530
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,891
Won't you do the same
for the Crown Prince title?

531
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,517
You don't know.

532
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,854
You don't know me at all!

533
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,692
I will not back down until I have
what I want. I will not give up either.

534
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:19,735
That is why

535
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,613
I will...

536
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,993
not even take a step out of Gaegyeong.

537
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,002
Your life's dream

538
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,129
has been fulfilled.

539
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,549
Congratulations,

540
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,009
Mother.

541
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,178
I owe it to you.

542
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,181
If he had better brothers,

543
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,725
Uian wouldn't have had a chance
at being a Crown Prince.

544
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,354
It's astonishing

545
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,608
how the Crown Prince
still hides behind his mother's skirt.

546
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,501
Your Highness,

547
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,754
a skirt can't shield you from your enemies

548
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,966
or be the weapon you need. So,

549
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,802
hiding behind it

550
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:13,390
won't do you any good.

551
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,312
How dare you.

552
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,736
Good day, then.

553
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,077
I almost forgot.

554
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,206
You've been promoted to Commander.

555
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:43,337
Enjoy the scenery down south
and be generous to the people.

556
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:51,553
Mother, you make sure
you hold on to the throne tight.

557
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:56,558
Prince Uian might've
taken a seat on it first,

558
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,393
but...

559
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,482
he won't be able to keep it.

560
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,526
He will

561
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,363
as long as I'm alive.

562
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,172
How are you going to handle Bang-won?

563
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,759
Today is a good day.

564
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,680
Worries should be dealt with
some other time.

565
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:37,307
Once the Crown Prince was selected,

566
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,935
you promised to disband private armies

567
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,437
and kill Bang-won.

568
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,357
He is also of royal blood.

569
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,319
One cannot make hasty decisions.

570
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,905
The position of a Crown Prince
is like a candle in the wind.

571
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,534
The people can challenge his authority

572
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,412
and the other princes
will drool over his crown.

573
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,331
We must make a move before Bang-won does.

574
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,709
Can you...

575
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,046
handle what you just said?

576
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,173
I will,

577
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:15,095
so make your move right away.

578
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:17,806
The one

579
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,226
who hesitates will die first.

580
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,608
Is it your plan
to drive me out of Gaegyeong

581
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,070
and have me killed?

582
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,365
I had numerous chances

583
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,451
to take your life.

584
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,831
Even this is one of them.

585
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:49,212
Everyone wishes to kill you
but I will make sure you live.

586
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,673
Go ahead

587
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,675
and take my hand.

588
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:57,220
You're the one who dragged me
to the edge of the cliff,

589
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,932
but now you're telling me
to take it in order to survive.

590
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,775
Do you really think
I'll put my life in your hands?

591
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,993
Nam Jeon has invited you
to the Crown Prince installation ceremony.

592
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,252
Turn him down.

593
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,504
You should attend.

594
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,840
I will now show you
the plan I have laid out.

595
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:34,966
See it unravel

596
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,761
and decide if you want my help.

597
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,496
Come on.

598
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:09,125
Stop staring at him.
Your eyes will pop out at this rate.

599
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,170
Is it because of that name?

600
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,548
Sam-rye, was it?

601
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,802
Was she your wife or your betrothed?

602
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:20,846
My wife.

603
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,184
She was beaten to death

604
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,523
for challenging her master
who tried to rape her.

605
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,904
We had a baby who was still breastfeeding.

606
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,492
It was killed

607
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,619
for crying too loud.

608
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,957
My goodness.

609
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,966
Have you come to?

610
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,595
Jeong Beom, please. You can't kill him.

611
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,388
Then I won't kill him.

612
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,570
I need more investigators.

613
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,363
For what?

614
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:24,326
I will put Nam Jeon under surveillance
and kill him.

615
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,001
It'll take too long.

616
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,466
The key to the Secret Letter Room.

617
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,178
It can unlock all secrets of this world,

618
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,597
so it's far better
than some investigators.

619
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,390
Why are you giving this to me?

620
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,516
There's one condition.

621
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,519
Protect Ihwaru.

622
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,400
When you're in trouble,
Ihwaru will protect you in return.

623
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,904
Are you choosing me as your successor?

624
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,573
You are the only person
who can lead this place.

625
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,494
But I'm a nobody...

626
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,081
Today, the Crown Prince was announced.

627
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,041
There will be chaos.

628
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,793
What actions will you take?

629
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:19,130
Where there's chaos
lies an opportunity for big scores.

630
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,008
I will lower myself, read the situation,

631
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,387
profit on a higher level
with minimum risk.

632
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,392
That is why I choose you.

633
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,652
-Right?
-Goodness.

634
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,237
Here you go.

635
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,199
Have a drink.

636
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,575
Please enjoy.

637
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,745
Let's have a drink.

638
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,496
I am standing,

639
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,332
so who are you to sit there

640
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,752
with your legs crossed?

641
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:43,965
Sit.

642
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,260
I am the current master of this room,

643
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,637
so there's no need
to let a guest get to you.

644
00:55:57,395 --> 00:56:00,315
I'd rather not have a showdown
at a celebratory event.

645
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,276
Please have a seat.

646
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,862
Why did you invite me here?

647
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,532
I need to know so that
I can choose to drink with you

648
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,951
or flip over that very table.

649
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,538
It seems like you're the one
who's been flipped over.

650
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,792
The position of a Crown Prince
is no longer within reach

651
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,503
and you'll soon be stationed
somewhere outside Gaegyeong.

652
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,338
Aren't I right?

653
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,759
Traveling down south
will probably be boring,

654
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,637
so let me provide you
with a feng shui expert.

655
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,182
Have him find a nice spot
where you can rest forever.

656
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,813
Fifth Royal Secretary, watch your words.

657
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,357
He beat Poeun to death, remember?

658
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,485
He could always do the same to you.

659
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,154
Goodness, how terrifying.

660
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,784
Should I?

661
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,161
Go ahead.

662
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,550
Enough!

663
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,558
You just crossed a line.

664
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,352
You're the one

665
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,438
who crossed it first.

666
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,109
My lord!

667
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,781
You must see this.

668
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,858
"An evil subject of Goryeo

669
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,945
lives on as a treacherous subject
in Joseon.

670
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:55,156
How devastating is this?

671
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,910
On November 23, 1380,

672
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,121
one pledged his false loyalty
by shedding the blood of his comrades.

673
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,792
I hereby report
Director of the Privy Council Nam Jeon.

674
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,211
The King...

675
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,805
must...

676
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,815
execute Nam Jeon."

677
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,993
This was your doing.

678
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:43,121
Kneel before His Majesty
and beg for mercy.

679
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,540
Who knows?

680
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,001
He might let you live.

681
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:12,400
Without proof, this appeal
will be nothing but a rumor.

682
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,362
When the time comes,
the proof and witness will be provided.

683
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,905
And when...

684
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,116
is that time?

685
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,118
I will be the one to set the date.

686
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:26,914
His Majesty must see it
at the palace in front of everyone else.

687
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,084
That way, he won't be able to bury it.

688
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,671
How interesting.

689
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,093
Well,

690
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,764
count me in.

691
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,752
Bang-won has the secret letter.

692
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,339
His Majesty will know once day breaks.

693
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,634
If Bang-won tells His Majesty...

694
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,305
Bring Hwi over.

695
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:25,973
Right now!

696
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,860
If Bang-won hadn't stopped you,

697
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,659
would you have killed me?

698
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,744
I knew he was going to.

699
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,914
This was his way of testing me.

700
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,833
Then let me put you to the test too.

701
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,461
Kill Bang-won.

702
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,134
Tonight will be your one and only chance.

703
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:05,471
If he's still alive when day breaks,
it'll all be over.

704
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,390
Me, my family, you,

705
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:08,725
and even...

706
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,768
Yeon.

707
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,564
We'll all be slaughtered.

708
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:19,277
Killing Bang-won is a suicide mission.

709
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:23,072
However, your sacrifice will save Yeon
which should be enough.

710
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:36,419
It's poison.

711
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,213
Dip the tip of your arrow in it.

712
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,550
He will die even if the arrow grazes him.

713
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,180
Mark my words.

714
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:51,476
An assassination by a disgruntled soldier.

715
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,645
That's how Bang-won's death
should be known.

716
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,819
Keep your promise...

717
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,363
regarding Yeon.

718
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,532
I will.

719
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,494
So don't get any ideas.

720
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,748
My man will keep an eye on you.

721
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,251
I shall

722
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,170
oblige.

723
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,202
Round up some of the guards.

724
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:52,954
Once Bang-won dies,

725
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:56,123
we will charge into his residence.

726
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,987
You are holding her hostage
to control Hwi.

727
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:28,656
Now, I understand

728
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,784
why Hwi tried to hide everything from me

729
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,453
and why he seemed so desperate.

730
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,081
Don't tell anyone you came here.

731
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:38,541
Especially not Nam Jeon.

732
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,543
Why are you shaking?

733
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:42,587
Or have you regained your lost memories?

734
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,467
Hwi!

735
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,304
Yeon!

736
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:00,897
You know my name?

737
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:06,569
I bought them in hopes that you
only tread on flowery paths.

738
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,995
Hwi...

739
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,581
My brother.

740
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,862
Your Highness.

741
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:35,074
What is it?

742
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:38,327
I was suspicious,
so I did a background check on Hwi.

743
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,370
And?

744
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,957
According to his records, he has a sister.

745
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,084
So?

746
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,670
That sister is Nam Jeon's hostage.

747
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,426
Nam Jeon's hostage?

748
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:54,802
That's right.

749
01:06:56,637 --> 01:07:00,433
Is eliminating Nam Jeon his goal
or is he working for Nam Jeon?

750
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,728
I will figure it out myself.

751
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,897
Where is

752
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,399
Hwi?

753
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,819
There's something you must see first.

754
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,010
YI BANG-WON

755
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,940
All the red threads are pointing at me.

756
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,692
I am the target.

757
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,861
He has

758
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,948
joined hands with Nam Jeon
in order to kill me.

759
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:41,575
I will reinforce our security
and hunt Hwi down.

760
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,835
I don't care

761
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,379
whatever it is he has anymore.

762
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:57,800
Kill him.

763
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,320
-Chi-do?
-Things have gone sideways.

764
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:21,282
Bang-won was at the hut.
He found everything.

765
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:26,620
You fucking spies!

766
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,608
I will fight them off. Go.

767
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,526
-But Chi-do--
-Go!

768
01:09:58,903 --> 01:09:59,820
Be careful.

769
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,035
Fucking morons.

770
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,436
You gave him the order?

771
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:39,568
The whole world now knows.

772
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,908
In order to save this family,
Bang-won must die

773
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:47,576
and the secret letter must be destroyed.

774
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,537
You did this to save our family?

775
01:10:51,538 --> 01:10:53,207
You only made it worse!

776
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,332
You're actually here.

777
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:03,796
I am.

778
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:05,881
I'm here to kill you.

779
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:51,427
SPECIAL THANKS TO KWAK SUN-YOUNG

780
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:11,321
I remember everything.

781
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:14,616
From the beginning to the end.

782
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,287
So your sister is what started this all.

783
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,122
And the ultimate goal.

784
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:25,335
You promised me you will look after Yeon.
You must keep that promise.

785
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:27,504
I will save you from here, so let's leave.

786
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:31,133
Let's leave this hellhole.

787
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:34,094
Ihwaru sides with no one.

788
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:37,222
It cannot be owned or subdued.

789
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,934
I am now Madame Han of Ihwaru.

790
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:42,519
If that is the dream,

791
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,397
I'd rather not wake up.

792
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:47,024
I promise I'll be back.

793
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:48,108
Leave.

794
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,110
Let's never see each other again

795
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:52,154
in this way.
