1
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,433
THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

2
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,935
SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARACTERS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,533
You crush and trample on
what you can't have.

4
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,495
Won't you do the same
for the Crown Prince title?

5
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,039
You don't know me at all!

6
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,958
I will not back down
until I have what I want.

7
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,419
I will not give up either. That is why

8
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,964
I will not even take a step.

9
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,133
You want me to step down?

10
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,970
A loyal subject
would never suggest such a thing.

11
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,723
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

12
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,059
A battlefield for Nam Jeon and Bang-won.

13
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,311
It's time we need it.

14
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,778
Prince Jeongan wishes to see you,
Your Majesty.

15
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,697
He came all the way here?

16
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,664
EPISODE 12

17
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,957
Right now,

18
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,251
who am I to you?

19
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,839
Am I still just a subject of yours?

20
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,845
Do you want me to answer that as a father

21
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,849
or a king?

22
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,642
Both.

23
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:29,315
To a king, you were a sharp knife
and a thick shield.

24
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,610
But to a father...

25
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,366
you were just

26
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,870
the fifth born son out of eight.

27
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,623
But do not despair.

28
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,376
There is nothing in the world
that does not change.

29
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,296
I loathed you
after what happened with Poeun,

30
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,590
but I will be proud of
what you will do to Nam Jeon.

31
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,176
Who knows? Maybe your contribution

32
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,597
will make you into a Crown Prince.

33
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,891
It was the same with Poeun.

34
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,478
Poeun must die in Goryeo.
"Everyone knows that

35
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,107
but no one is willing to do so."

36
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,525
So it has to be you.

37
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,028
It must be...

38
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,614
you."

39
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,453
I never gave you an order.

40
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,875
It was your choice.

41
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,418
I regret

42
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,964
and resent that decision.

43
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,009
Over and over.

44
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,763
Desperately.

45
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,330
All the blood and tears
that will be shed from here on out

46
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,835
will start from you.

47
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:14,754
So...

48
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,881
Do not regret

49
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,093
or resent it.

50
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,169
You did well.

51
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,402
Cut off the bridge.

52
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,362
Cut off the bridge!

53
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,908
The only path that could lead me
to the King is now cut off.

54
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,203
It will never be reconnected.

55
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,374
Now, what will happen to you and me?

56
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,211
My only goal is destroying Nam Jeon.

57
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,797
Apart from reaching that goal,

58
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,591
I have

59
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,302
no other objective.

60
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,946
Listen to my words!

61
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,573
We were all

62
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,992
born separately

63
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,078
and have been living separate lives.

64
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,914
We all come from different social ranks,

65
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,251
and all of us are here
for different reasons.

66
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,253
However,

67
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,006
we were all abandoned.

68
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,554
Regardless of how it began
and how it will end,

69
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,514
you must survive.

70
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,353
All of you must survive!

71
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,653
That is

72
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,698
my order.

73
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,368
You must survive too.

74
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,332
We'll go to the citadel!

75
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,932
Your Majesty, this is the chief guard.

76
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,768
You may enter.

77
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,775
I had someone tailing Prince Jeongan.

78
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,861
He demolished the bridge
after crossing it.

79
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,074
He demolished the bridge?

80
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,619
I heard he had hundreds
of private soldiers across the bridge.

81
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,208
That means Nam Jeon isn't his only target.

82
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,377
He wants to turn this country upside down.

83
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,882
I will return to the palace immediately.

84
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,258
Yes, Your Majesty.

85
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,110
The sound of the pipe must travel faster
than horses do.

86
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,113
Look at me crawling like this.

87
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,657
Pick up the pace!

88
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,451
We must arrive at the palace
before the day breaks.

89
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:56,744
Yes, Your Majesty.

90
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,371
Pick up the pace!

91
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,044
Halt.

92
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,801
They broke the bridge
to lock in His Majesty.

93
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,638
He's not just after your father.

94
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,224
It's a revolt.

95
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,852
What will you do now?

96
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,146
Both of them must die while fighting.

97
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,691
If one side overpowers
the other completely,

98
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,026
we won't be able to handle it.

99
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,448
Everything from the checkpoint
to the beacon mound is blocked.

100
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,243
All routes from the palace
to the outside world have been cut off.

101
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,664
Is that so?

102
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,792
Then watch carefully from now on.

103
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,962
See how I crush you to pieces.

104
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,219
When a war begins, you first disturb
your enemy's messenger system.

105
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,596
Those scoundrels

106
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,766
want to start a war.

107
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,894
I must go and tell Sambong.

108
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,605
Sambong?

109
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,441
Is he the King?

110
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,613
I devised the plan,
so I will execute it myself.

111
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,866
Issue a royal order

112
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,952
for the princes.

113
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,624
Tell them to come to the palace now
as His Majesty is critically ill.

114
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,959
Are you going to fake a royal order?

115
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,754
Are you sure you can handle
the consequences?

116
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,301
The Crown Prince is supposed to act
as regent during the King's absence.

117
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,804
And it is the Fifth Royal Secretary's job
to deliver the Crown Prince's orders,

118
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,723
so how could you call it fake?

119
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,230
Mobilize your elite unit.

120
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,361
I will greet the princes myself.

121
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,679
Father is sick...

122
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,226
To me, it feels like walking into
a tiger's den.

123
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,853
What about you?

124
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,899
Tonight, I will slay

125
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,529
Sambong and Nam Jeon.

126
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,497
Well, this is exciting.

127
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,126
So, who else is going to die tonight?

128
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,254
-The Crown Prince?
-It could be you.

129
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,048
So tonight,

130
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,592
make sure not to show your back to me,

131
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,886
or try to stab me in mine.

132
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,936
I will kill you.

133
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:10,980
You and me.

134
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,942
We were born from the same mother.
We're brothers.

135
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,195
Trust me.

136
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,366
I trust you,

137
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,744
so you trust me.

138
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,548
Are you coming?

139
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,967
We're looking for justification that

140
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,927
Nam Jeon tried to Kill
Prince Jeongan first.

141
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:46,182
If we gather our men and attack them,
we will be giving them one instead.

142
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,435
Gosh, you and your justification.

143
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,522
The basics of fighting is to attack first

144
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,526
and the basics of war is a sneak attack.

145
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,740
I will guard the Sajeong gate
and meet you at Sunhwabang later.

146
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,745
Give me your flag.

147
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,915
I will fight with you.

148
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,586
I accept.

149
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,266
Did you issue a royal order
to summon the princes?

150
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,187
I will kill them
the moment they enter the palace.

151
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,814
You gave them the cause to revolt.

152
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,610
I cannot revoke an order
that has already been issued.

153
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,819
My lord.

154
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,368
You haven't even begun,
but you already lost.

155
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,163
Were you going to fight me
with such a weak mind?

156
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,207
Don't tell me to revoke the order.
Go and fight.

157
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,500
Slay them all,

158
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,795
and then slay me as well.

159
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,465
After all, wasn't that what you wanted?

160
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,559
From now on,

161
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,645
don't do anything.

162
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,190
All orders will come from me.

163
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,444
If you disobey my orders,

164
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,616
I will slay you.

165
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,221
Are you all right, my lord?

166
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,098
Assemble as many palace guards
as possible.

167
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,643
Half of them will escort Sambong
and the Chief Scholar

168
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,228
all the way to Chwiwoldang.

169
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,606
That will be our last retreat.

170
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,107
The other half

171
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,027
shall assemble in front of Sajeong Gate.

172
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,070
Will you dispatch them out of the palace?

173
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,408
If Bang-won won't enter the palace,

174
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,453
we will leave the palace to kill him.

175
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,878
You are the most capable palace guards.

176
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,963
If I order you to slay someone,
just do it.

177
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,673
Tonight,

178
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,302
you may slay anyone
regardless of their ranks.

179
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,803
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

180
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,485
All gates at the palace

181
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,780
are guarded by palace guards with torches
at all times.

182
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,823
But today, there is no one here.

183
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,078
I'm not sure what to do.

184
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,956
If we don't enter, we'll be accused
of being disobedient sons

185
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,791
and get framed for treason,

186
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,336
but I have a bad feeling about going in.

187
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,421
As they say, elders first.

188
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,839
In times of turbulence,

189
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,801
the strongest one rules regardless of age.

190
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,471
I'll call you my big brother.

191
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,369
We must ask Your Highness
to disarm yourself prior to entering.

192
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,663
I can't keep my sword
when you all have yours?

193
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,581
That is the law.

194
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,833
What if I refuse?

195
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,376
We will slay Your Highness.

196
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,796
Who will slay whom?

197
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,381
You will

198
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,049
slay me?

199
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,051
Yes, we will slay Your Highness.

200
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,428
You wish.

201
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:15,242
Now, they can obviously tell
that I was here.

202
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,421
Well, I'll be in Sunhwabang.

203
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,973
Are you here to stop me?

204
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,434
No, I am here to greet you.

205
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,148
Please enter.

206
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,196
Are you afraid?

207
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,698
Who isn't afraid of swords?

208
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,328
We're all just pretending
not to be afraid.

209
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,038
Both you

210
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,956
and I.

211
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,045
Hey, Park Chi-do.

212
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:13,759
You said that
the Black Snake Unit has never lost.

213
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,927
That is correct.

214
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,595
You also said

215
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,766
that some members of the elite unit
belong to Black Snake.

216
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,606
Unsheathe your swords.

217
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,984
You should not ascend the throne.

218
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,279
You will kill and abandon
countless people.

219
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,948
If a king is afraid of
sacrificing his subjects,

220
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,324
the people

221
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,535
will suffer instead.

222
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,787
You will desert Hwi in the end.

223
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,540
How are you different from my father?

224
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,417
I never

225
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,128
desert my people.

226
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,552
Close the gate!

227
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,821
Relay this to your father.

228
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,916
Nam Jeon,

229
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,460
Sambong, and the meritorious subjects

230
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,004
issued a fake royal order

231
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,965
and summoned the princes to the palace
to assassinate them.

232
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,760
Hence, I, Prince Jeongan,

233
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,180
will kill all you wicked traitors

234
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,392
to punish you for what you did!

235
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,530
Since Bang-won obeyed the royal order,

236
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,741
we can't refute that
he did his duty as a loyal subject.

237
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,620
And because he came to see his ill father
despite the risk of being assassinated,

238
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,331
we also can't refute
that he did his filial duty.

239
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,418
Now, we've become traitors,

240
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,300
and he's been given ammunition
to seize the throne.

241
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,560
Sir, this is all we can do.

242
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,198
I'll go and take care of the guards
around Sunhwabang

243
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,449
and join Hwi.

244
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,743
All right.

245
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,342
The palace guards are assembling
at Sajeong Gate.

246
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,639
He decided to
dispatch the troops after all.

247
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,188
Bang-won is on his way to Sunhwabang.

248
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,649
Before they mobilize
more of their soldiers,

249
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,697
we must kill them all!

250
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,157
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

251
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,080
THE KING IS RETURNING TO THE PALACE

252
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,625
His Majesty is returning to the palace?

253
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,003
They are taking a detour
as the bridge is demolished.

254
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,963
They will take about four hours.

255
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,465
Keep spying on them.

256
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,553
We should tell Hwi.

257
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,971
I'll do it.

258
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,807
Ihwaru will no longer be involved.

259
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,810
From now on,
I'll consider it a personal matter.

260
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,104
So I'll tell him.

261
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,701
The gate is still shut.

262
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,244
Will it ever open?

263
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,706
It will. I promise.

264
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,875
Why? Will something bad happen
if it doesn't?

265
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,960
Come on. Nothing will happen.

266
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,129
We'll just call it a day
and go have some rice wine.

267
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,631
With my dear Hwa-wol.

268
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,467
"One glass of wine for you
and one for me."

269
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,636
Who says you can do that?

270
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,564
His Majesty is returning to the palace.

271
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,656
Only His Majesty can mobilize
the Consolidated Army Command.

272
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,784
If you fail to get it done
before he returns,

273
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,162
you will be the one who suffers.

274
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,338
From now on,
don't deliver letters like this

275
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,298
yourself.

276
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,302
Still,

277
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,889
I'm happy I got to see you.

278
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,684
Goodbye.

279
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,021
I promise you

280
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,109
I will return.

281
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,115
I'll wait for you.

282
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,380
I feel so much better now.

283
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,092
Why the heck did you come here?
What were you thinking?

284
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,269
It's a key for my safe.

285
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,855
If I die, go ahead and open it.

286
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,649
I left you a note inside,
so just follow the instructions.

287
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,942
What an ominous remark.

288
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,028
Why would you die?

289
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,530
I figured now is
my only chance to tell you.

290
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,701
You're crazy about money.
What's gotten into you?

291
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,119
What are you talking about?

292
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,999
I'm crazy about you.

293
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,386
I'll see you in the morning.

294
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,515
I'll make doenjangguk with napa cabbage.

295
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,769
Wait.

296
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,369
Tell everyone to vacate Ihwaru at once.

297
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,121
Only you and I will stay.

298
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,166
Yes, Madame Han.

299
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,278
You guys should go to Sunhwabang.

300
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,571
What about here?

301
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,073
I will stop them.

302
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,492
What the heck are you talking about?

303
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:20,203
How will you fight the palace guards
without us?

304
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,663
I'm the head of the support squad.

305
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,957
Why are you ordering us to leave?

306
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,543
Hwi.

307
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,755
Do you look down on me?

308
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,009
Do you think I'm a joke
because I goof around all the time?

309
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,303
Do you think I'm here because of Bang-won?

310
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,098
I'm here because of you.

311
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,310
Because of you, moron!

312
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,562
Since losing Yeon like that...

313
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,441
I want to make sure you're okay.

314
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,943
I want to make sure you can live.

315
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,286
Go and protect the prince.
That is what you should do.

316
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,038
Whatever. You keep talking bullshit.

317
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,207
Hey!

318
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,293
Let's go together.

319
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,253
To Sunhwabang.

320
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,090
The palace guards aren't coming,

321
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,302
and that palace gate
is completely sealed off.

322
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,262
It won't even budge.

323
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,682
At this rate, we'll all be executed
for treason when the day breaks.

324
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,893
Shut your mouth, you stupid mantis.

325
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,437
Some are lounging around in Sunhwabang

326
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,481
when all of us here
will probably die at this rate.

327
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,149
Don't you think it's so unfair?

328
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,985
The guards and the head of the support
squad must protect the prince.

329
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,362
That's why

330
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,656
we want to protect the prince too.

331
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,369
Let's go to Sunhwabang!

332
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,797
These punks...

333
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,182
It's an order. Do you understand?

334
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,145
My order

335
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,524
is the prince's order.

336
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,069
If you disobey me, I will slay you first.

337
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,417
Back to your ambush positions.

338
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,106
Damn it.

339
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,415
Identify yourself.

340
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,167
Come closer.

341
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,045
Closer.

342
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,882
We'll just run over him.

343
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,769
Send the archers.

344
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,898
Why bring in the archers
when we can't even tell who's who?

345
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,483
Hurry!

346
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,251
Hey!

347
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,383
Do you know why
I've been helping Bang-won?

348
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,636
To shred you to pieces!

349
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,697
Watch out!

350
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,334
Hey, Beom!

351
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,674
-Mun-bok!
-Mun-bok!

352
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,636
Gosh...

353
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,513
Mun-bok!

354
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:18,102
Mun-bok, are you all right?
Why did you do that?

355
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,528
Take Mun-bok to Sunhwabang.

356
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,613
What about you?

357
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,199
I'll stay here to help the injured. Hurry!

358
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,952
Take care.

359
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,078
Mun-bok, let's go.

360
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,747
Mun-bok. Mun-bok! It will be all right.

361
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,790
Mun-bok.

362
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,737
What do we do now?

363
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,956
We're going to Chwiwoldang.

364
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,616
Halt!

365
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,202
Mun-bok.

366
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,004
Hang in there.

367
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,338
There are physicians

368
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,132
in Sunhwabang.

369
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,718
Pull yourself together.

370
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,678
Why do you keep lying down?

371
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,013
Mun-bok!

372
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,767
You can't die.

373
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,448
How many layers
does this breastplate have?

374
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,575
Three.

375
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,369
You rascal...

376
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,413
Are you crying?

377
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,624
You silly punk.

378
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,126
You...

379
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,670
Hey, Jeong Beom. Stop it.

380
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,131
My gosh. Hey.

381
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,510
Jeong Beom! Hey!

382
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,013
Madame Han.

383
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,849
His Majesty is nearing Gaegyeong.

384
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,770
I thought he was going to take
four more hours. How...

385
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,898
He took the shortcut across Mount Bukak.

386
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,376
You should go to the Consolidated Army
Command as soon as we get there.

387
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:32,338
Tell them to assemble
all the troops in and around Gaegyeong

388
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,173
and capture Bang-won.

389
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,008
Those who disobey the royal command

390
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,052
shall be beheaded.

391
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,387
Yes, Your Majesty.

392
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:44,433
Once His Majesty moves the Consolidated
Army Command, all will come to nothing.

393
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,311
-We have to stop it.
-It's dangerous.

394
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,274
If we don't make it through tonight,

395
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,068
Ihwaru will be wiped out anyway.

396
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,613
I'm not going to just sit back
and wait to die.

397
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,323
Madame Han.

398
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,616
Is there

399
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:02,994
any other choice?

400
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,331
I don't see any.

401
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,142
His Majesty is returning to the palace.

402
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,477
We have to hang in there until then.

403
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,737
We're in Gaegyeong, Your Majesty.

404
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,030
Hurry.

405
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,226
Back away.

406
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,741
Your Majesty, shall we make a detour?

407
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,035
It will take a long way.

408
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,247
We should rather wait
until it's burnt out.

409
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,084
Who dares to block my way?

410
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,212
Make sure to find out who it is.

411
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,171
Yes, Your Majesty.

412
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,633
That fire

413
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,095
will save Prince Jeongan.

414
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,740
-Where's Lord Nam?
-He's with Lord Sambong and Lord Sim.

415
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,325
How many soldiers do we have?

416
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,659
About 20.

417
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,702
What about the archers?

418
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,037
We have eight.

419
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,708
Have them on the roofs of the main
building and the servant's rooms.

420
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,419
Don't leave any guards outside
and vacate the front yard.

421
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,962
The spearmen should hide behind trees

422
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,964
and the swordsmen behind the building.

423
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,426
Paint and darken the blades
to conceal them.

424
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,515
We have four hours left before dawn.

425
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,394
If we make it through
until His Majesty returns,

426
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,481
it will show us the way to live.

427
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,355
Your Highness.

428
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,316
In Nam Jeon's villa, Chwiwoldang,

429
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,653
Nam Jeon, Jeong Do-jeon,
and Sim Hyo-saeng are gathered.

430
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,284
Is it the palace or Chwiwoldang?

431
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,956
Do we kill the Crown Prince first?

432
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,000
-or...
-We shall wait.

433
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,254
His Majesty is on his way back
to the palace.

434
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,297
We are all doomed when the sun comes up.

435
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,049
You have to make a choice.

436
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,385
Hwi is guarding against the main force.

437
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,928
If he breaks down,

438
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,972
it will attack our tail.

439
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,016
If you hesitate like that,
we will be destroyed.

440
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,311
We can only win this fight with Hwi.

441
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,188
He's not that important.

442
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,775
Why must you be so stubborn?

443
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,776
Besides, who knows?

444
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,529
He may have run away.

445
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,824
No, let it go.

446
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,786
He will come. I'm sure of it.

447
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,485
Hwi...

448
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,339
I am sorry I am late, Your Highness.

449
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,511
Take charge of the Consolidated
Army Command and Deliberative Council.

450
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:57,890
Go to Chwiwoldang with your soldiers
and hit them.

451
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,061
Nam Jeon is there.

452
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,149
What will our watchword be?

453
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,109
Our watchword shall be...

454
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,032
sanseong.

455
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,376
Who's there?

456
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,587
Those who are armed,

457
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,673
will be slayed

458
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:14,967
regardless of their ranks.

459
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,878
From this moment on,

460
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,257
the Consolidated Army Command
is under my command.

461
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,719
All soldiers will lay down their weapons.

462
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,888
Your weapons will be confiscated.

463
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,848
If you disobey my order,

464
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,144
you will be punished by death.

465
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,230
-Tae-ryeong.
-Yes, Your Highness.

466
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,859
Relay my order
to the Ministry of Rites immediately.

467
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,697
All the officials of this nation
will be summoned before me.

468
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,157
Those who do not attend

469
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,662
will be slaughtered
without any exceptions.

470
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,250
All the blood shed under my orders

471
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,213
will be on my hands and my hands only.

472
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,507
So answer me.

473
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,637
Who dares to

474
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,061
stand against me?

475
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,287
Surround the building.

476
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,405
Enter.

477
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,930
Sambong,

478
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,808
how about a drink?

479
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,102
Sure.

480
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,939
Bring us our drinks.

481
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,423
Make way.

482
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,425
This is the end of your path.

483
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,178
You mustn't even take a step forward.

484
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,973
You cannot be the end of my path.

485
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,144
I will go through you.

486
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,563
My father

487
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,649
must not die by your sword.

488
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,569
Not as a loyal servant
who was sacrificed in a revolt.

489
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,739
He must die while being
resented and cursed upon.

490
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,325
My curse upon him is more than enough.

491
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:57,040
I will kill your father
and take my life here,

492
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,669
so continue along
on the path carved by my blood.

493
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,845
Your blood on top of all the sins
I already have to pay for?

494
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,227
Must you be so cruel?

495
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,146
I think we are

496
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,108
finished.

497
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,525
I know you. Park Chi-do,
leader of the Black Snake Unit.

498
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,861
I know that you will die soon.

499
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,820
It must be my time to die.

500
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,285
Maybe I should greet death myself.

501
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:21,745
My lord!

502
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:23,914
Well,

503
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,919
take care.

504
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,977
Your sword

505
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,274
still feels affectionate.

506
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,973
Fine.

507
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,643
I admit it.

508
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,437
My world?

509
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,525
Yes, you crushed it.

510
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,046
However,

511
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:23,301
I am the beginning
and the end of my world.

512
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,890
So finish me.

513
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,937
It won't end until you do.

514
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,940
It's true that I never expected
any form of apology.

515
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:42,153
Still, how can you be so proud
of your actions?

516
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,074
How?

517
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:50,495
I dreamed of a nation
ruled by the subjects. That's all.

518
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:52,956
And that dream

519
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,876
wasn't one that needed
anyone's permission.

520
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,172
It was solely mine to fantasize.

521
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:03,925
That is why

522
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,428
I am proud of it.

523
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,414
What are you waiting for?

524
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,751
Did you expect me to beg for mercy?

525
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,087
Maybe...

526
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,381
I should lie and ask for forgiveness
that I don't need.

527
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,895
Do it.

528
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,701
It's best not to torture yourself forever

529
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,245
for killing a friend's father.

530
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,290
It's how I lived

531
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,584
after killing Poeun.

532
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,005
The guilt is unbearable.

533
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,759
Where are Sambong and Sim Hyo-saeng?

534
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,290
You did well.

535
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,379
You did...

536
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,348
more than enough.

537
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,515
Stay by his side.

538
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,520
-And the King?
-He has returned to Gaegyeong.

539
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,148
We will ride to the palace.

540
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,996
It's over now.

541
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,331
Let's go, Hwi.

542
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:33,916
Hwi,

543
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,710
we should go.

544
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:39,380
He won't die. He'll survive that wound.

545
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,090
Hwi.

546
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,301
Let's go.

547
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,687
Your Royal Majesty,
His Majesty is on his way to Sajeong Gate.

548
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,439
We're saved then. We should go to him.

549
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,234
Your Royal Majesty,
there was a fire in Songhyeon

550
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:25,236
and blood was shed everywhere tonight.

551
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,904
It is too dangerous to leave.

552
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:30,241
I should be by His Majesty's side.
No one would dare hurt him.

553
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,034
Your Royal Majesty, please.

554
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,328
I'm leaving, and no one shall stop me.

555
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,914
Your Royal Majesty!

556
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:37,915
Your Royal Majesty,

557
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:39,959
it's too dangerous outside.

558
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,839
Why are you so slow? Let's get going!

559
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,926
Pick up the pace. Run!

560
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,473
Crown Prince...

561
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,186
Crown Prince...

562
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,112
Open your eyes.

563
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,911
Why are you

564
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:41,872
lying down on this cold ground?

565
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,501
Why are you so cold?

566
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,133
Crown Prince...

567
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,262
Was it your doing?

568
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:42,266
You killed him.

569
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:47,563
Me?

570
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:52,234
I killed him?

571
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,279
Because of your greed,

572
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:59,116
because you tried to protect
your throne so badly,

573
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,286
you made your children fight each other

574
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,372
and you enjoyed watching it.

575
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,959
And this is the result.

576
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,173
You...

577
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:19,053
killed...

578
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,350
Bang-seok.

579
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,229
You are not a human.

580
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:35,194
If you are,

581
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:40,324
how could you kill your own brother?

582
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:53,754
You will die...

583
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,220
a lonely death...

584
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:05,933
amidst the hatred of everyone.

585
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:26,323
We did what we had to do.

586
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:28,617
You got your revenge

587
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,036
and I started a revolution.

588
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:33,330
I want to see smiles.

589
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:36,125
I want to see you smile and Hui-jae too.

590
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,168
And...

591
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:41,547
Whatever it takes
I will take everything from you.

592
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,882
I will make sure you regret
not killing me.

593
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,886
Regret is just an excuse

594
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,264
for the weak.

595
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:52,182
A man should not be in one's debt.

596
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:54,268
You should pay him back for what you got.

597
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:56,103
Use Bang-gan to take down Bang-won.

598
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:58,272
His Majesty has moved his army.

599
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,941
The chief guard left the palace

600
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:03,527
when the king is still inside?

601
01:12:03,777 --> 01:12:04,987
It's the king's revenge.

602
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,031
He must have sent them to others as well.

603
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:12,494
