1
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,558
THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

2
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,061
SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARACTERS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,158
You're actually here.

4
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,288
I am.

5
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,373
I'm here to kill you.

6
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,207
Your Highness!

7
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,383
Bring the physician. Now!

8
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,068
No.

9
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,361
Why...

10
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,864
Why on earth...

11
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,664
You did not see anything.

12
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,458
If rumors spread,

13
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,086
I will slay you first.

14
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,172
Okay.

15
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,102
Chi-do!

16
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,104
Chi-do!

17
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,940
-Are you all right?
-Chi-do,

18
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,983
what the heck happened?

19
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,570
Where is Hwi?

20
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,423
Why choose this obvious path to death

21
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,843
instead of choosing to live?

22
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,680
Why?

23
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,775
EPISODE 9

24
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,611
An assassin attacked Bang-won.

25
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,239
It is too early to tell,
but he is in critical condition.

26
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,117
-Where is the assassin?
-Tae-ryeong locked him up.

27
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,577
They'll interrogate him soon
to find out who put him up to it.

28
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,371
But the thing is,

29
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,333
your son is locked up with him.

30
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,587
Thanks for your hard work.

31
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,215
Rest now.

32
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,576
What brings you here, my lord?

33
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,870
I heard about what happened
to His Highness.

34
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,621
I must see how he is doing, so make way.

35
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,081
Nothing happened.

36
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,958
Please leave.

37
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,090
To my eyes,
it does not seem to be the case.

38
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,386
I wish to get to the bottom
of what happened.

39
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,471
If you stand in my way,

40
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,390
I will take your life to clear the way.

41
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,959
How is he?

42
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,087
His pulse is barely detectable.

43
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,007
It seems like the poison
has already spread throughout his body.

44
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,175
And?

45
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,928
We should prepare ourselves
for the worst-case scenario.

46
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,681
You may leave.

47
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,495
How did you end up like this?

48
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,458
You looked as if you could
even rip the sky into pieces.

49
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,502
How come you are barely breathing now?

50
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,261
And it seems like

51
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,515
you will stop breathing for good
very soon.

52
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,572
The secret letter will be gone for good
if you are gone.

53
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,909
Who, other than you,
would dare to stand against me?

54
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,376
Is it painful?

55
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,630
I have been struggling my whole life
to get a taste

56
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,549
of the things that you were born to.

57
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,844
I put up with mockery
while cleaning King Woo's palanquin.

58
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,473
I gained His Majesty's trust only after
smearing my hands with my comrades' blood.

59
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,392
Since everything came so easy for you,

60
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,687
there is no way you'd understand
how humiliating that is!

61
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:07,922
History

62
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,842
will despise you for killing Poeun.

63
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,221
And you will die at the hands of
your own soldier and will be laughed at.

64
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,180
So...

65
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,725
listen to my words
while you can still breathe.

66
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,484
I will get the Crown Prince under my thumb

67
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,197
and make sure to become
the real power behind the throne.

68
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,684
Where is the assassin?

69
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,483
Hwi.

70
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,755
Drag him out.

71
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,257
What more do you want?

72
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,301
What more do you want from me?

73
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,597
You know the answer.

74
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,103
No, Father. Please don't.

75
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,148
Let go. Let go of me, you bastards!

76
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,700
You barked well

77
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,624
but didn't bite hard enough.

78
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,795
That is why you are tied
to the leash like this.

79
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,464
Harsh torture awaits you,

80
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,882
and you will end up

81
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,885
saying my name.

82
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,345
That absolutely

83
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,847
will not happen.

84
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,517
"Absolutely," "never," "at all costs,"
and "without fail."

85
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,144
Those are words that I do not trust.

86
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,045
Take your own life.

87
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,060
Just like your father who died
to save you and Yeon,

88
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,064
take your own life to keep Yeon safe.

89
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,917
Father!

90
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,980
Did you do this to my father as well?

91
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,942
Would you believe me if I said no?

92
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,073
Stalling won't change anything.

93
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,790
You promised me

94
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,668
you will look after Yeon.

95
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,214
You must keep that promise.

96
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,841
Everything depends on your decision.

97
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,489
Cry.

98
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,742
Blame me like you have always done.

99
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,745
After all, that is what you are best at.

100
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,483
After I leave for the palace tomorrow,

101
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,903
you shall kill Yeon.

102
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,920
I'll tell the King

103
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,797
that a private soldier
revolted and killed the Prince.

104
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,842
His Highness is not dead.

105
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,969
Will that be the case tomorrow?

106
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,908
Kill Bang-won.

107
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,786
Put this on the arrowhead.

108
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,288
He will die even if the arrow grazes him.

109
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,042
The moment he finds out that you're a spy,
everything will be over.

110
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,504
The moment Nam Jeon orders me
to kill Bang-won,

111
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,506
I will hand the letter to Bang-won.

112
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,342
The letter is evidence of the past,

113
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,594
and I am evidence of the present.

114
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,308
Chi-do.

115
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,561
-Things are not going as planned.
-What do you mean?

116
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,313
Bang-won came to the hut.
He now knows that you're a spy.

117
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,411
I am Nam Jeon's spy.

118
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,581
I truly wished

119
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,083
to take you under my wing

120
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,212
because I liked your archery skills
and your bravado.

121
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,674
That is why I gladly joined your game.

122
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,846
But the objective of the game
was to kill me?

123
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,851
I cannot help

124
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,103
but laugh at myself.

125
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,980
You are not the one

126
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,982
I'm after.

127
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,158
Then who is it?

128
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,882
My sole goal

129
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,885
has always been taking Nam Jeon down.

130
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,637
Nam Jeon?

131
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,693
Is this the original letter?

132
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,500
How can I trust you?

133
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,851
There is a witness.

134
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,563
Nam Jeon, that son of a bitch.

135
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,857
He tried to frame His Majesty...

136
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:14,653
I mean, he tried to frame General Yi
for treason to get him killed.

137
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,906
But because he feared
that he might get caught,

138
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,785
he killed all his comrades instead
and sided with General Yi.

139
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,080
I saw everything with my own two eyes.

140
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,082
Is it true?

141
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,878
How could I dare to lie
in front of Your Highness?

142
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,714
I only did what I was ordered to do.

143
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,009
Your Highness, please spare my life.

144
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,969
I must take your life

145
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,263
because you obeyed such orders.

146
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,103
Why me?

147
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,357
Only through you
can the letter reach His Majesty.

148
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,151
Then why now?

149
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,740
I had to wait until Nam Jeon
gave me the order to kill Your Highness.

150
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,658
I will

151
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,036
tell His Majesty what he ordered me to do.

152
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,374
The letter proves
that he tried to kill His Majesty,

153
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,793
and I am the proof
that he tried to assassinate you.

154
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:13,837
I will

155
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,256
take Nam Jeon down.

156
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,807
But this could cost you your life.

157
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,185
Your Highness will have to die as well.

158
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,694
Why did your arrows

159
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,656
pierce through my chest armor?

160
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,824
I could not have fooled Nam Jeon

161
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,327
by just pretending to shoot you.

162
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,623
After all, that is why

163
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,917
you drank the poison.

164
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,759
Hey, guys.

165
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,928
I'm mad at you, so don't even call me.

166
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,805
I'm sorry
I'm putting you through all this.

167
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,807
What are you waiting for? The liquor.

168
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,729
It's nothing serious.
It's not one of the vital points.

169
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:16,024
Shut up, or I'll rip your mouth out.

170
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,569
Goodness, my fingers are trembling.

171
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,946
I said it's nothing serious.

172
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:30,205
My gosh, this is odd.
Why is the wound already infected?

173
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,332
Hey, here.

174
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,834
-Stop the bleeding first.
-Okay.

175
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,926
Hey, put pressure on this.

176
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,872
History

177
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,750
will despise you for killing Poeun.

178
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,545
And you will die at the hands of
your own soldier and will be laughed at.

179
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,755
So...

180
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,840
listen to my words
while you can still breathe.

181
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,971
I will get the Crown Prince under my thumb

182
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,141
and make sure to become
the real power behind the throne.

183
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,196
This won't kill me.

184
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,700
If I were meant to die,
I would've died a long time ago.

185
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,041
Soldiers on the battleground

186
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,127
try to walk without knowing
they've lost their legs

187
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,880
and try to grab their swords with no arms.

188
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,050
This is

189
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,969
your battleground.

190
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,556
That is why you do not realize
that you have

191
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,267
lost your arms and that you're in pain.

192
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,983
When I got stabbed,

193
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,363
the thought that I might actually die

194
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,784
and wouldn't be able to see Yeon again

195
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,955
truly terrified me.

196
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,128
And it made me think of my father.

197
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,759
He must've been so terrified.

198
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,848
He had to leave me and Yeon behind.

199
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,852
I realized that it must have been

200
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,812
truly heartbreaking.

201
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,283
After I leave for the palace tomorrow,

202
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,869
you shall kill Yeon.

203
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,503
Leave!

204
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,505
I said, leave.

205
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,391
I just need a moment.

206
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,727
I have something to tell her.

207
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,355
Then we will give you 15 minutes.

208
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,454
What is it

209
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,540
that you need to tell me?

210
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,050
If you're not going to say it,

211
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,429
why don't you just do me a favor
since you're already here?

212
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,398
My brother...

213
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,818
Please save him.

214
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,780
I remember everything.

215
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,824
From the beginning

216
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,702
to the end.

217
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,543
I won't ask anything.

218
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,671
Please just save my brother.

219
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,551
Please take pity on him.
You know why you should.

220
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,138
Who else knows about you

221
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,682
regaining your lost memories?

222
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,477
No one else knows.

223
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,439
You mustn't let anyone find out.

224
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,233
I will save you from here, so...

225
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,820
When?

226
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,325
What if Hwi gets hurt?

227
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,951
What if he dies?

228
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,752
-Yeon.
-I will take my life.

229
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,545
If I'm gone,

230
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,841
my brother can live, right?

231
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,096
Your brother, Hwi, is...

232
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,528
Let's leave

233
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,908
when my father heads out
to the palace tomorrow.

234
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,456
Let's leave this hellhole.

235
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:01,805
PRINCE JEONGAN IS ALIVE

236
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,061
So it appears that

237
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,147
he went to kill Bang-won
as per Nam Jeon's order,

238
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,066
but he did not kill him.

239
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,737
He will deceive Nam Jeon

240
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,407
and rescue Yeon later on.

241
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,326
Is Hwi colluding with Bang-won?

242
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,745
What will you do now?

243
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,667
Keep a watchful eye on Bang-won's
residence but be as discreet as possible.

244
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,711
A corpse will be carried out
if there was a murder. Please check.

245
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,339
Send a spy with a physician
to find out what's going on,

246
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,551
but I'd like an update every 30 minutes.

247
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,811
The Queen wants you
to come to the palace immediately.

248
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,821
I still cannot believe
the royal order has been issued

249
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,741
for the installation of Crown Prince.

250
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,201
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

251
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,494
Now, I must protect

252
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,872
what I have obtained.

253
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,790
That is why I summoned you.

254
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,543
In this turbulent time,

255
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,254
I am confined to the Queen's Palace.
It is truly suffocating me.

256
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,633
I wish to see the outside world
through Ihwaru.

257
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,304
You are already seeing
the outside world through me.

258
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,638
It is not enough.

259
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,350
I heard Madame Seol is ill.

260
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,938
Take over her position,
which will become vacant soon.

261
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,732
Make Ihwaru yours

262
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,234
and give it to me.

263
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,652
Madame Seol

264
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,946
is still alive.

265
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,908
We should prepare for what is to come
if she were to pass away soon.

266
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,993
Ihwaru sides with no one.

267
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,330
It cannot be owned or subdued.

268
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,623
You spoiled brat.

269
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:53,958
Have you forgotten?

270
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,920
This isn't about politics. This is a war,
where bloodshed is inevitable.

271
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,172
You won't side with anyone?

272
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,133
Could you still say it
if Bang-won got sole control over it?

273
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,344
At the moment, we should wait
and see how things go.

274
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,431
Do not do anything reckless
as it will only give them ammunition.

275
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,393
Nam Jeon will kill Bang-won.

276
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,314
You can just watch.

277
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,650
I will fight.

278
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,652
The head of Ihwaru

279
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,695
only fights for Ihwaru.

280
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,282
That will never change
no matter who occupies the position.

281
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,577
I took you under my wing

282
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,579
when you had nowhere to go.

283
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,541
Is this how you will repay my kindness?

284
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,876
I came to you of my own accord

285
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,089
and put my life on the line
to repay your kindness.

286
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,221
Make sure

287
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,223
you kill Bang-won.

288
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,600
If you fail,

289
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,312
you will face death.

290
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,147
I wish you

291
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,400
a long, healthy life.

292
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,406
Where will you go if you desert me?

293
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,701
There is nothing you can do without me.

294
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,077
I will make sure

295
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,998
no one can dare to mess with Ihwaru.

296
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,443
My mother

297
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,947
looked after our entire family by herself

298
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,367
while my father was fighting in wars.

299
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,039
She endured all those painful hardships

300
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,042
but passed away before
this new kingdom was founded.

301
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,713
She was given a meager posthumous name
instead of being called the Queen.

302
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,217
The order came from Nam Jeon
and the Queen herself.

303
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:13,181
They hounded His Majesty
to push it through.

304
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:20,188
Why did you spare my life
even though you knew that I was a spy?

305
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,992
Because you remind me

306
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,455
of someone I know.

307
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,042
Who might that be?

308
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,514
I hear you met with the Queen.

309
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,604
The key to the secrets.

310
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,774
I'll accept it.

311
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,861
I am now

312
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,155
Madame Han of Ihwaru.

313
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,131
All desires and secrets of this world

314
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,508
as well as scandals and trickery are here.

315
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,052
Some will only remove one from its post,

316
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,930
but some could ruin an entire family.

317
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,058
Use them wrong,
and they'll harm you instead.

318
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,481
I'll remember that.

319
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,151
Are you going after Nam Jeon?

320
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,695
I'll start with those
who are loyal to him.

321
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,238
And when

322
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,533
Nam Jeon is all alone in this world,

323
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,411
I will make him a mockery and kill him.

324
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,464
Listen.

325
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,007
-Yes, Madame Seol.
-Yes, Madame Seol.

326
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,551
This is my last command,

327
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,054
so be sure to respect it.

328
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,518
What you're holding are weapons
to end those of a ministerial rank.

329
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,314
Leave any traces or rumors
that could lead to you,

330
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,442
and I'll punish you by death.

331
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,612
Now, send out the secrets.

332
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,863
-Yes, Madame.
-Yes, Madame.

333
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,978
Are you saying we should be patient
for now? We might all end up dead!

334
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,439
What happened 20 years ago
was written in detail.

335
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,234
There's no way out of this mess.

336
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,570
This is all because of what Nam Jeon did.

337
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,739
There's the 1380 incident

338
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,741
and he also turned
Prince Jeongan's house around.

339
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,828
If His Majesty finds out,
none of us will live to tell the tale.

340
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,454
Watch what you're saying!

341
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,748
Keeping quiet isn't going to help.

342
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,458
Do you have a way out of this?

343
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,293
We must clean this up.

344
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,171
Whoever sent the letters
is after Nam Jeon anyway.

345
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,006
So to stay alive,

346
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,343
we should bury Nam Jeon?

347
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:40,429
We can't all die so that he can live.

348
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,062
So this will be my last plan of action.

349
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,022
Fetching.

350
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,191
If something happens to me...

351
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,279
Why do you always have
to say such discouraging things?

352
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,363
You shouldn't.

353
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,449
You really shouldn't be this way.

354
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,995
Please rescue my sister safely.

355
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,214
Let's go.

356
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,751
Yeon.

357
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,338
It's all right, Seon-ho.
You've done enough.

358
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,506
Don't say that.

359
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,842
I'm the one they're after.

360
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,386
There's no need for you to get hurt.

361
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,018
Enough!

362
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:37,773
Sorry we're late.

363
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,401
Are you Yeon?

364
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,986
It's nice to meet you.

365
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,530
Yeon, close your eyes.

366
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,951
We're a bit pissed off,
so this might get ugly.

367
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,763
Let's go, Yeon.

368
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,431
Who are you?

369
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,558
Your brother is waiting.

370
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,810
Hwi, I mean.

371
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,864
Is he alive?

372
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,872
Did something happen to Hwi?

373
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,085
No, he's all right. Don't worry.

374
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,212
Please

375
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:42,963
take good care of her.

376
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,469
Go.

377
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,221
Bye, Yeon.

378
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,640
Seon-ho,

379
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,351
will you be all right?

380
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,690
Please...

381
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,778
stay safe.

382
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:11,700
Let's go.

383
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,780
Where's Jeongan?

384
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,701
He wasn't at the coronation ceremony

385
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,744
and didn't even attend the feast.

386
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,872
Is he just petty

387
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,249
of planning something to retaliate?

388
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,925
Crown Prince, approach.

389
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:17,516
This is the sword I wielded
to unfold a new nation.

390
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,520
There have been many swords.

391
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,272
Mine,

392
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,483
the ones that died for me,

393
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,067
and...

394
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,654
the ones aiming at my throat.

395
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,364
Even at this moment,

396
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,576
there are swords aiming for our necks.

397
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,537
With this I give you,

398
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,456
be brave and slit your enemies.

399
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,377
Annihilate those who disobey
this court and nation

400
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:49,632
and those who trifle with us both

401
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,929
to lay the foundation
of an everlasting dynasty.

402
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,601
Who are you to decide
whom that sword belongs to?

403
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,408
What is that you're dressed in?

404
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,954
How dare you ruin
a festive day of this nation!

405
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,302
The Crown Prince
may shed blood of this world,

406
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,180
but you order us to lay down our swords.

407
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,599
That attitude of yours

408
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,977
is why someone made an attempt

409
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,187
on a prince's life.

410
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,733
On your life?

411
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,901
What...

412
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,404
On whose orders?

413
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:57,324
A man who plotted to kill you in the past

414
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,536
also tried

415
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,294
to kill me too.

416
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,051
Director of the Privy Council...

417
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,721
Nam Jeon.

418
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:32,234
Such an accusation requires evidence.

419
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,652
Is there one?

420
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,114
I actually have two.

421
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,643
IHWARU

422
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,108
The original copy of the secret letter
is one.

423
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,110
The other

424
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,781
is the assassin hired by
Director of the Privy Council Nam Jeon.

425
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,285
Enter!

426
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,980
Identify yourself.

427
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,441
I am Hwi of the Seo Family.

428
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,570
I once met you
as Nam Jeon's chaser on a hunt.

429
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:02,783
Continue.

430
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:06,745
Nam Jeon held my sister hostage
to threaten me

431
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,665
and ordered
the assassination of Prince Jeongan.

432
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,752
However, I couldn't do as asked,

433
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,796
so I told Prince Jeongan everything.

434
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,465
It's why I fooled Nam Jeon instead

435
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,677
and found a way for me, my sister,
and Prince Jeongan to live.

436
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,764
That is why I am
the second piece of evidence

437
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,683
and one that still breathes.

438
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,855
Go ahead and refute these accusations.

439
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:40,320
The secret letter is authentic,
but it does not tell the whole truth.

440
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,115
I only pretended to have

441
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:46,452
the same agenda
as those who tried to kill you.

442
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,745
The letter is only a remnant of that.

443
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,539
My loyalty toward you

444
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,708
has always been the same.

445
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,629
Prince Jeongan and this man

446
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,383
are purposely saying lies about me.

447
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,344
The two parties claim
two very different stories.

448
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,139
What does everyone else think?

449
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:14,438
Director of the Privy Council Nam Jeon
has always been vocal

450
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,733
about how Prince Jeongan
is plotting a revolt.

451
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,069
It is why he has insisted on eliminating

452
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,739
the princes born from your former wife.

453
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,745
Isn't that enough evidence,

454
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,538
Your Majesty?

455
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,832
Threatening to kill a royal blood

456
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,752
is the same as aiming the sword at me.

457
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,880
I will interrogate the suspect myself
and get to the truth.

458
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,382
Remove Nam Jeon right now!

459
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,239
I apologize for bringing this up
at a sensitive time,

460
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:09,117
but this happened as soon as
you disbanded private armies.

461
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,913
If our adversaries
plot another attack on us,

462
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,249
how are we supposed to defend ourselves?

463
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,670
That is why I ask you
to revoke your command

464
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,588
and ensure

465
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:26,385
the safety of your relatives
and the court's administrators.

466
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,645
Please reconsider.

467
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,190
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

468
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,914
Nam Jeon has been imprisoned.

469
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,083
The King will soon
interrogate the man himself.

470
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:02,004
It's already coming to an end
which makes it all seem vain.

471
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,716
It has only just begun.

472
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,677
Aiming swords at each other

473
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,179
but then enjoying drinks at night
is what politics is.

474
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,226
Smiling when you've stabbed someone's back
is also what politics is.

475
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,729
So watch carefully from now on

476
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,983
and see how everything unravels.

477
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,347
I doubt you planned this all on your own.

478
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,098
Who are you working for?

479
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,476
It is Sambong.

480
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,269
Do not lie to me.

481
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:02,189
You won't believe that it's Sambong

482
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,443
but you seem sure that I betrayed you.

483
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,862
I will ask you one last time.

484
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,866
Answer me truthfully
and then beg for your life.

485
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:14,910
Who is it?

486
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,543
The guards will listen

487
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,129
and so will the officers of this court.

488
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,048
The order...

489
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,095
came from the Queen.

490
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,020
How dare you!

491
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,336
Is this

492
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,964
what you achieved in the end

493
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,134
for being His Majesty's loyal dog?

494
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,888
Is this all that you achieved after

495
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,726
trampling on my father, me, and my sister?

496
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,686
That...

497
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:29,693
should only be said after I'm dead.

498
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,990
I'm still very much alive though,
so what now?

499
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,210
Do you know
why I didn't kill you with my sword?

500
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,047
Because the pain wouldn't have lasted.

501
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,842
So feel it from now on.

502
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:58,180
A life of misery and mockery
which is worse than dying.

503
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,559
It will be a living hell.

504
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,814
Who will end up in hell

505
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,234
is yet to be decided.

506
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,618
Face the reality.

507
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,038
Your world is over now.

508
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,560
I appreciate your mercy, Your Highness.

509
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,312
You should go.

510
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,606
Your sister must be waiting.

511
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,275
I will leave then.

512
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,657
He was my friend and mentor.

513
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,035
I also thought of him as a father figure.

514
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,704
Him as in

515
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,873
that man you resemble.

516
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,471
I wish you the best, Your Highness.

517
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,342
Dust has piled up everywhere.

518
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,388
They say old habits die hard.

519
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,558
How is it that you haven't changed?

520
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,519
How?

521
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,124
Thank you...

522
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,503
for staying the same.

523
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,507
I'm sorry for what I put you through.

524
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,678
You did well.

525
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,646
I'm sorry...

526
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,326
for not coming sooner.

527
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,996
I'm sorry, Yeon.

528
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,499
I'm sorry.

529
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,439
My gosh.

530
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,900
Did you bring all of this for me?

531
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,860
Not only do you have a pretty face,

532
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,905
but you also have the heart of an angel!

533
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,573
Please enjoy then.

534
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,533
I need to head down soon.

535
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,620
I've always found
a woman who works charming.

536
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,975
It's not bad!

537
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,769
Right? Isn't it good?

538
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:38,853
Yes.

539
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,480
Does Hwi have taste blindness?

540
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,733
He's the type
to even happily chew on rocks.

541
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,068
I heard that.

542
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,196
Right. Well, it's good.

543
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,531
It's so delicious.

544
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,158
It's so good that I feel like I'm flying!

545
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,910
I'll wish for you to drop.

546
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,204
I know you like me.

547
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,956
I like men who are clean.

548
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,334
You know, men with white teeth at least?

549
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,131
It won't be a feast without some drinks.

550
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,676
Here you go.

551
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,637
Uncle Mun-bok,

552
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,474
how did my brother survive out there?

553
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:22,188
Yeon, is the wind visible to you?

554
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,151
How can one see the wind?

555
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,944
Well, your brother is like one.

556
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:29,988
A strong gust of wind.

557
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:33,366
The enemies would encounter him
and lose their hands

558
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,161
without even knowing that it had happened.

559
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,705
Then they'd lose their heads
while looking for their hands.

560
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,914
Stop that.

561
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,876
He means that Hwi fought for his life

562
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,086
just so that he could come home to you.

563
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,339
That's not all.
Remember the captain of the advance party?

564
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:52,177
That jerk threw a hairband into the fire,

565
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,345
but Hwi went all crazy

566
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,849
and shoved his hand in the fire
to retrieve it.

567
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:00,768
The smell of his hand burning
even reached Ming

568
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,646
making their people and Jeong Beom hungry.

569
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,315
Hold on a second.

570
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,109
This.

571
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:09,986
This is the one.

572
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,739
Look how the ends are charred.

573
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,185
Next time, just leave it to burn.

574
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,355
Hairbands can easily be replaced.

575
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,985
But there's only one
of that specific hairband.

576
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,582
Everything feels like a dream.

577
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,544
Failing the state exam,

578
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,671
being dragged off to Liaodong,

579
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,340
and Yeon being held captive.

580
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,719
It's as if I've been living
in a nightmare.

581
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:24,352
Sometimes, I even worry
that I'm still stuck in one.

582
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,105
Not all of them were bad though.

583
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,024
The day we met,

584
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,402
the day we flew the kites,

585
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,529
and this moment

586
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,366
where we're all together again.

587
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,956
It actually could be
one long-lasting sweet dream.

588
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,209
If that is the dream,

589
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,004
I'd rather not wake up.

590
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,423
And then I wish...

591
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,218
to be a part of that dream.

592
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,273
I'll...

593
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,694
wait.

594
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,989
I promise I'll be back.

595
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,950
I won't keep you waiting.

596
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,709
Your Majesty.

597
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,633
It's true.

598
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:21,135
I ordered the assassination of Bang-won.

599
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,222
I already told you

600
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:27,475
that a mother will do whatever necessary
to protect her child.

601
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,812
Do not dare speak so absurdly.

602
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,190
Jeongan is also my son.

603
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,151
Then why do you fear him?

604
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,071
Watch your words.

605
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,531
Because you fear him,

606
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,908
you made Nam Jeon
go up against him instead.

607
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:47,787
Who will it be next once Nam Jeon dies?

608
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,331
If you don't look after your people,

609
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,667
no one will step up for you.

610
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,043
My Queen!

611
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,962
Depose me as well.

612
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:00,466
Depose Crown Prince Uian and throw us out.

613
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,428
Have Jeongan be Crown Prince

614
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,432
and live out your long life
watching this nation burn.

615
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,018
Do you still not get it?

616
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:13,938
Bang-won's sword
will slice through Nam Jeon,

617
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:16,023
kill me and my son,
and head for your throat.

618
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,699
Let Nam Jeon live.

619
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,618
Impossible.

620
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,037
A King's order
takes priority over any law.

621
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,623
This nation is the King's,

622
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,418
so who will dare disobey your order?

623
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,308
I have told you what I must,

624
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,061
so I will now wait for your wise decision.

625
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:27,386
But this happened as soon as
you disbanded private armies.

626
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:30,348
That is why I ask you
to revoke your command

627
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:31,849
and ensure

628
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:36,562
the safety of your relatives
and the court's administrators.

629
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,821
What has Jeongan been up to?

630
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:48,157
After returning to his residence,
he started gathering more soldiers.

631
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,034
Ministers who have been
keeping their distance

632
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:51,828
are now trying to be on his good side.

633
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,210
A feud between the Princes

634
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,756
is what I least want.

635
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,761
I might lose the Queen
and the Crown Prince.

636
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:53,264
Even you...

637
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,518
can't have everything.

638
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:59,854
Even if I save your life,

639
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,564
it's not for your sake.

640
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:05,776
If I kill you, I have to kill
your big brother, the Auditor General,

641
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,446
as well your little brother,
the Grand General.

642
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:10,239
I can't sacrifice the talents

643
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:13,993
because of their foolish brother.

644
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:16,787
A meritorious subject has immunity,

645
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:19,332
so it won't be violating the national law.

646
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,667
Keep your position,

647
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,670
but stay away from the Queen
and the Crown Prince.

648
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,884
And stop standing against Bang-won.

649
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,220
Focus on your duty.

650
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:35,431
Then...

651
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,268
who stands against him?

652
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:44,023
Your son, Nam Seon-ho.

653
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,443
He may be not mature,

654
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:50,363
but he's like his father at a young age.

655
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,782
The feisty therefore fearless man

656
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:55,534
who was full of desire.

657
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,871
It is you that I am talking about.

658
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,416
I gave you a chance.

659
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,586
If you confessed yourself
before the ceremony,

660
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,755
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

661
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:10,299
I know you, your Majesty.

662
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:13,135
Even if I confessed myself then,

663
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,722
my body would have been
shattered in pieces

664
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,350
and hung up all over the country.

665
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:22,895
You...

666
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,066
still don't know me.

667
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,340
He's alive.

668
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:53,843
Your father.

669
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:13,529
Everyone got the letter
about the conspiracy.

670
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:15,197
The source is unknown,

671
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,199
but the content is so detailed...

672
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:19,410
It's Ihwaru.

673
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:25,291
The Madame is having her death throes.
Her end must be near.

674
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:29,503
Get the royal guards ready.

675
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:39,930
The person who turned me in

676
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:42,475
and his sister.

677
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,312
I will kill them.

678
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,938
I will not let you.

679
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:50,900
Tell them to slay everyone
who is in the way.

680
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:54,403
Even if it's my son.

681
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,496
You took Yeon

682
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:05,081
and you killed my people.

683
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,458
What are you waiting for?

684
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,418
Go and tell Hwi.

685
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,505
That he must run far away.

686
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:00,177
What are you doing? Everyone is waiting.

687
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:01,846
I'm coming.

688
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:02,888
Good.

689
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,079
We must escape.

690
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,998
The royal guards are coming.

691
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:30,291
Why would they?

692
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:31,917
My father

693
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,544
was released.

694
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,172
We must hurry.

695
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,132
Seon-ho!

696
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:40,259
We've got this. Run. Now.

697
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,136
Guys, I'll see you there.

698
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:44,221
-Take care.
-Hurry.

699
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,519
Damn it.

700
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,566
Come here.

701
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:13,834
Over there!

702
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,132
Go to the quay.

703
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,842
-I'll see you there.
-Hwi.

704
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,010
Go!

705
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,609
Go. Yeon is waiting.

706
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:22,069
Seon-ho.

707
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:23,237
Leave.

708
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:24,905
And...

709
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:28,158
let's never see each other in this way.

710
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:31,495
Okay.

711
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:33,122
We won't.

712
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:05,779
Two are missing.

713
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:26,467
Hwi.

714
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:15,993
Yeon!

715
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,850
Your nickname is a king with a gat?

716
01:14:39,933 --> 01:14:41,685
There is even a rumor going around

717
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:44,146
that Prince Jeongan will be the next king.

718
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:46,523
You and I are alike.

719
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,859
We both tried to harm our own fathers.

720
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:51,153
You have changed a lot.

721
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:55,991
Yeon has died and Hwi might die too.

722
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:58,160
Your father used poison.

723
01:14:58,243 --> 01:14:59,828
He did not just make you kill yourself.

724
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:02,206
He tried to kill you
in the most painful way.

725
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,624
Okay, Yeon.

726
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,877
I'll stick around a little longer.

727
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:08,629
Just a little longer.

728
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:11,298
We don't know
when Bang-won will attack us again.

729
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:12,925
In the end,

730
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,177
we will all be slaughtered.

731
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,555
