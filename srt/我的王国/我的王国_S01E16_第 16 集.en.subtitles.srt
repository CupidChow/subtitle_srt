THIS DRAMA IS A FICTIONAL STORY
BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

2
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,852
SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARACTERS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,565
FINALE

4
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,360
Slay me.

5
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,239
I've had enough

6
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,826
of your hypocrisy.

7
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,255
You may now rest.

8
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,699
Let him in.

9
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,206
Damn it.

10
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,089
You're here to stop me?

11
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,844
Didn't I say

12
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,015
that I'd kill you too if you tried?

13
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,894
Go ahead then.

14
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,647
Kill me like you killed my father.

15
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,491
How you framed my father

16
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,743
and how you used me...

17
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,163
I will forget all of that.

18
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,167
However, the fact that you saved my life

19
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,877
and the comfort you offered...

20
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,130
I will forget all of that too.

21
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,261
So please let him go.

22
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,973
He is my dearest friend.

23
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,270
Please let me save him.

24
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,690
Don't and consider yourself dead too.

25
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,194
You'll shoot me?

26
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,197
You'll kill me?

27
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,117
This

28
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,287
is where our alliance ends.

29
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:49,938
Go.

30
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,693
Consider it a reward
for your contribution.

31
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,613
Run away

32
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,991
as far as you can.

33
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,519
Why are you making it
so fucking hard to die?

34
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,521
I will keep you alive with all my might.

35
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,774
In fact, we will both stay alive.

36
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,459
Did you

37
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,669
really kill Hwi's father?

38
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,633
I know that I'm hugely indebted to you,
but this is wrong.

39
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,347
Support Squad Commander.

40
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,310
"Support Squad Commander"?

41
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,485
I resign.

42
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,407
Tae-ryeong.

43
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,994
You mustn't slay those

44
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,747
who's unarmed
and who has their back to you.

45
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,569
Don't treat him like a piece of baggage.

46
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,656
Leave him there. I'll take care of it.

47
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,326
Why bother coming here?

48
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,871
You said we should go our separate ways.

49
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,373
We've been in this together
from the get-go,

50
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,749
and we can't cut our ties.

51
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,253
We tried to cut what is unbreakable
and ended up in this mess.

52
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,925
So keep your mouth shut
and just come with me.

53
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,731
Let's go inside.

54
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,399
Okay.

55
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,543
His pulse is strong.
Once again, he'll live.

56
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,253
My gosh.

57
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,256
Was he born with five lives or something?

58
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,591
Is he a nine-tailed fox?

59
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,135
Thanks, Mun-bok.

60
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,930
Thank the gods.

61
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,431
I didn't even do anything.

62
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,560
Boy, my eyes hurt. Hang on a second, okay?

63
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,522
Gosh, my back.

64
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,371
Don't ever lose Seon-ho,
no matter what happens.

65
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:03,000
He was the only one that held our hands
when everyone else treated us like ghosts.

66
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,294
-He and mosquitoes
-"He and mosquitoes

67
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,381
-are the only ones that like you.
-are the only ones that like you."

68
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,222
Don't worry.

69
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,058
I won't lose him.

70
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,663
How's Seon-ho doing?

71
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,290
He just fell asleep.

72
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,377
I brought him here
because I was so worried.

73
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,005
I'll leave with him
as soon as he regains his consciousness.

74
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,800
We won't bother Ihwaru anymore.

75
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,051
Don't worry.

76
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,138
If Bang-won attacks Ihwaru,

77
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,057
I will side with Yi Seong-gye
and send a letter to all the local armies.

78
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,728
Ihwaru is the safest place.

79
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,023
What do you mean?

80
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,651
Kimhwa, Cheolryeong, Yeoncheon,
Anbyon, and Hamhung.

81
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,613
He recently visited all those places.

82
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,449
They're all

83
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,660
where your father's
former subordinates live.

84
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,166
Yi Seong-gye is trying to launch a coup
with the help of

85
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,627
the Northern Punitive Force
and Gabyeolcho.

86
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,046
He was hoping Bang-won would kill you

87
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:34,258
because that would've made
the Northern Punitive Force more furious.

88
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,345
After the installation of Crown Prince,

89
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,930
Bang-won will

90
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,644
kill you and Seon-ho.

91
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,607
You must leave.

92
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,318
Both of you.

93
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,782
There must be another way.

94
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,867
And besides,

95
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,624
I won't go anywhere without you.

96
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,051
Are you all right?

97
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,222
I worry you every single time, don't I?

98
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,103
I'm sorry.

99
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,774
Shall we

100
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,484
go for a walk?

101
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,721
I hope it snows soon.

102
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,308
When we get the first snowfall, let's...

103
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,234
It's cold.

104
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,445
We should head back.

105
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,685
This is our fourth rain together.

106
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,064
You remember that?

107
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,443
The colors of the day when we first met,

108
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,320
the pleasant breeze on that happy day,

109
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,031
and the rain on the day that you left.

110
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,243
Who's the one that remembers all of that?

111
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,001
But I remember everything.

112
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,797
All the colors I saw
on the day I first met you,

113
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,135
the pleasant breeze on that happy day,

114
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,640
and even the rain on the day that I left.

115
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,986
You were

116
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,406
always in my dreams.

117
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,246
Looking back, even all those times
that felt like a nightmare

118
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,206
will be remembered

119
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,960
as a happy dream because of you.

120
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,839
I could get through it

121
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,049
thanks to you.

122
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,023
You'll always be my dream

123
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,819
until my last breath.

124
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,188
I remembered

125
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,358
the day

126
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,488
when you first came to slay me.

127
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,281
It is a memory

128
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,284
that I buried and have erased.

129
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,204
This is what I thought
when I saw you slaying dozens

130
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,914
while running toward me.

131
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,963
"I want to make him mine."

132
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,841
I felt the same way with Hwi.

133
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,266
That guy.

134
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,395
He is my man!

135
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,196
But the thing is,

136
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,408
has he ever been mine?

137
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,327
You are wavering.

138
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,502
You think so?

139
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,755
Nam Seon-ho tried to kill you,

140
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,801
and Seo Hwi helped.

141
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,303
If you spare their lives,

142
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,889
the whole world will laugh at you.

143
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,020
You're indeed the son of Seo Geom.

144
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,646
It sure runs in the blood.

145
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,816
You're just like your father.

146
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,028
Don't you think so, Jeongan?

147
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:16,076
Do you also know that your father was
Prince Jeongan's swordsmanship teacher?

148
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,211
"Dance with your sword.

149
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,258
Soar freely, like a bird."

150
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:38,182
Is that what you want, Your Majesty?

151
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,520
I shall wait

152
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,107
until the installation ceremony is over

153
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,359
to start

154
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,030
the bloodbath.

155
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,257
Don't move.

156
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,015
What happened to...

157
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,725
Don't worry.

158
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,728
I took good care of your friend.

159
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,602
This edict is about
the installation of Crown Prince.

160
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,480
It should be
"Royal Prince Successor Brother,"

161
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,982
but such a title is unprecedented.

162
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,734
Thus, I plan to adopt Jeongan

163
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,778
so that he can be named Crown Prince.

164
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,702
My first,

165
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,872
sixth,

166
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,167
seventh, and eighth sons are already dead,

167
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,002
so I cannot kill them.

168
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,297
And my second eldest son
is now sitting on the throne,

169
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,465
so killing him will not be easy.

170
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,342
Your Majesty.

171
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,428
The third one, Bang-ui,

172
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,931
is not obsessed with power,
but I can still kill him.

173
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,683
And the fourth one, Bang-gan,

174
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,521
will probably die unless he goes ahead

175
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,356
and stamps this royal seal.

176
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,568
King.

177
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,448
Keep your eyes wide open and watch

178
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:05,329
the consequences of you fearing Jeongan,

179
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:11,376
the bloodbath
he will bring upon this kingdom!

180
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,427
Your Majesty should also watch

181
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,139
how I strengthen

182
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,975
this kingdom

183
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,771
for our future generations.

184
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,609
The installation ceremony will take place
in three days.

185
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,947
I hope you can be safe

186
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,575
until then.

187
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,957
I truly do.

188
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,519
Three days...

189
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,162
Thank you for everything.

190
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,364
You must've come to tell me something.

191
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,077
I'd like to meet
the Northern Punitive Force.

192
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,748
I will persuade them to make sure
they are not used by Yi Seong-gye.

193
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,837
That is the only way
Seon-ho, you, and I can survive.

194
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,381
Why are you not asking

195
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,384
the reason I killed your father?

196
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,012
I said I'd forget the past

197
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,431
so there is no reason for me to ask.

198
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,641
I...

199
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,813
submitted an appeal falsely accusing
your father of corrupt deeds. Also,

200
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,649
I bribed the deputy leader
of the Black Snake Unit

201
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,818
to give a false statement.

202
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,570
Stop.

203
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:11,032
I feared the sword of my teacher,
Seo Geom, more than that of Choi Yeong.

204
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,200
That is why

205
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,914
I killed him.

206
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,041
Enough!

207
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,133
Don't kid yourself.

208
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,762
I chose not to kill you
only because I want to protect

209
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,140
those who are dear to me.

210
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,517
It has nothing to do with you.

211
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,563
Then,

212
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,692
hate and resent me!

213
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,613
So that

214
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,783
I can kill you.

215
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,373
I will bring the proof.

216
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,709
You can kill me then.

217
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,171
You'd better come
before the installation ceremony.

218
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,466
It will be useless
if you come after the ceremony.

219
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,384
You must keep

220
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,678
your promise.

221
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,017
So after all,

222
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,479
I failed to make you mine.

223
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,649
In the end,

224
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,818
you won't have anyone's loyalty.

225
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,871
So I have no choice

226
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,086
but to destroy everything?

227
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,807
A secret raid took place,

228
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,809
but no one died?

229
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,436
That is correct, Your Majesty.

230
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,234
The game of Go

231
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,654
is an art comprised
of all kinds of fights, tricks,

232
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,240
compromise, and concession,

233
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,202
but it is impossible
for both players to win.

234
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,628
Stage it as Jeongan's doing

235
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,299
and kill Seo Hwi.

236
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,259
Then,

237
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:41,057
Jeongan will die as well.

238
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,648
We'll meet there
if things don't go according to the plan.

239
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,400
Are you only taking Chi-do?

240
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,110
Why can't we come too?

241
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,323
Jeez, enough.
I'm sure he has a good reason.

242
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:00,035
Why must you step in
and get involved in everything?

243
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,078
Shut up, you moron.

244
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,372
Gosh, look who's talking.

245
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,000
Stop telling me to shut up.

246
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,793
I'm counting on you guys.

247
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,754
All right, don't you worry.

248
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,714
We'll do exactly as we're told.

249
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,216
You guys are going through all of this

250
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,843
because of me.

251
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:17,844
No, don't say that.

252
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,181
We can laugh every day because of you.

253
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,603
You call that laughing?

254
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,676
The birds have stopped chirping.

255
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,428
An ambush.

256
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,245
Seon-ho, what are you doing here?

257
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,206
Yi Seong-gye's guards are tailing you.

258
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,918
Others will arrive shortly.
Let's get out of here first.

259
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,474
The wound looks pretty deep.

260
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,060
I'm used to it.

261
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,940
You can never get used to being wounded.

262
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,067
It hurts every time you get a cut,

263
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,445
and you can't help but scream
when you're stabbed.

264
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,447
It's okay

265
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,909
to scream once in a while
when you're in pain.

266
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,788
Hwi has

267
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,124
so many wonderful people around him.

268
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,670
You're number one among them.

269
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,383
And Hwi is your number one.

270
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,390
General Seo

271
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,435
had asked me to look after Hwi and Yeon.

272
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,940
But I was dragged to the battlefield
the day before his execution.

273
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,444
Hwi and Yeon could endure it all

274
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,780
because you were there for them
in my absence.

275
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,908
Thank you.

276
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,373
You two will fall in love at this rate.

277
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,419
Did you two bond over bad-mouthing me?

278
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,672
You quick-witted punk.

279
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,298
You said I'm slow.

280
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,176
All right, let's peel them.

281
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,681
Damn it, this stupid chestnut.

282
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,352
All right.

283
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,233
I don't trust Bang-won.

284
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,778
To him,

285
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,115
a sword is just a tool
for him to become King.

286
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,201
It's just a piece of steel
he can discard when it breaks.

287
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,914
No one in power keeps their promise
made to a mere sword.

288
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,833
I know that.

289
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,335
However,

290
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,547
"the country for the abandoned."

291
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,342
I want to believe he was sincere about it.

292
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,180
You're gullible
and trust people too easily.

293
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,266
You haven't changed one bit.

294
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,727
You complain but still help out.

295
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,313
You haven't changed at all either.

296
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,169
How many are we going to kill?

297
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,145
Kill them all.

298
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,566
All of them.

299
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,175
Gosh, it's an honor.

300
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,054
You're the great leader of Group A
who will be a government official.

301
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:58,601
And you've come all the way here
to take my mere life?

302
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,051
We're almost there.

303
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,221
It's not a military camp. It's a village.

304
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:40,309
This is the place
where I was planning to teach kids.

305
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,563
I don't think it's a village.
It looks like a fort.

306
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,357
You're quite sharp-sighted.

307
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,317
He should at least be quick witted.

308
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:58,911
Leader.

309
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,705
It's been a long time.

310
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,920
Who are they?

311
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,716
He's Captain Seo's son.

312
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,509
I'm Hwi of the Seo family.

313
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:16,888
Guys.

314
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,931
Look who's here.

315
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,517
He's Captain Seo Geom's son.

316
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:30,234
My gosh. I can't believe this.

317
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,570
I'm so lucky.

318
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,323
I can't believe I'm seeing
Captain Seo's descendant.

319
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,658
Thank you.

320
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,620
Thank you so much for coming.

321
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,959
What did my father do?

322
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:50,171
Captain Seo took in those who got injured

323
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,548
or abandoned during the war.

324
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,301
And they gathered together

325
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,428
and built this village.

326
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,139
This is...

327
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,477
the country of Captain Seo.

328
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,299
Thank you.

329
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,611
We will unite with Gabyeolcho
to kill Bang-won.

330
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,365
We got His Majesty's permission.

331
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,243
His Majesty

332
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,121
is trying to use your anger.

333
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,832
He will convince you that
Bang-won killed me

334
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,001
so you will rise up in rebellion.

335
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,295
Even if we get to kill Bang-won,

336
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,298
I'll eventually be murdered
by His Majesty.

337
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,510
Bang-won knows it too.
We have to hurry and escape--

338
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,428
A surprise attack!

339
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,296
You tough rat.

340
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,924
Do you want to know
how to make tough meat tender?

341
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:02,053
You should cut off
all the tendons you see.

342
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,190
We will take care of things here.
Look after the kids.

343
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,608
I'll fight with you.

344
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,610
Don't worry about us.
Go take care of the kids.

345
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,653
Hurry.

346
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,548
Do you really have to go?

347
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,760
Bang-won broke his promise.

348
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,554
If we don't hurry,
a lot of people might get hurt.

349
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,599
They would need me.

350
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,643
I must help.

351
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,437
Please take good care of yourself.

352
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,107
I'll only become a burden there.

353
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,567
I'll stay here and look after Ihwaru.

354
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,861
Thank you.

355
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,992
Think of Madame Han as me
and take good care of her.

356
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,704
Okay. Don't worry about it. But...

357
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,789
you're pregnant now.

358
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,041
I just can't leave you here alone.

359
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,086
I like a man who's loyal and faithful.

360
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,841
Bo-gum will be proud of you.

361
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,805
Bo-gum,

362
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,391
I'll see you around then.

363
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,937
Bo-gum, I'll take good care of your dad.

364
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,315
There is no need for that.

365
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,985
And take good care of Ihwaru.

366
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,528
Yes, Madame Han.

367
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,574
All right then. Let's get ready.

368
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,543
We won the battle,
but our troops are seriously injured.

369
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,712
We are chasing them with more troops.

370
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,298
What about Hwi?

371
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,675
He's alive.

372
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,520
We're almost there.

373
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,022
Hang in there, guys.

374
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:43,839
What took you so long?

375
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,425
We were worried sick about you.

376
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,928
-Did you see me?
-See what? Dried corvinas?

377
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,013
Will you stop talking about food?

378
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,640
I'm so hungry.

379
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,351
Hwi, you are late.

380
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,853
I was worried to death
something might have happened to you.

381
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,814
Well, if you did
you wouldn't be here right now.

382
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,358
I guess you are right.

383
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,155
By the way, who is this guy?

384
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,574
He's my friend.

385
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,452
I'm Nam Seon-ho.

386
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,622
Well, anyone of Hwi's friend is
a friend of mine.

387
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,211
Let's go, Seon-ho.

388
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,297
Let's go.

389
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,259
Thanks for coming all the way here.

390
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,338
Why did you come here?

391
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,174
What about Ihwaru?

392
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,843
I'm not here as a madam from Ihwaru.

393
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,929
Captain Seo Geom saved my life as well.

394
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,643
Why are things so complicated?

395
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,820
Why are you being like this again?

396
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,031
You don't like the food?

397
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,535
Mun-bok, we have four phoenixes here.

398
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,872
I know. Now that I see the phoenixes,

399
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,375
I miss my wife a lot.

400
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,837
That's enough. Just pick up your spoon.

401
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,589
We're not eating because of you.

402
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,590
Why not?

403
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,134
They say elders first.

404
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,012
You're the oldest one here.

405
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,306
What are you talking about? I'm only 30.

406
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,769
Does that mean you started
your military service when you were ten?

407
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,148
Well. Forget it.

408
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,610
Gosh, it's so good.

409
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,529
The phoenix

410
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,114
is flapping its wings in my mouth.

411
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,700
Eat this too.

412
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,078
You stupid idiot.

413
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,288
I'm just worried you'd burst.

414
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,056
It's so good to eat with you guys.

415
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:42,643
I hope we can do this again next year.

416
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,985
Let's do that.

417
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,112
A year from today,

418
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,614
we will get together again in Ihwaru.

419
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,126
So on this day next year,

420
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,004
we'll be having a feast at Ihwaru?

421
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,422
Yes!

422
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,132
Sweet!

423
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:16,677
You should come too
if you don't want to be worried to death.

424
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,761
Sure.

425
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,703
Why aren't you asleep?

426
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,164
I...

427
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,293
had a realization that a life like this

428
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,171
wouldn't have been so bad.

429
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,968
I always thought
I only had two choices in life.

430
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,889
The worst and the second-worst choice.

431
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:04,933
But

432
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,687
there could've been another.

433
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,901
And I might've knowingly
ignored that option.

434
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,614
If I were you,

435
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,618
I would've only seen
those two options too.

436
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,792
How about an easier life from now on?

437
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,419
One that involves smiling.

438
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:38,926
Anyway, get some sleep.

439
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:36,692
So this is where you were.

440
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:02,426
This bracelet

441
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,220
stands for fate.

442
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,765
Just like you and me.

443
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:33,999
I'll come back to you.

444
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,508
And I'll wait for you.

445
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,899
If you go to Bang-won,

446
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,988
one will have to die.

447
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,453
He must revoke his order.

448
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,706
It's the only way

449
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,250
we can all live.

450
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,377
Am I also one of the people

451
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,296
you wish to save?

452
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,756
Yes.

453
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:08,844
Let's go then.

454
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,143
Liaodong was the last place
I'm making you go alone.

455
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:18,937
I'm coming with you.

456
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,987
Are those tears?

457
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,158
As if.

458
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:54,097
Ten silver ingots to the one
who arrives at the capital first.

459
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,807
Consider that already mine.

460
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,556
The new Crown Prince
will soon be installed.

461
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,893
You can't turn your back
on the Crown Prince.

462
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,854
The ceremony can't be commenced

463
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,940
unless you attend it.

464
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,529
That is my intention.

465
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,114
Father.

466
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,575
As of today, Jeongan

467
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,164
is this nation's Crown Prince.

468
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,083
However,

469
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:10,465
I will not congratulate him.

470
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,973
When guards at the gate change shifts

471
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,017
will be our only window.

472
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,937
All I wanted was to
never worry about starving.

473
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,565
That's all I ever wanted.

474
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,610
But here's how far I've come.

475
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:14,946
Are you scared?

476
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,367
You?

477
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,748
A little.

478
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,459
Only a little.

479
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,617
You're almost there. Seon-ho, get going.

480
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,246
Go.

481
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,466
Come back to us.

482
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,221
Don't you die!

483
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,447
We have an intruder.

484
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:41,741
It's Hwi.

485
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,578
Tae-ryeong.

486
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:46,955
Yes, Your Royal Highness?

487
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,417
Go.

488
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,795
Now!

489
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,907
Without my permission,

490
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,702
no one will take a step past me.

491
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,550
I hoped you wouldn't come.

492
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,218
But then again,

493
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,680
I also wanted you to witness this.

494
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,434
Why did you break your promise?

495
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,980
Why didn't you trust me?

496
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,650
I thought you'd be different.

497
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,779
I didn't think

498
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,909
you of all people
would abandon your people.

499
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,661
A country of the abandoned

500
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,705
can only...

501
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,796
be achieved by sitting on this throne.

502
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,674
Any sacrifice that leads me to it

503
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,346
is mine to endure.

504
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,234
Then let that sacrifice

505
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,195
be yours.

506
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,033
Revoke your order.

507
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,955
Or you will die here, right now.

508
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,009
You truly mean it this time.

509
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,095
My people

510
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,765
along with many others who are innocent...

511
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,102
Leave them be.

512
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,646
Even so,

513
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,110
you will have to die.

514
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,364
Then I will...

515
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,409
gladly.

516
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,713
Then you

517
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:55,049
have saved everyone.

518
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,556
My order!

519
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,105
Consider it revoked.

520
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:30,186
It's all over, Seon-ho.

521
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,868
Let's see.

522
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,163
Could my life

523
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:53,000
be worth about 1,000 nyang now?

524
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,964
All you spew is bullshit.

525
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,426
You...

526
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,847
You shouldn't talk.

527
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,518
I owe you my life.

528
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,522
Consider this as my debt paid.

529
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,941
Says who?

530
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,945
I will make you pay for decades to come.

531
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:28,453
I...

532
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,249
only looked too far ahead

533
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,712
and too high up.

534
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:42,341
When I finally I looked back behind me,

535
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,639
I saw you and Yeon.

536
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:57,148
My country...

537
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,614
was just one step behind me.

538
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:12,330
If only I had known that sooner.

539
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,507
I'm exhausted.

540
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:28,930
I've never been able
to get a good night's sleep,

541
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,685
but I bet I'll sleep like a baby today.

542
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,149
Right.

543
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,903
You should rest now.

544
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:50,243
I'll join you soon.

545
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,705
Take your time.

546
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,627
It's not like I'm going anywhere nice.

547
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,132
Yeon...

548
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,012
I'm glad I'll be able to face her.

549
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,901
I missed you.

550
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:28,906
so...

551
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,244
much.

552
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,716
You're going to cry again.

553
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:36,015
I should've made you laugh more.

554
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,410
You did well.

555
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,026
There, there.

556
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,236
Darling, can I get a bite of that too?

557
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:01,780
Open wide.

558
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:09,371
Goodness. Raising a baby
comes at the expense of your back.

559
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:13,584
You know, I now only have
admiration for all mothers.

560
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:18,422
Raising children is harder
than building a nation. Look at her.

561
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:21,508
Stop whining about
what you should be grateful for.

562
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:22,843
You jerk...

563
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,763
-Goodness, good girl.
-My gosh.

564
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:28,098
She knows you're talking smack
about her father.

565
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,434
Go ahead. Tell him!

566
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:32,186
-My dear--
-There, there.

567
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:37,024
Bo-yeong, when you're hungry,
you should ask for food.

568
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:38,275
There's no use in whining.

569
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:41,612
Jeez, could this be sadder?

570
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,657
There's a reason why one is still single.

571
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,535
I'm seeing someone, you know.

572
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:53,999
You and your bullshit lies.

573
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,710
If Hwi was here,
he'd put an arrow through you.

574
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:59,797
He would've shot another one
through the first one too.

575
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:17,022
Bo-yeong, come to your uncle. Here.

576
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,984
-Go to your uncle.
-Goodness.

577
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:22,945
My gosh.

578
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:23,988
My wrists are liberated.

579
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:25,948
I'm glad you don't take after your dad.

580
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:28,993
Again with the bullshit.

581
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,078
Is that so?

582
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,998
I'm surprised you didn't drop her sooner.

583
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,959
What? Don't you say that.

584
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:04,486
We all have a country we wish to protect.

585
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:10,200
Even though we break, snap, and crumble,

586
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,663
we can't give up on our nation.

587
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,207
It is because that nation

588
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:20,294
is equal to our lives.

589
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:59,786
WE SUPPORT ALL YOUR NATIONS

590
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,206
AND HOPE FOR THEM TO BE FILLED
WITH HAPPINESS AND PEACE

591
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,339
