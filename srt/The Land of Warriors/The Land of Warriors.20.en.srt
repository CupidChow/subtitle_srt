Wu sacrificed both her life and soul.

274
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,610
I'm afraid her body would've perished

275
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,610
without the
Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet.

276
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,570
To think that I expected
something out of this.

277
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
Martial Soul Hall,

278
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,180
you will pay the price.

279
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,530

280
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,220
I can only say
that he's infatuated with her.

281
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,570
Sober up!

282
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,570
I would definitely kill you

283
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,330
if Wu didn't sacrifice herself
to save you.

284
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,940
But she did.

285
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,900
You have to live on.

286
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,370
Since I can retain her body
with the Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet,

287
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,220
I can definitely revive her.

288
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,990
Both of you are
Hectomillennium Soul Beasts.

289
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,290
I'm sure you guys know

290
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,460
how to revive her
after a double sacrifice.

291
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:03,770
We do know.

292
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,770
But it's the same as not knowing.

293
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,530
It's literally impossible.

294
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,770
One has to accomplish many tasks
to revive her.

295
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,700
Each task is extremely difficult.

296
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,020
If not, we wouldn't even need you.

297
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,980
Erming and I could've
revived her ourselves.

298
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,370
I will accomplish them

299
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,850
by hook or by crook.

300
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,220
First, you need to become
a Grand Soul Master.

301
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,770
Only then will you be strong enough
to revive Wu.

302
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,700
I will become stronger.

303
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,050
I will.

304
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,330
Once you become a Grand Soul Master,

305
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,220
you have to gather three kinds of herbs.

306
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,500
The first herb

307
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,850
is Millennium Saint of Soul Herb,
which serves to awaken her consciousness.

308
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,420
Erming and I can

309
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,740
look for it in Xingdou Forest
on your behalf.

310
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,810
The second herb is a precious herb
that can reconstruct her human form for her,

311
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,370
the Thousand Year Nonary Ginseng.

312
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,770
You can seek for it
in the forest of the north.

313
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,700
The third herb

314
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,850
will help combine Wu's flesh body
and her consciousness.

315
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,180
It's the inner core of
an Ancient Spirit Animal Neidan.

316
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,810
However, Ancient Spirit Animal
are very rare.

317
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,020
It depends on your luck.

318
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,850
What about this inner core?

319
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,400
What is this?

320
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,760
This is the inner core
of a Ten-headed Burning Sun Serpent.

321
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,050
I obtained it after killing it

322
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,420
when I was going through Hell's Road
in Netherworld City.

323
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,610
You're so lucky.

324
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,660
We're so lucky.

325
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,940
So, I just need to become
a Grand Soul Master

326
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,330
and find the Thousand Year Nonary Ginseng

327
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,220
to revive Wu, right?

328
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,420
There's one more important thing.

329
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,530
What else is there?

330
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,940
Wu died

331
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,610
because she sacrificed her life
and soul for you.

332
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,050
Therefore, you need to return
the soul bone and soul ring

333
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,260
she created for you.

334
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:04,850
At the same time, you need to
grant Wu the nine soul rings

335
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,290
you obtained as a Grand Soul Master

336
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,740
to awaken her cultivation

337
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,260
and revive her.

338
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,900
By then,

339
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,420
she'll turn into a real human.

340
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,700
But you might become useless.

341
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,130
You might even die.

342
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,660
Can you do that?

343
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,020
I can.

344
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,220
Did you understand
what Erming said just now?

345
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,130
The process is akin
to transferring your martial soul

346
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,850
to Wu.

347
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,020
You will lose your martial soul
and soul rings.

348
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,740
All those years of cultivation
will go down the drain.

349
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,020
Is that even important?

350
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,460
You're a soul master, you know?

351
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,370
She dedicated her entire being
to save me.

352
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,570
I can cast away
all of my cultivation for her.

353
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,310
It's nothing even if I have to

354
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,050
offer my life.

355
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,190
I will never part ways with her again.

356
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,050
Unless I die.

357
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,420
Wu,

358
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,650
all those who had harmed you,

359
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,210
I won't spare any of them.

360
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,340
(I'll find you even if
I have to dig into)

361
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,860
(Earth's core.)

362
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,530
(So, you were hiding here.)

363
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,460
Wu,

364
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,420
This Lucky Fortune Bag
can help one to survive.

365
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,250
I've already prepared a space for you.

366
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,170
You should rest well.

367
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,130
(Human Faced Demon Spider,)

368
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,090
(you shall be the first to pay!)

369
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,530
(Soft-Boned Rabbit
Left Arm Bone Soul Skill,)

370
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,020
(Teleport.)

371
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,420
(Wu, we're fighting
side by side once again.)

372
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,690
(Soft-Boned Rabbit
Left Arm Bone Soul Skill,)

373
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,690
(Invincible Golden Shield.)

374
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,570
What's with that armor?

375
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,700
Did Eight Spider Lances
go through a mutation?

376
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,460
Now, my soul power is at Level 66?

377
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,900
Was it because of

378
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,570
Wu's cultivation and the Human Faced
Demon Spider's cultivation?

379
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,420
It's all my fault.

380
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,460
Master, please punish me.

381
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,090
Even if I execute you now,

382
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,650
I still can't retrieve
the Hectomillennium Soul Ring.

383
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,900
It's my fault!

384
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,650
The Titan Giant Ape and
the Sky Azure Bull Python.

385
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,250
Both of them are
Hectomillennium Soul Beasts

386
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,710
stronger than the soft-boned rabbit.

387
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,690
Master, I'm willing to offer my life
to atone for my mistakes.

388
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,250
I'll do all I can to capture
the two Hectomillennium Soul Beasts.

389
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,450
Preparing for the re-election
of the Seven Clans

390
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,130
is our current priority.

391
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,860
Once everything has settled down,

392
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,250
I'll hunt them myself.

393
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,130
Stay here and reflect upon your actions.

394
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,170
Think about what you've done wrong.

395
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,730
Your Holiness, thank you for sparing me.

396
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,130
I was entirely honest with you.

397
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,090
I don't even know
what you look like or your name.

398
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,210
My name is Tang Yin.

399
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,460
Tang Yin?

400
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,420
Hu Liena!

401
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,420
Wake up!

402
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,210
He Liena!

403
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,900
You saved me once.

404
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,500
Now, I've saved you.

405
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,340
Are we even now?

406
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,650
That's right.

407
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,500
Why am I born into Martial Soul Hall

408
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,090
while you were born into Haotian Sect?

409
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,020
Why?

410
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,420
Tang Yin

411
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,530
is actually Tang San?

412
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,890
Have you straightened out your thoughts?

413
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:41,820
Master,

414
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,610
I was blinded by love.

415
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,460
I knew the person he was,

416
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,960
yet I kept fantasizing about him
and tried to escape reality.

417
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,130
That's why I committed
such a huge mistake.

418
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,210
Do you regret your actions?

419
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,860
No, I don't.

420
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:57,940
Master, I dare not lie to you.

421
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,050
I cannot control my fondness for him.

422
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,650
Even if you give me another chance,

423
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,170
I'll still fall for him.

424
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,980
Therefore, I don't think
it's wrong for me to fall for him.

425
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,530
But it's my fault when I lose myself
and am unable to think

426
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,900
in front of him.

427
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,130
That's my fault.

428
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,150
There's nothing wrong
with falling in love.

429
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,570
No one can escape the grasp of love.

430
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,730
You just have to figure out

431
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,860
what's most important to you.

432
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,980
Only through constant conquest

433
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,130
can one avoid loss.

434
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,130
Master, please don't worry.

435
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,460
He's the person I fancy.

436
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,170
But at the same time,
he's also my enemy.

437
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,860
I won't let my enemy affect my goals.

438
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,300
The re-election of the Seven Great Clans

439
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,730
will be announced soon.

440
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,970
Since you've already
straightened out your thoughts,

441
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,530
you can proceed with your task.

442
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,380
Yes, Master.

443
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,250
Physical training

444
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,820
is the best way to improve
a soul master's determination.

445
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,090
Run!

446
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,250
Keep running!

447
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,130
Do not stop!

448
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:11,460
Run!

449
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,170
All of you!

450
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,380
Don't fall behind!

451
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:16,900
Xiaogang!

452
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:17,800
Don't fall behind!

453
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,610
You can do it!

454
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:19,820
I'll join you!

455
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,460
Come on!

456
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,940
Those at the back, don't fall behind!

457
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,340
Run!

458
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:27,300
Keep running!

459
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,090
Hurry!

460
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,250
Faster!

461
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,570
