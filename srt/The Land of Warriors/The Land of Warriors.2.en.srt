=The Land of Warriors=

2
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

3
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,540
=Episode 2=

4
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:47,910
San.

5
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,830
Thank you for saving my life.

6
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,700
You should leave.

7
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,590
A Hectomillennium Soul Beast
that hasn't reached the Mature Phase

8
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,110
is every soul master's target.

9
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,790
Staying by San's side

10
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,070
is not good for him

11
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,790
and even more dangerous for you.

12
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,900
This place is not far
from Star Dou Forest.

13
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,550
It's the largest soul beast gathering
place on land.

14
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,390
Your aura can be well hidden here.

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
It will be difficult
for the Martial Soul Hall to find you.

16
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,860
When San can protect you

17
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,510
and you've entered the Mature Phase

18
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,900
after breaking through level 60,

19
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,510
it won't be too late to meet again.

20
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,740
You don't oppose us being together?

21
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,620
Your main concern is rather unique.

22
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,180
Of course, I don't oppose it

23
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,230
because this kid is exactly like I was
in the past.

24
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,110
Do you know?

25
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,180
San's mother was like you.

26
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,300
She was also
a Hectomillennium Soul Beast.

27
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,420
He never told me about that.

28
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,740
He doesn't know that.

29
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,070
I'm telling you this

30
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,900
so you know

31
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,300
that when I was with his mother,

32
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,180
my soul power
had already exceeded level 80.

33
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,830
She was also about to enter

34
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,740
the Hectomillennium Soul Beast's
Mature Phase

35
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,300
and become a true human.

36
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,790
Even so,

37
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,700
we still faced many difficulties.

38
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,580
Soul beasts are always at risk

39
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,740
of being hunted and killed
by soul masters.

40
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,140
If you two truly want to be together,

41
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,510
you'll have to become stronger.

42
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,500
All right.

43
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:21,990
I'll leave.

44
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,670
You're truly a wise child.

45
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,890
Maybe you should wait
until he wakes up before you leave.

46
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:31,860
No.

47
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,030
I'm afraid once he wakes,

48
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,150
I will be reluctant to leave.

49
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,740
(San,)

50
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,590
(your father is right.)

51
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,740
(We should first improve on our own)

52
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,550
(and get past this dangerous period.)

San, forgive me.

00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,940
I am unable to keep our promise.

these two kids

91
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,300
are so much like us back in the day.

92
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,490
I have already dispatched soul masters

93
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,540
to find
that Hectomillennium Soft-Boned Rabbit.

94
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,230
Keep a close eye on Shrek Academy.

95
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,900
That's the only place she can go
in the human world.

96
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,230
I doubt that Tang Hao will protect
her forever.

97
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,110
Yes, Your Holiness.

98
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,950
Hu Liena,

99
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,310
Yan, and Xieyue
should be fully recovered by now.

100
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,260
Losing to the Shrek Seven Devils
this time

101
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,740
was not without reason.

102
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,470
Do you know what I mean?

103
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,220
Rest assured, Your Holiness.

104
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,930
Gui Mei and I will ensure they grow stronger
as quickly as possible.

105
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,590
Their training is entirely up to you
for now.

106
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:07,990
Gui Mei,

107
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,590
continue with the task I assigned you.

108
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,260
Those soul masters...

109
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,950
The number is far from enough.

110
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,620
I need more.

111
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,500
Your Holiness,

112
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,470
you've entered the Rakshasa Secret Realm

113
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,470
and changed the cultivation methods
for years.

114
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,690
The number of soul masters required
is also increasing.

115
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,020
If this continues,

116
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,710
it might draw the attention
of the Seven Great Clans.

117
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,240
Who cares about the Seven Great Clans?

118
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,500
I will wipe them out sooner or later.

119
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,900
That Hectomillennium Soul Beast

120
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,860
will become the soul ring
for my second martial soul

121
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,830
helping me ascend to the peak.

122
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,020
Father.

123
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,780
Where's Wu?

124
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,470
Wu...

125
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,380
Wu!

126
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,310
Wu! Wu!

127
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,070
Wu.

128
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,830
Stop looking for her.
She has already left.

129
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,740
That's impossible.

130
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,380
Wu will never leave by herself.

131
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,710
If she doesn't leave,

132
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,070
is she going to stay
and be captured with you?

133
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,140
Did you make her leave?

134
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:13,690
That's not it.

135
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,230
No one can make Wu leave

136
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,710
unless she wants to.

137
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,140
The Martial Soul Hall is pursuing her.

138
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,430
She did it
to avoid bringing trouble to me.

139
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,990
You two seem
to understand each other quite well.

140
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,590
If it were me,

141
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,590
I would do the same.

142
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,190
But it's too dangerous to be on her own.

143
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,380
I must find her.

144
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,020
Please step aside.

145
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,430
Let me go.

146
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,140
I want to find Wu!

147
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,290
How can you protect her

148
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,420
if you can't even withstand
a single strike from me?

149
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,310
Or do you plan

150
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,990
to die with her?

151
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,070
You ambushed me!

152
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,900
I'll give you one more chance.

153
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,470
Is this fair enough?

154
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,470
Or do you think I'm making
it difficult for you on purpose?

155
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,380
A man should face challenges head-on
and let go when needed.

156
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,490
More importantly, face himself honestly.

157
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,110
Recognize your strengths

158
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,710
but confront your shortcomings.

159
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,230
What must I do

160
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,740
to gain your approval?

161
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,140
Do you approve of yourself?

162
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,690
A soul master's duel
is a fight for life and death.

163
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,410
Instead of worrying
about useless things,

164
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,310
why not focus on honing yourself?

165
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,110
Otherwise,

166
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,260
how can you be worthy
of Wu's trust?

167
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,710
She's working hard to improve

168
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,990
and waiting for you
to become stronger and find her.

169
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,380
It's me...

170
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,310
I'm too weak.

171
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,900
As your father,

172
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,860
I'm not against you being together.

173
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,260
But you must have the strength
to protect the one you love.

174
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,590
Only then you are worthy of love.

175
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,620
If you want to find her

176
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,540
and keep her safe,

177
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,230
the only thing you can do
is grow stronger.

178
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,660
Grow stronger...

179
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,780
I will become stronger.

180
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,900
Wu,

181
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,230
I won't let you wait too long.

182
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,900
Are you that anxious?

183
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,470
I must become stronger.

184
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,590
Even if it's just one day sooner,
one hour sooner,

185
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,410
one minute sooner...

186
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,860
Then do as I say.

187
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,950
I've used my soul power
to repair your Eight Spider Lances.

188
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,070
Next, you need to regulate your breath,
heal your injuries,

189
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,140
restore your strength,

190
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,660
and prepare mentally

191
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,470
for the next phase of training.

192
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,780
If I had stayed by your side these years,

193
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,540
perhaps you wouldn't have gone through

194
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,860
so much pain.

195
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,380
San,

196
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,020
do you blame me?

197
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,860
You gave birth to me, raised me,

198
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,600
and even sent me to the academy.

199
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,350
You may have left

200
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,740
after that.

201
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,860
But you're still my father.

202
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,380
You even saved me and Wu this time.

203
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,160
I have no right to blame you.

204
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,780
Are you injured?

205
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,740
I'm fine.

206
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,190
It's just a minor injury.

207
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,990
I'll survive.

208
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,430
I always thought
my father was just a blacksmith

209
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,430
from Spirit Saint Village.

210
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,310
But later, I discovered

211
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,780
he was the legendary Haotian Douluo.

212
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,230
Father,

213
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,070
I want to know...

214
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,020
You don't need to know anything now.

215
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,830
When you finally
become truly strong one day,

216
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,540
I will tell you.

217
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:25,660
All right.

218
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,950
Activate your soul power

219
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,830
so I can check.

220
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,430
Luckily, the injury isn't serious.

221
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,110
Yes, I'll survive.

222
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,380
(Star Dou Forest)

223
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,340
There's danger.

224
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,230
I'm certain

225
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,910
this place is safe.

226
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,910
But I clearly felt

227
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,260
there was danger nearby.

228
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,340
That's not right.

229
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,300
It's not nearby.

230
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,100
How can this be?

231
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,390
I seem to be able to feel
the aura of Wu's soul power.

232
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,260
When Wu left,

233
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,020
your Blue Silver Grass martial soul

234
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,470
released a piece of Blue Silver Grass,

235
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,090
which transformed into a bracelet,
and wrapped around her wrist.

236
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,820
San,

237
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,340
is that you?

238
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,710
I can feel San.

239
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,260
That's great.

240
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,190
She

241
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,260
seems to be safe now.

242
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,710
Father,

243
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,150
we seem to be able
to feel each other's aura.

244
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,580
What exactly is happening?

245
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,430
The Blue Silver Grass may seem ordinary.

246
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,100
But it is the most flourishing force
on the continent

247
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,540
and found all across the continent.

248
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,950
Maybe it unknowingly formed a connection

249
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,580
to relay your messages.

250
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,670
San,

251
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,580
you must cherish this power.

252
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,780
(Wu,)

253
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,890
(please wait for me.)

254
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,190
Father.

255
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,870
Please teach me.

256
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,820
I'm sure you know

257
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,300
how I can become stronger quickly.

258
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,340
Come with me.

259
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,780
(Titan Giant Ape,
Hectomillennium Soul Beast)

260
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,630
Erming,

261
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,100
are you happy to see me?

262
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,950
Wu,

263
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,190
you've finally returned.

264
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,230
There, there.

265
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,780
You're already 100,000 years old
and still tearing up.

266
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,580
Aren't you ashamed?

267
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,950
I'm overwhelmed with joy

268
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,300
because you came back.

269
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,230
You had no idea

270
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,950
how we've been waiting
for you every day.

271
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,060
We wondered if you've eaten,

272
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,470
if you're doing okay,

273
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,090
or if you might need us
to help you fight someone.

274
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,990
Even when we were asleep,

275
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,820
we were still worrying about you.

276
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,060
I'm worried about you too.

277
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,230
Why are you worried about us?

278
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,780
In Star Dou Forest,

279
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,300
no one dares to mess with me and Daming.

280
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,100
I'm only worried
that you two childish fools

281
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,820
might start fighting over fusses.

282
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,300
You're also no match for Daming.

283
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,740
You'll end up getting beaten...

284
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,820
Who says I can't beat him?

285
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,860
With the physical strength

286
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,160
of a hundred thousand years
as the Titan Giant Ape,

287
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,790
I'm not necessarily going to lose.

288
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,060
Daming, did you hear that?

289
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,060
Go ahead and tattle all you want.

290
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,910
We're so far from Star Lake.

291
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,390
I doubt he can hear you.

292
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,190
Is that so?

293
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,340
If it's so far,

294
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,300
how did you know I'm here?

295
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,740
I was asleep just now.

296
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,500
Then suddenly the Blue Silver Grass

297
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,950
on the ground began to move.

298
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,710
I felt something was amiss

299
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,740
so I followed the movement
to check it out.

300
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,230
But I didn't expect to see you.

301
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,540
Blue Silver Grass?

302
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,340
I didn't expect San's bracelet
to be so powerful.

303
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,300
Wu,

304
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,060
you're missing the point here.

305
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,160
This is a Blue Silver Grass bracelet.

306
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,990
A person called Tang San gave it to me.

307
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,910
I've been saying all these

308
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,950
to tell you that we missed you,
and worried about you,

309
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,580
not to talk about Blue Silver Grass
or Tang San.

310
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,780
I don't know who's that.

311
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,540
He's someone important to me.

312
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,540
When the time comes,

313
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,470
I'll introduce him to you guys.

314
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,470
Let's go.

315
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,150
Let's go and meet Daming.

316
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,260
Daming is petty.

317
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,740
If he knew

318
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,780
you cared so much about a human,

319
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,060
he'd be even more upset.

320
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,260
Daming!

321
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,740
Daming!

322
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:53,710
See that?

323
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,430
He's not going to mind you.

324
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,710
Impossible.

325
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,390
His age must be catching up with him
and he has poor hearing now.

326
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,910
Or maybe I wasn't loud enough.

327
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,540
Daming! It's me, Wu!

328
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,060
I'm back!

329
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,390
Daming!

330
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,710
Daming is coming.

331
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,710
It looks like

332
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,190
he's really angry with me.

333
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,870
That's right.

334
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,910
During the first two years,

335
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,470
he was still hoping you would return.

336
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,580
But after that,
he never mentioned you again.

337
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,990
All right, then.

338
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,150
Then I'll take my leave first.

339
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,150
So I don't end up upsetting him.

340
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,470
Wu!

341
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,740
Wu!

342
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,500
Don't leave!

343
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,060
Once you leave the core area,

344
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,670
the other soul beasts will be after you

345
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,780
and you won't make it out alive!

346
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,430
You will lose your life for real!

347
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,300
Forget it.

348
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,780
My life doesn't matter.

349
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,100
I return this time

350
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,290
to see if you're doing well.
That's all that matters.

351
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,710
You and Daming should take care.

352
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,470
I'm taking my leave now!

353
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,710
Daming!

354
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,540
(Sky Azure Bull Python,
Hectomillennium Soul Beast)

355
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,470
The moment you leave,

356
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,390
don't ever come back.

357
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,780
I knew

358
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,540
you couldn't bear for me to leave.

359
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,990
But you left us behind.

360
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,910
But I've come back now, haven't I?

361
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,820
So,

362
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,100
are you still leaving?

363
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,880
You're not leaving anymore, right?

364
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,060
But I'll visit you often.

365
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,060
Since you're leaving,

366
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,710
why come back at all?

367
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,470
Daming,

368
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,740
this journey back

369
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,340
wasn't easy at all.

370
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,100
Please don't be mad at me.

371
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,340
I really missed both of you.

372
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,870
I also miss every little thing
about this place.

373
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,060
Isn't this my home?

374
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,470
You may put it that way.

375
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,710
But in the end, you're still leaving.

376
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,100
Is the human world really better

377
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,230
than Star Dou Forest?

378
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,150
It's different.

379
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,740
Star Dou Forest is where I grew up.

380
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,190
The most important thing is
that both of you are here.

381
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,990
This place can never be replaced.

382
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,390
The human world

383
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,430
is actually quite fun.

384
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,230
There are many interesting things.

385
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,390
What kind of things are they?

386
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,300
They have something called soul coins.

387
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,990
You can use them to exchange for things.

388
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,780
When I first arrived in the human world,

389
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,290
I didn't know anything.
I just grabbed things and walked away.

390
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,870
I almost got arrested thinking

391
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,100
I was a thief.

392
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,340
There are so many delicious foods.

393
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,390
Is that

394
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,470
what kept you attached?

395
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,150
Of course not.

396
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,340
The most important thing

397
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,990
is the people there.

398
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,430
- Who?
- Who?

399
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,230
Wu, tell us.

400
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,780
When I first arrived in the human world,

401
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,780
I went to a place called,
Nuoding Academy.

402
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,580
Hello. My name is Wu,

403
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,590
with "Wu" meaning dance.

404
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,430
I'm a new apprentice.

405
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,250
My name is Tang San.

406
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,100
What's your martial soul?

407
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,990
My martial soul is a rabbit.

408
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,990
My martial soul
is your martial soul's food,

409
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:34,780
Blue Silver Grass.

410
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,470
I won.

411
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,950
From now on, you can call me Wu.

412
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,910
He doesn't talk much.

413
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,710
But he's warm-hearted.

414
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,710
Just like family,

415
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,990
he's patient with me
and takes care of me.

416
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,430
(During those years at Nuoding Academy,)

417
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,580
(we all grew rapidly)

418
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,580
(and became each other's
best companions.)

419
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,540
But everyone says

420
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,000
my Blue Silver Grass
is a Trash Martial Soul.

421
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,900
There's no such thing
as a useless martial soul,

422
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,300
only a useless soul master.

423
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,020
San, you must remember.

424
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,470
You...

425
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,060
♪The wind sways,
trembling the moonlight♪

426
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,220

♪If fate stirs up waves♪

430
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,260
Wu, everyone else went home
for the holiday.

431
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,430
Aren't you going home?

432
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,390
I'm not going home.

433
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,150
How about I come with you
and stay at your place for a few days?

434
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,430
Father.

435
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,230
(I returned to Spirit Saint Village
with him.)

436
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:17,710
Father?

437
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,780
(To my surprise, San's father had left.)

438
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,980
♪I will protect your peace
for a lifetime♪

439
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,220
♪Enduring immense suffering

00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,990

♪Even if I turn into drifting dust♪

442
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,600
(When you read this, I'm already gone.)

443
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:38,338
(Don't look for me.
Take care of yourself.)

444
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,670
(My mother passed away when I was born.)

445
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,990
Father is the only family I have.

446
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,390
Without Father,

447
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,870
this place is no longer my home.

448
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,670
You still have me.

449
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,260
Actually, my mama died
a long time ago too.

450
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,540
If you need family,

451
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,990
I don't mind being your older sister.

452
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,300
Come on, greet me as one.

453
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,600
If you want to be my younger sister,

454
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,540
I have no objection.

455
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,470
No way.

456
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,690
I'll only be the older sister,
not the other way around.

457
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,990
Wu,

458
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,340
I'm asking you a serious question.

459
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,260
I hope you can answer it seriously.

460
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,780
Can you be my younger sister?

461
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,540
I really want

462
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,870
to have my own family.

463
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,780
But listen to me first.

464
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,300
I may not have much.

465
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,990
But I can promise you this.

466
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,190
I will protect you.

467
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,910
I will do everything I can
so you won't get hurt.

468
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,190
But what if one day

469
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,530
there are so many people
who want to kill me,

470
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,500
what will happen
if they're too strong for you to fight?

471
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,380
♪I will travel
through time and space for you♪

472
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,470

00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,940

♪As I wait for the frost♪

480
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,990
Later,

481
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,740
Grandmaster decided to take us

482
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,820
to continue our studies
at what he thought

483
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,190
was the best soul master academy.

484
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,780
(So that's how we ended up)

485
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,740
(at Shrek Academy which specializes
in producing exceptional individuals.)

486
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,910
(Shrek Academy Early Days)

487
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,740
Ancient History?

488
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,020
(Ancient History Academy)

489
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,060
It's all right.

490
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,820
Let's get going.

491
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:09,830
It's all right.

492
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,350
(To be more precise,)

493
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,910
(the early days of Shrek Academy.)

494
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,470
I'm Flander, the Dean.

495
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,910
The Shrek Academy

496
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,620
only accepts
exceptionally gifted talents.

497
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,790
The entrance exam

498
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,700
is for you to withstand Mr. Zhao Wuji's
attack for an hour.

499
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,100
Something to note.

500
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,390
If you fail,
the registration fee is non-refundable.

501
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,140
Sir,

502
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,900
Fatty, Ao, and I are all old students.
Do we still need to take the test?

503
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:31,830
Equal treatment.

504
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,660
If you fail the exam,

505
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,490
it means you've failed in your studies
and will be expelled immediately!

506
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,270
Never say I didn't warn you.

507
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,910
This school is insane.

508
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,660
You can still leave if you want.

509
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,020
Wuji, I'm leaving this to you.

510
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,620
(Zhao Wuji)

511
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,990
(Teacher of Shrek Academy)
Got it.

512
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,500
Let's begin.

513
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,570
I'll be in charge of controlling.
The Support Branch Soul Masters stay behind me.

514
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,290
The Storm Attack Branch
will move forward.

515
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,910
(That was our first time coordinating
in battle.)

516
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,870
If I were to use Mr. Flander's words...

517
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,990
They displayed such good teamwork
right from the start.

518
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,780
They really are
a bunch of little devils.

519
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,750
All right. I'm taking all of them in.

520
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,100
Shrek's lessons weren't held
in classrooms

521
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,910
but in the soul arena.

522
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,430
(Suotuo Soul Arena)
(We registered as the Shrek Seven Devils)

523
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,470
(and began our daily battles.)

524
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,020
(There,)

525
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,060
(we built deep bonds.)

526
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,790
(Soon enough,)

527
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,140
(we made a name for ourselves.)

528
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,270
(Shrek Seven Devils' name attracted)

529
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,780
(Lanba Academy)
(a lot of attention.)

530
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,990
(We followed Grandmaster and the Dean)

531
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,500
(Shrek Academy)
(to Lanba Academy,)

532
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,500
(where I met someone like Mama,
Ms. Erlong.)

533
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,100
(Later,)

534
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,140
(we won)

535
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,180
(the Continental
Advanced Soul Master Academy)

536
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,590
(Shrek Academy)
(Elite Tournament.)

537
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,750
But unexpectedly,

538
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,540
I ended up bringing trouble to everyone.

539
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,790
Bring that girl to me.

540
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,140
How dare they try to harm you?

541
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,140
Where is that Martial Soul Hall?

542
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,140
I will crush them into dust!

543
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,700
Erming, you're too loud.

544
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,830
Wu, ignore him.

545
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,700
Keep going.

546
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,060
What happened next?

547
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,140
Erming, stop being angry.

548
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,140
I'm fine now, am I not?

549
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,060
Luckily, San's father saved me

550
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,390
and I was unharmed.

551
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,910
It's just their luck.

552
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:22,870
No.

553
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,500
It's because San's father

554
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,700
is really powerful.

555
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,580
That's the reason I survived.

556
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,390
San's mother is also
a Hectomillennium Soul Beast.

557
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,310
So his father doesn't oppose us.

558
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,790
He told me
that once I reach the Mature Phase,

559
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,140
I'll be able to meet San.

560
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,270
No, you can't meet him.

561
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,910
You should stay away

562
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,390
from Tang San.

563
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,270
Why?

564
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,910
He's not reliable.

565
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,990
You've already been targeted by humans.

566
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,430
We won't allow you to leave again.

567
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,750
Daming is right.

568
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,140
As long as we're here,

569
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,950
you won't be harmed.

570
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,660
I understand.

571
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,910
But I made a promise to San.

572
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,140
I can't break it.

573
00:37:59,140 --> 00:37:59,910
No.

574
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,620
Absolutely not.

575
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,220
Have you forgotten

576
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,350
who's in charge here?

577
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,270
Speaking of which,

578
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,750
who gave you permission
to address San as someone older?

579
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,390
How old is he anyway?

580
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,990
That's right.
If you address him that way,

581
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,870
what should Daming and I address him?

582
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,700
All right.

583
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,990
You can address him how you want.

584
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,180
With me around,

585
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,700
you won't be taken advantage of.

586
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,860
I can guarantee that.

587
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:44,910
(Father,)

588
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,700
(what makes a soul beast choose
to transform into a human?)

589
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,790
(When a soul beast reaches
100,000 years of cultivation,)

590
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,500
(it faces two choices.)

591
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,750
(One is to endure
the heavenly tribulation.)

592
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,350
(If it fails, it dies.)

593
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,910
(If it survives,)

594
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,500
(it will face)

595
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,020
(another long 100,000 years)

596
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,830
(and the next tribulation.)

597
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,100
(The other option is
to transform into a human.)

598
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:09,660
(Just like Wu?)

599
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,270
(Won't every soul beast choose
this path?)

600
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,620
(But my teacher said
that a Hectomillennium Soul Beast)

601
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,620
(is equivalent to a Titled Douluo
in human terms.)

602
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,590
(But once a soul beast transforms
into a human,)

603
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,890
(its cultivation resets to zero.)

604
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,790
(They have to start from the beginning.)

605
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,060
(Although they don't need
to hunt for soul rings)

606
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,390
(before reaching the Mature Phase,)

607
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,990
(they are still limited
by human lifespans.)

608
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,350
(If they don't break through level 100,)

609
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,470
(they will die just like humans.)

610
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,390
(That's why
most Hectomillennium Soul Beasts)

611
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,830
(won't choose this path.)

612
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,580
(I see.)

613
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,850
(After a soul beast transforms,)

614
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,490
(the first stage before level 60
is called the Immature Phase.)

615
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,200
(and they are still detectable
by Titled Douluo-level soul masters.)

616
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,750
(After reaching level 60,
they enter the Mature Phase.)

617
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,830
(Not even a Titled Douluo)

618
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,830
(can tell their true identity
as a soul beast.)

619
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,220
(At that point,)

620
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,430
(they've truly become human.)

621
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,020
(None of that matters to me.)

622
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,660
(Wu is still Wu to me.)

623
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,690
(No matter what, he will always be
the most precious existence to me.)

624
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,620
(Hidden Valley)

625
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,350
We're here.

626
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,580
(That great battle from years ago
is still fresh in my mind.)

627
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,310
(Many years have passed.)

628
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,700
(Our son has grown so much.)

629
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,830
(Yin,)

630
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,870
(can you see it?)

631
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,220
The Martial Soul Hall
is either after money or people

632
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,690
both openly and secretly.
They are ruthless and domineering.

633
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,740
They're making it hard
for smaller sects like ours to survive.

634
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,470
Exactly.

635
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,830
Before the Haotian Clan had gone
into seclusion

636
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,890
and Haotian Douluo
hadn't disappeared back then,

637
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,610
the Martial Soul Hall would dare
to act this way.

638
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,060
Bah, what Haotian Douluo?

639
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,310
If he didn't kill
the former Supreme Pontiff,

640
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,060
would Bi Bi Dong take over the position?

641
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,420
Ever since the Supreme Pontiff changed,

642
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,300
the Martial Soul Hall's ambitions
have grown bigger.

643
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,290
They've been eyeing
both Heaven Dou and Star Dou.

644
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,100
I fear the Douluo Continent

645
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,790
won't have peaceful days ahead.

646
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,660
Who are you?

647
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,470
Ghost... Ghost Douluo?

648
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,240
You're the Elder
of the Martial Soul Hall.

649
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,790
Do you want to commit violence openly?

650
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,790
You brought this upon yourselves.
