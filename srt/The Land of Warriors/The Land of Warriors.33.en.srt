(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,300
=Episode 33=

4
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,780
If you lose, you lose.

5
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:40,280
It doesn't matter.

6
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,730
No matter?

7
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,220
You said it so casually.

8
00:01:44,316 --> 00:01:46,399
But the one who went undercover
for twenty years

9
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,420
is me.

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,980
Your undercover wasn't for nothing.

11
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,730
Tiandou has suffered a heavy blow.

12
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,140
I only didn't expect

13
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,283
you would lose to Tang San.

14
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,056
I didn't lose to Tang San.

15
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,730
I lost to you.

16
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:04,795
If you were not eager to get rid
of the Tiandou soul master army

17
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:06,747
and forced me to seize power
as soon as possible,

18
00:02:06,748 --> 00:02:09,224
I would have handled all this
more carefully.

19
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,899
I would never

20
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,190
let Tang San have the opportunity
to save Xue Ye.

21
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,229
All grown up,
but still acts like a child.

22
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,829
Do you really think you're still

23
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,719
that child crying out for her mother?

24
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,740
Mother?

25
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,300
I, Qian Renxue, have no mother.

26
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:27,848
Don't tell me you've forgotten,

27
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,780
Your Holiness.

28
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,340
Mother!

29
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,759
Mother, don't send me away.

30
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,109
I will be a good girl.

31
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,690
I promise I will cultivate diligently.

32
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:53,999
Mother,

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,669
it hurts.

34
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,039
Help me.

35
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,250
Bear with it.

36
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,220
If it weren't for your bloodline,

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,370
you don't even deserve this soul bone.

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,370
Can I stay if I overcome this pain?

39
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,690
My face...

40
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:49,549
This soul bone is one
of the Angel's Armor pieces

41
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,650
passed down in Martial Soul Hall
for generations.

42
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,690
It can disguise your martial soul,

43
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,780
appearance, and voice.

44
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,810
The real Xue Qinghe is gone.

45
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,250
From now on,

46
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,690
you are Xue Qinghe.

47
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,439
Mother.

48
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,650
Don't call me that.

49
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:13,069
I will remember that,

50
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,780
Mother...

51
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,060
I mean,

52
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,610
I will remember that,

53
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,580
Your Holiness.

54
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,380
You made me realize

55
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,900
that I never had a mother.

56
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,490
In this world,

57
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,900
I only have one family.

58
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,880
That person is Grandfather.

59
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,580
Your Holiness,

60
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,140
I'll ask Grandfather

61
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,170
for permission to manage the Elder Hall.

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,739
From now on,

63
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,060
we'll divide our powers
and go our separate ways.

64
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,220
At the moment

65
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,090
I realized you saw me as a pawn,

66
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,780
I woke up.

67
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:17,592
Did you think
I spent twenty years going undercover

68
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,490
just to fulfill your plan?

69
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,900
No,

70
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,410
I'm only loyal to myself.

71
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,260
I will make Tiandou

72
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,780
my power.

73
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,490
The moment I take the throne

74
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,900
will be the moment I declare war on you.

75
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:40,600
I may have failed

76
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,140
in taking over Tiandou.

77
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,260
But I still have the Elder Hall.

78
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,380
Don't forget

79
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,820
that Elder Hall

80
00:05:48,204 --> 00:05:50,700
is the true power center
of the Martial Soul Hall.

81
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,220
Those Flamens

82
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,460
are the highest decision-makers.

83
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,530
I won't follow your orders anymore.

84
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,380
Just stay in your place.

85
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:06,504
You're overestimating yourself.

86
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,530
With your current strength,

87
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,410
you want to control the Elder Hall?

88
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,850
Even your grandfather

89
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,260
wouldn't agree.

90
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,730
This confrontation

91
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,595
has revealed Xue Qinghe's true face

92
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,279
and the Martial Soul Hall's conspiracy.

93
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,900
But Tiandou and the Martial Soul Hall
are now at war.

94
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,850
Future struggles

95
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,170
will only be more cruel.

96
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,530
San,

97
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,749
tell us

98
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,580
about your fight with Qian Renxue.

99
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,460
Strong.

100
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:05,700
She's very strong.

101
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,650
We managed to rescue His Majesty

102
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,340
mostly because of luck.

103
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,730
Qian Renxue's

104
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,279
Angel Martial Soul
is incredibly powerful.

105
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,429
I used all my strength

106
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,187
to break through her Angel Domain.

107
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:18,309
If Wu hadn't merged
her consciousness and body

108
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,959
at the critical moment

109
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,970
and fought her,

110
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,340
we would have lost.

111
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,410
Six-winged Angel Martial Soul
and Angel Domain?

112
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,309
I remembered Qian Xunji's martial soul

113
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,848
was also a Six-winged Angel.

114
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,340
Qian Renxue must have inherited
his martial soul.

115
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,460
I once guided her cultivation.

116
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,610
I clearly remember her martial soul

117
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,429
is the Swan Martial Soul
of the Tiandou royal family,

118
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,130
with only five soul rings.

119
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,060
What's going on?

120
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,130
Does

121
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,490
she have Twin Martial Souls?

122
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,580
It's disguise.

123
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,187
It should be

124
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:01,992
the legendary Angel's Armor.

125
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,700
I've never heard of it.

126
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,435
There's finally something
that you don't know.

127
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:10,669
The Martial Soul Hall has kept
these six soul bones for a millennium.

128
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,420
They're known as the Angel's Armor.

129
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,189
Only a soul master
with a Six-winged Angel Martial Soul

130
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,250
can use them.

131
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,940
And all of them

132
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,759
are now on your master?

133
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,300
Yes,

134
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,340
that's why he's so powerful.

135
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,770
Do you know

136
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,039
the soul bone skills
of the Angel's Armor

137
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,610
can provide dual disguises,

138
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,643
changing both appearance and voice

139
00:09:29,644 --> 00:09:31,736
and even disguising the martial soul?

140
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,220
If all six pieces

141
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,340
are used simultaneously,

142
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,940
the boost to one's strength
is unimaginable.

143
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,460
Qian Renxue seems

144
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,119
to have acquired

145
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,940
a soul bone capable of dual disguises.

146
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:48,440
I didn't even know such a skill existed.

147
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,829
I remember Qian Xunji
only had one daughter.

148
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,460
She was announced dead
at the age of nine.

149
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,770
That

150
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,850
was twenty years ago.

151
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,730
If she's still alive,

152
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,371
given her age,

153
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:03,759
her soul power
should have reached level 70 or above,

154
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,220
which is incredibly talented.

155
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,340
When she possesses all six soul bones,

156
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,370
she will have the Angel's Armor

157
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,069
and gain the soul bone armor ability

158
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,460
like San's.

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,850
The increase in power

160
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,890
is something we can't imagine.

161
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,820
With Qian Renxue's talent

162
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,090
and the Angel's Armor,

163
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,730
her future strength

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,580
may rival even Bi Bi Dong's

165
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,250
or even

166
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:32,568
stronger than Bi Bi Dong's.

167
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,752
But obtaining

168
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,090
the Angel's Armor

169
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,940
isn't easy.

170
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,130
It's said

171
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,770
there's a requirement

172
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:47,992
for absorbing the last soul bone.

173
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,010
One must reach level 100 soul power.

174
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,667
In the history of soul masters,

175
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,789
increasing soul power by even one level

176
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,189
after reaching level 90

177
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,403
is extremely difficult.

178
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:14,399
I really don't know

179
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,159
what it's like to go

180
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,700
from level 99 to 100.

181
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,300
I know.

182
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,300
My father's

183
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,970
last opponent

184
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,300
was

185
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,060
a level 99 Grand Soul Master.

186
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,300
After defeating my father,

187
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,460
he admitted

188
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,730
that he had spent 30 years trying

189
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,460
to reach level 100

190
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,090
but found no way.

191
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,660
He said

192
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,490
it isn't just a gap between level 99

193
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,820
and 100

194
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,490
but

195
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,048
an insurmountable chasm.

196
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,820
Level 99?

197
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,176
Who is this Grand Soul Master?

198
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,370
Head Flamen

199
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,580
of the Martial Soul Hall's Elder Hall,

200
00:11:58,988 --> 00:12:00,280
also the core leader

201
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,970
of the Martial Soul Hall,

202
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,220
Qian Renxue's grandfather,

203
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,010
Qian Daoliu.

204
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,660
Grandfather.

205
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,090
You've met her?

206
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,300
Twenty years ago,

207
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:32,940
she sent me to infiltrate Tiandou

208
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,180
as a pawn in her game.

209
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,069
Consider these twenty years
of undercover work

210
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,060
a repayment for her raising me.

211
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,949
I didn't agree with her sending you

212
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,060
to Tiandou

213
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:45,279
because I was worried,
as you were so young.

214
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,010
But I have to admit one thing.

215
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,370
Even though she was a bit rash,

216
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,220
she wasn't wrong.

217
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,669
The position she's holding

218
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,730
isn't easy.

219
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,180
She had to be decisive and firm.

220
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,970
And I want

221
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,850
to be that way too.

222
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:04,970
Grandfather,

223
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:06,619
I wish to follow in your footsteps

224
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,344
and take charge of the Elder Hall.

225
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:14,069
Are you certain of this?

226
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,039
The Elder Hall

227
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,669
isn't as powerful as it used to be.

228
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,730
At present,

229
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,540
Bi Bi Dong has more influence than me

230
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,180
in the Martial Soul Hall.

231
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:26,920
It's a world of the strong,

232
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,940
and whoever is stronger

233
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,300
will have more say.

234
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,069
The Elder Hall

235
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,460
should be supreme.

236
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,420
One day,

237
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,340
I'll make her realize that.

238
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,069
She's your mother, after all.

239
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,970
No, she's not!

240
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,879
She never was,

241
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,999
not now,

242
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,300
not ever!

243
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,420
I will never forgive her.

244
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,060
Taking control of the Elder Hall

245
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,460
is no simple task.

246
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,220
I do not have the final say on

247
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,220
whether you're qualified.

248
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,280
I understand.

249
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:05,700
Grandfather,

250
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:07,700
I must quickly absorb

251
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,940
the second Angel's Armor soul bone.

252
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:12,056
Please make the arrangement for me.

253
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,490
I believe

254
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,850
I will earn its approval.

255
00:14:21,196 --> 00:14:23,208
Our nation has faced great peril.

256
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,610
But thanks to all of you,

257
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,180
who fought to the death,

258
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,010
our country is now safe.

259
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,060
You are all heroes of Tiandou.

260
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:35,239
Imperial Preceptor Yu

261
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,359
and Chief Ning,

262
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,608
please come forward.

263
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,730
In quelling the palace rebellion,

264
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,039
Shrek Academy and the Qibao Amber Sect

265
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,584
have made great contributions.

266
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,060
By the imperial edict,

267
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,429
(Imperial Edict)

268
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,370
Ning Fengzhi will henceforth
be exempt from court bows

269
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,420
and shall assist
Imperial Preceptor Yu Xiaogang

270
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,970
in training the royal soul masters

271
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,460
and commanding
all of Tiandou's soul masters.

272
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,610
Effective immediately,

273
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,010
the Fourth Prince Xue Beng

274
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,300
is crowned Crown Prince of Tiandou.

275
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,220
Qian Renxue has fled Tiandou,

276
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,850
and the Martial Soul Hall's
ambitions know no bounds.

277
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,060
A greater crisis

278
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,940
lies ahead.

279
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,420
For the peace of the continent,

280
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,060
the safety of the people,

281
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,660
and the responsibilities we bear,

282
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,300
Tiandou

283
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,250
must grow stronger.

284
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,940
Tiandou

285
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,060
must win!

286
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,789
Victory for Tiandou!

287
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,709
Victory for Tiandou!

288
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,770
Victory for Tiandou!

289
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,890
Victory for Tiandou!

290
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,340
Old Freak,

291
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,549
Prince Xue Beng is now the Crown Prince.

292
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,759
Are you planning

293
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,429
to stay and continue assisting him,

294
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,730
or are you going back
to your carefree life?

295
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,707
From the way you put it,

296
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,949
is there no place for me
in the Tang Clan anymore?

297
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,429
You want to join the Tang Clan?

298
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,570
The head of the Hall of Medicine's
position has been taken.

299
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,460
Then can I at least be
an honorary elder?

300
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,050
Sure, you can.

301
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,603
I thought you loved your freedom

302
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:24,229
and wouldn't want to join any sect.

303
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,900
I wouldn't join other sects
even if they begged me.

304
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,469
But Little Devil, don't ever think

305
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,100
your sect can get rid of me.

306
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,420
I do enjoy my freedom.

307
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,420
But that was in my younger days.

308
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,900
Now I'm getting old.

309
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,691
It will be hard

310
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:45,224
to advance my soul power now.

311
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,330
I might as well retire in the Tang Clan.

312
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,283
In any case,

313
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:50,824
I'm all good if food and shelter
are provided.

314
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,380
If there are any exciting fights,

315
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,660
call me.

316
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,620
Why sound so pitiful?

317
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:01,800
As long as you're willing,

318
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:03,304
I'll take care of you.

319
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,250
I didn't treat you nice for nothing.

320
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,250
Come.

321
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,140
Let's go back to the Tang Clan.

322
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,180
Let's go!

323
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,620
Soul Arena?

324
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,730
Icebound Forest?

325
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,330
Death Valley?

326
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,810
Netherworld City.

327
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,140
Martial Soul City.

328
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,530
Martial Soul Hall.

329
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,900
Fatty,

330
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:06,749
we're looking for training grounds,

331
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,220
not picking fights.

332
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,140
San,

333
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,919
you progress the fastest

334
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,443
among the Seven Devils.

335
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,119
Where do you think we should train?

336
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,640
We'll just follow your lead.

337
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,860
Qian Renxue once said

338
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:24,168
the Martial Soul Hall's goal
is to dominate the entire continent.

339
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,530
We must rapidly increase our strength

340
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,100
to have any chance
of stopping their plan.

341
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,919
So the usual training methods

342
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,180
won't cut it.

343
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,050
I don't have

344
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,010
any other ideas.

345
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,490
Maybe we should ask the teachers?

346
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,660
No,

347
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,530
they are still recovering

348
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,010
and in seclusion.

349
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,979
We can find some feasible methods

350
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,264
and discuss them
with the teachers later.

351
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,180
Xiang?

352
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,490
Why are you doing such heavy chores?

353
00:19:58,092 --> 00:19:59,220
Let me help you.

354
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,290
Chief.

355
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,900
These books are...

356
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:08,009
These are the ancient texts
and manuals brought by the four tribes.

357
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,749
We haven't had time
to sort them until now.

358
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,879
Since the Tang Clan's expansion
has been completed,

359
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,879
the elders asked me

360
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,832
to organize them into our library.

361
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,970
"The Advanced Soul Master?"

362
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,656
We'll help you sort them out.

363
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,220
Fatty, let's go.

364
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,860
Xiang...

365
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,940
Come on.

366
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,700
Rongrong.

367
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,250
Boss Dai.

368
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,736
All right.

369
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,220
This girl is named Mei.

370
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,770
She has the natural ability
to communicate with animals.

371
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,180
Her parents considered her an outcast

372
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,940
and abandoned her in the forest,

373
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,399
where she was found
by a painter named Shuai,

374
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,768
who brought her home.

375
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,940
One day,

376
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,490
she suddenly disappeared
into one of Shuai's paintings

377
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,290
and was never seen again.

378
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,919
What happened next?

379
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,290
Where's the next volume?

380
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,509
Who did...

381
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,420
Ma Hongjun,

382
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,700
be serious.

383
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,180
I'm looking for training grounds.

384
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,399
(The Advanced Soul Master)

385
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,509
The "Advanced Soul Master" book mentions
that soul masters on Douluo Continent

386
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,251
who want to break through
their bottleneck

387
00:21:30,252 --> 00:21:32,399
should train in environments opposite

388
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,832
to what they're used to.

389
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,730
For instance,
if they've primarily trained on land,

390
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:38,043
they should head to the sea.

391
00:21:38,044 --> 00:21:38,839
What are the odds?

392
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,490
The "Magical Places of the Continent"

393
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,189
mentions a legendary place
called Haishen Island.

394
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,460
The soul masters

395
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,269
on this island

396
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,915
can harness the power of the sea.

397
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,509
It's said to be the perfect place
for land-based soul masters

398
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,719
to surpass their limits.

399
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,639
(The Advanced Soul Master)

400
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,900
Haishen Island?

401
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,420
Do you mean this one here?

402
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:02,989
There really is such a place.

403
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,949
(Haishen Island)

404
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,331
San,

405
00:22:04,332 --> 00:22:05,944
what else is written in the book?

406
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,100
That's all.

407
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,483
On the continent's edge and at sea,

408
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:13,963
there are different soul masters,
called ocean soul masters.

409
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:16,872
But this is the first time
I've heard of Haishen Island.

410
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,736
What do you guys think?

411
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,940
This place sounds interesting.

412
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,380
Did you guys come to help,

413
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,159
or just to get in the way?

414
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,050
No!

415
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,010
I'll do it.

416
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,460
Fatty,

417
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,491
you stay and help Miss Xiang.

418
00:22:36,492 --> 00:22:38,315
You're best suited for heavy lifting.

419
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:39,119
We'll go and train.

420
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,515
Yes.

421
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:39,915
Let's go.

422
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:40,331
Come on.

423
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:40,709
Let's go.

424
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,079
Do you call yourself friends?

425
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,152
How can you leave
when it comes to chores?

426
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:48,312
What are you doing?

427
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,140
Taking off my clothes.

428
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,250
Fatty.

429
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,810
Ao...

430
00:24:08,652 --> 00:24:10,187
It's a shame if Xiang doesn't become

431
00:24:10,188 --> 00:24:12,104
a War Soul Master
when she's this strong.

432
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,715
I'm really innocent.

433
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:18,603
I took off my coat
and wanted to put it on her

434
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:20,509
because I was afraid
she would catch a cold.

435
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,140
This...

436
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,429
I believe you,

437
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,256
my friend.

438
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,770
You might have

439
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,940
the intention.

440
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,091
But you definitely

441
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,079
don't have the guts.

442
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,559
(Tang Clan)

443
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,839
Don't spread rumors.

444
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,709
I wouldn't dare have such intentions.

445
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,119
It's no use if we believe you.

446
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,970
I heard Xiang was heartbroken

447
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,100
and cried a lot last night.

448
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,229
Elder Bai came to San this morning

449
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,851
to ask for an explanation.

450
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:43,700
Although San explained on your behalf,

451
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,250
Elder Bai didn't seem satisfied.

452
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,989
(Tang Clan)

453
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,810
Fatty.

454
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,940
San.

455
00:24:57,068 --> 00:24:58,229
You're in trouble now.

456
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,119
You've started off on the wrong foot

457
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,749
and completely ruined your chances.

458
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,730
No way!

459
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,330
I'm serious about Xiang.

460
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,599
Really?

461
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,330
Yes!

462
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,220
(Tang Clan)

463
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,100
All right, then!

464
00:25:20,508 --> 00:25:21,189
Grandfather,

465
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,989
stop trying to match me with him.

466
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,051
It's not my concern
whether he's sincere or not.

467
00:25:25,052 --> 00:25:26,779
Last night was just a misunderstanding.

468
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,399
You can't use it as an excuse to...

469
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,900
Of course not.

470
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,919
I only saw that you and Ma

471
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,709
were getting along well.

472
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,989
I can tell

473
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,509
Ma genuinely likes you.

474
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,140
Why not give it a try?

475
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,269
I don't care
if he really likes me or not.

476
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,860
I don't like him!

477
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,050
Don't make up your mind so quickly.

478
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,050
I think Ma is quite good.

479
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,570
You can give it some thought.

480
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,304
What's so good about him?

481
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,530
His martial soul?

482
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,770
I know what you're thinking.

483
00:25:57,852 --> 00:25:59,559
Even if he has a Phoenix Martial Soul,

484
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,208
I, Bai Chenxiang, don't care.

485
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,420
What are you saying?

486
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,119
Do you think

487
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,530
I'm that shallow?

488
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,050
You're not shallow.

489
00:26:09,052 --> 00:26:11,469
You just admire
his top-notch Phoenix Martial Soul.

490
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,749
You wish everyone

491
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,639
in the Tribe of Agility could have it.

492
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,250
You...

493
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,900
Your words

494
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,140
are breaking my heart.

495
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,460
You're right.

496
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,570
I appreciate his martial soul.

497
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,700
And I admit,

498
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,010
if his martial soul

499
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,660
could be passed down
to our Tribe of Agility,

500
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,860
we would never be bullied

501
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,330
or looked down upon again.

502
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,010
But

503
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,940
my main concern is your happiness.

504
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,250
I'm getting old.

505
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,140
I can't protect you forever.

506
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,140
Grandfather,

507
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,940
why are you saying such things?

508
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,940
It's the truth.

509
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,660
I've always wanted

510
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,420
to protect you.

511
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,050
But I'm getting old

512
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,460
and the world keeps changing.

513
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,330
Do you remember

514
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,660
when the Elephant Armored Tribe
kidnapped you?

515
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,810
I wanted to fight to the death
to save you.

516
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,620
But I knew

517
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,269
even if I gave my life,

518
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,940
I might not be able to rescue you.

519
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,330
From that moment,

520
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,530
I was truly scared.

521
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,100
Grandfather...

522
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,770
Ma has been protecting you
with all his might,

523
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,770
and I'm grateful for that.

524
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,399
I've secretly observed him

525
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,490
since then.

526
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,559
Over time,

527
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,639
I've realized he's genuinely a good kid,

528
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,290
and he truly cares about you.

529
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,380
If he's by your side,

530
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,220
I can feel more

531
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,660
at ease.

532
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,100
Xiang,

533
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,509
I'm not saying

534
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,250
you must be with him.

535
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,730
But

536
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,100
tell me honestly.

537
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,380
Don't you

538
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,570
have even a little bit

539
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,700
of admiration

540
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,940
for him?

541
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:50,330
Maybe a little bit.

542
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:57,220
Who's there?

543
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,700
It's me.

544
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,770
It's me.

545
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,620
I heard you cried a lot last night.

546
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,599
It was my fault.

547
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,900
I'm here to apologize.

548
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,140
Xiang,

549
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,380
you were saying...

550
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:18,891
Were you eavesdropping
on my chat with Grandfather?

551
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:19,359
No!

552
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,559
I didn't hear anything!

553
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,159
You didn't say you admired me.

554
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,667
I mean...

555
00:29:22,668 --> 00:29:24,429
I mean I'm hateful.

556
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,159
No, I mean.

557
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,011
You find me hateful.

558
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:26,469
No, I...

559
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,810
I... I...

560
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,660
I'm wrong.

561
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,180
Ma Hongjun!

562
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,035
You devils!

563
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:37,989
Being this stubborn?

564
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,709
Ms. Erlong!

565
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,620
Ms. Erlong!

566
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,700
Ouch!

567
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,483
Ms. Erlong,

568
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:42,660
we only want to go...

569
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,139
Haishen Island, right?

570
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,336
No, I won't allow it!

571
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,709
Stop hitting them.

572
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,040
Stop...

573
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,699
Stop hitting us.

574
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,211
Come inside.

575
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:49,639
Stop!

576
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,380
Ouch!

577
00:29:50,668 --> 00:29:51,509
Stop right there!

578
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,330
Run, huh?

579
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,970
Stay still!

580
00:29:55,612 --> 00:29:57,304
I dare you to run again!

581
00:29:57,452 --> 00:29:58,875
Since you're so eager to die,

582
00:29:58,876 --> 00:30:00,331
let me take care of that for you.

583
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,675
Better that, than dying out there

584
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:03,035
with no one to collect your bodies.

585
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:03,771
It's infuriating.

586
00:30:03,772 --> 00:30:04,700
Mr. Yu,

587
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,010
we have to go.

588
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,860
You...

589
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,180
You're no longer children.

590
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,730
You've faced countless dangers.

591
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:17,119
Normally, I wouldn't interfere

592
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,530
with your future choices.

593
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:20,770
But Haishen Island is different.

594
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,900
Even the Netherworld City pales

595
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,147
in comparison to it.

596
00:30:25,148 --> 00:30:26,770
Isn't that exactly what we need?

597
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,140
San,

598
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,490
you're being reckless.

599
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,010
That place is a one-way trip.

600
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,700
Do you know

601
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,189
that Martial Soul Hall once sent...

602
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,490
They once sent two thousand soul masters

603
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,643
to conquer the soul masters there.

604
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:41,403
In the end, they returned defeated,

605
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:43,469
losing two Grand Soul Masters
in the process.

606
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,107
Since then,

607
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,467
the Martial Soul Hall hasn't dared

608
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,824
to target it again.

609
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,304
Do you still want to train there

610
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,700
after knowing this?

611
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,460
Mr. Yu,

612
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:53,860
we're not going there

613
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,220
to conquer the soul masters.

614
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,460
We just want to improve ourselves.

615
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:01,240
I don't think we'll end up like
the Martial Soul Hall, right?

616
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,250
You've certainly done your homework.

617
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,380
But you're still naive.

618
00:31:06,844 --> 00:31:08,189
Ocean soul masters

619
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,730
are completely different from us.

620
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,770
Sir,

621
00:31:12,076 --> 00:31:13,368
I know this one!

622
00:31:13,596 --> 00:31:15,189
Haishen Island soul masters draw

623
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,491
their power from the sea.

624
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:18,180
They're not friendly to outsiders.

625
00:31:18,316 --> 00:31:20,971
Their martial souls are mostly linked
to marine creatures,

626
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:23,192
and their soul skills are different
from ours.

627
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,459
They harness the sea's power,

628
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,920
giving them a natural advantage
over you.

629
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,919
Going there

630
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,669
is like walking into a lion's den.

631
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,290
Plus,

632
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,970
Haishen Island

633
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,050
has a terrifying legend.

634
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,107
You even know this?

635
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:40,747
All right.

636
00:31:40,748 --> 00:31:41,976
Tell me what you know.

637
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,380
I don't know.

638
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,509
Mr. Yu,

639
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,940
what did you mean

640
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,660
by "legend"?

641
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,620
Why raise your hand if you don't know?

642
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,330
Xiaogang, ignore him.

643
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,635
Explain to them.

644
00:31:56,636 --> 00:31:57,669
So these kids understand

645
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,140
the danger of that place.

646
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,700
It's said Haishen Island is home
to a Grand Ocean God Master,

647
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,250
possibly

648
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,220
a 99-Level Ultimate Soul Master.

649
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,159
She controls the ocean's power
for the God of the Ocean.

650
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,570
Soul masters going there

651
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,507
will face this power.

652
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:13,599
As they face this power,

653
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,180
this power will rapidly increase.

654
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,900
The soul masters' power will also grow,

655
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,570
pushing them beyond their limits

656
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,290
until it destroys them.

657
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,250
So

658
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,330
if this legend is true,

659
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,940
it's a death sentence if you go there.

660
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,010
Mr. Yu.

661
00:32:30,124 --> 00:32:31,531
Now that you've put it that way,

662
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,879
we have even more reason

663
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,290
to head to Haishen Island.

664
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,490
Xiaogang,

665
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,290
look at these kids.

666
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,810
So these are the Little Devils
you've trained?

667
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,810
They're as stubborn as ever.

668
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,900
Grinning, are you?

669
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,140
That's right.

670
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:46,875
We, the Shrek Seven Devils,

671
00:32:46,876 --> 00:32:48,792
have never taken the ordinary path.

672
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,330
Mr. Yu,

673
00:32:50,332 --> 00:32:52,264
isn't this exactly what you taught us?

674
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,220
I know you are concerned
about our safety.

675
00:33:00,284 --> 00:33:02,203
But once the Seven Clans
are restructured,

676
00:33:02,204 --> 00:33:04,330
the Martial Soul Hall
will surely expand.

677
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:06,552
If we stay away from danger now,

678
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,803
the Martial Soul Hall

679
00:33:07,804 --> 00:33:10,152
won't spare us
on the battlefield anyway.

680
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,283
If that legendary power

681
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:14,424
can truly boost our soul power quickly,

682
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,620
why not take the risk?

683
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,140
San is absolutely right.

684
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:22,469
Taking a risk is better
than waiting for doom.

685
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,420
One day,

686
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,570
Tiandou and Xingluo will
face Martial Soul Hall head-on.

687
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,639
If the younger soul masters like us,

688
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,730
hesitate,

689
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,229
who will ensure peace
for the continent's future?

690
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,051
Mubai and I

691
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,269
have already informed the emperor
about Haishen Island.

692
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,660
I believe he will support us.

693
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,010
You Little Devils...

694
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,180
It's my fault

695
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,770
for raising you to be so fearless.

696
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,700
Now, I'm the one worried.

697
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:52,330
All right.

698
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:53,639
You can go.

699
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,180
Go.

700
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,620
But know this,

701
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,490
my knowledge about Haishen Island

702
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,100
and the ocean soul masters is limited.

703
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,180
Once you're there,

704
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,970
you'll have to rely on yourselves.

705
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:09,080
Don't worry, Mr. Yu.

706
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,810
Let's start getting ready.

707
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,800
All right.

708
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:14,989
But I have some matters

709
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,190
that I need to return
to the Haotian Sect first.

710
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,180
Once I'm back,

711
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,580
we'll head to Haishen Island together.

712
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,290
(I've been afraid to disturb you,)

713
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,770
(or even think about you.)

714
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,370
(I hope you sleep well
in the Spiritual Sea.)

715
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,850
(But you've been asleep for so long.)

716
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:01,272
(Why aren't you waking up yet?)

717
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,330
Cousin San,

718
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,290
Wu is still not awake?

719
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:33,051
Cousin San,

720
00:35:33,052 --> 00:35:35,176
I heard you're going to Haishen Island.

721
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,239
Can that place

722
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,020
really boost soul power quickly?

723
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,620
That's what the legends say.

724
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,620
Then can I join you?

725
00:35:43,884 --> 00:35:45,679
I promise not to slow anyone down.

726
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,930
I can scout ahead

727
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,850
and clear any dangers.

728
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,069
You can let me handle anything

729
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,949
I can.

730
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,700
Xiang,

731
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,730
you're the best scout we have.

732
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:54,989
I'd be more than happy

733
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,410
to have you come along.

734
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,890
But

735
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,450
this place could be very dangerous.

736
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,275
As a soul master,

737
00:36:03,276 --> 00:36:06,279
you know that rapid power gains
come with equally great challenges,

738
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,410
and possibly the risk
of losing one's life.

739
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,832
I'm not afraid.

740
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,700
Grandfather is getting old

741
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,540
and still worries about me.

742
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,707
I want to show him with my strength

743
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:17,469
that no matter what happens,

744
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,839
I can take care of him

745
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,890
and myself.

746
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,540
I don't need anyone's protection.

747
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,370
I can shoulder my responsibilities.

748
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,540
So

749
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:26,888
no matter how dangerous
the path ahead is,

750
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,060
I'm not scared.

751
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,730
All right.

752
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,100
Then come with us.

753
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,003
Having you around

754
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:35,128
will put my mind even more at ease.

755
00:36:35,372 --> 00:36:36,799
Thank you, Cousin San.

756
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,139
I'll make sure to scout safely

757
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,699
and clear any dangers for everyone.

758
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,509
I'm going to tell Grandfather
this good news.

759
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,290
Go.

760
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,140
Wu?

761
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,220
Wu,

762
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,930
you're finally awake.

763
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,540
Wu.

764
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,890
Wu.

765
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,500
Who are you?

766
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:34,939
Don't you...

767
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,568
Don't you recognize me anymore?

768
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,211
I've never met you.

769
00:37:39,212 --> 00:37:40,968
Why should I recognize you?

770
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,540
Where is this place?

771
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,980
You said you were just going to sleep.

772
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,220
How could you forget?

773
00:37:57,116 --> 00:37:58,440
Wait, don't do that.

774
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,290
I was just kidding.

775
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,850
Kidding?

776
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,469
I was so worried about you.

777
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,020
And you joke about this?

778
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:20,860
♪Longing is an unknown riddle♪

779
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,100
San,

780
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,700
don't be mad.

781
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,290
I didn't know you'd take it seriously.

782
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,290
I didn't consider your feelings.

783
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,020
Please don't be mad at me.

784
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,290
You dared to tease me?

785
00:38:48,204 --> 00:38:49,620
If you can joke with me,

786
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,250
why can't I do the same?

787
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:56,587
When did you wake up?

788
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:57,832
How are you feeling?

789
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,770
I had a deep, restful sleep,

790
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,410
and I recovered quickly.

791
00:39:03,164 --> 00:39:05,848
I already woke up
when Xiang knocked on the door.

792
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,949
Say,

793
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,589
if Fatty finds out Xiang is also going
to Haishen Island,

794
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,850
he'll be over the moon.

795
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,330
He'll probably thank you.

796
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,580
Maybe even buy me some delicious food.

797
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:15,919
It looks like

798
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,200
you already know we're heading
to Haishen Island.

799
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,651
I'm really curious

800
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,728
about what kind of place it will be.

801
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,020
Yeah,

802
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,450
me too.

803
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,799
(Tang Clan)

804
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,770
Elder Lou.

805
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,149
Chief,

806
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,629
good timing!

807
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,620
Come!

808
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,163
I've finished my work today.

809
00:39:39,164 --> 00:39:39,980
Look at this.

810
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,180
Young Master,

811
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,379
we've completed
this batch of hidden weapons

812
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,251
for the Qibao Amber Sect
right on schedule.

813
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:51,500
Thanks to Lou's help.

814
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,589
We've been truly

815
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,020
unstoppable.

816
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,980
Good,

817
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,155
very good.

818
00:40:00,156 --> 00:40:02,632
As expected from the God of Ironsmiths
of our time.

819
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,539
These hidden weapons are key
for the Tang Clan

820
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,370
to stand up against Martial Soul Hall.

821
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,890
Chief,

822
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,429
I've completed the tasks

823
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,919
you gave me.

824
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,660
Don't forget what you promised.

825
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,799
Who is the person

826
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,227
who will help me make

827
00:40:19,228 --> 00:40:20,635
the Storm Pear Blossom Needles?

828
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:22,290
When will we meet him?

829
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,730
I'm here to discuss that.

830
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,410
Elder Lou,

831
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,552
follow me back to the Haotian Sect.

832
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,020
Watch your step.

833
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,359
So this is where the Haotian Sect

834
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,850
is hidden.

835
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,580
Tang San?

836
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,429
You're back.

837
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,315
Tang Long,

838
00:41:40,316 --> 00:41:41,704
it's been a while.

839
00:41:45,932 --> 00:41:47,180
Who are these people?

840
00:41:47,484 --> 00:41:49,515
As a disciple of the Haotian Sect,
you should know

841
00:41:49,516 --> 00:41:51,659
after the Haotian Sect withdrew
from the world,

842
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,339
no one other than
the Haotian Sect members

843
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,440
was allowed inside.

844
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,930
I know the rules.

845
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,199
So I need your help

846
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,029
to watch over my friends outside

847
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,651
while I inform the Chief

848
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:01,799
and get permission

849
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,850
to bring them in.

850
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,100
No matter.

851
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,220
Tang San understands the rules.

852
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,580
Bring your friends inside.

853
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:09,930
Tang Long,

854
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,810
inform the elders.

855
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,980
Tell them Tang San has returned.

856
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,890
Yes.

857
00:42:16,156 --> 00:42:17,400
Please come inside.

858
00:42:17,612 --> 00:42:18,808
This way, please.

859
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,500
Chief,

860
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,730
how can you allow outsiders
into the sect?

861
00:42:25,244 --> 00:42:26,850
Seventh Elder, calm down.

862
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,330
Let San introduce his friends first.

863
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,370
This is my beloved,

864
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,850
Wu.

865
00:42:36,252 --> 00:42:37,448
She's not an outsider.

866
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,220
So she's Wu.

867
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,330
But isn't she...

868
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,250
Aunt,

869
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,100
allow me
to explain Wu's situation later.

870
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,800
This time, I've come to the Haotian Sect

871
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,109
to introduce you

872
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,587
to this esteemed senior by my side.

873
00:42:50,588 --> 00:42:53,211
He's one of the three God of Ironsmiths
in the continent.

874
00:42:53,212 --> 00:42:54,392
Lou Gao.

875
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,620
Greetings, Chief Tang,

876
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,140
and to you elders.

877
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,659
I've heard
of President Lou's reputation.

878
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,700
It's an honor.

879
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,500
I don't deserve that title anymore.

880
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,949
I've left the Ironsmiths Society

881
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,469
and joined the Tang Clan.

882
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,580
I'm now a member of Tang Clan.

883
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:18,408
The Haotian Sect has been in seclusion
for a long time.

884
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,330
So we haven't heard of the Tang Clan.

885
00:43:20,652 --> 00:43:22,719
What is your connection
with the Tang Clan?

886
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,450
Uncle,

887
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,060
