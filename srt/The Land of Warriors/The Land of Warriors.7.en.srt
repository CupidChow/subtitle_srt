Tangjia Sanshao's novel "Soul Land")

=Episode 7=

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,950
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

26
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:49,720
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

27
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,870
You knocked him out?

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,950
What are you doing?

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,080
Just kill him!

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,360
Don't you know the rules?

31
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,870
This isn't child's play.

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,790
Kill him!

33
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:03,430
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

34
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,580
(Do not drink the Netherland Shot
when entering the city.)

35
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,440
(Abstain from killing strangers
in the arena.)

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,640
(This Haotian Sect disciple)

37
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,550
(is quite the extraordinaire.)

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,990
My great king.

39
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,790
Looks like this new warrior

40
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,440
who's come to the Netherworld City

41
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,080
has a kind heart.

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,880
He won't be for long.

43
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,640
Will you continue fighting?

44
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,990
(He is being controlled.)

45
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,830
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

46
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,920
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

47
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:46,760
- Good!
- That's right!

48
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,830
There's one more alive.

49
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:54,550
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

50
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,950
Please, don't kill me.

51
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,920
I'm begging you, don't kill me.

52
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,640
All nine must die

53
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,040
for you to be named the winner.

54
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,920
The state he is in now

55
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,200
is no different from a dead man.

56
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,600
According to the rules,

57
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,760
they must be truly dead.

58
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,270
If he doesn't die

59
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,550
and leaves that door,

60
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,640
The Netherworld King
will sentence you to death.

61
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,440
Please...

62
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,910
That should've been the way.

63
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,390
Yeah.

64
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,120
Congratulations to No. 9528 for winning.

65
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,640
- Nice!
- Good!

66
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,460
You should've just killed him.

67
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,080
Good work.

68
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,800
Good!

69
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,030
He is really skilled.

70
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,800
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

71
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,800
The third soul skill, teleportation.

72
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,350
Stop it. You're stepping out of line.

73
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,800
Wu.

74
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,760
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,080
I didn't mean to.

76
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,350
It's alright. Again.

77
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,880
No, you almost got hurt.

78
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,370
I feel like I'm about to break through
the level 50 bottleneck.

79
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,680
The normal training is no longer
of much use to me.

80
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,200
Thank goodness for Erming.

81
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,150
He used his gravity control field
to pressure me.

82
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,940
That helped me
to concentrate my soul power.

83
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,120
It's the push I need
to finally reach level 50.

84
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,120
But...

85
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,200
San.

86
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,950
San.

87
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,950
(I don't know what you've been through,)

88
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,390
(nor what I could do for you.)

89
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,640
But whenever I was powerless,

90
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,640
I would think of a children's song

91
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,350
my mother used to sing

92
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,120
for me in the past.

Your Majesty.

102
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,830
Evildoers move in the darkness of night.

103
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,000
So,

104
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,950
I propose a curfew.

105
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,560
When night falls, all soul masters
are forbidden from going out.

106
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,030
If there's a need, five or more people
are required to travel.

107
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,710
Apart from that,

108
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,680
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan

109
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,710
and Qibao Amber Sect

110
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,780
will send their disciples

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,080
to go to the other sects

112
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,800
to provide one-on-one assistance.

113
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,510
That's a good plan.

114
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,760
But, do Chief Ning and
the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan

115
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,440
agree to cooperate?

116
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,230
It will be done.

117
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,470
(Yu Tianheng,
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan)

118
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,630
I will write a letter
to inform our chief.

119
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,830
Come on, welcome.

120
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,590
Here. You have to try this.

121
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,230
Here.

122
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,440
Strawberries?

123
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,800
And tofu?

124
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,990
Uncle, can this be delicious?

125
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,160
You bet.

126
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,470
Listen.

127
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,590
Your Aunt Erlong's cooking skills
are second to none.

128
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,470
Only she would be able to create
such a delicious dish

129
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
using strawberries and mapo tofu.

130
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,440
Go on and try it.

131
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,710
I'll have you know.

132
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,800
This is my special recipe.

133
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,160
It's your uncle's favorite.

134
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,230
You won't find it anywhere else.

135
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,350
You're lucky to be able to eat it today.

136
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,630
So make sure you eat a lot.

137
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,280
Anyway,

138
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,950
how is your grandfather?

139
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,950
He's good.

140
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,680
Sometimes,

141
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,710
he'd go and sit in your room

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,500
and no one's allowed to disturb him.

143
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,200
Uncle,

144
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,160
when this matter is resolved,

145
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,440
perhaps you and Aunt

146
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,590
could go back and visit.

147
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,870
I am a disgrace of the family.

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,910
If I go back, it will only put
your grandfather in a difficult position.

149
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,520
I know he misses me.

150
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,620
But that doesn't mean
he'd want me to go back.

151
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,630
I don't get it.

152
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,080
Your martial soul mutated as it evolved

153
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,590
and turned into Luo Sanpao.

154
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,230
It wasn't your fault.

155
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,110
Why were you kicked out of the sect?

156
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,750
Tianheng,

157
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,230
move your chopsticks.

158
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:58,990
Don't be shy.

159
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,990
Eat more.

160
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,680
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

161
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,190
But the Blue Lightning
Tyrant Dragon Clan is your home.

162
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,650
Nothing wrong in going home, right?

163
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,200
I no longer had a home

164
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,990
when I was kicked out.

165
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,440
Tianheng.

166
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,710
Come on.

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,280
Eat more and talk less.

168
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,320
Eat.

169
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,470
Okay.

170
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,590
Is it good?

171
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,520
Yes.

172
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,160
Oh, right.

173
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,160
Grandfather asked me to give this
to you before I left.

174
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,830
Isn't this the clan's mugwort cake?

175
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,750
Xiaogang,

176
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,280
I remember

177
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,680
this used to be your favorite.

178
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,560
Excuse me for a minute.

179
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,280
You two eat.

180
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,890
I've disappointed you.

181
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,350
(Young Yu Xiaogang)
Sorry for embarrassing you.

182
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,830
Please take care of yourself
when I'm gone.

183
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,680
Take these.

184
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,040
It's your favorite snack.

185
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,920
Leaving home,

186
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,790
it'd be hard to find these again.

187
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,320
Xiaogang,

188
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,830
the old grandmaster's
intention is clear.

189
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,470
It's about time you return.

190
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,870
Not yet.

191
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,230
In this world,

192
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,350
no son wouldn't want
to make his father proud.

193
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,520
Same goes for me.

194
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,520
My martial soul

195
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,750
shamed him.

196
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,870
Perhaps my martial soul's
accomplishments

197
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,590
could make up for its flaw.

198
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,950
Do you mean...

199
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,440
The day San and the others

200
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,990
stand at the pinnacle
of the continent's masters,

201
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,110
the people would see

202
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,330
that my beliefs on the martial soul
are not unfounded.

203
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,750
When that happens,

204
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,450
that would be the day I return to
the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan.

205
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,040
Showing mercy to the opponent
is being cruel to yourself.

206
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,750
Mubai, Zhuqing, what do you think?

207
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,080
I agree.

208
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,990
The ancestral teachings taught us

209
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,630
that kindness without principles

210
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,630
shows ignorance toward evil.

211
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,590
I will take it to heart

212
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,560
and not forget the limits for mercy.

213
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,350
Principles and limits are clearly
written in the ancestral teachings.

214
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,830
Do you abide by them?

215
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,810
- We dare not disobey.
- We dare not disobey.

216
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,630
Showing the slightest bit of kindness

217
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,590
could very well

218
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,080
put yourself in an unfavorable position.

219
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,470
It's the survival of the fittest.

220
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,280
Have I not taught you?

221
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,230
I understand.

222
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,040
I don't think you do!

223
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,870
The one who lives

224
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,520
is the one who gets to rule.

225
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,990
What are you two waiting for?

226
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,680
I thought you guys have left Xingluo.

227
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,470
We were too naive.

228
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,560
We though we could hide the truth,

229
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
but we failed to escape Father's grasp.

230
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,440
Do we have any other choice right now?

231
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,160
The ancestral system is not a knife,

232
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,950
but it's forced us
to turn against one another.

233
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,040
See?

234
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,800
The person you saved could very well
betray you.

235
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,110
The ancestral system exists
to prevent a backstab.

236
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,560
What are you people doing?

237
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,830
Father,

238
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,400
I do not regret what I did.

239
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,400
If I could choose one more time,

240
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,110
I still would not kill my brethren.

241
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,950
Insolence!

242
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,830
A benevolent person

243
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,830
will never assume the seat of the king.

244
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,680
Real power

245
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,350
is not annihilating others.

246
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,200
It's to become indestructible,

247
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,920
able to not only protect yourself
but also other people.

248
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,280
Your Majesty,

249
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,080
I solemnly vow

250
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,160
to reach level 60 before I turn 25.

251
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,110
If I succeed, I implore you to let
Zhu Zhuyun and Dai Weisi go.

252
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,200
You should ask
your father, Duke Lingmao,

253
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,280
how long it took him to reach level 60.

254
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,950
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

255
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,750
They don't know
what they're talking about.

256
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,200
What if I manage to do it?

257
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,630
There is no way.

258
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,200
Father,

259
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,950
I too promise you.

260
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,850
I will reach level 60
together with Zhuqing.

261
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,900
We'll become unprecedented warriors
of Xingluo.

262
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,150
Please spare their lives.

263
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,960
Your Majesty.

264
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,080
Are you bargaining with me?

265
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,280
I wouldn't dare.

266
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,800
But if we succeed,

267
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,040
we will become the pride
of Xingluo Empire.

268
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,720
And Xingluo will look down
on the entire continent.

269
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,720
The Martial Soul Hall is unhinged.

270
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,830
And Tiandou has its sight
set on Xingluo.

271
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,800
For Xingluo's future,

272
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,780
we will do everything we can
to become stronger.

273
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,520
I dare ask Your Majesty
to spare them when the time comes.

274
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,190
You can speak to me again

275
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,630
when you actually reach level 60.

276
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,430
Rongrong,

277
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,040
are you angry with me?

278
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,870
Yes.

279
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,960
I'm angry because
you put yourself in harm's way.

280
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,040
Don't ever step in front of me again.

281
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,870
It didn't do any good anyway.

282
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,670
I wasn't able to protect you.

283
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:34,800
Ao,

284
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,320
you're an amazing support soul master.

285
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,910
You don't have to console me.

286
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,350
This isn't consoling.

287
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,830
If the war soul master
hadn't shown up today,

288
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,150
things could've ended terribly.

289
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,190
That's not true.

290
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,150
Ao.

291
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,760
I have a weird feeling
about what happened today.

292
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,240
The two soul masters who attacked us

293
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,910
clearly knew about our backgrounds.

294
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,320
And that war soul master
named Wang Zheng.

295
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,110
He showed up just at the right time.

296
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,870
Rongrong, the chief asked for you
and Ao to greet guests in the study.

297
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,870
I'm tired and would like to rest.

298
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,870
The chief said it's an important guest,

299
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,760
so it's imperative
that you two be there.

300
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,040
What important guest?

301
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,480
What does it have to do with me?

302
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,720
Okay.

303
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:24,720
We will be there.

304
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,630
Okay.

305
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,910
Shouldn't you be resting?

306
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,240
I'm fine. It's not hurting.

307
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,910
The chief never invited me
to the study before.

308
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,300
Who knows I'm in for something good?

309
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,190
Father, we're here.

310
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,320
Come over, Rongrong.

311
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,520
Let me introduce you.

312
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,520
You.

313
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,320
So you are Ms. Rongrong.

314
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,990
You two know each other?

315
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,520
Ao and I were in trouble today.

316
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,280
He was the one who saved us.

317
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,480
I see.

318
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,350
That means

319
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,760
I should properly thank you.

320
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,080
They are not very good at offense.

321
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,580
Thank goodness you got here in time.

322
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,830
You're too kind, sir.

323
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,190
Rongrong should really thank you.

324
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,350
Anyway, Rongrong,

325
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,670
Wang Zheng is
Grand Bone Master's nephew.

326
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,590
He is the most outstanding disciple
among the younger generation.

327
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,670
You flatter me, Mr. Ning.

328
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,910
Not at all.

329
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,710
Please, sit.

330
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,630
Ms. Rongrong, take a seat.

331
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,670
Ao,

332
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,350
you too.

333
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,040
Rongrong,

334
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,430
didn't I tell you
to properly thank the young master?

335
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Thank you for your help today.

336
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,240
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

337
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,760
It was nothing, really.

338
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,480
I happened to pass by
and stepped in to help.

339
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,340
I guess we share
an affinity, Ms. Rongrong.

340
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,910
Sure we do.

341
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,190
Tiandou City is massive,

342
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,760
and yet you happened to show up

343
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,240
right when Ao and I were in trouble.

344
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,390
I don't suppose I accrued the good luck
in my previous life?

345
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,180
Two youngsters of similar age,
brought together serendipitously.

346
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,670
There could be good things in store.

347
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,430
Indeed, I am five years older than Rongrong.

348
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,110
My Bazi is in the Shen branch,
of the Fire element.

349
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,830
I wonder what Rongrong's Bazi is.

350
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,760
I feel like we are quite a good match.

351
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,590
Really?

352
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,960
I don't think so.

353
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,110
The two ruffians today seemed ruthless,

354
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,150
but they didn't go overboard.

355
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,000
It looked precarious,

356
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,630
but none of the moves were fatal.

357
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,720
Don't you find it odd?

358
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,480
Father,

359
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,150
I am not feeling well
and can't stand it any longer.

360
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,960
I am going to rest.

361
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,240
Rongrong,

362
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:58,800
we have a guest here.

363
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,800
Mind your manners.

364
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,960
It's alright, Mr. Ning.

365
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,870
Rongrong must have gotten a scare today.

366
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,350
It's better to rest early.

367
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,800
Thank you.

368
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,830
I shall take my leave then.

369
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,430
Let's go, Ao.

370
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,630
You're still up.

371
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,870
Rongrong,

372
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,150
you can be frank with me.

373
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,800
Why don't you go first?

374
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
What was that about?

375
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,910
Trying to arrange my marriage?

376
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,560
Wang Zheng has a lot of potential

377
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,280
among the younger masters.

378
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
But do you know

379
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,480
what he did today?

380
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,560
I know Wang Zheng's ways.

381
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,430
It's underhanded and deplorable.

382
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,080
Hence why I won't force you to continue
to keep in contact.

383
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,150
Why did you invite him if you knew?

384
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,960
You even asked Ao to be there.

385
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,080
Were you purposely
trying to embarrass him?

386
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,080
I did not intend to embarrass anyone,

387
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,480
nor deliberately oppose anything.

388
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,430
I just wanted you two to see the truth.

389
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,270
Wang Zheng today could be taken
as a mock obstacle

390
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,430
for you and Ao.

391
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,110
But it represents a very real future
you two must face.

392
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,190
After what happened today,

393
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,870
you should know better.

394
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,480
As a support soul master,

395
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,520
your offensive skills

396
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,480
are no match for a war soul master.

397
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,390
We have secret weapons.

398
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,000
We have the means to protect ourselves.

399
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,830
If Wang Zheng hadn't done his homework

400
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,280
and sussed out our background,

401
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,080
Ao has the ability to fly.

402
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,110
He couldn't have so easily subdued us.

403
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,890
What if his ability was blocked
and you used up your secret weapons?

404
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,150
No matter how strong the weapons are,
they cannot beat physically

405
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,350
possessing fighting power.

406
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,720
The marriage

407
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,280
can be put aside for now.

408
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,870
But Rongrong,

409
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,480
do you remember

410
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,870
the sect's rule?

411
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,560
The spouse of a direct sect disciple

412
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,190
has to be a war soul master.

413
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,480
Master Gurong.

414
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,390
But when I was in danger today,

415
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,280
Ao stepped in to protect me.

416
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,150
Based on this one sacrificial act alone,

417
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,140
tell me which war soul master
is better than him?

418
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,040
You took Ao in as a personal disciple.

419
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,910
I thought...

420
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,620
I accepted him as a private disciple
because he possesses the talent.

421
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,320
But Ao won't be able to change the fact

422
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,000
that as a support soul master,

423
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,560
his fighting power is not as strong.

424
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,080
He is destined

425
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,910
never to be my son-in-law.

426
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,510
Neither of you has the ability
to protect yourself without help.

427
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,590
So I have to make the choice for you

428
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,630
to ensure not just your future safety,

429
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,960
but Ao's too.

430
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,670
Over the centuries, the Qibao Amber Sect

431
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,620
is considered on equal footing
with Haotian Sect

432
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,040
and Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan
despite us following the support branch.

433
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:45,720
That's because we've always collaborated
with the war soul masters.

434
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,150
For centuries?

435
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,760
Despite centuries gone,

436
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,000
no one has been able
to reach Jiubao Amber Pagoda.

437
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,870
That... That's also
to support the war soul master.

438
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,240
There's Ao.

439
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,080
He's more talented than me.

440
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,960
Today,

441
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,830
I had to be the bad person

442
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,320
and embarrassed Ao.

443
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,720
I know you and him
share deep affection for each other.

444
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,240
But...

445
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,110
But Rongrong,

446
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,390
you are Qibao Amber Sect's successor.

447
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,720
You have the duty

448
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,040
to protect the sect.

449
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,390
Take this.

450
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,000
This

451
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,000
will be useful for treating your wounds.

452
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,720
Thank you.

453
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,720
But I care about now

454
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,630
is not these skin-deep wounds.

455
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,000
Do you know why Qibao Amber Sect

456
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,870
has been able to stay away

457
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,150
from outside influences?

458
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,960
It's because of me
and the Grand Sword Master.

459
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,350
As war soul masters,

460
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,680
we have to work in tandem
with support branch soul masters

461
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,830
to ensure that Qibao Amber Sect

462
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,720
has no interference
from the outside world.

463
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,830
I will do everything I can
to protect Rongrong

464
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,000
and Qibao Amber Sect.

465
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,910
If the outcome is unsatisfactory,

466
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,870
what's the use of giving it your all?

467
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,040
I will use 10 percent of my power

468
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,560
and not use my martial soul.

469
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,430
Do as you see fit.

470
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,240
Oscar, you are a talented person.

471
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,430
I know your feelings
for Rongrong are sincere.

472
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,150
As a support branch soul master,

473
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,670
your innate talent is much greater
than my nephew

474
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,280
who is a attack branch soul master.

475
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,870
But right now, he's the one
who can protect Rongrong.

476
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,670
Not you.

477
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,190
I can do it!

478
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,870
If you truly love Rongrong,

479
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,000
I doubt you'd want her
to get hurt, do you?

480
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,320
I get it.

481
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,910
Thank you for your advice.

482
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,560
(If I don't become stronger,)

483
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,670
(I have no right
to stay by Rongrong's side.)

484
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,350
You are dead.

485
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,320
You can't hurt me.

486
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,590
My lady.

487
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,830
Enter.

488
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,110
My lady, a group of the soul masters
among the entourage

489
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,910
sent to Xingdou Forest
encountered beast-eating flowers.

490
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,760
They were almost wiped out.

491
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,080
Give their families compensation.

492
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,990
In the future, there's no need
to bother me

493
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,590
with such matters.

494
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:58,960
Yes, my lady.

495
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,590
One soul master escaped.

496
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,280
They claimed to have seen

497
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,760
the 100,000-year-old soul beast.

498
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,830
However,

499
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,830
it got away.

500
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,720
Send more men.

501
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,150
Yes, my lady.

502
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,830
This is the Supreme's order.

503
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,790
Capture the 100,000 year-old
soft-boned rabbit alive.

504
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,280
Yes, sir!

505
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:25,960
Set out!

506
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,110
The third soul technique.

507
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,000
Teleportation.

508
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,390
Wu,

509
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,960
you're improving so quickly.

510
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,190
With the help of your gravity field, my soul power
has become more concentrated.

511
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,350
Erming,

512
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,000
don't hurt it.

513
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,040
How did you get here?

514
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,720
The way is full of fierce beasts.

515
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,240
It's dangerous to come here.

516
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,390
This is me.

517
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,320
Where did you find this?

518
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,900
Did you come looking for me on purpose?

519
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,990
It previously helped me locate the traps
the Martial Soul Hall set up.

520
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,340
It must have a reason
for coming.

521
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,180
I'll go take a look.

522
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,620
Looks like Bi Bi Dong won't quit
if she doesn't capture me.

523
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,590
Wu,

524
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,110
I'll go and teach them a lesson.

525
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,960
No, Erming.

526
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,830
Although they can't take you on even in a group,

527
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,280
if a fight breaks out now,

528
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,670
it will surely cause a commotion
within Xingdou Forest

529
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,250
and make other soul beasts feel uneasy.

530
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,960
Got it, Wu.

531
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,800
I'll do as you say.

532
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,670
(San,)

533
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,110
(what should I do?)

534
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,520
No. 9528, 41 wins.

535
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,390
- Nice one!
- Great!

536
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
No. 9528, 65 wins!

537
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,390
Good!

538
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,000
No. 9528, 79 wins!

539
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,000
Great!

540
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
(Aside from Tang San,)

541
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,190
(you are the most talented
soul master I've come across.)

542
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,280
No. 9528's winning streak

543
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,210
has caught up to that
of the Emissary of Hell's.

544
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:10,960
I heard

545
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,720
some people are secretly calling him

546
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,590
King Asura.

547
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,430
People are scared to meet him
in the Hell's Training Ground.

548
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,280
However many are scared of him,

549
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,630
means they are as many
who wish him dead.

550
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,190
Looks like you want him
out of the picture.

551
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,720
Otherwise, you wouldn't have matched him
against a level 80 Great Soul Master.

552
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,560
King Asura,

553
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,760
you may begin your performance.

554
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,370
♪The fleeting dream of life
is easily shattered♪

555
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,300

556

♪A so-called hero, covered in dust♪

565
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,360
You want to suck my soul power dry?

566
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,110
Dream on.

567
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,440
(Haotian Sect Random Air!)

568
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,590
All things come together!

569
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,440
That concludes the match.

570
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,790
No. 9528,

571
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,110
95 wins.

572
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,840
(When he used the Haotian Hammer,)

573
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,400
(he was even stronger than Tang San.)

574
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,310
(With such formidable power,)

575
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,710
(he will surely break 100 wins.)

576
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,750
(I should plan ahead.)

577
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,040
He... He won again.

578
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,750
Look, he's injured.

579
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,120
I never want to meet him
in Hell's Training Ground.

580
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,920
Don't let him onto the Ground again.

581
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,230
We should kill him right now.

582
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,310
Kill him!

583
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,590
Kill him!

584
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,270
King... King Asura.

585
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,440
You did not disappoint.

586
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,390
(Only when you're at the brink of death)

587
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,150
(will you be able to obtain)

588
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,440
(the power to turn the tide.)

589
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,560
(This power)

590
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,710
(is hard-won)

591
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,480
(and extremely risky.)

592
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,190
(Mastering it)

593
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,190
(is a true test of one's will.)

594
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,790
Father,

595
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,880
I will not let you down.

596
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,190
He's come.

597
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,770
Anyone who successfully escapes
Hell's Road

598
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,840
is free to leave
and enter Netherworld City.

599
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,840
No one can stop him.

600
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,360
That King Asura...

601
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,590
I mean, 9528.

602
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,630
What do you plan to do with him?

603
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,750
He and the girl from Martial Soul Hall

604
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,110
are indeed troublesome.

605
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,710
I'll have to think about it.

606
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,760
(It's not just the Netherland Shot.)

607
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,360
(Even the air here)

608
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,230
(causes confusion in people.)

609
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,880
(Who knows how much the pellet I made)

610
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,000
(could withstand the poison.)

611
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,040
What's the matter?

612
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,790
What's happened?

613
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,710
San is in a lot of pain right now.

614
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,080
That's his own problem.

615
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,630
You are at the bottleneck
of reaching level 50.

616
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,840
Focus on transforming the soul ring.

617
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,000
If you help him now,
who's going to help you?

618
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,920
The Martial Soul Hall
won't give you any more time.

619
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,920
I know what I'm doing.

620
