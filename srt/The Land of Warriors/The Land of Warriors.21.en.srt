=The Land of Warriors=

19
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

20
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,220
=Episode 21=

21
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,660
(Shrek Academy)

22
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,860
Tiandou is generous indeed.

23
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,660
The soul master legion's stay at Shrek
wasn't for naught.

24
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,140
I spent the whole morning
doing the calculations.

25
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,170
Are you going to give up
on Xiaogang for good?

26
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,530
Have you tried persuading him?

27
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,650
Have I tried persuading him?

28
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,300
Including Rongrong,

29
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,170
Fatty,

30
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:14,490
Zhuqing,

31
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,210
we've all tried talking to him.

32
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,730
Did it work?

33
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,100
If he continues
training the soul masters without rest,

34
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,050
and studies the martial soul
all day and night,

35
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,330
if this goes on any longer,

36
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,140
he is going to collapse.

37
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,540
The Blue Lightning
Tyrant Dragon Clan incident

38
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,140
had a big impact on him.

39
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,610
It's weighing heavily on his mind.

40
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,900
Keeping himself busy

41
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,420
is better than having him be idle.

42
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,420
Besides,

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,820
it's not just a simple grudge
between clans.

44
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,020
Just look at that Marshal Ge Long.

45
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,610
Clearly, he didn't come to assist him.

46
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,770
I bet the Crown Prince sent him
to keep him in check.

47
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,170
His Majesty is ill

48
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,330
and the enemy is approaching.

49
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,990
But the Crown Prince is more concerned
with taking over the throne.

50
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,020
That spells trouble.

51
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,700
If Xiaogang fails to train
those soul masters,

52
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,260
it means he failed to live up
to His Majesty's expectation.

53
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,540
Erlong,

54
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,580
you should support him instead.

55
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,820
How am I supposed to do that?

56
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,540
All I know is, if he doesn't eat,

57
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,770
I won't eat either.

58
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,330
The clan and nation
don't only belong to him.

59
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,860
If he chooses to persist,

60
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,930
then I, Liu Erlong,
will persist alongside him.

61
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,860
Okay.

62
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,020
You go ahead.

63
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,820
Give me that.

64
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,540
Sorry.

65
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,610
By "we", I mean "all of us."

66
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,930
Hey you.

67
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,260
Can you even finish

68
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,050
all that?

69
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,700
Let me count it once more.

70
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,050
The poison in His Majesty's body
is getting serious.

71
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,140
If we don't deal with it,

72
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,380
I'm afraid he won't be waking up.

73
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,610
But the Tiandou Palace is a fortress.

74
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,930
Moreover, with His Majesty's dire
condition, security is even tighter.

75
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,300
It will be much harder to break in.

76
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,650
(Tiandou Palace)

77
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,360
Do you remember
that I tried to be naughty

78
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,810
and dug a tunnel to escape studying?

79
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,580
Only you, me

80
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,730
and Father knew about it.

81
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,730
(Tiandou Palace)

82
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,700
But the secret tunnel

83
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,530
had long been sealed
by His Majesty when he found out.

84
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,020
We could just unseal it.

85
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:37,890
Father.

86
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,940
Arrest the assassin!

87
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,700
It is you.

88
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,700
You tricked me.

89
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,970
I just know you too well.

90
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,970
Actually, Father had known about

91
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,180
the secret tunnel you dug
in order to escape your lessons.

92
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,410
But you were naturally gifted.

93
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,890
Despite being naughty and unruly,

94
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,620
you kept up with your studies.

95
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,970
That's why he was
particularly lenient with you.

96
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,970
Do you know why Father

97
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,410
ultimately sealed the tunnel?

98
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,020
It was because of me.

99
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,700
Because I found out about it too.

100
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,450
He didn't want me to think
that he played favoritism.

101
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,380
And so he had no choice but to seal it.

102
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,020
Why are you telling me these now?

103
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,890
Because I want you to feel grateful
toward him.

104
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,580
I want you to know,

105
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,140
how much he doted on you before,

106
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,140
how generous he was.

107
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,700
There's one more thing
I want to tell you.

108
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,060
You will never see him again.

109
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,500
Where is Father?

110
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,770
Where did you hide him?

111
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,330
That has nothing to do with you.

112
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,310
The Fourth Prince Xue Beng
is found guilty

113
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,620
for attempting to murder Father,

114
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,210
he has been executed.

115
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,650
You're the one who should be executed!

116
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:58,970
Arrest him.

117
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,500
Dugu Bo.

118
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,090
Locate and arrest Dugu Bo
and the Fourth Prince.

119
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,530
Be it dead or alive.

120
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,450
Yes, Your Highness.

121
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,620
Old Venom Freak,

122
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,450
stop while you can.

123
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,940
I've served Tiandou for so long

124
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,500
and yet I wasn't aware
that such a Grand Soul Master

125
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,330
existed within the royal circle.

126
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,260
I am Grand Porcupinefish Master.

127
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,090
Today, I'll make sure
you don't die in vain.

128
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,330
At our age,

129
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,700
there's no use for lofty words.

130
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,180
When I have the time,

131
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,700
I'll deal with you then.

132
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,330
How about some snacks?

133
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,530
Wu,

134
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,500
sorry you'll have to make do for now.

135
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,060
Once I resurrect you,

136
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,500
I'll take you to sample
these delicacies.

137
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,690
You dare stop me?

138
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,220
Don't push your luck.

139
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,770
Old Freak.

140
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,490
I'll look for you next time.

141
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:03,770
Who is it?

142
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,290
Who dares assist the Old Venom Freak?

143
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,980
You lost them?

144
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,170
I got careless.

145
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,890
I didn't think Grand Venom Master
would have secret help in the city.

146
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,890
I was held back for only a moment

147
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,690
but that was enough
for Grand Venom Master to get away.

148
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,050
I see.

149
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,770
Guard.

150
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,460
Your Highness.

151
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,260
Give the order.

152
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,890
Fourth Prince Xue Beng

153
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,170
is on the run after failing
to assassinate the Emperor.

154
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,620
He is now a wanted criminal.

155
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,390
Yes, Your Highness.

156
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,810
What are you doing?

157
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,380
Is killing me the way you greet me?

158
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,380
Old Freak.

159
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,460
Let's talk somewhere else.

160
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,620
I used soul power to sustain his pulse.

161
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,100
He is stable for now.

162
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:02,930
Little Devil.

163
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,410
In a few short years since we met,

164
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,650
your soul power
has improved quite a lot.

165
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,530
You were able to interrupt
that Grand Porcupinefish Master.

166
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,220
I owe you one.

167
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,290
Not many people
could give you a headache.

168
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,650
Where did that person come from?

169
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,500
I've been a familiar of
the Tiandou royals for years,

170
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,100
but I've never seen him.

171
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,890
I suspect he's from
the Martial Soul Hall.

172
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,220
(Martial Soul Hall.)

173
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,770
Little Devil?

174
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,740
I'm fine.

175
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,620
So you think

176
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,790
Xue Qinghe is colluding
with the Martial Soul Hall.

177
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,890
That's the worst assumption
one could make.

178
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,220
Looks like you've chosen where to stand.

179
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,570
So Xue Beng pretended to be naughty

180
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,650
and unruly over the years

181
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,260
because of an ulterior reason?

182
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,570
You guessed right.

183
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,100
Xue Beng is unruly

184
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,460
because Xue Qinghe forced him to be.

185
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,890
Xue Qinghe is the current Crown Prince,

186
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,380
and future ruler.

187
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,100
Why would he push Xue Beng
into a corner?

188
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,650
This goes years back.

189
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,100
Emperor Xue Ye has a total of four sons.

190
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,500
Xue Qinghe is the eldest,

191
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,460
while Xue Beng is the youngest.

192
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,860
(In the beginning,
the most outstanding prince)

193
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,500
(wasn't Xue Qinghe.)

194
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,020
(Tiandou's second prince)
(It was the emperor's second son.)

195
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,810
(He was a highly talented boy.)

196
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,410
(In terms of soul power cultivation,)

197
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,500
(he wasn't as good as you.)

198
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,650
(But in terms of intelligence and wit,)

199
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,770
(Young Xue Qinghe)
(he was far superior.)

200
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,980
(But he passed away)

201
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,810
(when he was 12.)

202
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,940
(Tiandou's third prince)

203
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,480
(After the Second Prince's passing,)

204
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,770
(people began to take notice
of the Third Prince's traits.)

205
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,170
(He had an innate talent)

206
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,460
(for the soul master cultivation.)

207
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,100
(However, two years
after Second Prince's passing,)

208
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,500
(the 11-year-old Third Prince)

209
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,890
(also passed away suddenly.)

210
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:18,770
Your Majesty,

211
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,990
the eldest and Third princes were both
poisoned with the same rare poison.

212
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,380
The symptoms are similar
to what the Second Prince had before.

213
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,410
Grand Venom Master,

214
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,690
investigate this thoroughly.

215
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,020
The one responsible
for harming Tiandou's royalty

216
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,530
must not be spared.

217
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,690
(At the time, I smelled a distinct odor)

218
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,290
(emanating from Xue Qinghe's body.)

219
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,570
What kind of distinct odor?

220
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,650
What made you think Xue Qinghe

221
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,530
caused the two princes' deaths?

222
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,340
It's a kind of spices used in making
combination poison.

223
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,620
Aside from this,

224
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,020
there's nothing else
to prove his involvement.

225
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,020
There is no way to find the cause

226
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,860
of what poisoned the two princes.

227
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,980
But Tiandou has always
chosen their ruler

228
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,690
based on merits, and not seniority.

229
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,850
The second and third princes passed away
one after the other.

230
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,100
Meanwhile, Xue Beng was still young.

231
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,530
So ultimately, Xue Qinghe
became the beneficiary.

232
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,380
That's right.

233
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,560
My investigation
didn't reveal anything concrete.

234
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,530
The incidents became an unsolved case

235
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,500
and a shadow hovering
above the Tiandou royalty.

236
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,810
A few years later,

237
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,860
Xue Qinghe was officially named
as the Crown Prince.

238
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,620
The deaths of the two princes

239
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,530
also became taboo within the palace.

240
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,990
No one mentioned it again.

241
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,860
Then how did Xue Beng

242
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,810
notice something
was off with Xue Qinghe?

243
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,860
Prince Xue Beng is extremely smart.

244
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,380
Back then, I gave him

245
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,770
a hint obscurely

246
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,290
and he immediately understood.

247
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,570
For his own safety,

248
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,860
he switched from being intelligent

249
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,570
to being unreasonable

250
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,890
and absurd.

251
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,740
Xue Qinghe and the other officials
took no notice of him.

252
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,500
So he managed to stay alive.

253
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,930
He was going to continue
living like a bum.

254
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,380
but he didn't expect Xue Qinghe

255
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,810
would plot against Emperor Xue Ye.

256
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,170
How old are you?

257
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,890
You only know to play all day.

258
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,460
You neglect your studies

259
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,740
and refuse to train.

260
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,140
Are you satisfied with being

261
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,170
at level 40 for the rest of your life?

262
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,620
I don't like to train,

263
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,620
I just want to play.

264
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,650
Be it level 100 or level 40,

265
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,490
it's the same for me.

266
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,260
I'm off.

267
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:22,860
You...

268
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,190
Don't be angry, Your Majesty.

269
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,220
Your health is more important.

270
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,980
It's my fault
for indulging you too much.

271
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,690
You've become unruly.

272
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,290
Don't be upset, Father.

273
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,690
Xue Beng

274
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,140
is too much of a free spirit.

275
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,930
Your cold hasn't been getting better.

276
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,410
So please take care of your health.

277
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,890
Combination poison?

278
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,380
Yes.

279
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,500
His Majesty's condition
is due to a poison

280
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,830
created from many types of poison.

281
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,990
It's because you pointed out
his inability to recover,

282
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,740
so I looked into it further.

283
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,020
Indeed, there's foul play at work.

284
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,050
I need to tell Father.

285
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:07,650
Wait.

286
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,100
Sit down.

287
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,740
Before we find an anecdote,

288
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,410
it's better not to alert
the perpetrator.

289
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,500
Otherwise, it could do
more harm than good.

290
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,020
Occasionally, I'd smell

291
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,380
a distinct spice on the Crown Prince.

292
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,410
It's a spice required

293
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,740
to make combination poison.

294
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,620
Why would Qinghe wish to harm Father?

295
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,380
I don't know.

296
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,690
Right now, it's only an inference.

297
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,890
But moving forward,
you have to be more careful.

298
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,650
Make sure he doesn't see
through your act.

299
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,100
How can we treat the poison?

300
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,300
And how did the Crown Prince
get his hands on it?

301
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,140
I heard in the Martial Soul Hall,

302
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,690
there is an expert
in making combination poison.

303
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,530
Could the Crown Prince have
connections with the Martial Soul Hall?

304
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:56,990
The enemy is lurking.

305
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:58,990
If we do anything rash,

306
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,170
it might make them pull the trigger.

307
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,740
But Father's life is at stake.

308
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,260
No matter what, I have to keep him safe.

309
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,140
Grand Venom Master,

310
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,690
you are the most knowledgeable person
on toxins.

311
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,770
Could you make an anecdote?

312
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,770
Combination poisons
are the hardest to treat.

313
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,980
Without knowing how it is made,

314
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,890
it'd be nigh impossible
to produce an anecdote.

315
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,740
But I could try fighting
poison with poison

316
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
and temporarily suppress the toxins.

317
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,140
However, this move is very risky.

318
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,860
If it gets found out,
you won't be able to remain hidden.

319
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,620
Father's life is at stake.

320
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,650
Don't worry about me.

321
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,380
Emperor Xue Ye's poison
is only suppressed for now.

322
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,690
Also, Xue Qinghe already knows.

323
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,570
You are more well-versed
in toxins than me.

324
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,100
Perhaps you could ideate some anecdotes.

325
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,290
Xue Beng has the poisonous pills.

326
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,340
When I see him,

327
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,650
I'll tell him to bring it to you.

328
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:57,620
Okay.

329
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,650
A combination poison is slow-acting.

330
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,890
Long-term consumption

331
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,810
does make it hard to detect.

332
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,980
The person who administered the poison
must be an expert.

333
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,290
I doubt you'd find His Majesty's poison
anywhere else in the continent.

334
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,020
I've heard that some members

335
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,530
of the Martial Soul Hall
specializes in combination poison.

336
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,180
Only those scoundrels would be capable

337
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,290
of such cruel and vicious acts.

338
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,740
You want to help Xue Beng,

339
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,810
but you must take caution.

340
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,290
After all, Xue Qinghe working with
the Martial Soul Hall

341
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,380
is still only an assumption.

342
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,090
There's no concrete evidence
to back it up.

343
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,700
If it wasn't Xue Qinghe,

344
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,290
who could have the power

345
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,730
to provide cover for those soul masters
to sneak into Tiandou?

346
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,180
And how would their soul master legion

347
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,700
managed to ambush Qibao Amber Sect
and Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan?

348
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,220
Qibao Amber Sect and Blue Lightning
Tyrant Dragon Clan

349
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,500
were attacked?

350
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,220
More than two-thirds

351
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,940
of Qibao Amber Sect was annihilated.

352
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,150
They escaped to Tiandou City.

353
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,130
Meanwhile, the Blue Lightning
Tyrant Dragon Clan has perished

354
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,740
from the face of the earth.

355
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,050
How is Master Yu?

356
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,260
Yu Xiaogang and Liu Erlong
were in Shrek Academy

357
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,290
and were spared.

358
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,740
Some disciples were away on errands

359
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,050
and managed to escape too.

360
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,330
But only a handful of members remain.

361
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,260
One of the Upper Three Clans

362
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,020
is no more.

363
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,900
To cope with the crisis,

364
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,420
Grandmaster Yu was conferred
as the national chaplain.

365
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,880
He is given the authority
to command the army of soul masters.

366
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,420
He is currently training Tiandou's
own legion of soul masters.

367
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,220
They hope to be able to stand up
to the Martial Soul Hall.

368
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,740
The Martial Soul Hall is brazen indeed.

369
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,050
Not just brazen.

370
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,260
Bi Bi Dong has ordered for a reselection
of the seven major sects.

371
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,660
Everyone knows

372
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,020
they're greedy wolves.

373
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,260
Not only did they harm Wu,

374
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,850
they also took out the Upper Two Clans.

375
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,330
Now they're scheming to control
every soul master in the world.

376
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,460
Wu?

377
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,810
What's happened to the girl?

378
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,500
Wu was the one who gave me this
Hectomillennium Soul Ring.

379
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,090
Did she present...

380
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,760
The Martial Soul Hall
was hunting down Wu.

381
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,980
She had managed to escape.

382
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,220
But in order to save me,

383
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,180
she fought with them.

384
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:22,610
She wasn't spared.

385
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,700
As long as I'm alive,

386
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,020
I swear I'd remove the filth
of the Martial Soul Hall.

387
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,460
Otherwise, I would've lived in vain.

388
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,900
I too, will make them pay.

389
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,770
Old Freak,

390
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,940
I have to go.

391
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,660
Wait.

392
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,660
Little Devil.

393
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,700
Don't do anything reckless.

394
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,660
You're no match
for the Martial Soul Hall right now.

395
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,420
I understand.

396
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,260
Openly challenging
the Martial Soul Hall now

397
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,460
will be like an ant
trying to shake the tree.

398
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,290
I won't repeat my father's mistake.

399
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,900
I will slowly accumulate power.

400
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,390
If one does not act, then so be it.

401
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,090
But when action is taken,
it will be thorough and complete.

402
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,650
How come the number of soul masters
in the strong attack group

403
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,920
has diminished by a third today?

404
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,050
It's not just them.

405
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,500
Ma Hongjun and Zhuqing's
agile attack group,

406
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,020
as well as Rongrong and Mubai's
support group

407
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,020
also had less than half show up today.

408
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,660
Is military training
some kind of child's play?

409
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,130
Erlong,

410
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,130
relay my order.

411
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,800
Tell them to come immediately.

412
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,090
Okay.

413
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,460
Forget it.

414
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,770
I'm the one who let them rest.

415
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:36,770
Why?

416
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,090
They've been training non-stop.

417
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,660
They can't even get out of bed now.

418
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,460
Imperial Chaplain,

419
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,570
every soul master
is the nation's treasure.

420
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,330
The way you're training them,

421
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,740
there's no need for outside forces.

422
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,460
They'd collapse on their own.

423
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,330
Marshal,

424
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,900
don't question my methods.

425
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,530
As a member of Tiandou's
soul master legion,

426
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,180
they must have good stamina.

427
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,370
Especially the strong attack group.

428
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,770
Right now, their stress resistance
is too weak.

429
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,050
They can't even handle
the daily training.

430
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,050
Not to mention survival
and rapid improvement

431
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,480
in a simulated training environment.

432
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,850
If I placed them in a one-on-one fight

433
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,660
with a fierce beast,

434
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,850
I doubt they'd be able to survive.

435
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,220
Don't be ridiculous.

436
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,900
You claim to be training soul masters,

437
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,320
but just make us running.

438
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,420
You're just humiliating us.

439
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,350
That's right.

440
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,810
I am a level 50 soul king.

441
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,610
Why should I listen to a soul order?

442
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,470
Return immediately

443
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,980
and continue training.

444
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,700
Or else, you'd pay the consequence.

445
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,370
Marshal,

446
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,420
we're soul masters,

447
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,090
not livestock.

448
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,610
I'll quit if I have to.

449
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,460
It's still better than dying here.

450
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,850
Even a Grand Soul Master

451
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,570
wouldn't be able to endure this torture

452
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,810
without the use of soul power.

453
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,660
Am I right?

454
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,770
- Yeah.
- That's right.

455
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,330
Imperial Chaplain,

456
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,570
soul masters talk with their powers.

457
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,980
Reasoning won't work.

458
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,090
The trainer needs to be
physically able themselves.

459
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,610
At least, whatever orders I give,

460
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,500
I am able to complete them myself.

461
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,850
Can you walk the talk,

462
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,940
Imperial Chaplain?

463
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,460
What you say makes sense, Marshal.

464
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:17,900
Today,

465
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,090
so long as I'm still standing,

466
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,050
none of you gets to rest.

467
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,130
You lot,

468
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,370
get back in line!

469
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,330
Erlong,

470
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,330
you will supervise.

471
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,320
I will train alongside them.

472
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,090
Okay.

473
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,770
The student should do the work.

474
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:38,770
Mr. Yu,

475
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,220
allow me to train with them.

476
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,700
I'd like to see

477
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,740
how hard the training is

478
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,570
to make the legion whine about it.

479
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,090
Sir.

480
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:51,940
San.

481
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:53,740
Who are you?

482
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,000
This is the Tiandou soul master
legion's training grounds.

483
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,320
Who allowed you to storm in here?

484
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,610
I'm the grandmaster's disciple.

485
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,420
I will prove it to you guys

486
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,500
that my teacher's reasoning is right.

487
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,130
I will train with you
on behalf of my teacher.

488
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,490
However much you have to do,

489
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,050
I'll do twice the amount.

490
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,180
What? Twice the amount?

491
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,050
Young man,

492
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,570
don't be too arrogant.

493
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,900
I'm not being arrogant.

494
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,500
It's just that my strength
doesn't allow me to be humble.

495
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,980
If I'm able to do it,

496
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,570
I'd like you to apologize to my teacher.

497
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,850
Do you know whom you're speaking to?

498
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,290
Marshal, sir.

499
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,900
Could it be you're scared
to take the bet?

500
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,570
Fine.

501
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,090
And what if you lose?

502
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,420
What are you going to do then, Imperial Chaplain?

503
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,900
I will relinquish the Tiger Tally.

504
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,010
I'll ask His Majesty for forgiveness

505
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,330
and never interfere
with military affairs again.

506
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,610
Okay.

507
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,370
(Shrek Academy)

508
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,020
Mr. Yu,

509
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,050
please instruct.

510
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,290
San,

511
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,180
under a 30 percent
pressure field Mr. Zhao creates,

512
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,390
I want you to run 20 laps.

513
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,690
You're not allowed to use
soul power or techniques.

514
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,260
Mr. Zhao,

515
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,900
please give me
a 60 percent gravity field.

516
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,610
Hang on.

517
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,850
Since it's a bet between you and I,

518
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,570
then I'll create the pressure.

519
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,610
That's more fair.

520
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,810
Marshal,

521
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,700
do you want to do it yourself

522
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,020
so you could secretly sabotage it

523
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,810
and put our San in a losing position?

524
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,700
I am the commander of three armies.

525
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,700
I wouldn't use such lowly tactics.

526
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,100
Besides, the master and student
surely share a bond.

527
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,980
They could very well gang up on me.

528
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,260
What should I do then?

529
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,700
Ms. Erlong,

530
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,090
obey the Marshal.

531
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,740
Young man,

532
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,810
you're very brave.

533
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,740
I won't go easy on you.

534
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,050
Please.

535
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,020
Let's begin.

536
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,370
Marshal is personally
creating the pressure field

537
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,390
and still the guy
is able to run nimble-footed.

538
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,050
Is the pressure lacking?

539
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:34,610
Help me...

540
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,500
Help me!

541
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,660
Young man,

542
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,130
my soul power pressure field

543
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,220
is stronger than
Zhao Wuji's control field.

544
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,700
If you can't take it,

545
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,610
speak up.

546
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,180
If you got hurt,

547
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,290
I'm not responsible.

548
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,500
You can increase 10 percent more
soul power, Marshal.

549
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,530
Don't worry.

550
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,020
Trust in San.

551
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,990
He wouldn't do something
he wasn't confident of.

552
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,770
Hopefully you're not
overestimating yourself.

553
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,530
Get up.

554
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,500
It's the 19th lap.

555
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,500
Young man,

556
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,220
it's the last lap.

557
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,500
Do you dare take on
10 percent more pressure?

558
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,530
Show me where your limit is.

559
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,810
Alright.

560
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,370
But moving forward, you must not get
in the way of Mr. Yu's training again.

561
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,900
If you're able to handle it,

562
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,330
I promise to leave Tiandou City and
not question the Imperial Chaplain again.

563
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,850
If you can't handle it,

564
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,330
I will stop immediately.

565
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,020
I won't put your life in danger.

566
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,980
San!

567
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:08,940
Sir,

568
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,050
I can do it.

569
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,130

So can you guys!

597
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,180
Young man,

00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,740
what is your name?

599
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,530
Are you really the Imperial Chaplain's student?

600
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,940
I am Tang San.

601
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,330
I trained under Mr. Yu since young.

602
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,980
I'm currently level 60.

603
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,530

Now, apologize to my teacher.

607
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,260
Imperial Chaplain,

608
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,980
I solemnly apologize for my actions.

609
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,420
To be able to produce
an outstanding disciple like Tang San,

610
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,900
you must know something I don't.

611
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,500
I will not interfere
with the legion's training

612
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,370
ever again.

613
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,740
I will report back to the Crown Prince

614
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,050
and return to the army.

615
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,290
Sorry, sir.

616
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,770
It was rude of me.

617
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,970
I deserve to be punished.

618
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,180
Marshal,

619
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,130
I accept your apology.

620
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,810
I challenged you
in order to help my teacher

621
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,770
establish his authority.

622
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,420
I hope you'll understand, sir.

623
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,330
It's nothing.

624
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,900
Today, you and your teacher

625
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,370
gave the men a good lesson today.

626
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,660
Even I learned something new.

627
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,180
As for you guys,

628
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,330
listen up.

629
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,500
The Martial Soul Hall
is every soul master's enemy.

630
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,910
They're a formidable opponent.

631
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,940
Sooner or later, Tiandou
will have to face them head on.

632
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,260
If you do not wish to shed blood
on the battlefield,

633
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,220
then you must drip sweat now.

634
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,020
Understand?

635
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,610
Understood.

636
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,090
The Tiger Tally is still out there.

637
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,590
There's no need to fuss over it.

638
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,180
You don't know
how formidable Yu Xiaogang is.

639
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,530
With him leading the soul master legion,

640
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,660
they will be our biggest obstacle.

641
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,900
The plan needs to be accelerated.

642
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,220
You'll support me

643
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,220
to take out Tiandou's
soul master legion.

644
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:54,370
I would think that claiming such a legion
for ourselves is the better move.

645
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,940
Eliminating them would be a waste.

646
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,090
Or perhaps, you could send someone
to secretly kill off Yu Xiaogang.

647
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,130
That'd save us a fight.

648
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,700
No.

649
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,660
Why?

650
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,020
Yu Xiaogang is the Martial Soul
Hall's honorary elder.

651
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,120
He must not be harmed.

652
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,850
Grand Sword Master of Qibao Amber Sect

653
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,020
was also an honorary elder.

654
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,000
You didn't hesitate in...

655
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,010
Do not doubt my decisions.

656
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,900
Carrying out my orders

657
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,980
is your only job in Tiandou.

658
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,900
Regarding Tiandou,

659
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,050
I have my own plan.

660
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,810
I will let you know
when the time is right.

661
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,490
After the Operation Clan Hunt,

662
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,350
the Martial Soul Hall
has suffered huge losses.

663
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,950
We can't afford any big moves right now.

664
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,280
This is what the Elder Hall thinks too.

665
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,740
There has been quite a few complaints
about your constant itch for war.

666
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,020
You can't pressure me
with the Elder Hall.

667
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,500
A double sacrifice.

668
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,130
That silly child.

669
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,770
The suffering you've endured,

670
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,180
I will make sure
it wasn't in vain.

671
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,180
Wu...

672
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,020
Martial Soul Hall.

673
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,420
I, Ma Hongjun, will go to hell with you!

674
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,130
Fatty!

675
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:51,530
The wise

676
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,330
does not seek instant success.

677
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,810
It's not the time

678
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,500
to challenge the Martial Soul Hall yet.

679
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,570
What I want to do now

680
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,570
is to quickly resurrect Wu.

681
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,870
Then, I'd take her with me
to the Martial Soul Hall

682
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,220
and avenge

683
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,500
her and all those soul masters who died

684
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,570
at their hands.

685
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,260
It's good to take it slow.

686
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,220
Right,

687
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,290
San?

688
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,460
I'm fine.

689
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,370
Xiaogang.

690
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,220
Instead of feeling sad,

691
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,090
we should become stronger.

692
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,260
Strengthen...

693
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,460
Xiaogang.

694
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,020
- Mr. Yu!
- Mr. Yu!

695
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:53,740
Xiaogang,

696
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,220
don't get up.

697
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,220
Lie down. What are you doing getting up?

698
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,370
I need to prepare
for tomorrow's training.

699
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,260
Sir.

700
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,290
I came back this time

701
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,130
because I have a lot of questions.

702
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,460
I can't have you collapse.

703
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,090
You need to help me with the answers.

704
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,210
Yes.

705
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,380
Did you forget your own teachings?

706
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,340
You told the kids never to chase
instant success.

707
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,610
Yet you're forgetting

708
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,130
that haste makes waste.

709
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,690
What's more important is,

710
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,680
if you collapse, be it getting treated
or taking medication,

711
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,690
it all requires money.

712
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,940
Oh, shut up you.

713
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,050
Sir,

714
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,460
this is a Dragon Leaf.

715
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,920
It has recuperative properties.

716
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,980
You're overworked.

717
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,300
Take it

718
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,380
and you'll recover
after a few days of rest.

719
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,690
No.

720
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,570
The legion's training cannot be delayed.

721
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,380
Xiaogang!

722
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,820
Why are you so stubborn?

723
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,080
Sharpening the knife does not delay
the chopping of wood.

724
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,570
It's not too late to go back
once you're recovered.

725
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,050
I am ordering you to rest
as the academy dean!

726
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,900
There's Erlong and Wuji.

727
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,300
The training will continue as usual.

728
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,210
Besides,

729
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,900
we have another helper now.

730
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,530
Right?

731
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,050
That's right.

732
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,090
Okay.

733
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,570
Let me lie down.

734
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,300
I'll rest.

735
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:20,820
San.

736
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,940
Sadness weighs heavily on the heart.

737
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,570
But don't let it consume you.

738
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,900
You need to look forward.

739
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,420
Yes, sir.

740
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:31,860
Okay.

741
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,460
Come.

742
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,650
I'll help you.

743
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,210
San.

744
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,300
You just got back.

745
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,900
Go and rest early.

746
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,650
San.

747
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,300
The room is the same one.

748
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,420
I kept it for you.

749
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,780
Thank you, Ms. Erlong.

750
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,300
I shall leave too, then.

751
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,690
We haven't had a drink in a long time.

752
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,320
How about we get drunk tonight?

753
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,690
Boss Dai,

754
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,890
you don't have to worry about me.

755
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,900
I don't feel like drinking tonight.

756
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,340
Don't keep the worries to yourself.

757
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:44,780
Zhuqing said it before.

758
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,280
Better to drink and share
than keeping things bottled up.

759
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,190
If one bottle is not enough,
we'll have another.

760
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,570
We can drink while we share.

761
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,940
If one bottle isn't enough,

762
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,750
we can go back
and talk over another bottle.

763
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,250
I doubt Zhuqing said that.

764
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,430
Why would I lie to you?

765
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,790
- Come, let's go in.
- Boss Dai.

766
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,170
I'm fine, really.

767
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,530
You have to be up early tomorrow
to help Mr. Yu train the soul masters.

768
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,610
You need the energy.

769
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,690
Go on back and sleep early.

770
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,980
Well, take the wine anyway.

let's fight.

775
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,340
What?

776
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,900
You need to vent.

777
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,760
When your mind is stuck,
let the body fight.

00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,100

779
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,500
Ouch! That hurt!

780
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,990
Stop pretending.
I didn't even put any strength into it.

781
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,610
I only wanted to let you vent a little.

782
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,460
It's because you always keep
everything to yourself.

783
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,650
Wu taught me this.

784
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,300
Yes, it does sound like
what she would say.

785
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,970
I can spar with you as much as you want.

786
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,900
Thank you, Zhuqing.

787
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,340
But I'm very calm right now.

788
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,980
I just want to train in solitude.

789
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,210
If I ever feel
like I need to vent my frustrations,

790
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,530
I will look for you then.

791
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:18,530
Okay.

792
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,250
Whenever you feel like fighting,

793
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,820

San,

796
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,090
I made this specially for you.

797
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,980
I can guarantee its warmth and comfort.

798
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,090
Thank you,

799
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:39,650
Rongrong.

800
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,480
No need to thank me.

801
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,780
I made it for Wu.

802
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,940
I went over some old tomes today.

803
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,570
Although there are few records

804
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,380
on how to resurrect after a sacrifice,

805
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,050
I managed to find some information.

806
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,410
As for the Decade Millennium
Grade Nine Ginseng King,

807
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,790
I've sent some Qibao Amber Sect disciples
to search for it.

808
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,050
We will do everything we can
to resurrect Wu.

809
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,650
So San,

810
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,050
make sure you look after yourself.

811
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:05,980
Thank you.

812
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,570
Rest early.

813
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:13,940
San...

814
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:15,900
San.

815
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,900
I'm fine, really.

816
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:18,900
No need to worry.

817
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,500
Okay.

818
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,410
Then take these
mood-lifting magical items,

819
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,300
and I'll leave you be.

I was hoping not to avoid
giving excessive attention

827
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,690
in case it gave San more pressure.

828
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,940
Who knew we would all have
the same idea?

829
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,380

Rongrong.

832
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,050
We got a message from Qibao Amber Sect.

833
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,080
It said many patients
suddenly started burning up.

834
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,930
The medicine in stock is running out,
so they need you back o oversee the matter.

835
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,090
I will go back straight away.

836
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:40,780
Hang on.

837
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,080
I have some medicine here.

838
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:42,980
It should be useful.

839
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,020
Rongrong,

840
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,500
I'll go with you.
When we see their actual condition,

841
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,410
I'll be able to prescribe
the right medication.

842
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,250
All of us will go.

843
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,290
Be it dispensing medicine or carrying
the patients, we can handle them all.

844
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,480
Let's go then.

845
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:58,860
Let's go.

846
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,380
Go on.

847
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,420
The heat wave is spreading
at an alarming speed.

848
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,170
Spontaneous abdominal pain,
weak pulse,

849
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,380
high fever and chills,

850
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,820
symptoms of the Taiyin disease.

851
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,050
Fatty,

852
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,570
go look for peonies.

853
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,120
Crush them up with these two herbs
and give it to the patients.

854
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,170
Apply it onto the wounds

855
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,720
as it can remove toxins
and relieve heat.

856
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,570
Got it.

857
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:24,820
Rongrong,

858
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,210
I'll take a look over there.

859
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:27,980
You'll be okay soon.

860
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,380
Don't touch me.

861
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,290
I don't need treatment!

862
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,090
Over here.

863
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,530
Leave me alone.

864
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:06,820
Quick, come and check him out.

865
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,780
Hurry up!

866
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:11,380
I scared you, huh?

867
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,090
What's the matter?

868
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,020
I got the medication.

869
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,300
Your injuries are severe.

870
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,720
If you don't get them treated,

871
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:22,980
your life could be in danger.

872
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,980
Use this medicine.

873
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:24,900
You'll slowly heal.

874
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,650
I said I don't need it!

875
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,650
I'm better dead.

876
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:33,890
Here's the medicine.

877
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,460
You may not want it,

878
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:42,990
but what about the rest?

879
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,500
So just leave me be.

880
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,300
Go and save them.

881
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,300
I don't deserve it.

882
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,460
I am not giving up on anyone

883
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,420
from the Qibao Amber Sect.

884
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,460
Hold him down.

885
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,170
Sorry, my man.

886
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,050
I'm a cripple!

887
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,780
What's the use of living?

888
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,570
Being alive

889
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,690
is of the biggest use.

890
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,500
Being alive?

891
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,020
But my brothers died because of me.

892
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,460
If I couldn't even protect those
who are important to me,

893
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,530
what's the point of my life?

894
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,610
What is the point?

895
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,240
(My only wish is to turn into
a vengeful ghost.)

896
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,050
(I'll bring those
Martial Soul Hall people)

897
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,420
