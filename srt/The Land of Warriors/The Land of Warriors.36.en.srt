disperse!

00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,490
Are you okay?

7
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,140
Are you worried about me?

Look.

11
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:12,688
Judging from
the Haipo Brothers' expressions,

12
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,380
I assume they're severely poisoned.

This is our reward.

20
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:41,140
This is first bucket of gold

21
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,210
we earned together.

22
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,770
This isn't ours.

23
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,848
This belongs to everyone.

24
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,580
Let's hand it to Cousin San later.

Fengxiang Duo!

35
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:07,536
Fatty, you must be kidding me.

36
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,580
You actually won?

37
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:11,980
It's all thanks to Xiang
for drawing their attention.

38
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,770
She bought enough time
for my Phoenix Roar Air Strike.

39
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,410
It's his idea.

40
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,700
He should claim credit for that.

41
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,330
Xiang.

42
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,500
Here.

43
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:27,140
Recover some stamina and soul power.

44
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,336
Land soul masters defeated

45
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:34,040
ocean soul masters of the same level.

46
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,392
This is my first time seeing it.

47
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,090
It has broadened my horizons indeed.

48
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,056
We already saw
how the ocean soul masters fought

49
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:40,210
when we observed the battle.

50
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,450
But that was a close shave indeed.

51
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:43,744
I'm glad that you guys are fine.

52
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:45,380
Sorry for making you guys worried.

53
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,850
Next time, I'll be more cautious.

54
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,850
I'll try not to put myself in danger.

55
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,970
Next time, it's my turn.

56
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,260
Lord Soul King!

57
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,770
Lord Soul King,

58
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,650
the Haipo Brothers
are still unconscious.

59
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
Our physicians can't
do anything about them either.

60
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:01,580
Please...

61
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,580
It's fine.

62
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,820
I'll check on them.

63
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:04,820
Okay.

64
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:06,208
Over here, please.

65
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,496
Lord Soul King.

66
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:16,992
Over here.

67
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,820
They've recovered.

68
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,450
All done.

69
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,450
Look.

70
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,020
They've recovered.

71
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,180
Sorry about that,

72
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,620
guys.

73
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:46,090
I won the battle with my wits.

74
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,580
If it's a battle of brawn,

75
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,290
I definitely am no match for you guys.

76
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,850
Thank you, Lord Soul King.

77
00:05:57,904 --> 00:05:59,020
Thank you, Lord Soul King.

78
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,450
Don't mention it.

79
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,760
Thank you, Lord Soul King.

80
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,210
Everyone,

81
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,890
do you guys have any plans?

82
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,210
If not,

83
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,410
why don't you guys

84
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,940
try out the exciting programs
we have in Hanhai City?

85
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,820
How exciting are they?

86
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,740
You can fish

87
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:17,940
and surf.

88
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,530
I have a boat.

89
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,700
You can go anywhere you like.

90
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,620
Surf, huh?

91
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,850
Mr. Hai wants to take us to sea.

92
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:26,290
I don't think we should let him down.

93
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,620
Alright.

94
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,090
I'll come up with a plan now.

95
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,260
Mr. Hai,

96
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:32,700
we want to head to Haishen Island.

97
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,820
Haishen Island?

98
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,290
That's right.

99
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,740
That island has many

100
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,210
mystical ocean soul beasts
and ocean soul masters.

101
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:46,720
However, we shouldn't
head there casually.

102
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,210
What's wrong?

103
00:06:48,256 --> 00:06:50,448
Do you not have the guts
to head to Haishen Island?

104
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,290
Of course I can head there.

105
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,940
But it's too risky.

106
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,090
If we can't avoid the ocean soul beasts,

107
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,620
there's no returning.

108
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,380
However,

109
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,820
I lived on the sea since young.

110
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,890
There's already

111
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,410
a complete map of the sea

112
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,330
in my mind.

113
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:28,928
I know all about the areas
where the ocean soul beasts thrive.

114
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,580
As for

115
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,890
the experience required to avoid danger,

116
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,500
I'll have to charge you extra for that.

117
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,290
Rongrong,

118
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,700
pay Mr. Hai the deposit for now.

119
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,820
I have something to say.

120
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,140
All of you are unfamiliar with the sea.

121
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,224
If you don't have a guide
while you're on the sea,

122
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,096
then you guys possibly
won't be returning.

123
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,090
Alright!

124
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,820
If I don't take on this trip,

125
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:18,880
no one else will be daring enough
to take it on.

126
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,970
Mr. Hai, you can set the price.

127
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,060
We'll do our best to ensure your safety.

128
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,890
But we'll only pay you
a 10% deposit for now.

129
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,688
We'll pay you the remaining sum
after we reach Haishen Island.

130
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,180
Fine.

131
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,776
I'm doing it because
we have an affinity with each other.

132
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,050
I need to head back
and get my crew members.

133
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,530
All of them are experienced sailors.

134
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,260
Mr. Hai,

135
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,290
we have one question for you.

136
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:46,170
Before heading to Haishen Island,

137
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,620
we wish to find a soul tool

138
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,380
that can help us navigate the deep sea.

139
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,770
You're very resourceful.

140
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,992
I wonder if you've heard of
such a tool before.

141
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,860
I know an old sailor.

142
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,860
He has navigated the sea for 30 years.

143
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,980
I heard that he explored

144
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,570
all the surrounding seas
when he was young.

145
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,220
He owns an antique shop now.

146
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,460
As for the soul tool you mentioned,

147
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,980
that's the treasure of his shop.

148
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:15,290
Please recommend us to him.

149
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,100
It's pointless to head there.

150
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,340
Many ocean soul masters tried to
buy it from him before.

151
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,770
He chased all of them away.

152
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,890
I was wondering

153
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,770
if the tool was broken long ago.

154
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,890
Maybe he was just using it as a gimmick.

155
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,976
We'll only know

156
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:30,970
whether it'll work out or not
after giving it a try.

157
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,240
No matter what's the result,

158
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:35,170
we won't pay you a single cent less
for your commission.

159
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:37,770
Alright, then.

160
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,170
If it doesn't work out,
just take it as a wasted trip.

161
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,840
You guys, come with me.

162
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,460
Fatty,

163
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,620
Ao, and Rongrong,

164
00:09:46,704 --> 00:09:47,968
we shall head there together.

165
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:50,140
Boss Dai, you guys
should wait for us at the pier.

166
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,500
Take care of Wu for me.

167
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,690
Rest assured.

168
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,410
Let's go.

169
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,660
(Antique)

170
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,260
This is the shop
owned by the old navigator.

171
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,190
You must address him
respectfully as Elder Ocean.

172
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,690
Understood?

173
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,650
Let's go.

174
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:11,520
This is Elder Ocean,
the most experienced navigator

175
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:13,930
in Hanhai City.

176
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,530
Elder Ocean,

177
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:17,050
I brought some new friends for you.

178
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,290
What do you like?

179
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,170
Take a look around.

180
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,170
Elder Ocean,

181
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,570
I'm Tang San.

182
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,930
Do you have any soul tools

183
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,810
that we can use underwater?

184
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,530
Are you guys

185
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:51,690
heading out to the sea?

186
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,260
That's right.

187
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,140
We came from the continental cities.

188
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,408
We're heading to Haishen Island.

189
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,340
We heard that you
have a useful soul tool.

190
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,784
That's why we came here to visit you.

191
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,530
Wait, land soul masters
are heading to Haishen Island?

192
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:05,050
You guys are quite bold.

193
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,770
Go back.

194
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,220
I'm not selling it
to some brash and young

195
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,380
soul masters.

196
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,530
Although we're land soul masters,

197
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,100
we're not inferior
to ocean soul masters.

198
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:32,570
Why are you guys
heading to Haishen Island?

199
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:33,980
To undergo training.

200
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,100
Land soul masters, you guys
might not be able to return

201
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:38,400
from Haishen Island, you know?

202
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,570
We have no choice.

203
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,648
If we don't make things difficult
for ourselves,

204
00:11:41,648 --> 00:11:43,260
Martial Soul Hall will do it for us.

205
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,520
So we have to boost
our strength as soon as possible.

206
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,050
Form a feud with Martial Soul Hall?

207
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,690
You guys?

208
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,380
It's more than just a feud.

209
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,530
We're their sworn enemies.

210
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,740
That's crazy.

211
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:55,980
Youngsters,

212
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,220
wait here.

213
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,860
I'll show you guys
something amazing today.

214
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,260
This can navigate on the sea

215
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,290
and underwater as well.

216
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,770
This is also known
as the Conqueror of the Seas.

217
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,530
This is Dragon Boat.

218
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,140
Dragon Boat?

219
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,170
So, it can dive underwater?

220
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:32,930
Of course.

221
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,570
If you encounter a storm on the sea,

222
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,770
it can dive into the sea immediately.

223
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,220
How many people can it carry, then?

224
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,170
Its length is about 12m.

225
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,530
The thickest part has a diameter of 2m.

226
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,290
It can carry around 15 people.

227
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,460
If so, this is exactly what we need.

228
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,460
Elder Ocean,

229
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,170
I wonder how much you're selling it for?

230
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,650
We can talk about the price later.

231
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,890
You guys have
to answer my question first.

232
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,410
First question,
it is the cradle of life.

233
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,100
However,
it can take your life at any time.

234
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:13,740
It's generous and magnanimous,

235
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,500
yet it cannot tolerate being controlled.

236
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,620
Sometimes, it's gentle,
and it answers your every call.

237
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,140
Sometimes, it rages,
and it roars at you.

238
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,570
What is it?

239
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,020
It's Ms. Erlong!

240
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,690
It's the sea.

241
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,050
That's right.

242
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,260
Since you could answer that,

243
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,810
that means you understand
the nature of the sea.

244
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,340
It's unpredictable.

245
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,810
You guys are friends, right?

246
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,650
Good.

247
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,340
Here's my question.

248
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,410
Navigating the sea means

249
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:46,560
that you'll encounter
unpredictable situations.

250
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,810
If, you guys are in danger,

251
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,410
and one of you has to be sacrificed,

252
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,650
who will you guys sacrifice?

253
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,620
No one.

254
00:13:52,656 --> 00:13:54,570
We have to be responsible
for ourselves first.

255
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,050
We can protect other people
once we can protect ourselves.

256
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:58,560
I know the answer to your question.

257
00:13:58,592 --> 00:13:59,980
It doesn't matter what happens.

258
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,650
No matter the kind of danger we're in,

259
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,890
no one should back down.

260
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,050
Just charge ahead.

261
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,220
What a shame.

262
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,500
I didn't realize that sooner in life.

263
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:11,460
I tried to act tough in the past.

264
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,500
My friends were sacrificed
because of that.

265
00:14:14,464 --> 00:14:16,384
It takes a lot of courage
to explore the sea.

266
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,500
This is my last question.

267
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:21,696
If you encounter a group of
ferocious ocean soul beasts underwater,

268
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,232
and they damage the Dragon Boat,

269
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,930
are you guys daring enough
to fight against them?

270
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,020
Have you lost your mind?

271
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,170
How is that possible?

272
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,220
The deal is off.

273
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,456
It's not embarrassing to escape.

274
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,260
Surviving

275
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:33,690
is the only thing that matters.

276
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,650
Excellent.

277
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,570
Excellent words.

278
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:38,140
You're daring enough
to do what you can do

279
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,100
and refuse the things you shouldn't.

280
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,930
You possess wisdom and courage.

281
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,020
I'll sell you guys

282
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,340
my Dragon Boat.

283
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:49,220
You're selling it to us already?

284
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,810
This is not a joke, right?

285
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,530
Elder Ocean truly loves the sea.

286
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,290
That's why he asked us
all those questions.

287
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,260
The Dragon Boat
can change its form easily

288
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,020
and is portable as well.

289
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,980
It can definitely help you guys out.

290
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,020
You guys must keep it well.

291
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,290
However, do not use it
to commit despicable deeds.

292
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,530
If not, the sea will
teach you guys a harsh lesson.

293
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,260
We're heading to Haishen Island

294
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,770
to improve our cultivation.

295
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,930
We're doing so to change the world

296
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,620
and change the situation
in Douluo Continent.

297
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,570
It has left the sea for too long.

298
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:35,260
Being able
to go on adventures with you all

299
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,340
might be

300
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,380
its best destiny.

301
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:41,890
Thank you, Elder Ocean.

302
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,690
Welcome to the Sea Devil.

303
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,100
Besides me,

304
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,290
there's one first mate

305
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,340
and four crew members.

306
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:20,896
Captain Hai,

307
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:22,368
how do you deal with the ferocious

308
00:16:22,384 --> 00:16:23,184
ocean soul beasts

309
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,160
when you encounter them?

310
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,020
Although ocean soul beasts
may seem ferocious and violent,

311
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,650
if you don't provoke them

312
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,380
or attack their territories,

313
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,930
they won't be enraged.

314
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,890
If so, they won't attack our ship.

315
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,980
However, if you guys provoke them

316
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,290
by accident,

317
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,890
and they become enraged,

318
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:50,432
you can only blame
yourselves for being unlucky by then.

319
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:55,100
Mr. Hai, you're a veteran of the sea.

320
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,690
Please lead the way.

321
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,410
Just leave it to me.

322
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,980
Remove the anchor!

323
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,410
Set sail!

324
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,370
Set sail!

325
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,220
Let's depart!

326
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,420
Stop acting tough.

327
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,330
Go and throw up.

328
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:47,664
It's pointing to
the northwest of Hanhai City.

329
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,130
Indeed. We're heading to Haishen Island.

330
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,260
Wu?

331
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,370
What's wrong?

332
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,850
Father!

333
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:01,740
Father.

334
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,330
Seems like

335
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
they're seasick.

336
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,900
Come here.

337
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:20,980
Are you seasick?

338
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:22,420
Just throw up.

339
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:24,096
You'll feel better after throwing up.

340
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:26,220
You have to throw up.

341
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,370
Here.

342
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:28,528
Here's some medicine.

343
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:30,064
She'll be fine after taking this.

344
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,900
Thank you, Mr. Hai.

345
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,980
You're familiar with the sea indeed.

346
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:35,120
How long it'll take
for us to reach our destination

347
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,900
according to our current route?

348
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,090
It'll take eight days.

349
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:39,550
But we'll be entering

350
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,610
a region where
the ocean soul beasts are more active

351
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:42,940
after half a day.

352
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,900
By then,

353
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,940
I'll help you guys to avoid them.

354
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,770
Alright.

355
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:47,900
Look after her.

356
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,660
(Letter of allegiance)

357
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,220
(We shall serve Martial Soul Hall.)
Reshuffling major clans is necessary.

358
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,090
The sect contest will be ranked
based on strength.

359
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:06,500
All those who participate in it

360
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,420
will usher in a new era
together with Martial Soul Hall.

361
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,416
Elephant Armored Tribe.

362
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,230
Sacred Dragon Tribe.

363
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:15,930
Black Tiger Tribe!

364
00:19:15,936 --> 00:19:16,720
The Wind Sword Tribe!

365
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,529
Fire Panther Tribe!

366
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,336
Peacock Wasp Tribe!

367
00:19:18,352 --> 00:19:19,130
Rock Antelope Tribe!

368
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:20,368
Greetings, Holy Lady!

369
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,810
All the soul masters in the world

370
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,180
are led by the Martial Soul Hall.

371
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,130
As the leader of the Seven Clans,
the Armored Elephant Tribe

372
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,370
will lead the continent's soul masters

373
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:31,472
and serve
the Martial Soul Hall in the future.

374
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,020
All of the soul masters
have submitted a joint petition.

375
00:19:34,064 --> 00:19:35,850
We're willing to honor
the Martial Soul Hall.

376
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,296
We humbly request Martial Soul Hall

377
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:39,536
to command
all of Douluo Continent's soul masters.

378
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,020
With the power of Martial Souls

379
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,500
and in the name of Her Holiness,

380
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,020
we shall lead the soul masters
of the world toward greater brilliance.

381
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,420
We shall serve Martial Soul Hall

382
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,850
with our lives!

383
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,420
I need to enter the
Rakshasa Secret Realm for my cultivation

384
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,952
in preparation for the divine test.

385
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,740
As the Holy Lady of Martial Soul Hall,

386
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,900
do you know what you're supposed to do
at this moment?

387
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,528
I'll lead the soul master army
to attack all of the territories.

388
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,672
We shall plant our flags
all over the continent

389
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:21,180
and make final preparations
for the establishment of our nation.

390
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,700
Remember,

391
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:27,360
the new Seven Great Clans
have been selected.

392
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,460
You must learn to assign positions and
appoint the right people.

393
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:32,850
Understood.

394
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,530
Go now.

395
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,370
Master,

396
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,940
I heard

397
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,336
preparing for the divine test
is an excruciating process.

398
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:40,980
You...

399
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:42,570
I can only accomplish my goals in life

400
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,700
by becoming a god.

401
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,330
Don't worry about me.

402
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,770
Just fulfill your duties.

403
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,130
Yes, Master.

404
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:02,980
Over there.

405
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,180
Come.

406
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,370
That's right, over there.

407
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,220
Tighten it.

408
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,530
You guys must learn how to regulate
yourselves during long voyages.

409
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,919
Not only must you take good food,

410
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,590
but you also
have to maintain a good mood.

411
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,940
If not, you'll get frustrated easily.

412
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:23,940
How is it?

413
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:25,180
The food is okay, right?

414
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,370
It's delicious.

415
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,020
This is the best meal we had

416
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,420
ever since we boarded the ship.

417
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,220
Don't you guys

418
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,220
feel

419
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,900
a little giddy?

420
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,770
Nope.

421
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,500
Do you feel giddy?

422
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,530
Not me.

423
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,290
I'm worried about you guys.

424
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,500
Usually,

425
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,296
soul masters would throw up
and feel giddy

426
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:48,740
for a few days upon boarding.

427
00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:50,460
We have an excellent constitution.

428
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,568
We got used to it already.

429
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,740
Mr. Hai, you're acting strange today.

430
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,810
Don't tell me you spiked our food?

431
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,408
Are you waiting for us to feel giddy?

432
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,810
You're such a jokester.

433
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:06,050
Since you've improved our meals,

434
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,248
I'll improve our mood, then.

435
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:08,816
Or it'll be boring
to spend our days

436
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:09,792
on the sea like this.

437
00:22:10,368 --> 00:22:11,090
Excellent words.

438
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,130
I'll tell you guys a joke, then.

439
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,660
Life is unpredictable.

440
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,610
Maybe

441
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,770
this is our last meal.

442
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,420
Capture them alive.

443
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,220
Hand them to Martial Soul Hall.

444
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,660
So, are you from Martial Soul Hall?

445
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,570
Thanks to you guys,

446
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,220
I'll be their member soon.

447
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,570
You guys have a deep feud
against Martial Soul Hall.

448
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,610
If I hand you guys to them,

449
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,460
I'll definitely have
a bright future ahead of me.

450
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,610
I'm afraid you won't get
what you wished for.

451
00:23:04,352 --> 00:23:05,290
How could this be?

452
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,370
Are you curious

453
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,420
as to why
your men fell unconscious first?

454
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,740
I found out

455
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,420
that our meals were spiked by accident.

456
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,130
That's very thoughtful of you guys.

457
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,370
You guys should enjoy them yourselves.

458
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:23,810
Rongrong and the rest are asleep.

459
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,090
I won't wake them up.

460
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,180
I've been confirming our direction
using the compass

461
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:28,590
and the sun
for the past few days.

462
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,544
I realized that the ship
was going in circles.

463
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,570
We weren't heading
toward Haishen Island.

464
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,112
I knew something was off with them.

465
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,912
Those crew members were keeping
a close eye on us.

466
00:23:38,976 --> 00:23:40,256
I suppose they were monitoring

467
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,090
our daily routine and behaviors.

468
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,180
I'll interrogate them now.

469
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,260
Fatty,

470
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,880
do not alert them to our presence.

471
00:23:46,912 --> 00:23:48,496
We'll wait for him to give himself away.

472
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:50,096
I think he can't hold it in any longer.

473
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,850
That's right.

474
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,570
We have to be very cautious.

475
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,090
Besides, tell Xiang to examine the meals

476
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,500
when she scouts the ship.

477
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,180
You guys are pretty witty, huh?

478
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,570
This must be what you do usually.

479
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,850
You'll make up an excuse
to bring people out to the sea.

480
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,112
Then you'll get rid of them
and steal their possessions.

481
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,040
This time, you also found out that
we have a feud with Martial Soul Hall.

482
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:25,200
You wish to claim credits
by handing us to her.

483
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,980
Your ship has been going in circles.

484
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,850
Your men were monitoring us.

485
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,530
We found out long ago.

486
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,090
So what if you guys found out?

487
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,610
We're on the sea.

488
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,050
Without me,

489
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,824
none of you gets
to leave the place alive!

490
00:24:39,872 --> 00:24:40,912
All of you will die!

491
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,900
Since you wish
to serve Martial Soul Hall,

492
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,130
I cannot keep you alive.

493
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,220
No!

494
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,180
Sir, please spare me!

495
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,220
Sir, please spare me!

496
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:23,940
Sir!

497
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,810
I was just muddle-headed!

498
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,940
This ship belongs to the Purple Pearl!

499
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,420
I only wanted to
make a living in another way!

500
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,700
That's why I wanted to hand you guys
to Martial Soul Hall!

501
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:34,704
Please spare me!

502
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,460
Just tell me where you guys are heading!

503
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,500
I'll definitely send you guys there!

504
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,528
What kind of organization
is the Purple Pearl?

505
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,330
Who's the leader?

506
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,570
The Purple Pearl,

507
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,220
they live nearby.

508
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,570
We can reach

509
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,130
Purple Pearl Island in two days.

510
00:25:50,144 --> 00:25:51,728
They make a living by robbing people.

511
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,700
Their leader, Purple Pearl,

512
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,460
is

513
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,290
a Level 73 soul saint.

514
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,420
We're merely normal members.

515
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,610
We head to the pier to find victims.

516
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,940
After that, we'll rob them on the sea.

517
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,180
The possessions we've stolen

518
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,690
have to be handed to the organization.

519
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,592
Aren't the authorities
concerned about this?

520
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,610
We only rob. We don't kill.

521
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,660
And, we only target nobles.

522
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,900
If that's the case,

523
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,220
you thought we were nobles, huh?

524
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,290
Get up.

525
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,850
Lead us to Haishen Island.

526
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,330
But don't try anything funny.

527
00:26:37,504 --> 00:26:39,260
I've already sealed
your soul power away.

528
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,530
If you try something funny,

529
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,370
there's only one fate awaiting you.

530
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,370
You'll beg me to kill you.

531
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,180
Yes, sir!

532
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,180
Yes, sir!

533
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,770
San,

534
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:55,090
are we letting him off already?

535
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,290
Fatty,

536
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,940
if we get rid of him,

537
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,648
we won't be able to survive on the sea.

538
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:00,940
We'll spare him for now.

539
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,770
If he tries anything funny again,

540
00:27:03,184 --> 00:27:04,700
we'll uphold justice for the heavens.

541
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,660
Now, our identities are exposed.

542
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,130
We have to stay more alert

543
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,220
during rest.

544
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,810
From today onward,

545
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,072
we'll guard the night on shifts.

546
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,020
Rongrong,

547
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,220
look after Wu on my behalf.

548
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:15,740
Okay.

549
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,896
I'll cover the first shift.

550
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,420
(You've underestimated
the rage of a father.)

551
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:16,850
San,

552
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,420
I sense danger.

553
00:28:21,744 --> 00:28:22,910
My instinct is telling me

554
00:28:22,928 --> 00:28:23,712
that this region

555
00:28:23,712 --> 00:28:25,990
has soul beasts that are stronger
than Daming and Erming.

556
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,416
Something's off about this region.

557
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,770
Where are we?

558
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,180
You said you wanted to reach
Haishen Island as soon as possible.

559
00:28:47,344 --> 00:28:49,370
I have no choice
but to take the nearest route.

560
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,460
However, in this region,

561
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:55,456
there's a powerful being called
Magic Whale King of the Deep Sea.

562
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,020
Due to its power,

563
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,420
the God of the Ocean
stabbed its left eye.

564
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,290
Ships that are
passing through this region

565
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,552
need to navigate the route
where its left eye is located.

566
00:29:03,568 --> 00:29:04,816
It won't be provoked by then.

567
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,850
And now,

568
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,090
we're heading

569
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,330
to its right eye!

570
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,530
Listen.

571
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,850
It's too late.

572
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,770
What have you done?

573
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,850
This is a gift for you all.

574
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,660
It's a bomb we use to bomb the fishes!

575
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,810
Don't you wish to live?

576
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,290
No, I don't.

577
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,610
Do you know something?

578
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,904
The crew member you pushed
into the sea before this,

579
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,420
that was my son!

580
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,700
My only son!

581
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,770
Now, you guys will
perish together with me!

582
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,810
Listen!

583
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,260
Listen to the voice of

584
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,530
the Magic Whale King of the Deep Sea!

585
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,700
I'm sure you've never seen it before!

586
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,940
All of you shall join my son
in the afterlife!

587
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,500
Kill me.

588
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,850
This way, I can see my son sooner.

589
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,500
Your son died because of your greed.

590
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,500
You're on your own!

591
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,180
Son,

592
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,980
I'm coming

593
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,570
to meet you now.

594
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,940
What was that noise?

595
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,900
What happened?

596
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,940
Captain Hai set us up.

597
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,776
We have to leave!

598
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,130
Do it!

599
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:10,740
Ao!

600
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,220
San?

601
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,460
San?

602
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,740
Wake up.

603
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,260
San, wake up.

604
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,420
San?

605
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,980
Seven as one!

606
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:08,900
Rongrong!

607
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,700
Jiubao, reinforced with Amber!

608
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,530
Invincible Golden Shield!

609
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,130
San!

610
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:52,820
Hurry and leave with the rest!

611
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,530
San!

612
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,250
Leave this to me!

613
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:54,820
Leave!

614
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,530
San!

615
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,530
San!

616
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,650
San!

617
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,820
Purple Divine Light!

618
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,690
Leave!

619
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:37,980
Go!

620
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,420
Bring it on!

621
00:36:12,512 --> 00:36:14,000
Even if I were to die today,

622
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,020
I'll expend some of your soul power

623
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,090
and buy time for them to escape!

624
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,300
(San!)

625
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,420
(Hang in there!)

626
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,380
Wu.

627
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,250
Don't...

628
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,460
Don't save me.

629
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,820
(God of the Ocean)

630
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,650
You beast.

631
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,500
Have you forgotten the lesson
I taught you 20,000 years ago?

632
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,610
It's been 20,000 years.

633
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,380
You're closer to a dragon's evolution.

634
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,090
But,

635
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,210
that doesn't mean
you have the right to provoke me.

636
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,050
I hope my current choice

637
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,090
won't disappoint me.

638
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,340
It's a shame

639
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,050
that my strength is...

640
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,570
Their ship sank?

641
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,420
That's right.

642
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:36,240
Sea Devil, which was
the ship they boarded,

643
00:39:36,256 --> 00:39:37,500
were attacked by soul beasts.

644
00:39:37,536 --> 00:39:39,904
Both the members and the ship
are nowhere to be found.

645
00:39:40,096 --> 00:39:41,300
I assume the Shrek Seven Devils

646
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,768
are sleeping with the fishes now.

647
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,500
They've disrupted Her Holiness's plans.

648
00:39:44,576 --> 00:39:45,650
They deserve this fate.

649
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,130
No.

650
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,500
Tang San won't die that easily.

651
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,090
The re-selection of
the Seven Great Clans is over.

652
00:39:54,448 --> 00:39:55,940
According to Her Holiness's plan,

653
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,560
Hanhai City and the Purple Pearl

654
00:39:58,624 --> 00:40:01,040
were cities and organizations
that she wanted to conquer.

655
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,680
Relay my order.

656
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:02,860
We shall attack Hanhai City.

657
00:40:03,952 --> 00:40:05,376
Yes, Holy Lady.

658
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,500
Buddy,

659
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,820
hear me out.

660
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,170
He's half-dead.

661
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,456
Why are you trying to save him?

662
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,690
You'll be in trouble

663
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,530
if our leader finds out

664
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,860
that you brought an outsider here.

665
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,624
Why don't you just
toss him into the sea?

666
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,650
Our leader won't find out

667
00:40:58,688 --> 00:41:00,064
if both of us keep quiet, you know?

668
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,340
Don't think

669
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,880
that I don't know what you're thinking.

670
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,130
I've kept

671
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,500
all of his possessions away.

672
00:41:05,568 --> 00:41:06,650
Don't even think about them.

673
00:41:07,408 --> 00:41:08,780
To think that I went out to the sea

674
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,730
to help you find
the Ten Thousand Year Ginseng.

675
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,240
Is this how you treat your buddy?

676
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,460
Besides,

677
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,420
now that you're on Purple Pearl Island,

678
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,610
you're one of us.

679
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,610
How can you side with an outsider?

680
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,090
All his possessions,

681
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,170
you have to hand them to our leader.

682
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,500
Don't forget,

683
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,860
everything here belongs to our leader.

684
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,730
Why don't I tell our leader

685
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,192
about your hidden gold vault, then?

686
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:34,940
Fine, fine.

687
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:35,980
I talked too much.

688
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:36,900
I talked too much.

689
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,240
I can't afford to offend you.

690
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,460
I'll go and drink.

691
00:42:05,136 --> 00:42:05,860
Don't move.

692
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,610
You!

693
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:08,900
I'm not a bad guy.

694
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,730
I'm a doctor.

695
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:10,860
Oh yeah,

696
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,928
I think you've sustained
some internal injuries.

697
00:42:12,928 --> 00:42:15,072
All of these are herbs
that can help revitalize you.

698
00:42:15,152 --> 00:42:16,130
If you don't believe me,

699
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,504
I'll drink it in front of you.

700
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:34,900
Your medicinal brew is pretty good.

701
00:42:35,712 --> 00:42:36,690
Thanks for the praise.

702
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,050
You saved me, huh?

703
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:44,610
I never expected you
to regain consciousness this quickly.

704
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,340
When I first rescued you,

705
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,170
you looked like a dead person to me.

706
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:50,130
Where are my possessions?

707
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,570
When I rescued you,

708
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,570
the seawater had ruined your clothes.

709
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,170
I took them away as I had

710
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,130
to help you get changed.

711
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:04,130
Don't misunderstand me.

712
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,420
Hurry and sit down.

713
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,680
You've regained consciousness.

714
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,592
So rest more often.

715
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,170
Sorry for the offense just now.

716
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,210
I'm Tang San.

717
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,730
Thank you for rescuing me.

718
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,820
My name is Ji Xiang.

719
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,250
You have to remember my name

720
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,560
so that you won't forget
who you should repay the favor to.

721
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,340
Don't worry.

722
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:30,752
I won't forget your name.

723
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,090
I was just joking.

724
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,300
I'm not your benefactor.

725
00:43:34,336 --> 00:43:36,848
It's all because you possess
excellent self-regenerative powers.

726
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:37,968
Or I couldn't do anything.

727
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:40,650
You're a good guy.

728
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,020
No matter what,

729
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,020
I owe you my life.

730
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,340
Many people owe me their lives.

731
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,920
You don't need to take it to heart.

732
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,420
However,

733
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,210
judging from your behavior,

734
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,690
I suppose you know medicine as well.

735
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,940
Although I don't know
what happened to you,

736
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,460
no outsiders are allowed

737
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,780
on Purple Pearl Island.

738
00:43:58,864 --> 00:44:00,340
But I'm the only doctor on the island.

739
00:44:00,432 --> 00:44:01,020
Why don't I

740
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,980
recommend you to our leader as a doctor?
