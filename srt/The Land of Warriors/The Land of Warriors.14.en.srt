=The Land of Warriors=

24
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from
Tangjia Sanshao's novel "Soul Land")

25
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,660
=Episode 14=

26
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,750
Master.

27
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,030
What are you doing here?

28
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,360
I'm here to collect a debt.

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,520
Such audacity!

30
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,590
Don't forget.

31
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,670
I'm the leader of Martial Soul Hall!

32
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,240
I am your master!

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
And I am your...

34
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,710
What did you say?

35
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,590
You were already nothing to me

36
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,480
ever since the day you hurt me.

37
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,150
So, I can boost my power

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,000
by absorbing the soul power
of other soul masters, huh?

39
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,650
Thank you,

40
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,530
my master.

41
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,060
Thank you for your last lesson.

42
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,060
(Qian Xunji,)

43
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,810
(your death)

44
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,420
(gave me a reason
to drive off the Haotian Sect.)

45
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:07,420
(It also helped me to unlock
the Rakshasa Secret Realm.)

46
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,460
(Now, I face its challenge.)

47
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,140
(The Martial Soul Hall
will rise gloriously.)

48
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:15,808
(I suppose this is the last bit of value
you can provide to us.)

49
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:20,980
Unlock it.

50
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,250
I need you to do two things for me.

51
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,810
First,

52
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,930
I owed our sect these two soul bones.

53
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:37,660
I've failed to meet
the expectations of Haotian Sect.

54
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,370
Bring them back for me.

55
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,570
Second,

56
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:42,980
help me pay respect to your grandfather.

57
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,980
Send my regards to your uncle as well.

58
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,780
Father,

59
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,180
why aren't you willing
to visit Uncle yourself?

60
00:04:58,736 --> 00:04:59,980
I'll spend the rest of my life

61
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,780
to keep your mother company here.

62
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,780
San,

63
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,450
I have placed such heavy burdens
on your shoulders.

64
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,620
Are the burdens too heavy for you?

65
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,620
As a son,

66
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,180
I only hate myself

67
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,490
for not being able to share your burdens
with you earlier.

68
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,450
You've grown up.

69
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,330
Father,

70
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,450
you're wounded.

71
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,780
You need to rest and recuperate.

72
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,690
This Dragon Leaf can help you
to consolidate your foundation.

73
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,420
You may consume this once per month.

74
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,060
By the way,

75
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,810
I know of a place

76
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,250
that can boost
the growth of plants 1000 times.

77
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,540
That place

78
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,930
may help Mother to recover
from her wounds quicker.

79
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,250
1000 times?

80
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,660
Are you serious?

81
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,660
Yes, I am.

82
00:06:03,744 --> 00:06:04,690
That place is known as

83
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,570
one of the Three Treasures.

84
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,180
It's called Ice Fire Mouth Spring.

85
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,648
I harvested these Dragon Leaves

86
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,810
from that place.

87
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,660
Yin,

88
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,620
did you hear that?

89
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,690
Everyone else is undergoing training.

90
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,296
Why did you guys disobey our order?

91
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:34,976
We're applying
for the teaching position.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,470
We won't join
Martial Soul Hall Army.

93
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:37,250
Release us now!

94
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,570
That's right! Release us!

95
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:39,808
You want me to release you?

96
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,740
Sure.

97
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,690
But that'll depend on your capabilities.

98
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,330
Who's there?

99
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:03,888
Your Holiness, please pardon me!

100
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:05,420
- Your Holiness.
- Your Holiness.

101
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,100
Take them away.

102
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,780
Hu Liena shall remain here.

103
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,180
Yes, Your Holiness.

104
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:19,980
Na,

105
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,100
come to me.

106
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,180
Na,

107
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,330
remember this.

108
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:47,216
Although one's killing intent
is important,

109
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,420
it'll backfire on you
if you don't know how to control it.

110
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,810
Those who see through you
can manipulate you,

111
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,740
do you understand?

112
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,620
I understand.

113
00:07:57,696 --> 00:08:00,240
I'll surely undergo training
to strengthen my mental fortitude.

114
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,860
Ao,

115
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,250
I don't think the flower crackers

116
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,330
are as good as they used to be.

117
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,690
This is Tiandou City.

118
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,090
This is Qibao Amber Sect.

119
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,210
It turns out that Douluo Continent

120
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,780
is gigantic.

121
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,330
I heard that the environment here
is very harsh.

122
00:08:56,944 --> 00:08:58,260
It can hone one's determination,

123
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,810
body, and mind to the highest degree.

124
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:02,672
(Extreme North)
If I can endure the trial here,

125
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,570
I'll definitely be able to protect you.

126
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,210
I can't just let other people
protect me forever.

127
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,810
Ao,

128
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,420
I'm working just as hard as you.

129
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,210
Eight steeds! Seven coincidences!

130
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,300
Ten out of ten!

131
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,500
Who opened the door?

132
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:33,540
Shut the door. Hurry.

133
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,688
It's so cold.

134
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,320
Our party of Level 60 War Soul Masters
lacks a support soul master.

135
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,784
We'll be harvesting soul bones.

136
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,160
And we'll be departing tonight.

137
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,180
This is the deposit.

138
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,660
I'm a Level 53 War Soul Master.
Do you need me?

139
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,420
I'm a Level 49 War Soul Master.

140
00:09:47,424 --> 00:09:49,104
I'll go with you
if you pay me half of it.

141
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,540
I'm a Level 58 Support Soul Master.

142
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,090
Give me two times the deposit.

143
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:55,330
Twice my reward if we manage
to harvest soul bones.

144
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,020
Even the soul masters of
Qibao Amber Sect

145
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,690
aren't as greedy as you.

146
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,060
Seems like you're itching for a fight.

147
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,730
Don't get so agitated.

148
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:11,850
Here.

149
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:13,570
This is a treat for you all.

150
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,610
Try it.

151
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,090
Are you a Food Branch Soul Master?

152
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,660
Boss, look! My wound has healed!

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,210
His food can cure people.

154
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:43,900
Yeah.

155
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:52,930
I'm fair to all, and you won't
incur losses when you invest in me.

156
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,180
I feed you when you starve
and save you when you're in danger.

157
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,810
You're reliable.

158
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,180
I, Wang Kui, the Tempest Wolf,

159
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,952
will have you in our party.

160
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,060
Tempest Wolf?

161
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,780
He's actually Tempest Wolf?

162
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:22,300
Tempest Wolf,

163
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:23,616
I've long heard of his name.

164
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,660
This is my partner,

165
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:27,810
a Seven-Ring War Soul Master.

166
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:30,300
If you want me,
you have to take him as well.

167
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,690
I'll say this first.

168
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,080
One can only enter
the mountains if they're capable enough.

169
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:39,290
However, one's life or death
will be determined by fate.

170
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:40,540
Don't worry.

171
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,570
I know the rules.

172
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,180
Our party is full.

173
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,336
Let's enter the mountains.

174
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:51,140
Youngsters prefer to seek wealth
than ensure their own survival.

175
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,660
You're right. Cheers.

176
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:02,380
Tempest Wolf is notorious in
the soul beast hunting circle.

177
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,900
He plays dirty.

178
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:06,128
Many soul masters who followed him
into the mountains

179
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,880
have gone missing.

180
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,590
No one knows whether
they're dead or alive.

181
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,080
Are you sure you want to
follow him?

182
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,970
I've heard of him.

183
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,380
This man is great
at hunting soul beasts.

184
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,730
I'm almost Level 60.

185
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,704
I can find better soul rings
if I follow his lead.

186
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,140
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

187
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:18,900
But...

188
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,690
You may leave if you're afraid.

189
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,660
I'm not afraid.
I'm just worried about you.

190
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,970
I gave the lady my promise.

191
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:29,216
I have to fulfill it
and head back as soon as possible.

192
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,540
We're men.

193
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,090
We need to keep our promises.

194
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,780
(Martial Soul Hall Academy)

195
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,610
Generous benefits!

196
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,330
Honorable services!

197
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,300
This is a rare opportunity!

198
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,500
Don't miss out on it...

199
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:52,020
Who did that?

200
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,570
These boys!

201
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,260
Capture them!

202
00:12:55,536 --> 00:12:56,020
Yes, sir!

203
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,330
I didn't mean it.

204
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,180
Stop!

205
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,380
You want to escape?

206
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,210
Darned lass,

207
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,060
seems like you have a death wish.

208
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,610
How dare you hit me?

209
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,660
She's quick.

210
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,930
Not bad.

211
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,300
Lass,

212
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,850
there's no escape.

213
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,180
You look quite pretty.

214
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,930
I'll make you suffer less

215
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,810
if you stay obedient.

216
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,450
(People often think that escaping
is a sign of cowardice.)

217
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,660
(Little do they know that the art of
movement is a part of the Great Dao.)

218
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,300
(During the evasion process,)

219
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,730
(one can lure foes, set up traps,
and set up formations.)

220
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,020
(Most importantly, they can stay alive.)

221
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,272
I didn't expect you

222
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:39,810
to be a powerful War Soul Master.

223
00:14:39,888 --> 00:14:42,464
I'm sure you hold an important position
in the Martial Soul Hall.

224
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,140
Mister,

225
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:45,040
sorry for failing
to recognize your greatness.

226
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:09,920
Seems like the training
I provided to you wasn't in vain.

227
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,300
Grandpa Sword!

228
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:14,900
Grandpa Sword,

229
00:15:14,944 --> 00:15:15,920
what are you doing here?

230
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,970
Just look at you.

231
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,120
You ran out all by yourself.

232
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,504
Your father was worried about you.

233
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:20,496
He told me to find you.

234
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,420
Grandpa,

235
00:15:21,694 --> 00:15:22,380
did you see that?

236
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,260
He's a Five-Ring War Soul Master.

237
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:25,424
Don't you think I'm amazing?

238
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,540
Of course I saw that.

239
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,970
How dare he try to hurt
the princess of Qibao Amber Sect?

240
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,850
This won't end well for him.

241
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,340
(Sunset Forest, Ice Fire Mouth Spring)

242
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,140
This place is magical indeed.

243
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,810
This is the Ice Fire Mouth Spring.

244
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,060
The eye of the spring is highly toxic.

245
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:13,216
Soul masters and soul beasts dare not
approach this place easily.

246
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,210
It's safest for Mother to grow up here.

247
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,570
San,

248
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,660
you have to be careful.

249
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,610
Do not let the environment here

250
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,730
harm your mother.

251
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,130
Mother.

252
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,500
Father,

253
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,700
seems like

254
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,940
this is the best spot for Mother.

255
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,424
This may seem like a beautiful place.

256
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,410
However, these two springs

257
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,850
are fatal to humans.

258
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,300
It's because I've consumed
the Octa Dark Frost

259
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,330
and the Fiery Soft Apricot.

260
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:45,456
And, I've undergone
the Ice Fire Body Training.

261
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,130
Therefore, my martial soul and body

262
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,700
are immune to both water and fire now.

263
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,700
Immune to both water and fire?

264
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,890
This place is great indeed.

265
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,300
How did you discover it?

266
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,300
Dugu Bo abducted me and
brought me to this place

267
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,192
to make me neutralize
the poison in his body.

268
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,700
I even made a bet with him.

269
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,540
A bet?

270
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,300
That's right.

271
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,890
As long as I pass his three
poison-neutralizing tests,

272
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,060
he'll promise me three things.

273
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:11,610
First, it was
the Jade Phosphor Serpent Venom.

274
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,890
I neutralized it easily.

275
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,060
The second was the Bamboo Emerald.

276
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,170
It was highly toxic.

277
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,280
It can turn the victim
into a pool of pus

278
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:20,540
after a short period.

279
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:21,810
However,

280
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,700
I neutralized it with the pollen
of Fragrant Silk Woven Flower.

281
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,020
As for the third test,

282
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,500
it was more troublesome.

283
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:28,896
The third test

284
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:31,808
should be neutralizing the Jade Phosphor
Serpent King Venom in your body.

285
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,570
I can't bear to kill you now.

286
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,090
If you lose, you can stay here
and serve me as my apprentice.

287
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,570
You can plan how to exploit me

288
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,220
all you want after I lose the bet.

289
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,890
You have a Beast Martial Soul.

290
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,460
That's why the poison
merged with your body.

291
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:57,536
If you wish to retain
the lethal toxin in your body

292
00:18:57,552 --> 00:18:58,780
without letting it damage you,

293
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,570
you have to find a vessel
to store the toxin.

294
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,220
Do you intend to seal the toxin
in my body

295
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,610
in my soul bone?

296
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,410
That's right.

297
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:10,512
It's possible to use medicine
to guide the toxins

298
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:12,570
in your meridians and bones,

299
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,850
gradually filtering them and

300
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,780
concentrating them entirely
into the soul bone.

301
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:16,512
Just like me.

302
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:18,560
The toxins in my body
are kept in Blue Silver Plant

303
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:19,610
and my attached soul bone.

304
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,060
Therefore, my life isn't in danger.

305
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,610
There are not many people
I admire in the world.

306
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,090
Now, you're one of them.

307
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,020
All right.

308
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,260
I'll heed your instructions.

309
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,260
Consume this.

310
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,890
You just spit this out.

311
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:58,150
Now, you want me to consume it?

312
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:58,500
This...

313
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,650
I...

314
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,330
Weren't you worried
that I was trying to harm you?

315
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,980
Didn't you make me take that

316
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,460
in order to keep me in check?

317
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,610
This is the inner core

318
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,890
of my Jade Phosphor Serpent
after I evolved it

319
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,890
into the Jade Phosphor Serpent King.

320
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,940
If you fail to treat me,

321
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,890
it'll explode in your body.

322
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,300
Forget about you.

323
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,540
Even a Grand Soul Master
won't be able to survive this.

324
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,056
I'll suffer a terrible death
if I fail to treat you, huh?

325
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,780
So, if I manage to treat you,

326
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,500
I guess there are plenty
of benefits for me, right?

327
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,060
You annoying boy.

328
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,850
This inner core contains
half of my power.

329
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:01,020
As long as you don't try anything funny,

330
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,130
it'll only be beneficial
to your cultivation.

331
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,060
You better return it to me

332
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,330
once I'm cured.

333
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,890
Fine.

334
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,300
Old Freak,

335
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:12,500
I have one more condition.

336
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,170
Do you know

337
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,980
that you're the only person

338
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,700
in the last few decades who dares
to negotiate a deal with me?

339
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,220
It's simple.

340
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,650
Every single plant here is a rare herb.

341
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,856
I wish to take some with me

342
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,350
so that I can give them to my friends.

343
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,610
Forget about the plants.

344
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,650
If you can cure me,

345
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:37,060
you can own
the entire Ice Fire Mouth Spring.

346
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,090
After that, I neutralized
his poison using the methods found

347
00:21:40,144 --> 00:21:41,220
in the Xuan Tian Records.

348
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,890
And, I became the owner of this place.

349
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:49,130
We became friends
after our hostile encounter.

350
00:21:49,296 --> 00:21:50,700
In the end, we became best friends.

351
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,060
Grand Venom Master is known
for his eccentric personality.

352
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,300
It's kind of magical for you two

353
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,170
to become friends.

354
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,170
Indeed.

355
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,130
After that, I brought these herbs

356
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,540
back to Shrek Academy.

357
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,300
I gave them to my friends

358
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
to aid them in their cultivation.

359
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,330
I suppose this is our shared destiny.

360
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,610
San,

361
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,300
I'm truly happy for you.

362
00:22:15,672 --> 00:22:18,090
Friends, brothers, and lovers,

363
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:18,780
those are

364
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,500
the reasons we live in this world.

365
00:22:20,864 --> 00:22:23,460
You have plenty of friends,
and have found the love of your life.

366
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,060
You're truly lucky.

367
00:22:26,752 --> 00:22:28,512
This is a type
of responsibility as well.

368
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:30,650
Father,

369
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,370
do you miss Uncle?

370
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,400
It's been more than
two decades since we met.

371
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,020
He should be as old as me now.

372
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,410
(Wu, I finally saw Mother.)

373
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,048
(I'm sure you would
be happy for me as well)

374
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,090
(if you were still around.)

375
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,460
How's Father doing?

376
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,570
Fourth Prince,

377
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,300
His Majesty still needs
to rest and recuperate.

378
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,610
Get out of my way.

379
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,020
I'll serve Father.

380
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,170
His Majesty must take his medicine
without any accidents.

381
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,130
I should do it.

382
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,570
I'm fulfilling my filial duties here.

383
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,980
Can you replace me for that?

384
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,890
Go now.

385
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,570
Get us some snacks and tea.

386
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,810
I have to look after His Majesty
under Crown Prince's order.

387
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:06,810
I dare not leave without permission.

388
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,980
Crown Prince?

389
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,170
What?

390
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,810
Aren't I one of the princes too?

391
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,650
Xue Beng.

392
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,060
Why are you raising your voice?

393
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,460
Father,

394
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,020
I heard that your condition
has worsened.

395
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,768
That's why I came here
to look after you.

396
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,700
But that scum tried to stop me.

397
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,890
It's time for you

398
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,700
to be sensible.

399
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,500
You should learn from Crown Prince.

400
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,260
I'll feed you the medicine.

401
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,170
Hurry and get us some water.

402
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,090
Your Highness.

403
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,370
What are you doing here?

404
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,060
I escorted Fourth Prince here
to visit His Majesty.

405
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:04,384
Why are you still standing there?

406
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,330
Hurry and feed Father some water.

407
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,060
Your Highness, I dare not obstruct you
from fulfilling your filial duties.

408
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,460
You were never here usually.

409
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,060
Why are you being a filial son today?

410
00:25:21,184 --> 00:25:23,370
You know that it's your duty
to look after Father, huh?

411
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,740
Although I'm a terrible son,

412
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,500
I still have to fulfill
my filial duties.

413
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,650
Moreover, I have something
to discuss with Father.

414
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,370
Father needs to rest.

415
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,060
You may discuss it with me.

416
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,780
You...

417
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,460
What trouble have you
gotten yourself into again?

418
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,060
Father,

419
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,260
a few days ago,

420
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,896
I wanted Grand Venom Master
to give me a venomous serpent for fun.

421
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,370
He wasn't willing to do so.

422
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,020
He said he lost the serpent.

423
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,330
He tried to deceive me
like I was a three-year-old kid.

424
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,650
Therefore, I came here to find you

425
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,190
so that you could issue an edict to him.

426
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,300
Your Majesty,

427
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,980
my serpent did go missing
a few days ago.

428
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,776
It wasn't my intention to brush him off.

429
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,170
However, I've found another serpent

430
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,700
that can replace it.

431
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,370
I wish to invite Fourth Prince
to check it out with me.

432
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:10,740
Hurry!

433
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,570
Show it to me!

434
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,500
You...

435
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,980
You came here to visit me

436
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,260
just so you could get yourself
a venomous serpent?

437
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,020
Scram!

438
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,170
Father, please be appeased.

439
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,130
Don't be angry.

440
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,090
I'll scram right now.

441
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,020
Get out!

442
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,540
Let's go.

443
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:32,608
This time, you mustn't lose
the serpent again.

444
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Father, don't be angry.

445
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:36,980
Please mind your health.

446
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,570
Water.

447
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,090
Here. Have some water.

448
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:03,728
This is the medicine I swapped out.

449
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,520
Luckily, you appeared
in the nick of time.

450
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,410
Is this the pill?

451
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,740
This contains the toxin

452
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,370
of my Jade Phosphor
Serpent King's Martial Soul.

453
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,850
This pill is highly toxic.

454
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,568
Are you sure

455
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,344
it can fight off the toxin
in Father's body?

456
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,410
I've been crafting poisons for decades.

457
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,780
This is the only solution.

458
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,330
Father is deeply poisoned.
I can't afford to delay it any longer.

459
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:43,570
I have to take the risk.

460
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,320
Do I need to test the potency myself
before I feed it to him?

461
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,890
Although I like playing dirty,

462
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,500
I won't joke around
with His Majesty's life.

463
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:53,980
Don't worry.

464
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,500
This pill can stabilize His Majesty's
heart meridians.

465
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,500
You can swap Imperial Physician Yang's
prescription with this

466
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,060
so that I can keep researching
the antidote.

467
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,300
You have to be careful.

468
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,940
Hopefully,
Crown Prince didn't notice it.

469
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,130
If we wish to suppress
the toxin in His Majesty's body,

470
00:28:16,368 --> 00:28:19,140
we have to take the risk by swapping
his prescriptions multiple times.

471
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,130
I don't think we can suppress it
if we only do it once.

472
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,130
Now, there's no turning back.

473
00:28:25,776 --> 00:28:27,170
Let's take it one step at a time.

474
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,710
Luckily, we've obtained the poison

475
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,580
that Imperial Physician Yang
had fed him with.

476
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,810
I'll leave the antidote research to you.

477
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,570
Your Holiness,

478
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,810
I think we should head back.

479
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,260
Head Flamen and other flamens

480
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,700
won't support us.

481
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,940
I don't need their support.

482
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,330
I just need them to know about this.

483
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,940
Yes, Your Holiness.

484
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,170
Head Flamen and the other flamens

485
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:56,130
have vital positions
in the Martial Soul Hall.

486
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,410
If we don't notify them before we act,

487
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,370
we'll be criticized when they find out.

488
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,850
Elder Golden Alligator.

489
00:29:13,024 --> 00:29:14,144
Where's Head Flamen?

490
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:14,980
(Grand Golden Alligator Master)

491
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,740
(Second Flamen)
Head Flamen is on a retreat.

492
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,700
He will not see anyone.

493
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,300
Please hand this to Head Flamen.

494
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:40,410
What does that mean?

495
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,610
Since they're not objecting to it,

496
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,570
I'll take it as a yes, then.

497
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,540
If so,

498
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,056
they should send flamens

499
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,570
to support Her Holiness's operation.

500
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,220
It'll make

501
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,300
things way easier.

502
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,060
It's because they aren't agreeing
to it wholeheartedly.

503
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,890
And,

504
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,330
I don't expect the Elder Hall
to support me either.

505
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,780
Relay my order.

506
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,550
Summon the chiefs of Martial Soul Halls
from all cities and continents

507
00:30:07,552 --> 00:30:08,432
to Martial Soul City.

508
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,940
I have an announcement to make.

509
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:10,940
Yes, Your Holiness.

510
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:22,800
This is an item handed to you
by Her Holiness.

511
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,410
The engravings on the Elder Token

512
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,740
represent the Upper Three Clans
of the Seven Great Clans,

513
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,410
Her Holiness, and Martial Soul Hall.

514
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,610
Is she...

515
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,750
(Qian Dao Liu, Head Flamen)
She only retained the crown.

516
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,780
Isn't this obvious enough?

517
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,410
She's too ambitious.

518
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,370
However, we cannot deny the fact

519
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,168
that the Martial Soul Hall
has achieved such glorious results

520
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:45,090
all thanks to her lofty ambitions.

521
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,830
(Grand Sacred Dragon Master, Elder)
So what?

522
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,890
She no longer has any regards
for Martial Soul Hall.

523
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:49,940
She forgot

524
00:30:50,032 --> 00:30:52,300
that the Elder Hall was the core
of Martial Soul Hall.

525
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,780
Only we and Head Flamen

526
00:30:53,888 --> 00:30:56,080
are able to dictate the future
of Martial Soul Hall.

527
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,740
If we can let her manage
the Martial Soul Hall,

528
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,940
we can make her step down
from her throne.

529
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,544
That was possible 20 years ago.

530
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:03,890
But now,

531
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,890
I'm not sure about that.

532
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:09,280
She's recruiting plenty of soul masters
and accumulating her forces in secret.

533
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,152
Her forces have spread across
the continents.

534
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,540
She's no longer someone
we can deal with easily.

535
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,570
It's been many years.

536
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,170
She never gave up on her plan.

537
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,020
However, if she succeeds,

538
00:31:21,104 --> 00:31:23,520
it'll be even harder for the Elder Hall
to keep her in check.

539
00:31:26,704 --> 00:31:27,540
It doesn't matter.

540
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,060
Once the chosen one appears,

541
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,540
she'll naturally be constrained.

542
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,968
Could it be

543
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,448
that you've received a prophecy
from the divine oracle?

544
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,500
I believe

545
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,540
that my expectations
will not be in vain.

546
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,300
(The Xuan Tian Records are right.)

547
00:31:59,568 --> 00:32:00,780
(The Ice Fire Mouth Spring)

548
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,460
(is indeed a Treasure.)

549
00:32:02,784 --> 00:32:04,048
(My soul power has received)

550
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,048
(a tremendous boost
after just one night.)

551
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,740
(I've already exceeded Level 59.)

552
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,170
Father.

553
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:27,740
Look.

554
00:32:30,832 --> 00:32:31,890
It's only been one night.

555
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,650
However, your mother's body

556
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,090
is already twice its original size.

557
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,610
Father,

558
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,488
you're poisoned.

559
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:45,840
Poison fills the air due
to the Ice Fire Mouth Spring.

560
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,136
I thought you would be fine

561
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,200
after consuming Dragon Leaf

562
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,870
since you had
a huge amount of soul power.

563
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,672
I never expected...

564
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,500
I'm fine.

565
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:56,810
Father,

566
00:32:57,328 --> 00:32:58,848
please calm down and regulate your qi.

567
00:32:59,536 --> 00:33:00,880
I'll neutralize your poison.

568
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:17,570
How could this be?

569
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:18,850
Father,

570
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,240
you mustn't stay here.

571
00:33:20,256 --> 00:33:22,510
I'll take you somewhere else
and neutralize your poison.

572
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:22,980
No.

573
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,330
I promised Yin
that I wouldn't leave her again

574
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,016
when I see her.

575
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,800
But it'll be too late if the poison
seeps into your heart meridians.

576
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:31,952
With my cultivation,

577
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,940
such poison is nothing to me.

578
00:33:39,424 --> 00:33:40,170
What about this?

579
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,890
You should consume these two Dragon Leaves
and regulate your body.

580
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,020
I'll go and concoct a pill.

581
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,300
You won't be affected

582
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,850
by the air here upon consuming it.

583
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,500
Don't waste your cultivation on me.

584
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,570
Your father isn't that fragile.

585
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,300
Father, there's no need
to worry about me.

586
00:33:55,152 --> 00:33:57,632
I could neutralize the poison
crafted by Grand Venom Master.

587
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,850
I'm sure I can neutralize yours as well.

588
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,220
And,

589
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,740
I can only leave you guys in peace

590
00:34:04,064 --> 00:34:06,224
if you can keep Mother company
in a healthy state.

591
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,850
Father,

592
00:34:07,936 --> 00:34:09,020
you have to promise me this

593
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,290
for Mother's sake.

594
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,090
San,

595
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,210
come here.

596
00:35:55,104 --> 00:35:56,192
What are you doing?

597
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,500
Is this the so-called "pill"
you mentioned?

598
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,352
Father, you don't need
to worry about me.

599
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,650
Did you forget?

600
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:04,032
The soul bone skill
that Mother had left behind for me

601
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,340
has regenerative properties.

602
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:06,690
This kind of minor wound

603
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,090
is nothing to me.

604
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,820
That doesn't mean
you can mutilate yourself!

605
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,656
You shouldn't do it
even if it's for my sake

606
00:36:12,656 --> 00:36:13,760
or your mother's sake!

607
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,380
I'm not trying to act tough
because of my soul bone skill.

608
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,650
I only wish for you

609
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,690
to stay by Mother's side healthily.

610
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,420
I've consumed
the Octa Dark Frost

611
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,540
and the Fiery Soft Apricot.

612
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,090
These two herbs are highly toxic.

613
00:36:33,072 --> 00:36:35,250
Your poison can only be neutralized
if you consume

614
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,820
a pill made from

615
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,384
the catalyst using my heart's blood.

616
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,770
The pill is completed.

617
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,210
Please let me

618
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,940
fulfill my filial duties.

619
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,980
This is the map to Haotian Sect.

620
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,690
Depart immediately.

621
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,250
Your aunt

622
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,130
should be waiting for you
back at the sect.

623
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,340
Your soul power should reach
Level 60 soon.

624
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,610
Once you're done
with the sect's affairs,

625
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,210
you can head to Xingdou Forest

626
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,090
and look for Wu.

627
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,980
She should be entering
her mature phase soon.

628
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,860
People won't be able to recognize her

629
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,460
as long as she puts on a disguise.

630
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,090
Yes, Father.

631
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,340
I will remember that.

632
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,060
You know that I have
high expectations of you.

633
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,060
But you better remember this.

634
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,690
You're the only son

635
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,980
in our family.

636
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,940
Remember to prioritize your safety.

637
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:17,250
Father, Mother,
please don't worry about me.

638
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:18,730
I know what to do.

639
00:38:42,144 --> 00:38:42,770
All right now.

640
00:38:43,632 --> 00:38:45,540
Go and do the things
you're supposed to do.

641
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,610
Don't worry about me.

642
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,090
Your mother is here with me.

643
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,940
This place is my best refuge.

644
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,500
Go now.

645
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,610
Father,

646
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,500
Mother,

647
00:39:02,928 --> 00:39:03,940
please take care.

648
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,980
Daming, Wu is...

649
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,250
Be quiet.

650
00:39:59,090 --> 00:39:59,730
(Wu,)

651
00:40:01,808 --> 00:40:04,144
(the things you've been
experiencing all this while,)

652
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,020
(I'm able to experience them too.)

653
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,650
Enough! Don't do it again!

654
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,820
Enough!

655
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,380
(Don't be afraid.)

656
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,650
(I'm here.)

657
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,250
(Don't be afraid.)

658
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:38,820
San?

659
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,460
Wu!

660
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,460
It's time to wake up.

661
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,210
San, please save my mother!

662
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,090
She will die!

663
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,610
The Martial Soul Hall will kill her!

664
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,090
Why can't I save her?

665
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,290
Wu,

666
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,170
she has already passed away.

667
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,570
There's no way to change the past

668
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,420
even if you dwell

669
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,380
on it.

670
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,090
We have to look forward.

671
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,500
Look forward?

672
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,060
Wu.

673
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,650
Come with me,

674
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:19,980
okay?

675
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,020
No.

676
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,420
I cannot leave this place.

677
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,980
I'll go through the same experience
over and over again.

678
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:34,500

how did you manage to come in, then?
