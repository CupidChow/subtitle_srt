=The Land of Warriors=

18
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,340
=Episode 28=

20
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,360
Both of us can't see this person.

21
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,470
I can't say anything much.

22
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,880
Elder Yang,

23
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,240
I hope you can try

24
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,110
to create an antidote
by using this pill.

25
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,440
I understand.

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,219
However, I don't know
the formula and ratio of this poison.

27
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,750
I need time to analyze and study it.

28
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,729
With my knowledge,

29
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,670
I'm 60% confident
of creating an antidote.

30
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,659
However, I'm afraid
I can't do it in time.

31
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,910
Do whatever you can

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,800
and hope for the best.

33
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,299
I shouldn't waste time

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,630
and get to work now.

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,830
Please.

36
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,169
(The one you seek)

37
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,720
(to cure Emperor Xue Ye's poison
is Elder Yang.)

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,030
(I'm afraid there's no one
more suitable than him on this continent.)

39
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,840
If he can create the antidote,

40
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,880
I've lived up
to Fourth Prince's expectations.

41
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,720
(San.)

42
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,000
(Thank you for your help
about the clan rules.)

43
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,030
I'm the one who should thank you.

44
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,280
You showed me the arrogance of humans.

45
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,000
Perhaps

46
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,560
it's just like Ao said.

47
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,630
Humans are
just a part of every living thing.

48
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,120
It might be unrealistic
to stop all forms of killing

49
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,750
but we shouldn't kill indiscriminately.

50
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,600
This can start

51
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,840
from the Tang Clan.

52
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,910
You are too impatient.

53
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,379
It is too risky to execute your plan

54
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,790
before taking control
of the whole of Tiandou.

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,070
I'm not discussing it with you.

56
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,680
Hu Liena is mobilizing the troops now.

57
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,070
I'm giving you one last opportunity.

58
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,120
If you still fail,

59
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,840
I will take over
the Tiandou soul master legion.

60
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,510
Your Highness,

61
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,460
The Tiandou Imperial Guards
are searching everywhere

62
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,510
but

63
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,750
they still can't find Prince Xue Beng.

64
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,720
Keep searching.

65
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,880
How can we forgive the person
who poisoned His Majesty?

66
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,560
Poisoned His Majesty?

67
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,790
What a serious crime.

68
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,720
We haven't found him

69
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,819
and we don't know the truth.

70
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,209
Are we going

71
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,350
to pin the crime on a prince?

72
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,280
The Crown Prince saw it himself.

73
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,400
Mr. Wang,

74
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,560
are you doubting His Highness?

75
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,910
Your Highness,

76
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,470
All of us care about the truth.

77
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,299
His Majesty is ill.

78
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,150
I've been stopped whenever
I asked for a meeting with him

79
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,019
and the Fourth Prince is missing.

80
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,680
There's no evidence or witnesses.

81
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,750
It's hard to convince everyone with
just Your Highness' statement alone.

82
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,480
Your Highness,

83
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,920
what Mr. Wang said
is exactly our thoughts.

84
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,939
The Fourth Prince
is a descendant of His Majesty

85
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,320
and a brother of Your Highness.

86
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:38,819
Even if he has committed a crime,

87
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,409
he should be arrested
and tried in public

88
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,880
to give the officials
and the people an explanation.

89
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,769
Your Highness,

90
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,240
we are requested by the officials

91
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,680
to request an order from you.

92
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,120
We hope Your Highness
doesn't convict hastily

93
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,710
since both of you are siblings.

94
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,299
Wait for the Fourth Prince to come back

95
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,209
so the people's and
officials' hearts are calmed,

96
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,969
the temple is at peace,

97
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,710
and everyone's mouth can be sealed.

98
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:14,649
I might be the one who witnessed
the Fourth Prince's act of poisoning

99
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,630
but

100
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,800
I will capture him

101
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,830
and give everyone an explanation.

102
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,270
I must ask him

103
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,560
why he would murder Father myself.

104
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,480
Your Highness is wise.

105
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,510
That's enough.

106
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,120
Leave if you have nothing else.

107
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,680
I have to take care of Father.

108
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,070
Even the Heaven and Earth are
touched by Your Highness' filial piety.

109
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,270
We won't be
disturbing Your Highness anymore.

110
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,920
We are leaving.

111
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,830
It's better to get rid

112
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,680
of these disobedient officials.

113
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,510
They are the pillars of Tiandou.

114
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,830
They cannot be killed.

115
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,529
It seems like I'm in charge now

116
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,440
but the military authority
isn't with me.

117
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,819
These officials are not loyal to me.

118
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,019
We can only shut everyone's mouth

119
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,019
if Xue Beng admits his crime.

120
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,710
That is when I can truly rule Tiandou.

121
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,150
But he is very elusive.

122
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,209
All the men I sent

123
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,920
haven't found him at all.

124
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,270
Then, force him to appear.

125
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,150
Yes.

126
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,960
(Tang Clan)

127
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,950
Grandpa,

128
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,209
what is inside this box
that makes you treasure it so much?

129
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,409
This box

130
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,630
has been with me for many years.

131
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,270
I always hope that it can be used soon.

132
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,040
Look.

133
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,710
The Tribe of Agility
has been living a frugal life.

134
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,270
Where did you collect all these things?

135
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,819
The year when you were born,

136
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,270
we just left Haotian Sect.

137
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,089
We still lived a lavish life.

138
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,019
This box was prepared back then.

139
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,710
I kept it until now.

140
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,619
You grew up

141
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,019
day after day.

142
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,379
I would take it out

143
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,150
and have a look from time to time.

144
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,390
I've always thought about
adding something inside.

145
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,060
However, my situation is getting worse

146
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,880
so I can't add anything else.

147
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,619
However, everything in this box

148
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,379
is your dowry.

149
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,240
It's time to use it now.

150
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,499
I think the kid
with the Phoenix Martial Soul

151
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,800
sincerely treats you well.

152
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,750
What do you think about him?

153
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,579
What are you talking about?

154
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,819
There's nothing.

155
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,270
There's nothing between us.

156
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,969
He is a nice person

157
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,619
and he is righteous

158
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,819
but he is just

159
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,939
shameless brat in my opinion.

160
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,510
I can't wait to hide from him.

161
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,390
I see.

162
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,769
I thought both of you
would get along well

163
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,870
after clearing the misunderstanding.

164
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,760
You don't see him that way?

165
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,920
Then, I can give the things in this box

166
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,640
back to the chief then.

167
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,830
Grandpa,

168
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,280
are you kidding me?

169
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,569
The chief has been busy
expanding the clan

170
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,019
and buying ores at Gengxin City.

171
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,889
The items in this box

172
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,169
was prepared to support the chief

173
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,830
and not my dowry.

174
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,950
My granddaughter understands me most.

175
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,689
However, I wasn't lying.

176
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,950
This is your dowry indeed.

177
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,950
We just joined Tang Clan.

178
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,760
I've finally let go

179
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,710
of all my worries in the past.

180
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,070
However, I believe

181
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,289
I will surely

182
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,870
prepare a better dowry
for you in the future.

183
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,889
Tang Clan is not rich.

184
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,950
It needs money in many places.

185
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,440
You won't blame me

186
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,190
for giving this to the chief, right?

187
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,230
Of course, I blame you.

188
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,619
Grandpa,

189
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,929
you shouldn't prepare
a dowry for me in the future.

190
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,040
I'm not marrying anyone.

191
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,230
You...

192
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,040
This brat.

193
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,769
There are eight chests in total.

194
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,409
San,

195
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,739
count them.

196
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,049
No need.

197
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,379
You can count them.

198
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,569
All these are just the deposit?

199
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,739
My father said

200
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,139
Qibao Amber Sect

201
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,070
is the most solid support Tang Clan has.

202
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,619
Ao,

203
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,689
have you drafted
the list to go to Gengxin City?

204
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,499
It's basically done.

205
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,019
I'm not sure if we should bring
a Hall of Agility disciple

206
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,190
to send during scouting.

207
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,019
I think

208
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,219
Fatty can do this too.

209
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,470
I can't.

210
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,379
We should leave something professional
to the professionals.

211
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,929
I think Xiang is a suitable candidate.

212
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,619
San,

213
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,680
what do you think?

214
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,859
Fatty, it's my first time seeing you

215
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,649
denying yourself so happily.

216
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,230
I'm doing it for the sake of the clan.

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,619
Sure.

218
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,710
Bring Xiang along.

219
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,280
Xiang.

220
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,710
Let me help you.

221
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,809
What is inside this box?

222
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,040
It's quite heavy.

223
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,099
Xiang,

224
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,440
these are...

225
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,470
The establishment of the clan

226
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,350
needs a lot of money.

227
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,920
Grandpa wants to share your burden

228
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,569
so he asked me to give this box

229
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,110
to you.

230
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,680
The Tribe of Agility
can't contribute much.

231
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,110
I hope you don't complain.

232
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,680
I'm grateful to Grand Uncle

233
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,920
for being so considerate.

234
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,440
However, you should

235
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,640
bring this box back.

236
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,950
The clan has sufficient funds now.

237
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,040
I won't use
everyone else's personal assets.

238
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,320
That won't do.

239
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,689
If I bring this box back

240
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,619
right now.

241
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,110
Grandpa will reprimand me
for neglecting my duties.

242
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,569
Go back and tell Grand Uncle

243
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,979
I will find him immediately

244
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,800
if I need help.

245
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,230
This box is too precious.

246
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,800
Bring it back to Grand Uncle
and let him take care of it.

247
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,640
That's right.

248
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,350
You should call me your cousin
according to our seniority.

249
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,459
Cousin San.

250
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,409
I'll be leaving then.

251
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,529
Go back and get prepared.

252
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,809
I need you to come with us
to Gengxin City

253
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,599
in case you are needed
for scouting purposes.

254
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,190
Sure.

255
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,760
I'll go and get prepared immediately.

256
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,640
All right.

257
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,569
Xiang, let me help you.

258
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,640
No need.

259
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,590
Go after her.

260
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,710
Yes.

261
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,190
Xiang!

262
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,870
Xiang!

263
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,760
Chief!

264
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,379
Chief, the imperial chaplain is here.

265
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,560
He is looking for you.

266
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,640
Let him in quickly.

267
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,470
Yes.

268
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,259
Speak with Master.

269
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,550
Rongrong and I will go
and arrange Gengxin City's matters.

270
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,590
All right.

271
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,560
Rongrong, let's go.

272
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,280
Let's go.

273
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,680
Xiang!

274
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,280
Let me help you with it.

275
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,710
Thank you.

276
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,230
Why are you acting so polite?

277
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,920
I heard you took care of me

278
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,190
on the night

279
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,230
(Tang Clan)
I was poisoned at Longxing City.

280
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,680
I haven't thanked you yet.

281
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,920
No.

282
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,929
Ms. Ning and the rest
took care of you too.

283
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,070
I wasn't the only one.

284
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,070
You got injured because of me.

285
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,680
I'm supposed to take care of you.

286
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,219
Don't overthink.

287
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,560
I'm not.

288
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,320
I just feel happy inside.

289
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,990
There's so much jewellery
inside this box.

290
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,339
Since San didn't accept it,

291
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,280
you can use it for your dowry.

292
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,560
I'm not marrying anyone

293
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,160
and won't prepare a dowry.

294
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,070
Did I say something wrong again?

295
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,520
Xiang!

296
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,400
No matter what,

297
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,219
it's a good start

298
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,920
that Wu has regained her body.

299
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,280
I'm already happy enough
because I can see Wu.

300
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,560
However, I want to revive her.

301
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,110
Don't pressure yourself.

302
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,320
Take it slow.

303
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,400
That's right.

304
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,160
Bring this to Gengxin City.

305
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,160
The Elder Token?

306
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,099
The Elder Token

307
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,870
is the token of the highest level
at Martial Soul Hall.

308
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,300
The one who has it
has limitless prestige

309
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,070
similar to His Holiness.

310
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,320
When you first arrived
at Nuoding Academy,

311
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,590
your father left it with me.

312
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,520
I'm handing it over to you now.

313
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,070
Perhaps it might
save you some trouble in the future.

314
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,710
When your father gave it to me,

315
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,990
he hoped I could take care of you well.

316
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,160
Don't worry, Master.

317
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,920
I won't let you and my father down.

318
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,099
I will finish everything

319
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,470
that my father started.

320
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,560
San,

321
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,040
I'm proud of you

322
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,800
for being responsible

323
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,560
but I want to know

324
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,520
if this is what you want

325
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,110
or just to fulfill
your father's expectations.

326
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,920
Aren't these two

327
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,160
the same?

328
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,640
I was also the same as you

329
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,160
and wanted my father to be proud of me.

330
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,350
Because of this obsession,

331
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,320
I've regretted it for life.

332
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,470
So, I don't want you to learn from me.

333
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,920
I hope

334
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,710
you can become your true self.

335
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,110
Let go of your obsession and be relaxed.

336
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,040
Even if you can't complete all those,

337
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,640
it will still be fine.

338
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,710
Master,

339
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,870
I will think about what you say.

340
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,680
San,

341
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,400
I know you are the most considerate.

342
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,640
Wu,

343
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,950
this is your favourite Sugar Cake.

344
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,560
Eat more.

345
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,590
Cousin San,

346
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,099
if we purchase

347
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,139
all the metal needed
to create secret weapons

348
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,289
all at once,

349
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,169
does it mean

350
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,870
we can manufacture
a batch of secret weapons

351
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,520
and let everyone equip them?

352
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,369
Besides basic materials,

353
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,809
I hope we can also
find some rare metals as well.

354
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,419
Rare metals.

355
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,899
When we enter Gengxin City,

356
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,560
we will ask about it.

357
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,630
The best metal and ore

358
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,289
will usually appear

359
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,760
at the city's auction.

360
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,480
We can go and take a look.

361
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,259
Xiang,

362
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,200
you know so much.

363
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,320
Actually, I've been
to Gengxin City since young.

364
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,019
I understand a little.

365
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,289
However, it still feels awkward

366
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,899
for you to praise me like that.

367
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,040
Don't be awkward.

368
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,419
Although the weapons and
equipment of the military,

369
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,129
the farming equipment of every citizen,

370
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,769
and the buildings we see everywhere

371
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,390
are made from blacksmiths,

372
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,089
I don't think they are prioritized

373
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,800
by Xingluo or Tiandou.

374
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,320
However, Gengxin City
is known as the Iron City after all.

375
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,070
It is a place where blacksmiths gather.

376
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,089
I wonder

377
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,809
if their status has improved.

378
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,760
Compared to
other places on the continent,

379
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,019
their statuses are slightly higher

380
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,110
but it depends on their rank.

381
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,419
In Gengxin City,

382
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,480
blacksmiths are separated
into seven ranks.

383
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,769
They are beginner,

384
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,939
intermediate,

385
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,089
and expert blacksmiths,

386
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,129
Master Blacksmiths,

387
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,499
Great Master Blacksmiths,

388
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,720
Grand Master Blacksmiths,
and God Blacksmiths.

389
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,809
Does an item
forged by a higher rank blacksmith

390
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,200
means it's more valuable?

391
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,760
Elder Titan is the vice president
of the Blacksmiths Guild.

392
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,939
I'm sure the items he forged
are very valuable.

393
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,390
We must collect more.

394
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,670
San's father is also a God Blacksmith.

395
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,630
What he forged must be worth collecting.

396
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,240
Master

397
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,200
is the greatest blacksmith.

398
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,670
His skills exceed mine and Lou Gao's.

399
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,520
Unfortunately...

400
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,560
San is feeling sad for his father.

401
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,670
I must think of something
to distract him.

402
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,960
I only eat and sleep every day.

403
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,200
You need to help me move around.

404
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,200
(Otherwise, my body will degenerate.)

405
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,280
Fine.

406
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,070
Let's

407
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,630
start from some simple movements.

408
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,000
Look.

409
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,179
The horse-riding stance looks easy

410
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,849
but it can increase your leg strength

411
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,329
and your hip strength.

412
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,499
During this process,

413
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,280
you must keep your core tight.

414
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,000
♪Just to defy destiny with you♪

00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,320

Are you really helping Wu train?

423
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,800
I don't think so.

424
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,560
You should let Rongrong do it instead.

425
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,590
Sorry for disturbing you.

426
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,390
Let's go.

Forget about my body for now.

00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,150
Help me train my brain instead.

435
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,430
I think it works.

436
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,040
Borrow soldiers?

437
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,769
The Elephant Armored Tribe plans
to expand their territory first

438
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,830
instead of cooping up in Longxing City.

439
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,520
Holy Lady,
please send someone to help us.

440
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,739
What you did in Longxing City

441
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,350
has troubled Her Holiness.

442
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,609
Everything was under my control

443
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,089
but...

444
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,110
Her Holiness hates people who say "but".

445
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,670
I've been reflecting on myself
every day.

446
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,329
I will never make
the same mistake again.

447
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,240
You also sounded confident previously

448
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,560
but what happened in the end?

449
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,939
What a pity.

450
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,910
Your ability is outstanding

451
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,910
but it is not indispensable.

452
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,350
Martial Soul Hall will give the title

453
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,129
of the Seven Great Clans' leader
to a truly capable person

454
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,800
who can share Her Holiness' burden.

455
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,369
The Elephant Armored Tribe
is willing to sacrifice itself

456
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,289
for Her Holiness.

457
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,089
We suffered some losses currently

458
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,910
but I'll prepare my troops soon

459
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,830
so Her Holiness can see
the might of the Elephant Armored Tribe.

460
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,480
Not bad.

461
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,089
Whether the Elephant Armored Tribe can
become the leader of Seven Great Clans

462
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,369
or disappear on Douluo continent

463
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,280
like the
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan

464
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,200
will depend on your performance,
Master Huyan.

465
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,910
The greatest clan
of the Seven Great Clans

466
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:30,845
must belong to
the Elephant Armored Tribe.

467
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,899
All right.

468
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,569
I will send you another unit

469
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,590
to replenish your troops.

470
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,529
When the time comes,

471
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,960
you must bring good news
for Her Holiness.

472
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,720
Thank you for
Your Holiness and Holy Lady's grace.

473
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,816
When I've dominated the other factions,

474
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:45,529
I will get all tribes
of the four single attribute tribes

475
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,520
and get rid of Tang San.

476
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,240
I'm the one
who will take Tang San's life.

477
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,520
You mustn't touch him.

478
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,670
Yes.

479
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,960
One!

480
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,390
Two!

481
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,480
Three!

482
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,630
Four!

483
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,430
Five!

484
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,800
Six!

485
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,240
Stop!

486
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,630
Father.

487
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,590
Your Majesty.

488
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,480
You must learn from
the Elephant Armored Tribe incident.

489
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,089
If they stop incorporating other clans

490
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,630
of Longxing City forcefully,

491
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,870
you shouldn't increase the tension

492
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,430
so you won't allow anyone

493
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,369
an opportunity to trouble Xingluo.

494
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,350
I understand.

495
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,960
Thank you for your guidance.

496
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,499
Father, Tiandou and Xingluo are two factions
that are against each other

497
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,329
on Douluo Continent.

498
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,699
However, there's another faction
that controls the situation.

499
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,520
This faction is Martial Soul Hall.

500
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,049
They want to nurture

501
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,739
forces like Elephant Armored Tribe

502
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,000
to extend their grasp on Xingluo.

503
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,369
Zhuqing and I think
we should be on full alert

504
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,760
and increase the training intensity.

505
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,179
Forgetting about war brings danger

506
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,019
and being lazy guarantees the fall
of an empire. I taught you that.

507
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,870
Why are you reminding me instead?

508
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,390
Duke Lingmao
has already selected elite soldiers.

509
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,960
One!

510
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,670
Two!

511
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,200
Three!

512
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,560
Four!

513
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,000
Five!

514
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,480
Six!

515
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:28,670
Stop!

516
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,630
What do you think?

517
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,369
The training method
is too old-fashioned.

518
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,369
It has to be changed.

519
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,089
Zhuqing.

520
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,510
Zhuqing, you mustn't run your mouth
in front of His Majesty.

521
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,320
I want to hear your ideas.

522
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,830
Father,

523
00:24:45,337 --> 00:24:46,939
if you want to train an elite unit,

524
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,529
you must implement

525
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,019
the usual battle plans practically.

526
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,529
After Operation Clan Hunt,

527
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,019
our master, Yu Xiaogang

528
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,569
has been training the
Tiandou Soul Master Legion every day.

529
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,000
I think we can learn from that method.

530
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,419
Every member
must be trained in an elite method.

531
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,309
They need to adapt
to the complicated weather,

532
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,899
train in new and unfamiliar regions,

533
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,200
and study night battles and training.

534
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,240
There are more details.

535
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,329
Mu Bai and I

536
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,350
can show you a detailed plan.

537
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,430
Good.

538
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,390
Very good.

539
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,939
After going out
to train for many years,

540
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,830
you've improved a lot.

541
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,800
Just do everything

542
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,390
that's beneficial to Xingluo.

543
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,960
I'll fully support you.

544
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,040
Duke Lingmao.

545
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,000
It's time

546
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,670
to hand over the military seal
of Xingluo's Imperial Soul Master Legion

547
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,240
to the Crown Prince.

548
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,499
I have the same idea as Your Majesty.

549
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,430
I've been waiting
for this day to arrive.

550
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,240
I hope both of you

551
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,560
can train

552
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,960
an elite army for Xingluo soon.

553
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,240
Brat.

554
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,630
Thank you, Father.

555
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,800
I will do my best.

556
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,390
It seems like we are old indeed.

557
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,760
We must listen
to the young people for their ideas.

558
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,590
Their persistence and courage
against a strong opponent

559
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,870
resemble your former self.

560
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,070
The sooner they grow up,

561
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,040
the more hope Xingluo has.

562
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,910
Help...

563
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,560
Take him back.

564
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,849
Master said

565
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,320
not to let anyone find out.

566
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,240
Take a look.

567
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,560
Don't miss this opportunity.

568
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,520
Have a look.

569
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,499
We are finally here in Gengxin City.

570
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,390
I'm so tired along this journey.

571
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,830
Thank you, everyone.

572
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,150
Elder Titan,

573
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,870
why is Gengxin City
known as Blacksmith City too?

574
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,560
Many blacksmiths

575
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,430
came to Gengxin City on purpose
to participate in the assessment.

576
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,555
If they pass
the expert blacksmith assessment,

577
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,830
they can stay in this city.

578
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,280
Here.

579
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,760
Let me pour you some.

580
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,560
Elder Titan,

581
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,739
Why are old people, women, and children

582
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,560
the ones working at Gengxin City?

583
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,659
Isn't this the City of Blacksmiths?

584
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,419
Why aren't there
any strong and young people?

585
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,630
The elder said blacksmiths
hold a high status here.

586
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,699
Have they gathered

587
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,560
to forge something?

588
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,499
I never heard about any major incidents.

589
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,430
However, it's different
from the past indeed.

590
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,350
Stand still!

591
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,830
Master,

592
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,390
these are given to you

593
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,070
by the shop owners of the city.

594
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,870
There are valuable

595
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,720
rare ores.

596
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,659
Master,

597
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,150
he's dead.

598
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,830
Do you think I care about that?

599
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,000
Someone, take him away.

600
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,760
Hurry.

601
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:28,910
Master,

602
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,390
many people have died
from exhaustion recently.

603
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,590
Do you think

604
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,350
we can delay the progress?

605
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,760
How many days do you think is suitable?

606
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,200
Ten days.

607
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,430
Ten days?

608
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,089
Master,

609
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,070
we have been working overtime.

610
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,699
However, there's a lot of work

611
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,760
and the deadline is tight.

612
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,280
Some blacksmiths are ill

613
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,960
and some even died.

614
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,329
When we can't replace
the working blacksmiths,

615
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,240
we can't catch up with the progress.

616
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,200
Gengxin City has many blacksmiths.

617
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,720
If a batch dies,
just find another batch.

618
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,040
Her Holiness gave me a do-or-die order.

619
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,070
If the progress is delayed,

620
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,979
I'll bring back as many heads

621
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,280
as the number of items you owe.

622
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,630
Your head will be the first to roll.

623
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,390
Yes.

624
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,110
I will go and capture them.

625
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,240
Let's go.

626
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,390
Yes.

627
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,259
Everyone!

628
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,259
Everyone!

629
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,280
The blacksmith is having a promotion!

630
00:30:39,282 --> 00:30:40,419
Our president,

631
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,459
the God Blacksmith, Lou Gao's disciple

632
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,259
has forged an armor.

633
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,590
There's only one in the world.

634
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,739
Its original price is 88,888.

635
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,000
It's only selling for 6,666 now.

636
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,000
Has Gengxin City fallen to such a state?

637
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,200
Even Lou's disciple
is peddling on the streets.

638
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,019
Let Elder Titan and I
see what's going on.

639
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,240
All of you go and find an inn to stay.

640
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,430
Help me take care of Wu.

641
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,899
Go to Tie's Inn.

642
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,200
I will come and find you
after I'm done with the Chief.

643
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,480
Wu,

644
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,040
be good.

645
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,480
Let's go.

646
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,289
Those from the South.
Those going to the North!

647
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,560
Don't miss this.

648
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,129
This armor is made by my master,

649
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,419
the current guild president,

650
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,179
God Blacksmith, Lou Gao's disciple.

651
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,979
It's called the Brilliant Silver Armour.

652
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,590
There's only one in the world.

653
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,200
Let me see.

654
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,110
Garbage.

655
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,630
Who are you calling garbage?

656
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,560
I'm saying this armor is garbage.

657
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,040
The same goes
for the blacksmith who made it.

658
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,809
Old Man,

659
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,419
my master is the disciple of Lou Gao,

660
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,000
the current Blacksmith Guild president.

661
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,739
How dare you call his armor trash.

662
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,110
You are humiliating the God Blacksmiths!

663
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,320
You won't accept it, right?

664
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,520
Fine.

665
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,910
Let me teach you a lesson

666
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,630
in front of everyone.

667
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,089
This armor

668
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,480
is made with the Ring Armour Method.

669
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,529
On the surface, it looks shiny

670
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,659
but the armor plates

671
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,240
are thin.

672
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,529
There's only
a layer of plated silver on the armor.

673
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,320
It is no different from other armor.

674
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,329
This armor is for decorative purposes.

675
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,070
It's not for battle.

676
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,739
Every armor plate has to be thin

677
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,110
to show its workmanship.

678
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,870
Look.

679
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,329
The size of all the plates is different.

680
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,809
How dare you talk back to me.

681
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,289
This... This is called
the beauty of asymmetry.

682
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,329
It was taught by
my master, Master Lou Gao.

683
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,910
You... You know nothing.

684
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,240
Beauty of asymmetry?

685
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,569
If that old man, Lou Gao, were here,

686
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,760
he would be so angry
that he would vomit blood.

687
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,390
The armor of
Lou Gao's Brilliant Silver Armour

688
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,800
is made with Silver Essence.

689
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,979
All the armor plates might be thin

690
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,670
but every piece
is inserted individually.

691
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,739
Even if a piece
is taken off by a sharp blade,

692
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,560
the other pieces will still be intact.

693
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,000
You...

694
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,320
What?

695
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,899
Don't use Lou Gao's name

696
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,129
to be a fraud in the future.

697
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,070
Otherwise,

698
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,849
you will not be allowed
to do business in Gengxin City anymore.

699
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,529
- Fraud!
- Fraud!

700
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:35,110
- Fraud!
- Fraud!

701
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,899
- Fraud!
- Fraud!

702
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,419
Who's causing trouble here?

703
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,720
Do you want to die?

704
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,200
Sir!

705
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,320
Sir!

706
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,000
I work for
Martial Soul Hall's Mr. Myles.

707
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,049
I'm selling the latest work

708
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,939
by my master, the disciple
of God Blacksmith, Lou Gao.

709
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,089
This old man

710
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,699
humiliated God Blacksmith Lou Gao.

711
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,129
Quick.

712
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,129
Arrest him.

713
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,529
No wonder you dare use Lou Gao's name

714
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,070
to cheat people.

715
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,680
I see you have someone to support you.

716
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,080
Take him away.

717
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,800
Stop.

718
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,120
Mr. Si Long.

719
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,499
(Si Long, Lou Gao's disciple)
Please stay out of this.

720
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,280
Even if you are Lou Gao's disciple,

721
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,390
you can't take responsibility for this.

722
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,280
Mr. Titan,

723
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,510
it's really you.

724
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,299
Brat,

725
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,600
why are you being polite to me?

726
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,600
Elder Titan

727
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,720
is the vice president
of the Blacksmith Guild.

728
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,990
He is also one of
the world's three God Blacksmiths.

729
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,240
Even President Lou Gao
must show him some respect.

730
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,510
Who are you to cause trouble here?

731
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,350
What if he's the God Blacksmith, Titan?

732
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,430
They humiliated someone
from Martial Soul Hall

733
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,030
so they must accept
punishment by Martial Soul Hall.

734
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,819
We did not recognize you.

735
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,729
Please spare us

736
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,819
and let us go.

737
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,910
Get lost!

738
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,080
Let's go.

739
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:10,470
Let's go.

740
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,510
Chief.

741
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,729
Si Long

742
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,280
is the eldest
of Lou Gao's four direct disciples.

743
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,510
I am Tang San.

744
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,870
Can you let us meet Master Lou Gao?

745
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,320
Si Long,

746
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,760
he is an esteemed guest.

747
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,819
Bring us to see Lou Gao

748
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,200
and see what he's up to.

749
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,160
Master should be
in the forging room now.

750
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,030
Please come with me.

751
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,529
(Blacksmith Guild)

752
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,569
This is the Blacksmith Guild.

753
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,779
The first-floor lobby

754
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,320
is where blacksmiths sell their wares.

755
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,169
The second floor is
the high-class metal trade area.

756
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,499
Those who can open a shop there

757
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,280
are reputable merchants of Gengxin City.

758
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,209
The third floor
is the Blacksmith Registration...

759
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,200
Enough.

760
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,990
I'll tell them all this.

761
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Just take us to the fifth floor
to see Lou Gao.

762
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,120
Sure.

763
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,030
This way, please.

764
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:10,979
(Blacksmith Guild)

765
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,649
Over here.

766
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,320
Follow me.

767
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,120
This is my master's forging room.

768
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,030
Please come in.

769
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,240
Who dares to annoy me again?

770
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,280
Get lost!

771
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,209
Master,

772
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,800
it's Vice President Titan.

773
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,529
Buddy, what do you think?

774
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,019
Were you surprised?

775
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,680
Where did you get this?

776
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,689
I know you are interested

777
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,689
in this, Geezer.

778
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,729
Let me tell you.

779
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,800
This is a good thing.

780
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,030
Come.

781
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,979
Let me show you

782
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,390
the inner structure
once it has been dismantled.

783
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,350
Let's go.

784
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:10,280
I spent a lot of money
to buy two of them.

785
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,019
To study its internal structure,
I dismantled one of them

786
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,379
and I think

787
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,529
I probably broke some parts.

788
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,720
I was thinking about how to restore it.

789
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:21,939
Buddy,

790
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,689
the person who created this

791
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,800
must be a genius!

792
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,320
Master.

793
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,169
Where did you
get this Godly Zhuge Crossbow?

794
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,350
Godly Zhuge Crossbow?

795
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,689
How do you know that?

796
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:37,569
He is the genius
who created this Godly Crossbow.

797
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:40,089
Our chief, Tang San.

798
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,200
Who?

799
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,320
Tang San!

800
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,569
Can't you speak louder?

801
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,729
You sound like a mosquito.

802
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,550
Who?

803
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,169
Tang San!

804
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:56,950
That's right.

805
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,830
I invented this Godly Zhuge Crossbow.

806
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,640
You invented it?

807
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:03,979
Can you tell me

808
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,350
how to restore it?

809
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,430
I sold this Godly Zhuge Crossbow

810
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,430
to Qibao Amber Sect.

811
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,080
(No. 189)
There's a serial number here.

812
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,569
How did it get distributed?

813
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,529
What Qibao Amber Sect?

814
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,129
I spent a lot of money

815
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,529
to buy it from an auction!

816
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,280
What Qibao Amber Sect?

817
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,950
It seems like Martial Soul Hall
sent all the weapons they seized

818
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,390
to the auction marketplace.

819
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,689
This is probably

820
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,240
related to the special mechanism inside.

821
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:31,939
Kid,

822
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,729
tell me

823
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,510
what's going on.

824
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,550
Master Lou Gao,

825
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,030
there's an anti-dismantling mechanism.

826
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,499
If you dismantle it,

827
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,800
it will break.

828
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,720
If you want to restore it,

829
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,529
you must change a few parts.

830
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,609
No problem.

831
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:49,200
I have all kinds of metal here.

832
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,609
What parts do you need?

833
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,680
I can make one for you.

834
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,120
I might have to disappoint you.

835
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,390
You are a God Blacksmith.

836
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,979
If I restore it in front of you,

837
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,800
doesn't it mean
I'll be revealing its secrets

838
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,990
to you?

839
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,280
Titan!

840
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,129
Control the kid you brought.

841
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,600
Is that how he speaks to his elders?

842
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,510
Brother.

843
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,169
This kid

844
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,209
is the chief of Tang Clan.

845
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,030
I have to obey him.

846
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,280
Old Man,

847
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,779
if you can't continue

848
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,339
as the chief of the Tribe of Strength,

849
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,339
you can return to the Blacksmith Guild.

850
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,019
I've been saving

851
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,800
the spot of vice president for you.

852
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,910
There's no need to join

853
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,240
the stupid Tang Clan
which I've never heard before.

854
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,240
Don't speak nonsense.

855
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,550
Buddy,

856
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,280
you are obsessed with weapons.

857
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,830
Do you know

858
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,779
all the secrets inside

859
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,569
after joining the Tang Clan?

860
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,600
Brother,

861
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,080
Of course, I know.

862
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,339
Because the Godly Zhuge Crossbow

863
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,569
is just a basic secret weapon.

864
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,720
Basic secret weapon?

865
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,609
Tell me. What kind of
other secret weapons are there?

866
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,129
Those who are not disciples of the clan

867
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,899
cannot know the secret weapon's secrets.

868
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,510
You...

869
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,200
Fine.

870
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,990
I can just join Tang Clan.

871
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,640
With my blacksmithing abilities,

872
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,610
it shouldn't be a problem
to become a core disciple, right?

873
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,499
Tell me

874
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,320
what secrets are inside.

875
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,419
Master Lou Gao,

876
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,990
are you sure you want to join Tang Clan?

877
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,320
You are the president
of the Blacksmith Guild.

878
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,729
It's fine.

879
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,600
I'm sick of being the president.

880
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,129
But since I came across

881
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,939
this Godly Zhuge Crossbow,

882
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,339
my urge to forge

883
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,830
has appeared again.

884
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,299
Let me tell you.

885
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,299
I've never had this feeling
for many years

886
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,299
but now,

887
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,569
it feels exactly the same
as when I just learned

888
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,760
how to forge.

889
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,080
Why are we talking about this?

890
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,729
Can you tell me

891
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,680
how this is manufactured?

892
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,609
After joining Tang Clan,

893
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,080
you will be a disciple of the clan

894
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,870
who only serves Tang Clan.

895
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,019
All of Tang Clan's techniques
cannot be spread to others

896
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,470
including blacksmiths
who are not from Tang Clan.

897
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,470
Si Long!

898
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:20,499
Come here immediately!

899
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,430
Master!

900
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,680
Master, what is it?

901
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,209
From now on,

902
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,870
you will be the president
of the Blacksmith Guild.

903
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,240
I'll leave all my work

904
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,910
to the four of you.

905
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,200
I won't be
at the Blacksmith Guild anymore.

906
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,339
You must manage it well.

907
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,800
If you have something you can't handle,

908
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,430
find Titan.

909
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,510
Brother.

910
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,030
This is

911
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,030
such a casual handover ceremony.

912
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,720
Yes.

913
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,430
No.

914
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,459
Master,

915
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,910
are you just going to leave?

916
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,986
Don't you want the guild anymore?

917
00:41:58,987 --> 00:42:00,249
Don't you want your house anymore?

918
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,979
I've been alone all my life

919
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,720
and only love forging.

920
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,019
My home is the place

921
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,550
where I can forge.

922
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,640
Master,

923
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,640
are you serious?

924
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,430
I can't succeed without taking a risk.

925
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,430
I'm sure I want to join Tang Clan.

926
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:17,990
Kid,

927
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,569
do you dare accept me?

928
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,390
Yes.

929
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,720
Of course.

930
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,379
If you join Tang Clan,

931
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,350
you will be an elder of Tang Clan

932
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,240
like Master Titan.

933
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,049
You must tell me

934
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,680
how you make this crossbow now, right?

935
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,390
What?

936
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,320
Master Lou Gao,

937
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,529
the Godly Zhuge Crossbow

938
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,510
is just the clan's most basic weapon.

939
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,599
It is unworthy of your identity
as a God Blacksmith.

940
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,160
Someone with your identity
can only make the clan's

941
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,640
advanced secret weapon.

942
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,899
Are there secret weapons

943
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,800
that are more advanced
than the Godly Zhuge Crossbow?

944
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,120
They are miles apart.

945
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,760
Our clan's advanced secret weapon can even
threaten the life of a Grand Soul Master.

946
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,529
Once you make it,

947
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,160
you will be the pioneer
of the Blacksmithing world.
