=The Land of Warriors=

19
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,300
=Episode 25=

21
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,420
I knew I wasn't mistaken.

22
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,970
Your smile is exactly
as I remembered it.

23
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,730
Birds of a feather flock together.

24
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,170
I...

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,810
I'm different from them.

26
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,300
We have met before.

27
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,420
So, we're kindred spirits.

28
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,904
If you like her, I'll give her to you.

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,880
Why would you hit me?

30
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,700
I'd like to hit you more.

31
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,970
You, you, you...

32
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,530
Miss!

33
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,890
Miss!

34
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,730
We met before!

35
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,730
What's in your scented sachet?

36
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,770
It smells so nice.

37
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,210
You don't remember me?

38
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,930
You...

39
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,930
How could I forget?

40
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,580
Have we also met in a dream?

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,650
Oh, so you also met me in your dream.

42
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,540
To be honest,

43
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,980
I've dreamed of you as well,

44
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,820
even of the tavern where we first met.

45
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,020
A tavern?

46
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,490
Your dream is oddly specific.

47
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,650
Don't you remember?

48
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,050
Back then, in that tavern,

49
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,300
there was a swindler

50
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:49,770
trying to deceive a young lady,

51
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,420
and then you...

52
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,210
A swindler trying
to deceive a young lady?

53
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,020
Wasn't that you?

54
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,890
At this moment.

55
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,650
Right now.

56
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,650
It wasn't me!

57
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,820
It was the Wretched Trio.

58
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,820
Wretched?

59
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,210
Indeed, you are wretched.

60
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,210
Don't bother me.

61
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,860
Xiang!

62
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,580
Grandpa!

63
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,296
(Bai He, Chief of Tribe of Agility)

64
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:38,240
What's going on?

65
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,450
Just a lecherous man.

66
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,856
I've already taught him a lesson.

67
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,020
You're so young,

68
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,700
and already so unambitious.

69
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,980
If I see you again next time,

70
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,730
I won't let you off!

71
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,170
Exactly!

72
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,328
It's all a misunderstanding!

73
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:53,980
I mean it!

74
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,490
Elder.

75
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,860
No need to talk to him.

76
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:56,820
Grandpa,

77
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,648
let's leave here.

78
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,330
Xiang...

79
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,540
So, her name is Xiang.

80
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:18,080
Master Huyan, there's
no need for formalities.

81
00:04:18,144 --> 00:04:20,272
The Crown Princess and I
are traveling in disguise.

82
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,648
Ignorance is understandable.

83
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,380
Master, please rise

84
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,580
and sit down for a chat.

85
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,890
Thank you, Your Highnesses.

86
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:28,304
Please have some tea.

87
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,700
I wasn't aware

88
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,380
that Your Highnesses are familiar
with the Tribe of Defense.

89
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,090
Previously,

90
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,290
I barged in on you.

91
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,940
I hope I didn't disturb you.

92
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,290
Please.

93
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,330
It's normal for the tribes

94
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:53,568
to have some interactions
and occasional sparring.

95
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,680
You're preparing
for the Seven Clans' reelection,

96
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,090
and trying to win over other tribes.

97
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,500
This is understandable.

98
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,620
But, Master Huyan,

99
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,450
you must be mindful of your methods.

100
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,450
You're right, Your Highness.

101
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,410
I've had a long-standing
friendship with Niu Gao.

102
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,260
I hoped we could
join forces for the future,

103
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,500
but he keeps shutting me out.

104
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,260
That's why I became a little anxious.

105
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,290
You don't have to explain.

106
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,890
We're not here

107
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,820
on behalf of the Tribe of Defense.

108
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,820
The Elephant Armored Tribe
establishes a clan in Xingluo Empire.

109
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,450
If it becomes the foremost of all clans

110
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,770
in the Seven Clans reelection,

111
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,410
it would be a great
blessing for Xingluo.

112
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,020
If there's anything
you need us to mediate,

113
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,290
don't hesitate to ask.

114
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:38,890
How could I dare
trouble Your Highnesses?

115
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,290
Your words alone

116
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,890
are the greatest support
for the Elephant Armored Tribe.

117
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,472
If we succeed in taking
the top spot in the reelection,

118
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:47,060
I will surely serve the country.

119
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,090
You have such an earnest dedication.

120
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,450
I must report it
truthfully to His Majesty.

121
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,500
But,

122
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,940
to serve the nation,

123
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,290
why wait for the future?

124
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:57,936
You can start doing it now.

125
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,260
Your Highnesses, feel free
to give any instructions.

126
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,020
There are several chiefs

127
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,530
in the Longxingg Town are missing.

128
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,410
Have you heard of this?

129
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,500
I see, this is what brought you here.

130
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,020
The current situation is chaotic.

131
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,820
Some chiefs couldn't bear the burden,

132
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,740
and abandoned their clans.

133
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,500
As for these clans,

134
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,090
I help where I can.

135
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,770
Those willing to join
the Elephant Armored Tribe,

136
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,140
I accept them all

137
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,090
as a small contribution

138
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,450
to the soul master world.

139
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:45,104
Master Huyan, how noble you are!

140
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:49,056
It seems you don't know the
whereabouts of those missing chiefs.

141
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,580
If I knew,

142
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,180
how could I not go after them?

143
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,408
Your Highnesses,

144
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,850
are you suspecting us,
the Elephant Armored Tribe

145
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,970
is involved in it?

146
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,290
Of course not.

147
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:06,832
The disappearance of so many
chiefs in Longxingg Town

148
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,472
is a matter of concern for both
the nation and its people.

149
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,850
I just hope that Master Huyan

150
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,620
will personally investigate the matter.

151
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,700
We can't afford

152
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,180
to lose any more chiefs.

153
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,260
Otherwise, if this escalates

154
00:07:18,464 --> 00:07:20,060
and reaches His Majesty's ears,

155
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:22,496
things might change
drastically in Longxingg Town.

156
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,580
You're right, Your Highness.

157
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,410
I will thoroughly investigate

158
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:28,820
and ease His Majesty's concerns.

159
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:34,090
What a bored
conversation between you two!

160
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,700
Master Huyan,

161
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,480
how about I take a look around
your Elephant Armored Tribe?

162
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,740
Sure.

163
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:40,890
Someone!

164
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,576
Please serve the Crown Princess well.

165
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,180
Yes.

166
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,620
Your Highness, please.

167
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,440
Your Highness,

168
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,496
you're going the wrong way.

169
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:05,500
This area is prohibited.

170
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,500
Isn't this a garden?

171
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:13,872
The flowers are blooming beautifully.

172
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,330
Take me inside for a look.

173
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,140
Your Highness,

174
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,060
this area is under renovation.

175
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,890
You can't go in.

176
00:08:19,968 --> 00:08:21,580
If you wish to have
a walk in the garden,

177
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,704
there's another one.

178
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,224
I'll take you there immediately.

179
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:26,140
The flowers are just so beautiful.

180
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:28,016
Let me pick one,
and then we'll go elsewhere.

181
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,090
No, Your Highness.

182
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,020
Don't do that.

183
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,210
Your Highness,

184
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:31,936
please don't.

185
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,050
Stop!

186
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:35,140
This is the tribe's forbidden area.

187
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:36,608
What are you doing here?

188
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,776
What are you looking at?

189
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:38,690
Get out of here!

190
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:42,384
Who gave you the guts
to speak to me like this?

191
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:43,899
Your Highness, please don't be angry.

192
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,620
Mind your manners!

193
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,192
She's the Crown Princess of Xingluo.

194
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:46,640
Your...

195
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:48,890
Your Highness, forgive me.

196
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,360
Say it or not.

197
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,020
You...

198
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:08,860
Step aside!

199
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,410
I...

200
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,050
Step aside!

201
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,290
This is no place for the Crown Princess.

202
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,140
Master Huyan,

203
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:38,416
do you know the punishment

204
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,280
for showing disrespect
to the Crown Princess?

205
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,280
Your Highnesses,

206
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,980
I've treated you with sincerity.

207
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,930
Why are you intruding

208
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,340
into my tribe's forbidden area?

209
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Don't play dumb.

210
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,980
What's hidden in this dungeon?

211
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:53,696
They are my disciples
who need to be punished.

212
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,980
What grave mistake did they commit

213
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,650
to deserve such harsh punishment?

214
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,220
This is a private matter of my tribe.

215
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,380
No need for Your Highness to meddle.

216
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,690
I don't care how you
discipline your disciples,

217
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,930
but didn't you promise me

218
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,980
to help investigate the missing chiefs?

219
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:13,872
I suspect there's something
suspicious about this place.

220
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:15,248
Let's go down and take a look.

221
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,460
Stop them!

222
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,260
Presumptuous!

223
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,020
Let's see who dares
disrespect the two Highnesses.

224
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,020
Father!

225
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,140
I didn't expect Your Grace to be here.

226
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:30,928
Forgive me for not
welcoming you properly.

227
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,570
Crown Prince,

228
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,448
and Crown Princess,

229
00:10:36,464 --> 00:10:37,360
are you alright?

230
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:38,570
Rest assured,

231
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,260
Your Grace.

232
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,690
We are fine.

233
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,620
Master Huyan.

234
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:45,890
Your Grace.

235
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,930
What is going on here?

236
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,260
This is all a misunderstanding.

237
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,020
A misunderstanding?

238
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,352
It's great if it's just
a misunderstanding.

239
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:07,584
Thank you, Your Grace.

240
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,650
His Majesty

241
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,220
eagerly anticipates

242
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,050
the competition between the clans

243
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:14,410
for the Seven Clans reelection.

244
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,930
But,

245
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,050
if someone tends to expand their tribe

246
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,380
and disregards the law,

247
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,650
Xingluo will not stand idly by.

248
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,050
The Crown Prince's stance

249
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,050
is the stance of Xingluo.

250
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:26,930
Understood.

251
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,170
I think

252
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,020
Master Huyan

253
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,770
knows how to settle the matter now.

254
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,290
Understood.

255
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,220
His Highness has made his point clearly.

256
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,860
I will investigate

257
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,260
the missing chiefs' whereabouts

258
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,140
and ensure their safety.

259
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,140
Your Highness, please.

260
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,140
Farewell, Your Highnesses.

261
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:52,810
Master.

262
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,220
His Majesty has ordered you
to return with me.

263
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,530
No way!

264
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:17,600
The Elephant Armored Tribe has
always aimed for the Tribe of Defense.

265
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,170
Today, we managed to suppress him,

266
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:20,432
but if we leave just like this,

267
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:22,530
he'll certainly vent it out
on the Tribe of Defense.

268
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,792
What about San and the others?

269
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:24,930
Moreover,

270
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,072
the Elephant Armored Tribe
uses despicable methods

271
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,380
to strengthen its power.

272
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,980
We cannot turn a blind eye.

273
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,860
Mubai is right.

274
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,880
Keep your mouth shut!

275
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,770
As the Crown Princess,

276
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,472
you should persuade the Crown Prince
to focus on the nation.

277
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,930
But, what are you doing instead?

278
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,770
Do you still remember your position?

279
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,860
Your Grace,

280
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,890
Zhuqing has done nothing wrong,

281
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:48,060
and neither have
we forgotten our position.

282
00:12:48,064 --> 00:12:50,460
Stopping Elephant Armored Tribe
from continuing its misdeeds

283
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,384
is also a way to restore
order in Longxingg Town

284
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,740
and benefit its people.

285
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,260
Your Highness, as the heir,

286
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,860
I shouldn't have to lecture you.

287
00:12:57,872 --> 00:12:59,808
However, following
His Majesty's instructions

288
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,890
and as an elder,

289
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,410
I must say this,

290
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,410
while the Elephant
Armored Tribe is in Xingluo,

291
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,530
it is essentially under the control
of the Martial Soul Hall.

292
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,690
You two,

293
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,500
as part of the royal family
has openly intervened,

294
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,980
intended to expose crimes on the spot,

295
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,050
and left no room for negotiation.

296
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,650
Isn't that pushing Xingluo

297
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,930
to become the
Martial Soul Hall's sworn enemy?

298
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,410
Elephant Armored Tribe
alone is no threat.

299
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:29,968
But against the Martial Soul Hall,

300
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,100
neither Xingluo nor Tiandou

301
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,220
dares claim they can stand a chance.

302
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,740
As the Crown Prince,

303
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,050
do you

304
00:13:37,328 --> 00:13:38,930
not realize that your impulsive actions

305
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,380
could push the entire
nation into danger?

306
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,140
That wasn't my intention.

307
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,260
The Martial Soul Hall is powerful,

308
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:49,860
but endless concessions will
only embolden them further.

309
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:51,620
Xingluo has existed for a millennium.

310
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,880
Must we continue living in fear
of the Martial Soul Hall?

311
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,290
You could be a fearless hero,

312
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,810
but can you alone

313
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,460
resist the Martial Soul Hall's

314
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,740
numerous Grand Soul Masters?

315
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,410
Can you?

316
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,220
When they encounter one day,

317
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,740
will you be the one at the front,

318
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,536
or will it be the people
under your rule?

319
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:06,544
Your courage

320
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:08,650
comes at the cost of their lives.

321
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,552
My dear daughter,

322
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:10,860
have you thought this through?

323
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,690
His Majesty's letter reminded you two

324
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,740
not to forget that
you are the Crown Prince

325
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,930
and the Crown Princess,

326
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:21,460
but more importantly, to remember

327
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,810
the people and nation you represent.

328
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,020
Your every decision

329
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,860
shapes their future.

330
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,740
In fact,

331
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,860
it's not just Longxing Town.

332
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:36,290
Even the Capital of Metal, Gengxin City,

333
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,170
is plagued by the
Martial Soul Hall's arrogance.

334
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,944
You must mature quickly

335
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,810
to shoulder the
responsibility for the action

336
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,220
and resolve the people's hardships.

337
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,050
You cannot act on impulse again.

338
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,140
Your Grace,

339
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,050
we were reckless in our actions earlier.

340
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:54,690
Zhuqing and I will return to the palace.

341
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,930
Also,

342
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,144
the chief of the
Tribe of Defense, Niu Gao,

343
00:14:58,144 --> 00:14:59,712
has agreed to join the Tang Clan.

344
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:01,740
Soon, he will leave
with my brother Tang San.

345
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,112
Once we ensure their safety
before leaving Xingluo,

346
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,930
Zhuqing and I will return.

347
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:10,140
Today's reprimand
of Huyan Zhen will likely

348
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,170
lead him to quietly release

349
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,408
the imprisoned chiefs.

350
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,248
But, I'm afraid that after we leave,

351
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,752
he will revert to his old ways.

352
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,770
I will handle this matter

353
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,020
to ensure the safety

354
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:22,592
of those clans in the future.

355
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,140
Since Your Highness
has promised to return,

356
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,650
I shall report to
His Majesty accordingly.

357
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,570
Thank you, Your Grace.

358
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,050
Zhuqing,

359
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,290
His Majesty mentioned

360
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,340
that upon your return,

361
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,290
you should start preparing
for the wedding.

362
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,792
It's time for you to focus
and prepare yourself

363
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,290
to assist the
Crown Prince in the future.

364
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,570
Please.

365
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,860
Although His Grace's words is harsh,

366
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,570
he was just reminding us.

367
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,020
You don't take it to heart.

368
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:30,860
Zhuqing,

369
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:32,736
what's wrong with you?

370
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,860
I don't want to go back.

371
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,792
Is it because His Grace suddenly
brought up the wedding

372
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:46,576
and it scared you?

373
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,650
Don't worry.

374
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,890
It's just a matter of planning the date,

375
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,140
it won't happen instantly.

376
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,140
I'll discuss it with my father.

377
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,050
Besides,

378
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,264
I haven't even proposed to you yet.

379
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,704
How could we rush things like this?

380
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:22,900
Look.

381
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:28,940
Mubai,

382
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:35,200
I don't want to be a Crown Princess.

383
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:37,220
You don't want to marry me?

384
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:38,640
Of course, I want to marry you.

385
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:41,940
But I don't want to
be Xingluo's Crown Princess.

386
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,850
This identity is too heavy for me.

387
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:46,384
The Duke's words must
have stressed you out.

388
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,090
Zhuqing,

389
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,530
you're not alone.

390
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,500
Whatever happens, I'll face it with you.

391
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,740
How messy you are!

392
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,384
Go ahead.

393
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,570
Look at those two kids.

394
00:18:01,552 --> 00:18:03,168
They live a simple and happy life.

395
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:06,464
Even if they're ordinary,
they have nothing to fear.

396
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Unlike us,

397
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,810
from the moment we were born,

398
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,752
we were part of a gamble
that demanded lives.

399
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,370
The strong survive.

400
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,460
The weak perish.

401
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,288
You're still worried
about the ancestral system.

402
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,180
I've told you,

403
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:23,008
once I ascend the throne,

404
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:24,020
everything will change.

405
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,980
And what if the one who changes is you?

406
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,290
As my father said,

407
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:30,530
being the Crown Prince
is not just about yourself.

408
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,020
When you take that position,

409
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,260
many things change.

410
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:34,610
You can't control everything,

411
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:36,784
and it's hard to say
what's right or wrong.

412
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,900
That's why

413
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,330
I'm trying to build our future.

414
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,740
I dream of ruling Xingluo with you.

415
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:45,824
But, there's no place
for me in the future.

416
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,660
I haven't thought that far.

417
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:50,900
I just hope

418
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,330
we can respect our wills

419
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,770
and do what we want.

420
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,130
But everything I want
to do includes you.

421
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:04,900
Forget it.

422
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:06,940
Let's go back.

423
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,460
Stop.

424
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,570
Why are you angry?

425
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,660
Shouldn't I be the one angry or upset?

426
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,980
Why am I angry?

427
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,464
Do you think everything I want to do

428
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,472
doesn't include you?

429
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:21,040
You dream of ruling Xingluo with me.

430
00:19:21,088 --> 00:19:22,720
I dream of traveling
everywhere with you.

431
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:24,770
From birth, I was assigned
to be your fiancee.

432
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:27,008
When you lost to Dai Weisi,
I'd have to die with you.

433
00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:29,840
Now you're the Crown Prince,
and I must rule the empire by your side.

434
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:30,700
Does my entire life

435
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,130
belong to you, Dai Mubai?

436
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,090
Then who am I?

437
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,500
Has anyone asked me what I want?

438
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,770
If I didn't love you,

439
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,420
I wouldn't be struggling with all this.

440
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,260
I would've left long ago.

441
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,460
Or if I were more domineering,

442
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:49,344
I'd force you to give up
the throne in the name of love,

443
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,248
letting you go through
all the sufferings.

444
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,980
But, I don't want to do that,

445
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,700
because I'm tired of being manipulated.

446
00:19:56,784 --> 00:19:59,330
I don't want the person I love
to sacrifice their dreams for me.

447
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,460
If our paths diverge,

448
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,980
then let's not force
each other into our plans.

449
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:07,700
I don't want you
to sacrifice for myself.

450
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,260
Likewise,

451
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,330
I don't want
to sacrifice myself for you.

452
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,420
Maybe I'm being selfish,

453
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,290
but I only have one life.

454
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:31,940
I care no more about what others think.

455
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,180
Zhuqing!

456
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,370
Zhuqing...

457
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,570
Fatty.

458
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,850
Why are you sighing?

459
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,570
Boss Dai,

460
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:48,330
Zhuqing and you have
left the Elephant Armored Tribe?

461
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:50,980
Forget it.

462
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:51,850
Let's go back.

463
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,980
Mr. Bai He,

464
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,770
as a junior, Tang San,

465
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,290
sincerely invites you

466
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,928
to join the Tang Clan with your tribe

467
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:09,136
to stand together
against the Martial Soul Hall.

468
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,610
The great promises at the beginning

469
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:15,900
always ended up being miserable
during the crisis.

470
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,330
The Tribe of Agility has been
through this once before

471
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,370
and is afraid.

472
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,770
I appreciate your kindness, Chief Tang.

473
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,570
But, joining the Tang Clan

474
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,700
is impossible.

475
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,290
You...

476
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,330
Old White Bird!

477
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,850
A piece of wood
can be broken easily.

478
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,080
Why are you being so stubborn?

479
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,216
I understand your concerns,

480
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:38,610
isn't it all because of...

481
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,330
The big dream was ruined,

482
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,020
and I drowned in the sea of bitterness.

483
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,330
Since you understand me,

484
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,570
don't bring up

485
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,290
the past anymore.

486
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,660
Old White Bird,

487
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,660
stop being so pretentious!

488
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,530
Your Tribe of Agility has had
a tough time.

489
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,928
What's the point of being stubborn?

490
00:21:54,944 --> 00:21:56,848
If it weren't for us
brothers protecting you,

491
00:21:56,896 --> 00:21:58,528
with your defensive power alone,

492
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:00,608
your tribe would have
long been taken by others.

493
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,260
Old Rhino might be blunt,

494
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,460
but he's speaking the truth.

495
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:13,936
In the end, it's about us brothers

496
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:16,530
supporting each other.

497
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,460
That's unnecessary.

498
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,810
We can't decide fate and fortune.

499
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,980
The Tribe of Agility

500
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,128
has relied on your
protection for many years.

501
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,940
From now on,

502
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,660
it all depends on our destiny.

503
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,050
Since you've joined the Tang Clan,

504
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,660
it's time for us to part ways.

505
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,980
Regarding the Four Tribes gathering,

506
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,020
I think

507
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,740
we should just dismiss.

508
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,020
What are you saying?

509
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,610
Joining the Tang Clan

510
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,420
doesn't mean we can't
be brothers anymore.

511
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,810
Do you think we'd harm you?

512
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,700
We're amid the hardships,

513
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,180
but if we unite,

514
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,050
we could drink

515
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,940
and eat together, isn't this sound good?

516
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,090
Old White Bird,

517
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,020
trust me, joining the Tang Clan

518
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,500
is the right move.

519
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,610
Don't worry.

520
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,090
I'll seek assistance
from the Tribe of Destruction.

521
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,020
You...

522
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,610
Why are you all here together?

523
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:13,744
San is waiting for us in the main hall.

524
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,460
The Tribe of Agility has arrived.

525
00:23:22,272 --> 00:23:25,248
Mubai and Zhuqing failed in their
mission at the Elephant Armored Tribe.

526
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,980
But, why does Fatty look so down too?

527
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:32,180
He doesn't seem

528
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,020
defeated and depressed,

529
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,130
but more like

530
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,610
heartbroken.

531
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,130
Are you heartbroken?

532
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:40,980
Heartbroken?

533
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,220
Impossible!

534
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,810
In my love dictionary,

535
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,272
there is no word for heartbreak.

536
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,180
He's crazy.

537
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,700
Let's go and see what's going on.

538
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,530
Stop talking nonsense.

539
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,220
Is it that you think the master

540
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,090
is too young to trust?

541
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,050
Let me tell you,

542
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,810
even I'm impressed by his abilities,

543
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,260
and also his friends,

544
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,660
all of them are extraordinary.

545
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,129
You just come at the right time.

546
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:11,980
I tell you,

547
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,940
Old White Bird,

548
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,090
this is the chief's close friend.

549
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,980
Though his look is incomparable to me,

550
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,370
his martial soul...

551
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,660
It's you!

552
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,420
Xiang!

553
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,050
Shut up!

554
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,536
Who allows you to call me that?

555
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:30,810
It turns out

556
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,260
that he's your friend?

557
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,500
Exactly.

558
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,570
Chief Tang,

559
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,980
you must be cautious

560
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,130
when choosing friends.

561
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,260
Xiang,

562
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:42,496
let's head to the
inner courtyard for a rest.

563
00:24:42,544 --> 00:24:43,168
No.

564
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:44,900
Old White Bird,

565
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,888
what's wrong with you?

566
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:47,664
There's still so much
food and liquor left,

567
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,610
including two roasted lambs!

568
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,260
I have no appetite.

569
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:52,770
Old Rhino,

570
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,500
remember my words,

571
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,130
think carefully before making friends.

572
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,290
Xiang.

573
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:00,700
Grandpa!

574
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,980
Let's go.

575
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,460
Elder...

576
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:04,810
Xiang.

577
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,500
Xiang!

578
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,610
Xiang!

579
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,500
You stubborn old man...

580
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,220
Xiang!

581
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,180
Elder Titan,

582
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,260
it's getting late,

583
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,896
Mr. Bai He might be tired already.

584
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,660
Let's discuss this tomorrow.

585
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,330
Fatty,

586
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,940
explain yourself.

587
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,370
I have never met her again.

588
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,610
It turns out that she'd be
from the Tribe of Agility.

589
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,290
And now, she misunderstands me,

590
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,570
disrupting

591
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,810
Tang Clan's plan
to unite with their tribe.

592
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,770
It's not your fault.

593
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,050
Titan and Mr. Niu Gao told me

594
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,740
they'd handle Mr. Bai He.

595
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,700
He's so straightforward,

596
00:25:50,784 --> 00:25:52,180
that I couldn't even explain myself.

597
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,810
I'll figure out another way.

598
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,180
Anyway, Fatty,

599
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,460
this wasn't your fault.

600
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,770
That's a relief.

601
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,660
So, the woman in white
you mentioned earlier

602
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,500
is her.

603
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:03,460
You have been doing
great things together.

604
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,260
It sounds quite romantic.

605
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,050
So,

606
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,500
do you think that we're destined?

607
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,740
Fatty,

608
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,610
meeting once is a coincidence.

609
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,700
Meeting twice is destiny.

610
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,260
Destiny.

611
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,330
This is the third time,

612
00:26:18,384 --> 00:26:20,448
it's confirmed the work
of the match-matching god!

613
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,090
You always understand me, Ao.

614
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:22,940
Of course.

615
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,900
So,

616
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,740
what should I do next?

617
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:26,850
Fatty,

618
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:29,090
could it be that
you're imagining things?

619
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,740
I don't think she even remembers you.

620
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,130
Zhuqing,

621
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:34,848
it's fine if you don't encourage me,

622
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,330
but don't hurt me.

623
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,220
Fatty,

624
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,420
I support you.

625
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,432
That's all misunderstanding
between the two of you.

626
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:41,472
Just voice out anything,

627
00:26:41,488 --> 00:26:42,880
and the problem can be resolved.

628
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,810
From my love experience,

629
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,370
a good relationship
requires communication.

630
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,090
More communication
and makes things clear.

631
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,239
Then, it leads to a future.

632
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,990
More communication.

633
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,420
Fatty,

634
00:26:50,704 --> 00:26:51,810
I advise you to be cautious.

635
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,610
Don't just think about yourself,

636
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,180
consider her feelings too.

637
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,220
As the saying goes,

638
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,050
forced love will not be sweet.

639
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,420
Fatty,

640
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,570
trust me,

641
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,050
love is all about courage.

642
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,020
Pursue it boldly

643
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,290
and face any obstacles head-on.

644
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:03,824
Courage!

645
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,980
Those who give up easily

646
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,530
are unworthy of love.

647
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,850
The foundation of love is respect.

648
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:09,840
Without that, one shouldn't
even speak of love.

649
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,850
Fatty, don't listen...

650
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,330
Stop!

651
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,940
You two, saying this and that.

652
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,290
Who am I supposed to listen to?

653
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,192
- Mine!
- Mine!

654
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,330
Boss Dai,

655
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,290
did you and Zhuqing have a fight?

656
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:19,980
No.

657
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,120
What happened

658
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,980
when you were at the
Elephant Armored Tribe?

659
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,900
Why did you become
like this after returning?

660
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,850
It's our matter.

661
00:27:33,072 --> 00:27:34,260
We'll resolve it ourselves.

662
00:27:34,864 --> 00:27:36,608
But, regarding the
Elephant Armored Tribe,

663
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,090
we have to tell you all.

664
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,260
Without a fight,

665
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,610
we rescued all the arrested chiefs.

666
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,660
It seems the Elephant Armored Tribe

667
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,192
still fears the Xingluo Royal Family.

668
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,330
His Grace will personally
handle the rest.

669
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,370
The chiefs will be safe now.

670
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,700
Boss Dai,

671
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,330
when did you promise Duke to return?

672
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,810
The Elephant Armored Tribe has
long coveted the Tribe of Defense.

673
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,080
I guess they might take further action.

674
00:28:02,112 --> 00:28:03,980
Let's wait until it's safe
for you to return.

675
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:04,460
Alright.

676
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,220
His Grace is right.

677
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,420
Boss Dai,

678
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,530
Zhuqing,

679
00:28:08,768 --> 00:28:10,496
you should keep low profile for now.

680
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,420
Don't worry.

681
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,850
I know what to do.

682
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,220
Let's go.

683
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:28,770
Chief,

684
00:28:28,912 --> 00:28:31,088
I have released the
arrested people in the dungeon.

685
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,570
They're deeply grateful

686
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,940
for your mercy

687
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,810
and pledge loyalty to you.

688
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,940
What a bunch of useless guys.

689
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,530
Everything is nearly settled.

690
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,020
Since the Xingluo Crown Prince
wanted to intervene,

691
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,810
I'll give him this face.

692
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,500
You're wise, Chief!

693
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,460
By the way,

694
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:54,090
regarding the collusion
between the Tribe of Defense

695
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,940
and the Xingluo Royal Family,

696
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,220
should Martial Soul Hall...

697
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,850
Idiot!

698
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,530
If Her Holiness hears of this,

699
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,130
how could I face her?

700
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,770
The Tribe of Defense thinks involving
the Xingluo Royal Family

701
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,090
will make me withdraw myself.

702
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:12,208
But, I, Huyan Zhen, am not
someone who would go lenient.

703
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,460
One day,

704
00:29:15,696 --> 00:29:18,330
when the Elephant Armored Tribe
becomes the foremost of all clans,

705
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,530
even the Emperor Xingluo

706
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,570
will have to tolerate me.

707
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,700
That's just fine
for using some tricks now.

708
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,130
You're right.

709
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,180
Absolutely right!

710
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,740
I have a plan

711
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,700
and needs your decision.

712
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,530
The Tribe of Agility was here.

713
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,260
I believe

714
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:44,832
Yang Wudi from the Tribe of Destruction
will also be here soon.

715
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,220
Why not take this opportunity

716
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,810
to keep them all in one go?

717
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,530
On one hand, we can
weaken the enemy's forces,

718
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,770
and on the other hand,
we can warn everyone

719
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,180
showing the smaller clans

720
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,900
that you are

721
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,810
the only one worth relying on,

722
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:00,290
and dares not to go against you.

723
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,090
If we can take down
all the chiefs of the four tribes,

724
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,220
that would be ideal.

725
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,660
But if we start it forcibly,

726
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,696
it'll undoubtedly drain our strength.

727
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,420
Moreover, if the four
of them join forces,

728
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,090
they won't be easy to deal with.

729
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,810
There's a less complicated method.

730
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,850
Tell me now,

731
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,050
this time, Bai He comes along

732
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,370
with the heir of the Tribe of Agility,

733
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,460
which is his granddaughter,
Bai Chenxiang.

734
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,810
I heard that these four old folks

735
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,980
dote on her immensely.

736
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,420
If we can find an opportunity

737
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,420
to "invite" Bai Chenxiang to stay
with us for a few days,

738
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,900
I think the old fellows

739
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,740
will definitely come here personally.

740
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,980
Once they make it here,

741
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,700
we'll make sure they regret it.

742
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,660
That's the same tactic I used before!

743
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,220
Shameless!

744
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,530
But it works.

745
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:14,980
Have a fight?

746
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,570
You told me,

747
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,260
Wu taught you that.

748
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,900
If you're unhappy, go for a fight.

749
00:31:19,936 --> 00:31:21,344
If you're confused, go for a fight.

750
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,832
If you can't explain it, go for a fight.

751
00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:23,312
Come on.

752
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,640
We will follow whoever wins.

753
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,130
Alright.

754
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,090
You win.

755
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:47,130
Please take it seriously.

756
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,700
I am serious.

757
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,530
Besides,

758
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,960
losing to you is not
something to be embarrassed.

759
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,090
Zhuqing,

760
00:31:56,272 --> 00:31:57,776
you won. I'll listen to you.

761
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,610
Are you sure?

762
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,740
Only one thing,

763
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,800
if you want to separate from me,

764
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,090
I won't agree.

765
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,420
It's such a coincidence.

766
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,570
I won't agree either.

767
00:32:17,424 --> 00:32:18,660
Since you're following me,

768
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,900
after San and the others leave,

769
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,260
we'll go back together.

770
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,290
Zhuqing.

771
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,810
Listen to me first.

772
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,180
Now, the Martial Soul Hall

773
00:32:30,752 --> 00:32:32,610
has thrown the entire
continent into chaos.

774
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,420
Many people are experiencing
life-and-death separations.

775
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:38,180
The fact that we can still be together

776
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,260
is a blessing.

777
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,810
I don't want to waste it.

778
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,530
I've voiced out everything

779
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,610
on my mind to you.

780
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,770
And, you deliberately lost to me.

781
00:32:53,216 --> 00:32:55,296
This shows that you
understand my grievances.

782
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,850
I'm sorry.

783
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:06,960
I've always thought

784
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:08,832
our fates were destined to be together.

785
00:33:09,152 --> 00:33:12,064
I never considered whether you were
willing to be bound like this.

786
00:33:12,528 --> 00:33:13,660
I've also never asked

787
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,180
what kind of life you wanted.

788
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,260
You're right.

789
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,370
I oversimplified the idea

790
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,740
of overturning the ancestral rules.

791
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,370
But for your sake,
and for Xingluo's future,

792
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,090
I will give it my all.

793
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:34,900
Not just you,

794
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,050
but us.

795
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:42,460
Before changing the ancestral rules,

796
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,900
we have to face our responsibilities.

797
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,850
Do you remember San asking us

798
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,896
what the purpose
of becoming stronger is?

799
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,900
I always thought it was
to change my fate.

800
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,330
Now I understand,

801
00:33:55,376 --> 00:33:58,032
the purpose of becoming stronger
is to shoulder responsibility

802
00:33:58,464 --> 00:33:59,850
and to care for the world always.

803
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:00,850
Mubai,

804
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,530
together,

805
00:34:03,312 --> 00:34:04,900
we'll carry out our obligation.

806
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,500
It's late now.

807
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,840
Why aren't you going to rest?

808
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,170
For me,

809
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,730
cultivating is resting.

810
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,380
You've gone too much.

811
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:24,730
No,

812
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:26,460
it's not enough.

813
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,460
There's only one year left
until the clan reelection.

814
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,380
Time waits for no one.

815
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,570
Well.

816
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,210
Since I can't stop you,

817
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,460
I'll stay by your side.

818
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,780
If you stare at me like this,

819
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,020
I can't focus on my cultivation.

820
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,570
Stop flattering yourself.

821
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,860
It's your own thought.

822
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,250
Don't forget.

823
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,090
I'm just your imagination.

824
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,460
It seems that my heart
isn't calm enough.

825
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,690
Stop thinking about me

826
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:10,940
and focus on your cultivation.

827
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,170
That might be difficult.

828
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,420
But,

829
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,730
I can multitask.

830
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,500
I never realized

831
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,500
you were so slick.

832
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,090
Do you want to try again?

833
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:39,570
I've already tried several times.

834
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,570
This poison is truly
difficult to resolve.

835
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:42,780
It seems

836
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:45,020
I'll have to wait
until I've united the four clans,

837
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,512
so I could entrust this

838
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,020
to the expert elder.

839
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,340
So, it's all about
uniting the four clans.

840
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,820
But, your meeting with Mr. Bai He today

841
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,460
was totally a disaster.

842
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,130
Elder Niu and Elder Titan's good
intention led to more trouble.

843
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,820
Now, it's even harder.

844
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:02,900
That's fine.

845
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,860
I have other ways for this.

846
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,780
Do you remember what my aunt told me?

847
00:36:09,136 --> 00:36:12,208
The Tribe of Agility is the martial
soul masters from the Agility Branch.

848
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,250
In terms of speed,

849
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,530
no clans on the continent
can defeat them.

850
00:36:15,856 --> 00:36:18,080
But speaking of their
attacking and defensive power,

851
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,900
they're as weak as

852
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,008
the Qibao Amber Sect.

853
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,690
If the other three tribes didn't protect

854
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,568
the Tribe of Agility
over the past years,

855
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:27,008
even without the Martial Soul Hall,

856
00:36:27,056 --> 00:36:29,360
they would've been taken up
by the other clans long ago.

857
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,250
So, your grand uncle's weakness

858
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,420
is observable.

859
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,420
Just like the Qibao Amber Sect,

860
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,020
the Tang Clan can help them
solve the problems.

861
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,020
No wonder you're not worried at all.

862
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,104
It seems that you have
everything planned out.

863
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,768
I have little confidence to say that.

864
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,500
But,

865
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,420
as long as I hand this thing

866
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,730
to Mr. Bai He

867
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,584
and let him play with it for a few days,

868
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,250
he'll understand its significance

869
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,730
to the Tribe of Agility.

870
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,610
By that time, I'll show him

871
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,256
the true ability of the Tang Clan.

872
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,610
I believe

873
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,020
he'll change his mind.

874
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,780
Is this item

875
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,860
as powerful as you say?

876
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,820
Old White Bird,

877
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,090
just try it out and see.

878
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,690
Since your tribe are
not good at attack and defense,

879
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,820
this item

880
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,900
is just perfect for you.

881
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,860
You used to hate these things.

882
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,420
Why do you appreciate them now?

883
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,780
Because I've figured it out!

884
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,460
Weapons are inanimate.

885
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:32,720
Whether it's good or evil,
it depends on who uses them.

886
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:33,420
Old White Bird,

887
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,380
I guarantee

888
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,790
that once you've used this,
you won't be able to put it down.

889
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,050
Grandpa,

890
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,210
I want to try it.

891
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,570
Press here?

892
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,130
Xiang!

893
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,500
Ao!

894
00:37:56,752 --> 00:37:58,050
It's your personal grudges,

895
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,460
settle it yourselves.

896
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,130
Xiang,

897
00:38:02,784 --> 00:38:03,650
don't be impulsive.

898
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,420
This thing can pierce through

899
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,400
a level 40 soul master.

900
00:38:06,448 --> 00:38:07,420
It's no joke.

901
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,300
If you bully another girl again,

902
00:38:09,392 --> 00:38:10,820
I guarantee I'll shoot you through.

903
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,530
Xiang.

904
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:16,730
Grandpa,

905
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,900
this is a good thing.

906
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,300
No worries.

907
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,380
Its attack range is so wide.

908
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,210
Its maximum power
is guaranteed within 100 steps.

909
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:26,900
I want this.

910
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:27,940
How much?

911
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,420
I want 200 of them.

912
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,780
Old White Bird,

913
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,420
this thing is forged
from the iron essence.

914
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,744
Its craftsmanship is complex,

915
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,130
and the price is extremely high.

916
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,090
Considering that
you have financial issues,

917
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,530
our chief has long decided

918
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,500
to gift this
Godly Zhuge Crossbow to you.

919
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,210
But,

920
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,340
for the extra 200 units,

921
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,500
just forget about it.

922
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,900
Elder Titan is right.

923
00:38:49,712 --> 00:38:51,500
Although you refuse
to join the Tang Clan,

924
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,780
you're still my elder.

925
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:54,650
This Godly Zhuge Crossbow

926
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,340
is a meeting gift from me to you.

927
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,610
Thank you for your kindness,

928
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,832
but I can't accept it
without earning it.

929
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,050
I don't need this.

930
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,500
Elder,

931
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,090
if you join the Tang Clan,

932
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,130
I'll provide you with free
secret weapons.

933
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,980
I'll equip your whole tribe with this.

934
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,090
So, this is your plan.

935
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:30,930
Firstly, you showcase
the secret weapons,

936
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,130
then luring us with benefits.

937
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,900
I have to admit,

938
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,090
your offer

939
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,900
is incredibly tempting.

940
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,650
But, the Tribe of Agility

941
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,300
won't accept handouts.

942
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,130
We won't abandon our
principles for all these.

943
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:49,090
Elder, you misunderstand me.

944
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:50,460
Even if you don't join us,

945
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,650
I won't force you.

946
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,940
This Godly Zhuge Crossbow

947
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,432
is simply a token of my goodwill.

948
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,460
Please accept it.

949
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:58,980
By the way,

950
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,130
I have a small request.

951
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,312
I heard the Tribe of Agility
is known for its speed

952
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,650
and agility.

953
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:06,420
I've long wanted
to witness it firsthand.

954
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,690
Tang Clan would like
to have a speed contest

955
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:09,730
with the Tribe of Agility.

956
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,210
A speed contest
with the Tribe of Agility?

957
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,460
How arrogant you are!

958
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,936
Elder, you would never know
the outcome if we don't compete.

959
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,300
Maybe we can win.

960
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,530
What a joke!

961
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,210
When it comes to speed,

962
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,820
the Tribe of Agility has never lost.

963
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,460
If you insist on competing,

964
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,610
fine.

965
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,500
I'll teach you a lesson

966
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,820
so you'll know not
to be so reckless in the future.

967
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,570
Tell me

968
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,210
how you'd like to compete.

969
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,650
In 15 minutes,

970
00:40:44,704 --> 00:40:45,610
within this courtyard,

971
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,250
if you can touch

972
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,650
any part of my body,

973
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,730
you win.

974
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,460
If not,

975
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,530
I win.

976
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,500
Grandpa,

977
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,690
let me compete with him.

978
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,090
Young man,

979
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,050
you have to be careful.

980
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,860
Among the Tribe of Agility,

981
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,130
Xiang is the most promising member
of becoming a Grand Soul Master.

982
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:08,900
San, hold on.

983
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,570
Let me do this.

984
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,130
Sure.

985
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,500
I'll leave it to you then.

986
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,380
Elder,

987
00:41:21,552 --> 00:41:22,560
please come with me.

988
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,130
What a small world.

989
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,340
No,

990
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,940
perhaps we're destined.

991
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,500
Don't you remember me?

992
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,792
How dare you speak nonsense?

993
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,720
Ignite the incense.

994
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,570
Xiang is young,

995
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,900
but she is already
a four-ring Soul Ancestor.

996
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,980
Plus, she is with
the best soul ring ratio.

997
00:42:07,712 --> 00:42:08,420
Old White Bird,

998
00:42:08,784 --> 00:42:10,090
your granddaughter is awesome.

999
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,210
Xiang is the most talented disciple

1000
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,780
in the Tribe of Agility.

1001
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,300
All her soul rings

1002
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,690
are speed-type soul beasts.

1003
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,820
Having a battle of speed
against her peers,

1004
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,170
she won't lose.

1005
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:24,340
Xiang,

1006
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,020
since this is a contest,

1007
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,690
I won't go lenient for you.

1008
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,090
Keep your mouth shut!

1009
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,780
Phoenix Martial Soul!

1010
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,020
I've told you earlier,

1011
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,500
don't underestimate Fatty by his look.

1012
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,460
He's a top-tier bird martial soul,

1013
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,650
and a five-ring Soul King.

1014
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,690
White Bird,

1015
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,888
do you admit defeat now?

1016
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,780
The Phoenix is the king of birds.

1017
00:42:57,904 --> 00:42:59,440
It has a natural bloodline suppression

1018
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,980
over other bird types.

1019
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,570
Xiang,

1020
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:04,980
be careful!

1021
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,860
Even if he's a Phoenix,

1022
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,650
purely on speed,

1023
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,860
our Sharp-tailed Swallow

1024
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,820
won't necessarily lose.

1025
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:22,820
Xiang,

1026
00:43:23,056 --> 00:43:24,020
what's wrong with you?

1027
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,380
Why aren't you moving?

1028
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:26,530
Why are you so smug?

1029
00:43:26,912 --> 00:43:28,380
Phoenix Martial Soul is just nothing.

1030
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,090
I, Bai Chenxiang can defeat you!
