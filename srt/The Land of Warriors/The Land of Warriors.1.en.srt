1
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,186
=The Land of Warriors=

2
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,726
=Episode 1=

4
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,660
(In many alternate worlds,)

5
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,570
(there exists a magical fertile land)

6
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,620
(known as the Douluo Continent.)

7
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,770
(The continent has two empires,
which are Star Luo and Heaven Dou.)

8
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,690
(Many of the people here are born
with a Martial Soul.)

9
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,490
(Once their Martial Soul is awakened,)

10
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,760
(they can pursue the most honorable profession
in the Douluo Continent,)

11
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,820
(which is a soul master.)

12
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,850
(Soul masters hunt soul beasts)

13
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,100
(to obtain soul rings,)

14
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,260
(which can continuously increase
their strength.)

15
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,290
(The existence of soul masters led
to the emergence of many sects,)

16
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,380
(among which the seven most powerful)

17
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,170
(are known as the Seven Great Clans.)

18
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,800
(The Haotian Clan,
as the leader of these seven clans,)

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,707
(stands alongside
the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan)

20
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,160
(and the Seven Treasure
Glazed Tile Clan,)

21
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,660
(forming the top three clans)

22
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,980
(that lead the soul masters
across the world.)

23
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,100
(At the same time,)

24
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,940
(a special soul master organization,
the Martial Soul Hall,)

25
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,090
(is gradually expanding its influence
across the continent,)

26
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,390
(creating a power strong enough
to rival the two empires.)

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,200
(On the other hand,)

28
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,990
(in the small village
of Spirit Saint Village,)

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,010
(a young boy named Tang San)

30
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,290
(successfully awakens
the extremely rare Twin Martial Souls,)

31
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,820
(where he has the Blue Silver Grass
and the Haotian Hammer.)

32
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:37,980
(To learn more,)

33
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,880
(Tang San becomes a disciple
of Yu Xiaogang)

34
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,010
(and meets Wu,
with whom he forms a deep bond.)

35
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,130
(They later enter Shrek Academy,)

36
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,260
(where they meet Dai Mubai, Zhu Zhuqing,)

37
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,850
(Oscar,)

38
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:50,850
(Ning Rongrong,)

39
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,220
(and Ma Hongjun)

40
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,890
(to form the famous Shrek Seven Devils.)

41
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,610
(Together, they train,)

42
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,760
(become close friends,)

43
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,890
(and set out)

44
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,660
(for the Continental Advanced
Soul Master Academy Elite Tournament.)

45
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,730
(They overcome many challenges.)

46
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,730
(Ultimately,)

47
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,500
(they make it to the finals.)

48
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,850
(However,)

49
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,500
(today, they face)

50
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,410
(the Martial Soul Hall's
Golden Generation)

51
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,580
(Martial Soul Hall - Martial Soul City)
(who are far stronger than them.)

52
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,260
(This is undoubtedly
a fight to the death.)

53
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,500
Two teams are about to compete.
Who will win and who will lose?

54
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,170
The Shrek Academy
and the Martial Soul Hall Academy

55
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,990
are about to compete
to determine who is superior.

56
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,500
Each team has seven members,

57
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,220
all highly skilled
with outstanding performance.

58
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,340
But there is only one winner.

59
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,660
Today's battle will be legendary.

60
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,240
(Bi Bi Dong)

61
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,290
(Supreme Pontiff of Martial Soul Hall)
Who will ultimately win the tournament?

62
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,850
(Yu Xiaogang, Vice Dean Shrek Academy)
We'll just have to wait and see.

63
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,558
(Chenxin, Sword Douluo.)

64
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,740
(Ning Fengzhi, Head of Seven Treasure
Glazed Tile Clan; Gurong, Bone Douluo)

65
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,740
(Dugu Bo, Poison Douluo)

66
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,780
Her Holiness is watching us.

67
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,780
So we must win this tournament.

68
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,040
They use such rare soul bones
as rewards.

69
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,900
(Flander, Dean of Shrek Academy)

70
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,020
If we win this time,
it's a guaranteed profit.

71
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,610
(Liu Erlong,
Vice Dean of Shrek Academy)

72
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,580
The rarest Skull Soul Bone

73
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,580
is probably prepared
for her top disciple,

74
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,730
Hu Liena.

75
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,580
It seems the Martial Soul Hall Academy

76
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,700
is determined
to win the tournament this time.

77
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,850
Who will win is still unclear.

78
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,540
The Continental
Advanced Soul Master Academy

79
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,220
Elite Tournament's final round

80
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,410
begins now!

81
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,850
Guys, unleash your Martial Souls.

82
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,820
(Tang San, Shrek Academy)

83
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,460
(Wu, Shrek Academy)

84
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,100
(Dai Mubai, Shrek Academy)

85
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,660
(Hu Liena, Martial Soul Hall Academy)

86
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,260
(Xieyue, Martial Soul Hall Academy)

87
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,820
(Yan, Martial Soul Hall Academy)

88
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,100
(Zhu Zhuqing, Shrek Academy)

89
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,420
(Ma Hongjun, Shrek Academy)

90
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,700
(Ning Rongrong, Shrek Academy)

91
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:59,700
(Oscar, Shrek Academy)

92
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,850
The gap in soul power cannot be crossed.

93
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,660
Soul Ancestor against Soul King?

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,490
You're only courting death.

95
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,100
Master said a lion hunts a rabbit
with all its might.

96
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,190
Underestimating your opponent
is a taboo in the arena.

97
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:31,810
It's starting.

98
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,780
Watch out for Hu Liena.

99
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,730
Her soul skill

100
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,140
is based on charm

101
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,370
and is a spiritual assault.

102
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,540
It can easily cause you
to lose your senses.

103
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,980
Charm?

104
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,990
It's the same as my second soul skill.

105
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,490
Yes.

106
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,370
So except for you and San
who has strong spiritual power,

107
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,930
everyone else needs to be cautious
of Hu Liena's charm attack.

108
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,810
No matter how powerful
the charm skill is,

109
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,100
it still needs to be triggered

110
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,730
through one of the six senses,

111
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,340
like hearing, sight,

112
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,930
smell, taste, touch, or feeling.

113
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,290
Facing Hu Liena,

114
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,780
the members of the Shrek team

115
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,370
actually blocked off their six senses.

116
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,250
I have to say,

117
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,100
this is a simple
yet effective defensive move.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,540
You want to counter my soul skill, huh?

119
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,170
Second soul skill.

120
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,340
Charm.

121
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,020
Stay alert!

122
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,980
Using charm against charm.

123
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,360
The one with a stronger spiritual power
will gain the upper hand.

124
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,050
Wu isn't trying
to gain the upper hand.

125
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,400
She's trying
to interrupt Hu Liena's opening move

126
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,430
to allow the others,
who have blocked their senses,

127
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,610
to enter the fight.

128
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,100
(Xiaogang,)

129
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,050
(you were well-prepared as expected.)

130
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,180
How can a four-ring Soul Ancestor
be that powerful?

131
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,370
Xieyue, we must end this quick.

132
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,180
After Hu Liena's opening move
was interrupted,

133
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,850
she and Xieyue unleashed
their Martial Soul Fusion Skill,

134
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,650
Charm Demon.

135
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
Charm Demon specializes in controlling.

136
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,730
Within the fog's range,

137
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,980
everyone's senses are reduced,

138
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,530
soul power is suppressed,

139
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,490
and all actions are slowed down.

140
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,420
(Why didn't the Shrek Seven Devils
stop them from fusing?)

141
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,340
(Could this be a part
of Grandmaster's strategy?)

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,630
This red fog can suppress
our soul power.

143
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,700
Protect Rongrong and Ao.

144
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,700
(Purple Demon Eye.)

145
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,770
Such powerful spiritual power.

146
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,220
You can even determine
the direction of my attack.

147
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,820
Do you think this will allow you to escape
my Martial Soul Fusion Skill?

148
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,890
Big Sausage Uncle
is now open for business!

149
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,530
The Nine Treasure Boost.
Third is soul power!

150
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,250
The fourth soul skill!

151
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,420
White Tiger Meteor Shower!

152
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,700
The Flying soul skill allows

153
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,890
each team member
to gain the ability to fly.

154
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,300
No one seems to notice

155
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,650
a genius Support Branch Soul Master
in Shrek's team.

156
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,410
The Swift Flight Mushroom Sausage
was seen in the previous tournament.

157
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,690
Martial Soul Hall mistakenly thought
it was San's soul skill

158
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,850
and failed to notice Ao.

159
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,730
It's their team's fault

160
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,770
for disregarding
the Food Branch Soul Masters.

161
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,340
It's time to let them see

162
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,300
Ao's strength.

163
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,010
Hu Liena and Xieyue's
Martial Soul Fusion Skill

164
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,610
instantly raised their strength
to level 60, the rank of a Soul Emperor.

165
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,980
San is relying on his Purple Demon Eye

166
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,220
to confront them alone.

167
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,610
This is a risky move.

168
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,130
(Hu Liena and Xieyue)

169
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,330
(are the two strongest Soul Kings
of the Martial Soul Hall team.)

170
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,890
(I must go all out to stall them.)

171
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,990
(Only then Boss Dai
and the rest have a chance at winning.)

172
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,650
Rock Blossom!

173
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,610
Waist Bow!

174
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,010
Is this

175
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,820
soul bone?

176
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,420
A mere Soul Ancestor

177
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,580
actually has obtained a soul bone?

178
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,940
Phoenix Roar Air Strike!

179
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,990
Intense heat
with strong offense and defense.

180
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,060
His Flame Lord

181
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,700
has dual attributes of fire and earth.

182
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,090
Yan is tough to deal with.

183
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,800
The Nine Treasure emits colored lights!

184
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,940
The Nine Treasure Boost.

185
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,730
First is power!

186
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,850
Second is agility!

187
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,820
Third is soul power!

188
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,730
Fourth is defense!

189
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:32,820
Ao!

190
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,400
Invincible Golden Body!

191
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,820
You will be the first

192
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,420
to experience my self-made soul skill.

193
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,940
It's your honor to die from it.

194
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,980
You have not won yet.

195
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,770
Lunar Eclipse!

196
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,770
(Tomorrow's match)

197
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,570
(is not only for honor.)

198
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,140
(It is also for the participants)

199
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,800
(who were brutally killed
by the Martial Soul Hall.)

200
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,330
(If anyone falls tomorrow,)

201
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,530
(it will be for a righteous cause
and death with a purpose.)

202
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,860
Haotian Hammer!

203
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,420
San!

204
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,860
San!

205
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,490
- San!
- San!

206
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,290
San!

207
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,490
Little Devil's External Soul Bone
has broken into pieces.

208
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,180
Stop this match before he dies!

209
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,530
This is their match.

210
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,940
We have no right to stop it.

211
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,530
You're very strong.

212
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,420
In terms of talent,

213
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,970
I am not as good as you.

214
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,990
Don't waste time talking.

215
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,490
I'll do it if you're not going to.

216
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,090
Wu!

217
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,220
(Oh, no.)

218
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,290
Xieyue,

219
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,640
we'll grant them their final wish.

220
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:12,810
Wu.

221
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:35,940
San.

222
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,900
A meaningless fight.

223
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,620
Na.

224
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,010
It's poison.

225
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,810
San!

226
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,530
San.

227
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,090
San.

228
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,190
You've been keeping this from us.

229
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,490
From the beginning, you already planned
to use the External Soul Bone

230
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,630
to go head-to-head with them.

231
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,090
You brat.

232
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,770
You even tricked us.

233
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,150
If you pull this hero act
behind our backs again, I...

234
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:32,980
I will...

235
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,980
Only my External Spirit Bone

236
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,570
can block them.

237
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,530
So

238
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,660
let me step up this time.

239
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,860
Don't do this again.

240
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,690
Your soul bone won't be destroyed
for nothing.

241
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,090
We will avenge you.

242
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:19,860
That's right.

243
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,940
The tournament isn't over yet.

244
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:25,940
That's right.

245
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,010

I need

289
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,860
to remind you of one thing.

Your Holiness,
the poison has been removed.

324
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,810
Return and rest well.

325
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,350
Now that the tournament has ended,

326
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,720
it's time to get to business.

327
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,420
Bring that girl to me.

328
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,770
Your Holiness,
what is the meaning of this?

329
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,250
Chief Ning, does
the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Clan

330
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,570
intend to make an enemy
of the Martial Soul Hall?

331
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:41,420
Your Holiness.

332
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,990
Even if it's the Martial Soul Hall,

333
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,530
it's unjust
to capture people without cause.

334
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,010
But she's not human.

335
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,770
She is a soul beast

336
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,700
that has transformed into a human form.

337
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,660
You're the one
that escaped back then, right?

338
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:15,860
Yes.

339
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,860
That was me.

340
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,380
Why?

341
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,770
Do you still want to protect her?

342
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,530
Of course, I do!

343
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,090
I've always known she wasn't human.

344
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,770
It doesn't matter if you're a human

345
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,770
or a soul beast.

346
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,180
All I know is

347
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:56,980
you're my family

348
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,420
and the one I love.

349
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,980
If you want to capture her,

350
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,050
then

351
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,290
walk over my dead body first!

352
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,980
This feud is between us.

353
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,530
Do not hurt San and my friends!

354
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,290
The Seven Devils are united.

355
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,770
We face any challenges together.

356
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,140
No one can take Wu away!

357
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,250
Bi Bi Dong,

358
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,770
don't you dare harm my student!

359
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,620
Celestial Radiance. Golden Shift!

360
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,290
(That's Mom's soul ring.)

361
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,180
Mom.

362
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,860
Kill those

363
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,180
who defy me.

364
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:32,900
Wu!

365
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,420
Wu!

366
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,810

San!

San!

370
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:54,700
San!

371
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,620
Wu!

372
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,940

373
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,380
Wu!

374
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,140
San!

375
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,730
Yearning Heartbroken Red?

376
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,490
The Immortal Herb
actually chose you as its master.

377
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,330
It's a pity.

378
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,050
Since the Immortal Herb has a master,
there's no point having it.

379
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,580
Kill them.

380
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,860
San!

381
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,860
San! Wu!

382
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,900
Wu!

383
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,900

(You've taught and guided my son

(I am deeply indebted to you.)

(I, Tang Hao,
will repay you in the future.)

420
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,490
Haotian Douluo remains the same
to this day.

421
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,480
Your Holiness,

422
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,740
Tang Hao went too far.

423
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,730
He actually attacked
the Martial Soul Hall.

424
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,890
Send Ghost and me to go after him.

425
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,340
You?

426
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,420
Do you think both of you can kill him?

427
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,300
Tell all of them to leave.

428
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,650
(Tang Hao.)

429
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,690
(When I achieve my goal one day,)

430
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,250
(I will make sure not a trace
of you remains.)

431
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,300
Now that Tang San's friends

432
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,420
are out of danger,

433
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,420
I shall take my leave.

434
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,650
When he returns,

435
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:36,980
I will spar

436
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,210
with him using poison skills.

437
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,780
Poison Douluo

438
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,690
is always indifferent to others.

439
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,980
But he's deeply attached to San.

440
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,690
It was not in vain
that San saved his life back then.

441
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,380
Where are San and Wu?

442
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,900
San's father took them away.

443
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,990
Even when the seven Titled Douluo
from Martial Soul Hall attacked together,

444
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,380
they barely injured him.

445
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,940
As expected from Haotian Douluo.

446
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,260
Don't worry.

447
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,650
Wu and San are safer

448
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,490
with him.

449
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,260
San's father is very powerful.

450
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,530
I've already decided to make San's father

451
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,210
my role model from now on.

452
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,260
If Tang Hao hadn't appeared
in time today,

453
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,990
none of us would have been able
to leave the Martial Soul Hall.

454
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,980
It's not safe to stay here for long.

455
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,650
Now, the Continental Advanced
Soul Master Academy Elite Tournament

456
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,530
has ended.

457
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,010
These kids

458
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,490
have graduated too.

459
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,170
Our academy

460
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,530
has completely offended
the Martial Soul Hall.

461
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,610
They will surely come

462
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,380
to trouble Shrek in the future.

463
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,460
No need
to return to the academy.

464
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,190
We'll go separate ways from here.

465
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,530
It may be safer this way.

466
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,610
We will meet again

467
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,390
when everything settles.

468
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,380
We cannot leave.

469
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,570
At this time, we should stay together

470
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,530
and face everything that may happen.

471
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,940
Staying at the academy
is no longer the best option.

472
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,260
You have learned much

473
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,420
and must not be stuck here.

474
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,170
You must find your own path.

475
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,820
Grandmaster is right.

476
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,380
It's also time for Rongrong

477
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,090
to return
to the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Clan.

478
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,210
I sincerely thank

479
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,420
all the teachers
for your guidance of my daughter.

480
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,380
If the Martial Soul Hall troubles Shrek
in the future,

481
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,210
the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Clan

482
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,340
will definitely not stand by
and do nothing.

483
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,690
Thank you, Chief Ning.

484
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:31,420
Rongrong,

485
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,820
bid farewell to your teachers.

486
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:02,210
Ao?

487
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,770
What's the matter?

488
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:04,820
Chief Ning,

489
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,820
I have a request.

490
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,420
All of you are Rongrong's friends.

491
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,420
Feel free to tell me
whatever is on your mind.

492
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,690
I wish to join
the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Clan.

493
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,820
I hope you will allow me.

494
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,340
Of course, you can.

495
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,420
A Support Branch Soul Master
as talented as you

496
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,490
is exactly what
the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Clan needs.

497
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,170
Thank you, Chief.

498
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,570
Ao.

499
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,370
The Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Clan

500
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:50,740
welcomes you.

501
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,290
Anyone here who wants to join
the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Clan

502
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,260
is most welcome.

503
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,770
Thank you for your kind offer,
Chief Ning.

504
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,170
Zhuqing and I
are from the Star Luo Empire

505
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,860
and still have duties to fulfill.

506
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:09,990
I hope you can understand.

507
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,650
We have been away for many years.

508
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,950
It's time to return home.

509
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,990
Thank you for your recognition,
Chief Ning.

510
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:17,870
What about you?

511
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:18,980
Me?

512
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,790
I'll pass on the offer.

513
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,460
I grew up in the academy.

514
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,660
Now that I've graduated,

515
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,710
my greatest wish

516
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,620
is to return to the academy

517
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,750
and help the teachers train
the juniors.

518
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,980
Good lad!

519
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,950
You usually seem so self-centered.

520
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:33,990
Yet, you have such intention.

521
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,260
Seeing how you want
to be a teaching assistant for free

522
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,540
shows I didn't teach you in vain.

523
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,460
Free?

524
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,710
Actually, I have another dream.

525
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,500
I want to travel across
the entire continent.

526
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,950
But after today,

527
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,280
it's unlikely we'll meet again.

528
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,980
But during my travels,

529
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,640
I can visit Rongrong and Ao
at the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Clan.

530
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,830
I can also visit Boss Dai and Zhuqing
in the Star Luo Empire.

531
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,830
Who knows

532
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,120
I might even run into San and Wu
along the way, right?

533
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:09,830
Each of you

534
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:10,580
has your own path.

535
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,310
I

536
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,310
can't force anything.

537
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,220
But please remember that the doors
of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Clan

538
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,980
will always be open to you.

539
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,460
Farewell,

540
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:19,870
everyone.

541
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,140
Wait.

542
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,100
Ms. Erlong.

543
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,140
Don't cry.

544
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,500
Our Little Devils at Shrek

545
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,230
should face the outside world
with increasing courage.

546
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,350
If you can win, then fight.

547
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,180
If you can't win,
keep fighting while running.

548
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,350
If anyone dares to bully you,

549
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,500
I, Liu Erlong,

550
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,060
will break their bones myself.

551
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,940
Growing up while being apart
for some time

552
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,270
is good for your future.

553
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:02,980
But don't forget

554
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,950
that Shrek Academy

555
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,060
will always be your home.

556
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,750
How about we set a date?

557
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,990
Today is the beginning of summer.

558
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,710
Five years from now,

559
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,950
we'll reunite at Shrek Academy.

560
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,240
No one is allowed to miss it.

561
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,460
I hope San and Wu

562
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,540
will return by then.
