=The Land of Warriors=

18
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

19
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,140
=Episode 30=

20
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,450
This is the auction hall.

21
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,420
Everyone, please come this way.

22
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,890
Why are they everywhere?

23
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,820
Well, perfect.

24
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,450
I'll make sure
they walk away empty-handed today.

25
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,610
Even we,

26
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,170
don't have any special privileges

27
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,210
at the Blacksmiths Guild auction.

28
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,610
We can only reserve a good spot to sit.

29
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,890
(All the seats are filled up.)

30
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,380
(The items being auctioned today
must be quite valuable.)

31
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,820
(and the competition is likely going
to be intense too.)

32
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,650
Looks like our rivals

33
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,050
are already here.

34
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,380
Ugh, not these guys again.

35
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,260
We need to spend as little as possible

36
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,700
to get what we want.

37
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,890
(How is it that I can't even do
something so simple?)

38
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,100
(San, you need to step up my training.)

39
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,860
What's this?

40
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,020
Why does it have images of San?

41
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,610
Is it some kind of brain-training game?

42
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,420
That's right.

43
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,610
This is an escape game

44
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,210
I made for Wu.

45
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,980
Let me explain.

46
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,610
By using high heat

47
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,100
to fuse these parts together,

48
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,610
then we can save a lot of space.

49
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,300
That won't work.

50
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,610
If we can't disassemble it

51
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,210
when something malfunctions inside,

52
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,930
the entire thing will be useless.

53
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,540
Take a closer look at this blueprint.

54
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,890
This seems
to use a new assembly technique.

55
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,980
It saves space
and allows for easy disassembly.

56
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,490
Finally, you got it right.

57
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,380
What did I tell you?

58
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,450
Even Chief says I'm right.
So I'm right about this.

59
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,380
Chief,

60
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,890
what is this new hidden weapon
you've been working on?

61
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,890
This isn't a new hidden weapon.

62
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,100
It's just something I made for Wu.

63
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,610
This thing looks fun.

64
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,610
It doesn't sound that hard too.

65
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,580
Let's start playing with it.

66
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,380
Let me make this clear.

67
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,610
Without jumping over the pieces,

68
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,820
you must move me to the exit

69
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,380
in the fewest possible steps.
Only then will you win.

70
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,540
Don't worry.

71
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,500
I'll make sure you pass the challenge.

72
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,530
As for the one outside, stay sharp.

73
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,450
With a history of forging
for thousands of years,

74
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,580
where you'll find
the finest treasures and rare metals.

75
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,330
Welcome
to the Blacksmiths Guild auction.

76
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,410
(Si Di, Lou Gao's Disciple)
I'm Si Di,

77
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,140
a disciple of Lou Gao,
the God of Ironsmith.

78
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,410
The auction will begin shortly!

79
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,970
- Marvelous!
- Splendid!

80
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,380
All items in the auction hall come

81
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,740
from various prominent families
across the continent

82
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,020
or private collections.

83
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,770
After being authenticated
by the Blacksmiths Guild

84
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,450
to ensure their authenticity,

85
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,700
they are entrusted
to the guild for auction.

86
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,850
The highest bidder wins.

87
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,290
During the bidding,

88
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,450
please raise the bidding paddle
next to your seat

89
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,450
and call out your offer.

90
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,890
After three rounds of bidding,
the price will be final

91
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,740
and non-negotiable.

92
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,620
So let the auction begin!

93
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,060
First up, we have
a special piece of metal.

94
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,090
It has a purity of over ninety percent

95
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,620
and weighs 231 kilograms.

96
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,500
It's such a small piece.

97
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,770
That's a good stuff.

98
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,970
This is the first time

99
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,530
I've seen such
a large piece of Black Iron.

100
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,140
This piece
is of exceptionally high quality

101
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,700
and can't be calculated
by unit price alone.

102
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,650
This is Black Iron.

103
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,770
Even a small amount added

104
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,090
to ordinary steel

105
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,020
will cause a dramatic transformation,

106
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,970
making it suitable
for crafting exquisite ironwork.

107
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,820
The bidding price starts

108
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,700
at twenty thousand gold soul coins.

109
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,770
The minimum bid increment
is 100 gold soul coins.

110
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,290
You can start placing your bids.

111
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,330
(Bidder No. 132)
I bid 20,100 gold soul coins.

112
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,530
Twenty thousand six hundred
gold soul coins.

113
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,290
Let the price keep rising.

114
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,450
Is there anyone with a higher offer?

115
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,890
(Bidder No. 164)
Twenty-four thousand.

116
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,210
(Bidder No. 132)
Twenty-five thousand.

117
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,410
(Bidder No. 164)
Twenty-five thousand five hundred.

118
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,020
Lady Bidder No. 164 bids

119
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,140
twenty-five thousand five hundred
gold soul coins.

120
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,090
San.

121
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,890
(Bidder No. 35)
Thirty thousand.

122
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,700
Thirty thousand?

123
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,530
Bidder No. 35 bids
thirty thousand gold soul coins!

124
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,020
Thirty thousand gold soul coins,
going once!

125
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,060
Thirty thousand gold soul coins,
going twice!

126
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,140
Thirty thousand gold soul coins...

127
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,740
Forty thousand.

128
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,210
Forty thousand!

129
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,020
Forty thousand?

130
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,330
That's quite high.

131
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,580
(Bidder No. 01)
Sir,

132
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,260
is it really worth spending this much?

133
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,450
I've got a bad taste in my mouth.

134
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,020
I need to make this purchase
to feel better.

135
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,700
Forty-five thousand.

136
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,500
(Bidder No. 35)
Fifty thousand!

137
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,530
Fifty thousand?

138
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,940
It's up to 50 thousand!

139
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Fifty thousand gold soul coins,
going once.

140
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,060
Fifty thousand gold soul coins,
going twice.

141
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,890
Fifty thousand gold soul coins,
going thrice!

142
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,970
Sold!

143
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,500
Not much competition.

144
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,650
Next, we have the second item
for auction.

145
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,940
A piece of refined gold,
weighing 50 kilograms,

146
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,890
which is also a rare item.

147
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,650
Please, take a look!

148
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,940
This one is truly beautiful.

149
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,090
It's refined gold.

150
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,450
The starting bid is ten thousand
gold soul coins.

151
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,970
You may start bidding.

152
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,740
(Bidder No. 35)
Thirty thousand.

153
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,620
Forty thousand.

154
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,700
Forty-five thousand.

155
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,530
Fifty thousand.

156
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,260
Fifty thousand gold soul coins,
going once.

157
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,890
Though refined gold is expensive,

158
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,620
fifty thousand

159
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,380
is already above its actual value.

160
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,850
Rongrong, keep bidding.

161
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,620
But San...

162
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,500
Don't worry.

163
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,820
Fifty thousand gold soul coins,
going twice.

164
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,380
We absolutely must obtain

165
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,700
this piece of refined gold today.

166
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,700
(Bidder No. 35)
Fifty-five thousand!

167
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,530
I've been waiting for you to say that.

168
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,090
Sixty thousand.

169
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,740
Sixty thousand!

170
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,740
The bids are getting higher.

171
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,090
Such extravagant spending.

172
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,890
Looks like there will be
no bargains today.

173
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,890
You were expecting bargains?

174
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,090
At this rate,
we won't even get to bid anything.

175
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,820
Sir,

176
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,140
there must be some grand purpose

177
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,260
for you to spend so much
on this refined gold, right?

178
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,170
How did you become an officer?

179
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,020
Don't ask so many questions.

180
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,930
Keep an eye on them.

181
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,980
I said I'd make sure
they walked away empty-handed.

182
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,260
The only reason
to buy these worthless items

183
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,860
is to make sure they can't get them.

184
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,860
He's deliberately causing trouble.

185
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,050
He's so hateful.

186
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,100
We made him leave
in front of everyone earlier

187
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,980
and made him cautious to strike back
because of the Elder Token we have.

188
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,410
Now that he has found an opportunity,

189
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,290
he naturally won't let us get
what we want.

190
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,260
Rongrong,

191
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,380
we can stop now.

192
00:08:59,170 --> 00:08:59,810
Let him have it.

193
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,650
(San,)

194
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,340
(you didn't bid when the Black Iron
was being auctioned,)

195
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,620
(were you trying to let Myles get cocky)

196
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,690
(and then intentionally drive
the price up)

197
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,140
(so he'd overpay for the ore?)

198
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,890
If he likes to eat,

199
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,050
he shouldn't worry about bloating.

200
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,500
San,

201
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,410
were you...

202
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,650
Our goal here for today

203
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,290
isn't to win rare items.

204
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,380
It's to make Myles pay
the highest price possible

205
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,380
for them.

206
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,530
(Bidder No. 1)
Bid higher and beat his offer.

207
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,660
(Bidder No. 35)

208
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,020
Sold!

209
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:56,980
(Bidder No. 35)

210
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,780
(Bidder No. 01)

211
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,300
(Bidder No. 01)

212
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,380
(Bidder No. 35)

213
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,060
(Bidder No. 01)

214
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:06,940
(Bidder No. 01)

215
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,220
(Bidder No. 01)

216
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,140
The next item up for auction

217
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,220
is the last one of the day.

218
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,020
Actually, these are two separate pieces.

219
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,260
The maker of both is none other
than my master,

220
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,380
the President of the Blacksmiths Guild,
Lou Gao, the God of Ironsmith.

221
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,020
Lou Gao, the God of Ironsmith,

222
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,810
hasn't produced many works
in recent years.

223
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,170
That's right.

224
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,690
Even when he does create something,

225
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,260
it won't be sold at the auction.

226
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,050
Today is a real treat.

227
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,380
We're seeing two of them at once.

228
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,140
My master named it

229
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,810
the Peerless Flexible Armor.

230
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,410
Its toughness

231
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,810
can withstand a full-force strike

232
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,860
from a soul master below level sixty.

233
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,810
So, does that mean
our defense will be off the charts

234
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,650
if we wear this divine armor?

235
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,500
You are right!

236
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,380
With this armor,

237
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,170
it is similar to having two lives.

238
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,980
This legendary treasure

239
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,410
is made by fusing eight different metals

240
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,050
in a special proportion.

241
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,770
It has exceptional flexibility.

242
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,100
Two pieces of Peerless Flexible Armor
are being auctioned together.

243
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,260
The starting bid
is two hundred thousand gold soul coins.

244
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,620
Two hundred thousand!

245
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,340
Ladies and gentlemen,
feel free to start your bidding now.

246
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,620
There's one amazing part

247
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,340
about the Peerless Flexible Armor.

248
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,980
Although it's made from metal,

249
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,890
it's incredibly elastic.

250
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,980
Even after a beast soul master

251
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,050
activates their martial soul

252
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,410
and doubles in size,

253
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,020
the armor can expand with them

254
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,980
and maintain the same defensive effect.

255
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,890
As expected of Senior Lou Gao's work.

256
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,220
This is probably
a piece of defensive armor

257
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,170
I could never create in my entire life.

258
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,380
Memory-expanding metals.

259
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,140
Flexible metal

260
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,340
is truly a miracle.

261
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,410
This isn't just a magical weapon to me.

262
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,980
I'll keep one for my protection,

263
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,980
and the other will be a gift
for Her Holiness.

264
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,890
That way,
I can leave this ordinary city.

265
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:05,930
You, there.

266
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,930
I'll take both.

267
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,740
I'll offer two hundred and ten thousand.

268
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,380
Two hundred and ten thousand
gold soul coins!

269
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,460
(Since he really wants them,)

270
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,100
(let's have a bit of fun with him.)

271
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,380
(Bidder No. 35)
I bid 210,100 gold soul coins.

272
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,980
Adding just a hundred?

273
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,220
Everyone,

274
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,380
you have common sense.

275
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,980
This is clearly just trying

276
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,810
to cause trouble.

277
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,260
The highest bidder wins the item.

278
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,980
If you need it, I need it too.

279
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,460
If not,

280
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,050
we'll see who bids higher.

281
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,570
What's wrong? Out of money?

282
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,570
210,100 gold soul coins, going once!

283
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,690
Wait!

284
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,410
Your point is valid.

285
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,340
We must be reasonable.

286
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,930
I'll bid three hundred thousand.

287
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,140
Three hundred thousand?

288
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,460
It's an auction, right?

289
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,020
The highest bidder wins, right?

290
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:16,980
Sir,

291
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,410
we've been spending
a lot on the armor lately,

292
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,890
and our budget is...

293
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,810
It has already come to this point.

294
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,100
If you were him

295
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,690
and Martial Soul Hall offered you
that much money,

296
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,460
would you even live to take it?

297
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,050
Is there anyone else willing to bid?

298
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,220
Three hundred thousand gold soul coins,
going once.

299
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,620
Three hundred thousand gold soul coins,
going twice.

300
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,570
Three hundred thousand gold soul coins,
going going trice.

301
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,570
Sold!

302
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,340
These are the items you just won.

303
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,100
Please inspect them
and settle the payment.

304
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,890
No need to inspect.

305
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,810
In business,

306
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,620
integrity is key.

307
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,260
I'll send them to bring the money
to you later.

308
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,770
Carry these away.

309
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,460
The rule of the auction house

310
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,690
is cash on delivery.

311
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,690
Come here.

312
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,340
When you do business,

313
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,140
you have to think big

314
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,340
and be more flexible.

315
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,500
Do you honestly think

316
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,340
Martial Soul Hall has ever failed
to keep its word?

317
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,530
Take them away.

318
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,380
Are you all right?

319
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,340
Oh, Elder.

320
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,260
I thought all items were sold out.

321
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,930
Why are you still walking around here?

322
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,740
It seems some people don't care

323
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,530
about Blacksmiths Guild's

324
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,410
cash-on-delivery rule.

325
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,380
Elder, did you hear

326
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,620
what your friend is saying?

327
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,500
Today in the market,

328
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,410
your friend took so many of my goods.

329
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,460
Now that we're at the auction,
it's every man for himself.

330
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,410
How can you be so greedy?

331
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,890
This is a bit too much, don't you think?

332
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,930
The Martial Soul Hall
truly came prepared with money.

333
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,570
But who would have thought,

334
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,380
the things you wanted
to buy were just too many.

335
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,460
I can hardly keep up with all of them.

336
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:09,930
How about this?

337
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,740
The Blacksmiths Guild is always welcome

338
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,340
to come to Martial Soul Hall
to collect the payment.

339
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,530
Just bring the bill.

340
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,050
Carry these away.

341
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,620
Let me make this clear.

342
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,650
These are already
Martial Soul Hall's property.

343
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,620
Since they belong to us,
we must take them with us.

344
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,290
Now, that's the rule.

345
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,650
You...

346
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,500
We're still at the auction hall.

347
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,050
Don't cause any trouble.

348
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,290
Despicable!

349
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,020
Everything for tonight is all set.

350
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,100
He's too much!

351
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,290
Master,

352
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,340
Myles and his men left
with the auctioned items,

353
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,170
saying we should collect the money
at Martial Soul Hall.

354
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,650
Martial Soul Hall?

355
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,260
What nerve they have.

356
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,930
Do they think they can just take
whatever they want?

357
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,410
Myles has always been arrogant,

358
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,980
using Martial Soul Hall as his backing.

359
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,620
But don't worry.

360
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,170
We won't let them steal

361
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,170
your treasure.

362
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,100
I'll go and get them back right now!

363
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,740
Tai Tan,

364
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,890
don't be reckless.

365
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,100
I know you are strong.

366
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,460
You may protect us this once.

367
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,890
But can you protect

368
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,460
the Blacksmiths Guild forever?

369
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,770
Even if you stay,

370
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,860
the gap between us and Martial Soul Hall

371
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,930
is insurmountable.

372
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,260
Senior Lou Gao,

373
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,410
please leave this matter to me.

374
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,570
What do you mean by that?

375
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,410
Since you've chosen
to join the Tang Clan,

376
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,980
then consider this

377
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,260
a welcome gift
from the Tang Clan to you.

378
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,770
Sir,

379
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,570
do you think we'll be in trouble

380
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,900
for offending that elder?

381
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,980
Are you sure he's even an elder?

382
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,420
Why do you think I am not afraid?

383
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,330
Don't worry.

384
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,370
I've sent a letter
to confirm his identity.

385
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:12,610
Besides,

386
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,700
even if he is an elder,

387
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,050
everything we bid at the auction

388
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,610
was intended as tributes
for Her Holiness.

389
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,660
What could he do about it?

390
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,370
Sir, you're indeed wise.

391
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,500
Stop flattering me.

392
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,370
Now, tell me.

393
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,130
How are the weapons
and armor coming along?

394
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,420
Sir, don't worry.

395
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,370
I've captured several more blacksmiths

396
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,020
to work day and night.

397
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,610
We finished the order five days
ahead of schedule,

398
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,420
with no compromise on quality.

399
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,260
Please take a look.

400
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,700
Who's there?

401
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,370
Protect me.

402
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,420
A hundred-thousand-year soul ring?

403
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,900
So what
if it's a 100 thousand soul ring?

404
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,770
You lot sure

405
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,900
are cowards!

406
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,850
Martial Soul Hall, heed my orders!

407
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,020
Take them down!

408
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,850
Where did you get that courage

409
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,810
to come here and kill?

410
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,740
We are precisely targeting

411
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,530
the Martial Soul Hall.

412
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,700
Are you going against Martial Soul Hall

413
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,420
because you are tired of living?

414
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,610
Bi Bi Dong actually appointed
a fool like you

415
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,220
to oversee Gengxin City's
Martial Soul Hall.

416
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,610
Since we are already here,

417
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,850
why would we even hesitate?

418
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,530
You're truly overestimating yourselves.

419
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,900
Hurry home now.

420
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,570
Myles is dead.

421
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,500
No one can oppress you anymore.

422
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,020
Myles is dead?

423
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,660
Really?

424
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,850
Myles is dead!

425
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,090
We are free!

426
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,420
Come on!

427
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,050
Let's go!

428
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,850
We're free!

429
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,500
I want to go home!

430
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,770
We're free!

431
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,260
San,

432
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,660
the blacksmiths have all left.

433
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,050
Where are the things?

434
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,770
They're all here.

435
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,300
♪The power hidden
within the food branch♪

436
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,020
♪Protecting the battlefield of youth♪

437
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,090
Beneath your feet lie the bones

438
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,500
of the blacksmiths who lost their lives.

439
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,700
What goes around comes around.

440
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,260
Justice will always prevail.

441
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,780
♪Some things can only
be understood through action♪

442
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,780

♪Together, we push forward

♪Fighting with mutual support

445
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,530
What is taking them so long?

446
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Calm down.

447
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,980
San and the others will be fine.

448
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,940
I still think they're too reckless.

449
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,530
That's the Martial Soul Hall
we're talking about.

450
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,330
I don't want Chief to be dead

451
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,370
right after I joined the Tang Clan.

452
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,220
Lou Gao,

453
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,530
stop talking nonsense!

454
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,220
I'm just concerned.

455
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,050
This won't do.

456
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:54,500
Si Long,

457
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,130
come here.

458
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,370
Yes, Master?

459
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,420
Gather a few of the disciples

460
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,330
and lead all the young men

461
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,220
of the Blacksmiths Guild

462
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,940
to Martial Soul Hall with me!

463
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,420
Right away!

464
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,220
Everyone, get ready.

465
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,770
We need to leave here
as soon as possible.

466
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,740
What about Myles

467
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,180
and the blacksmiths who were with him?

468
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,460
The blacksmiths have all been rescued.

469
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,460
As for Myles and Gengxin City's
Martial Soul Hall,

470
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,220
they're gone for good.

471
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,180
We may have erased all evidence.

472
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,260
But if Martial Soul Hall investigates
this matter,

473
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,180
they'll definitely come after
the Blacksmiths Guild.

474
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,980
That's why the Tang Clan has decided
to craft a batch of hidden weapons

475
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,570
for the Blacksmiths Guild
to defend themselves.

476
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,180
If Martial Soul Hall ever causes trouble

477
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,460
for the guild in the future,

478
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,740
send word to us.

479
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,460
The Tang Clan won't stand by
and do nothing.

480
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,020
Many thanks, Chief.

481
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,130
Many thanks, Chief Tang.

482
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,290
This is what we recovered
from Martial Soul Hall's storage.

483
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,180
Inside is the fortune

484
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,370
Myles amassed over the years

485
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,460
by exploiting the people.

486
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,020
I'm leaving this to you.

487
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:50,850
No,

488
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:51,850
I can't.

489
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:52,980
I can't accept this.

490
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,850
We can't give it to you
even if you want it.

491
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,370
It's for safekeeping.

492
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,500
In the future, the Blacksmiths Guild
will return it to the people.

493
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,460
Your righteousness is admirable.

494
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,460
We need to head back to Tiandou quickly

495
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,500
to prepare for Bi Bi Dong's next move.

496
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,020
Elder Lou,

497
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,180
it's time to leave.

498
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,180
Let's go.

499
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,130
Master.

500
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,090
Si Long,

501
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,370
the future of the Blacksmiths Guild
is in your hands now.

502
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,460
You're my most capable disciple.

503
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,610
I trust

504
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,420
you'll take care of the blacksmiths
in Gengxin City

505
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,530
and restore the guild
to its former glory.

506
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,530
Rebuild the Blacksmiths Guild!

507
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,460
Restore its honor!

508
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,770
I won't let you down.

509
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,220
One more thing.

510
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,050
Senior Si Long,

511
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,810
it's about the child we rescued.

512
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,290
His father was persecuted
by Martial Soul Hall,

513
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,050
and now he's an orphan.

514
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,220
Since you're in charge now,

515
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,330
so he's your responsibility now.

516
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:57,700
Chief.

517
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,610
Xiang.

518
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,500
Chief,

519
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,090
the carriage is ready.

520
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:04,850
But the boy

521
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,020
we saved

522
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,610
is still recovering at the inn.

523
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,500
Could you ask Senior Si Long
to look after him?

524
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,500
Xiang,

525
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,050
we're certainly on the same page today.

526
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:17,700
Don't worry.

527
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,260
I'll take him in as my disciple

528
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,420
and ensure he grows up well.

529
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:23,980
Let's move out.

530
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,810
Let's go, Wu.

531
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:31,940
What's the matter?

532
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:39,900
Wu!

533
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,900
It seems
my killing intent frightened Wu.

534
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,020
(Main Hall of the Martial Soul Hall,
Gengxin City)

535
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,220
Master,

536
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,220
Master, I want to be as strong as them

537
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,220
when I grow up.

538
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,290
Good.

539
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,740
When you're older, join the Tang Clan

540
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,980
and fight for justice alongside them.

541
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,610
Wu.

542
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,220
Wu.

543
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,370
Why is she still unconscious?

544
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,940
(Tell her to stop trying.)

545
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,220
(It won't help.)

546
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:12,980
Wu!

547
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,980
What's going on?

548
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:17,850
Don't touch it?

549
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,660
In the Spiritual Sea,

550
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,940
both of us are formed
from consciousness.

551
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,020
They're trying to control you.

552
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,330
You can't touch them anymore.

553
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,330
After studying at the Moon Pavilion,

554
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,700
I've learned
to control my killing intent.

555
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,740
How did it end up like this?

556
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,020
Ever since my sacrifice,

557
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,220
resentment has been brewing in you.

558
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,220
Unconsciously, your killing intent

559
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,460
is released during battles.

560
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,220
I didn't warn you

561
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,020
because

562
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,810
it wasn't having any real effect on you.

563
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,180
But in Gengxin City's Martial Soul Hall,

564
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,020
I could feel

565
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,370
it's trying to break free from your will

566
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,700
trying to turn
against your consciousness.

567
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,700
My original form

568
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,420
was struck unconscious
by your killing intent.

569
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,610
Now, the Spiritual Sea
has turned into this.

570
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,700
Are you all right?

571
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,130
I'm fine.

572
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,050
San,

573
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,130
your Spiritual Sea
is where my consciousness resides.

574
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
You must control it,

575
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,500
or we'll both be consumed.

576
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,330
Don't let the killing intent
dominate you.

577
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,740
How did you control it
back at Moon Pavilion?

578
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:13,900
By playing the qin.

579
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,330
When I play the qin,

580
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,290
I think of happy things.

581
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,570
Play the qin?

582
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,180
You know how to play the qin?

583
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,700
I remember now.

584
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,900
When I was going through
the soul ring conversion

585
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,180
and trapped in the nightmare,

586
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,260
I faintly heard the sound of a qin.

587
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,260
I didn't expect it to be you.

588
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:32,740
Then play the qin.

589
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,180
All right.

590
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,570
From now on, you can call me Wu.

591
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,420
Come catch me!

592
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,050
This song is exactly like the one
in my memory.

593
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,770
San,

594
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,940
I told you to think of happy things.

595
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,610
Why are you always thinking about me?

596
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,610
The happiest memories I have

597
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,570
all involve you.

598
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,180
Wu,

599
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,130
don't worry.

600
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,660
I'll let go of my resentment

601
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,900
and hold my killing intent in check.

602
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,570
I won't let it control me,

603
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,050
and I won't let it harm you.

604
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,660
You can keep
your killing intent to yourself.

605
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,980
What I really want
is to hear you play the qin.

606
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,570
You must play for me more often
from now on.

607
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,810
Most importantly,

608
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,370
practice new pieces.

609
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,940
You're finally up.

610
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,740
Wu.

611
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,220
Wu.

612
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,180
Wu,

613
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,090
are you all right?

614
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,130
She has been asleep the whole way
so she must be hungry now.

615
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,130
Wu, you're awake.

616
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:57,900
Come on.

617
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,370
Xiang made some clay pot congee.

618
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,260
Let's all eat together.

619
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,020
Thank you,

620
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,420
Xiang.

621
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,130
You're welcome.

622
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,050
Are the elders still resting?

623
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,370
I've brought them their congee.

624
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,570
But they're so focused on the blueprints
that they don't eat or sleep.

625
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,090
They even said
they'd come to find you to talk.

626
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,570
I held them back for now
since Wu hadn't woken up yet.

627
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,180
How's Wu?

628
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,370
She's all right now.

629
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,020
Everyone's tired from the journey.

630
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,020
Once everyone's rested,

631
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:22,940
we'll set off again.

632
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,610
Rongrong,

633
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,770
you've kept those two magical weapons
from yesterday, right?

634
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,610
Take them out

635
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,290
and let us admire

636
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,290
just how strong their defense really is.

637
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,050
That's right.

638
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,220
We've been so rushing on the road,

639
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,180
and we haven't had time
to take a good look at them.

640
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,570
Now is a good time
to show everyone what they can do.

641
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:41,610
All right.

642
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,220
It's hard to imagine

643
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,570
how Senior Lou Gao made this.

644
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,770
It looks so soft

645
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,020
and light.

646
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,290
Is it really that powerful?

647
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:05,660
San,

648
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,850
should I try using
my Phoenix Flame on it?

649
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,900
It's so precious.

650
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,130
What if you ruined it?

651
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,980
Then I won't do it.

652
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,570
Don't worry.

653
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,570
Pure gold fears no fire.

654
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,260
Fatty,

655
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,260
just try it out.

656
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,370
Got it.

657
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:37,940
I only felt some warmth

658
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,090
even through the armor.

659
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,610
It seems
it has excellent fire resistance.

660
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,090
As mentioned at the auction,

661
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,850
it can withstand attacks
from soul masters

662
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,900
below level 60.

663
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,610
That should also include
any form of direct impact.

664
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,810
This truly is a rare treasure.

665
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:53,940
Rongrong.

666
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:54,810
Ao.

667
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,330
You two are the ones

668
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,940
who need this the most
out of the Seven Devils.

669
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,850
One for each of you.

670
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,090
It's perfect.

671
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,090
I don't want it.

672
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,570
I want Wu to have it.

673
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,500
Now, she's the most vulnerable among us

674
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,020
and needs the most protection.

675
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:20,770
(No,)

676
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,570
(I don't want it.)

677
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,530
(I can't join any battles
in my current state.)

678
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,770
(Rongrong needs it more than I do.)

679
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,290
Rongrong,

680
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,260
Wu can have that one.

681
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,980
You can have this one.

682
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,500
You'd better protect me well
when you wear it.

683
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:33,740
Ao.

684
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,330
I'll be fine.

685
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,090
If Rongrong has one, then I have one.

686
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,500
Besides, Senior Lou Gao

687
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,940
is now an elder of our Tang Clan.

688
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,460
I can shamelessly ask him

689
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,610
for another one next time.

690
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,130
I'll get one for you too.

691
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,770
(Storm Pear Blossom Needles)

692
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,570
Don't touch it.

693
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:03,780
(Map of Tiandou City)

694
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,660
(Shrek Academy)

695
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,650
Gengxin City's Martial Soul Hall
has been destroyed.

696
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:14,730
What did you say?

697
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,820
Gengxin City's Martial Soul Hall
has been reduced to ashes.

698
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,980
Myles and all the officers are dead,

699
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,090
every one of them.

700
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,170
Who did it?

701
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,380
We don't know yet.

702
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,900
But Myles had sent a letter saying

703
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,530
that someone with an Elder Token
had appeared in Gengxin City.

704
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,690
But we never sent any elders.

705
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,900
Who could this person be?

706
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,650
Elder Token?

707
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,500
Yu Xiaogang?

708
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,250
No, it's not him.

709
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,780
Lately, we have sent people

710
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,090
to monitor Yu Xiaogang closely.

711
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,020
He never left the city.

712
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,650
Could it be

713
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:46,860
Tang San?

714
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,170
We can't tolerate this any longer.

715
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,940
Tang San must die!

716
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,530
Send people to investigate

717
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,650
who is impersonating the elder.

718
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,050
We will avenge them,

719
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,250
just not right now.

720
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,780
At a time like this,

721
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,730
you're still letting emotions cloud
your judgment!

722
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,500
Shut up.

723
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,530
There's no pardon for whoever did this.

724
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,130
Before Her Holiness entered seclusion,
she entrusted the Martial Soul Hall to me.

725
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,170
I am the commander

726
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,090
of the Tiandou soul master legion.

727
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,940
Between leading the troops to fight
the enemy and killing one soul master,

728
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,570
tell me which is more important.

729
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,250
Xieyue,

730
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,780
send a team to investigate.

731
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,420
The rest of you, stay in formation
and continue preparing for battle.

732
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:24,980
Yes.

733
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:35,820
Tang San,

734
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,730
do you have to do this?

735
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,050
Chief,

736
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,610
we may have the core of Deep Sea Silver.

737
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,090
But Tai Tan and I

738
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,380
still can't forge
the Storm Pear Blossom Needles.

739
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,130
That's right.

740
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:48,980
Yes, I know.

741
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,460
With our current abilities,

742
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,570
it's truly difficult to forge

743
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,650
the core of Deep Sea Silver.

744
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,780
I told you, didn't I?

745
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,940
He has already thought of it.

746
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,340
Indeed,

747
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,050
such a hard material

748
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,020
can only be forged by a God of Ironsmith

749
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,820
at the level of Grand Haotian Master.

750
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,020
If he were to collaborate with me,

751
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,860
the chance of success
would be over ninety percent.

752
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,530
It's a shame, though.

753
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,500
Master removed his soul bones

754
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,570
to fulfill the sect's obligations.

755
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:18,020
I admire such boldness

756
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,090
but it's also truly regrettable.

757
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,420
I can only blame myself
for only focusing on forging back then

758
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,130
and neglecting to improve my soul power.

759
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,820
Now, I find myself powerless
despite having grand ambitions.

760
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,460
I joined the Tang Clan

761
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,820
to forge a true magical weapon.

762
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,900
If I can't reach the level

763
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,380
of Grand Soul Master in my lifetime,

764
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,050
then I am truly not destined
to build this magical weapon.

765
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,420
Elder Lou,

766
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,250
do you mean so long they are
at the Grand Soul Master level,

767
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,460
they can forge the Deep Sea Silver core?

768
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,730
Your father, with the Haotian Hammer,

769
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,570
could refine and forge this iron

770
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,380
to its highest potential.

771
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,210
As for whether other Grand Soul Masters

772
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,020
can do the same,

773
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,340
I can't say for sure.

774
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,340
But in general,

775
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,900
it'd give us a better chance of success
than if I do it alone.

776
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,500
I already have someone in mind.

777
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,460
Once the sect matters are taken care of,

778
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,650
I'll take Elder Lou to meet him.

779
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,170
We will definitely be able
to forge the Storm Pear Blossom Needles.

780
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,900
(Tang Clan)

781
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,250
Rongrong. Xiang.

782
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,340
Protect Wu.

783
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:52,940
All right.

784
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,340
Who's there?

785
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,650
Show yourself and speak!

786
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:24,730
Tang San,

787
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,900
I've been waiting for you
for a long time.

788
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,340
You're behind the Gengxin City's
Martial Soul Hall incident, right?

789
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,940
What happened
to Gengxin City's Martial Soul Hall?

790
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:35,650
I'm curious too.

791
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,690
Could it be a retribution
for their evil deeds?

792
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,460
You're asking for death.

793
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,250
What's the matter?

794
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,210
I just learned

795
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,210
that Yan secretly took a group of people

796
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,340
and left the military camp.

797
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:55,940
What?

798
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:11,820
Tang San.

799
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,050
Although I can't kill you,

800
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,860
one day

801
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,610
the Martial Soul Hall
will tear you to pieces!

802
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:31,730
San.

803
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:32,460
San.

804
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:34,860
Get up.

805
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:35,570
Na?

806
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,250
Tang San,

807
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,860
I'll make sure you pay back

808
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,940
for everything you've done
when I have the spare time.

809
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,460
The news
of His Majesty's days are numbered

810
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,780
is a trap set by Xue Qinghe,

811
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,050
deliberately leaked to lure you in.

812
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,650
They've already dug the hole,
waiting to bury you.

813
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,020
For Father's life and Tiandou's future,

814
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,500
I must jump in even knowing it's a trap.

815
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,900
Then I'll go with you.

816
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,340
To the chambers.

817
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,050
You've finally shown up,

818
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,690
my brother.

819
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,730
I knew

820
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,340
it wouldn't be that easy to fool you.

821
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,300
Even knowing there's danger,

822
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,130
you sure are a dutiful son.

823
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,250
Too bad, though.

824
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,050
Father may not have
the chance to know the truth.

825
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,050
That's not certain.

826
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,420
Like a fly against a windowpane.

827
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,500
How's your injury?

828
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,820
Can you still join the battle?

829
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,250
With Xieyue's treatment,

830
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,610
it's not a serious problem.

831
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,730
But I promise I won't drag you...

832
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,610
You've already dragged us down.

833
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,460
You defied military orders

834
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,460
and took your soldiers out of the camp.
That's a death sentence.

835
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,530
You exposed our whereabouts,
lost our men,

836
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,020
and endangered the entire army.

837
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:34,210
What punishment

838
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,460
do you think you deserve?

839
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,210
I was too simple in my thinking.

840
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,090
If Her Holiness wants
to hold me accountable,

841
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,820
I'll take full responsibility.

842
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,460
You can't afford it.

843
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,570
Tiandou Palace has released the signal.

844
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:47,500
Move out

845
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,380
and enter the city.

846
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,780
If you don't want to die,
then earn your place on the battlefield.

847
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,210
Boss Dai.

848
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:14,530
Chief is back.

849
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,130
Zhuqing.

850
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:17,300
San.

851
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,650
You two...

852
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:20,570
San,

853
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,650
we already know about Gengxin City.

854
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,250
Even though you handled it well,

855
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,690
you couldn't hide it from us.

856
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,250
We have people watching over
the Blacksmiths Guild.

857
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,020
So don't worry.

858
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,210
Zhuqing and I requested permission
from our family

859
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,050
to meet up with you.

860
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,130
The Martial Soul Hall seems
to be up to something again.

861
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,820
We also want to keep track
of their movements at all times.

862
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,650
It's great

863
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,900
to have you back.

864
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,980
I don't know who you are.

865
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,130
But I'm grateful for your help
with the Blacksmiths Guild.

866
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,170
It's part of my duty.

867
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,050
This is...

868
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:56,980
Could this

869
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,530
be Lou Gao, the God of Ironsmith?

870
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,380
That's right.

871
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,530
Senior Lou is now an elder
of the Tang Clan.

872
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:03,980
We're all family now.

873
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:04,730
So let's get along

874
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,690
and take good care of me.

875
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,500
Lou Gao, the God of Ironsmith.

876
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,530
Old Orangutan always talks about you

877
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,780
and how he admires your achievements.

878
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,530
I never imagined we'd be family now.

879
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:17,650
What nonsense.

880
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,380
Who said I admired him?

881
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:23,050
I only envied him.

882
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,980
Since you're all Tai Tan's friends,

883
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,690
you're also my friends.

884
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,650
Elder Lou was supposed to be in charge

885
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,130
of the Tang Clan's hidden weapon forging
in the Hall of Strength.

886
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,090
However, I have other plans now.

887
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:38,130
Elder Lou,

888
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,860
I hope you will take charge

889
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,690
of creating the Tang Clan's
top-tier hidden weapons in the future.

890
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,460
I will provide you
with the blueprints and materials.

891
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,500
The future of Tang Clan's hidden weapons

892
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,380
will depend on you.

893
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,940
What are we waiting for?

894
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,690
Take me to the forge.

895
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:51,610
Wait.

896
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,460
Elder Bai,

897
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,610
has there been any unusual activity
in Tiandou City recently?

898
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,340
I was just about to report that.

899
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:00,250
Recently,

900
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,460
I sent disciples of the Hall of Agility
to scout the nearby area,

901
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,690
and they found the soul master legion

902
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,050
of the Martial Soul Hall is stationed
on the city outskirts.

903
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,250
Besides that,

904
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,460
Martial Soul Hall's soul masters
in Tiandou

905
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,530
have been very active,

906
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:14,530
often appearing
around Qibao Amber Sect's new residence

907
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,340
and Shrek Academy.

908
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,860
I've already notified teachers

909
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,860
when I was in Gengxin City.

910
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,570
They should be prepared.

911
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,420
We need to return to the academy now.

912
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:30,250
Send someone
to notify Uncle Ning to come.

913
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:31,820
For now, we'll carry on as usual

914
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,340
to avoid alarming them.

915
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,570
Tang Clan's halls
should be on high alert.

916
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,940
It looks like we're heading
for a tough battle.

917
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:06,698
♪Ending the despair of suffering♪
