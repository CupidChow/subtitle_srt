=The Land of Warriors=

19
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,260
=Episode 22=

21
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,660
Stay alive?

22
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,090
But my brothers died because of me.

23
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,170
If I couldn't even protect those
who are important to me,

24
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,660
what's the point being alive?

25
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,780
What is the point?

26
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,420
(My only wish is to turn into
a vengeful ghost.)

27
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,220
(I'll bring those
Martial Soul Hall people)

28
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,020
(to hell myself.)

29
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,020
San.

30
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,860
San!

31
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,780
What's wrong?

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,140
(If I couldn't even protect those
who are important to me,)

33
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,610
(what's the point being alive?)

34
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:09,490
(San.)

35
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:10,850
(Don't be like this.)

36
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,700
Wu?

37
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,540
This isn't my imagination, right?

38
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,420
You refused to let me disappear,

39
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,490
so here I am.

40
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,770
As long as I can see you,

41
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,610
it still makes me happy

42
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,780
even if you're just an illusion.

43
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,650
I am always with you.

44
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,540
I've never left.

45
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,610
San,

46
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,330
hang in there.

47
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,700
There's much more you have to do.

48
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,540
Keep at it.

49
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,700
Just now,

50
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,020
it was my bad.

51
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,610
Sorry.

52
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,490
San,

53
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,020
we're fine.

54
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:51,930
Just be safe.

55
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:54,820
Rongrong,

56
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,380
I'll go help Boss Dai and Zhuqing.

57
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:05,650
Rongrong,

58
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,860
let's continue.

59
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,490
What's happened to you?

60
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,490
I'm like you.

61
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,260
Because of the Martial Soul Hall,
I lost someone very important to me.

62
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,410
But I realized something just now.

63
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,740
She hadn't left me at all.

64
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,620
I feel like I've come to my senses

65
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,650
and I should do what I have to.

66
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,700
But you're still physically able.

67
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,210
You can avenge her.

68
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,140
Unlike me,

69
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,700
I'm a cripple.

70
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:38,890
No.

71
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,220
There are still plenty of things
you could do.

72
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,180
You can use your hand
to learn secret weapons.

73
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,450
You can use your mouth
to share your experiences.

74
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,020
Don't think about the point of it all.

75
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,260
Just do what you can

76
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,890
with what you have.

77
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,480
That's more than enough.

78
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,260
Yes,

79
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,330
as long as you're alive,

80
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,850
there will always be a chance.

81
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,990
You can use your hands
to learn secret weapons.

82
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,070
Use your mouth
to share your experiences.

83
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,450
There are many things

84
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,530
you can still do.

85
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,210
When your injuries heal,

86
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,500
there will be lots of tasks
awaiting you at Qibao Amber Sect.

87
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,060
I promise,

88
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,620
I'll find a way

89
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,140
to make you stand again.

90
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,990
You guys need not worry about me.

91
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,620
I know that was an illusion.

92
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,090
But the illusionary her

93
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,580
would smile at me.

94
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,850
She would talk to me,

95
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,500
help me think of ideas.

96
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,850
Tell me,

97
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,090
could it be possible

98
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,380
that her consciousness entered my body?

99
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,790
Otherwise, the Wu I saw just now
couldn't have been so real.

100
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,940
That's one way for her
to be by your side.

101
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,450
San,

102
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,180
what were you writing about?

103
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,090
I jotted down all the things

104
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,530
that happened lately.

105
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,970
This way, when Wu is resurrected,

106
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,020
I can show it to her.

107
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:33,920
Rongrong,

108
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,450
now that the patients have been treated,

109
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,500
the fever

110
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,060
should dissipate tomorrow.

111
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,650
I've got them settled.

112
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,620
But the symptoms persist.

113
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,620
It's going to be a long night.

114
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,170
The Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan,

115
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,330
and Qibao Amber Sect,

116
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,530
the once glorious Upper Three Clans,

117
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,020
are now barely surviving.

118
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,700
This attack has greatly impacted the world
of soul masters.

119
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,740
Now without a leader, the Martial Soul Hall
will likely become more aggressive.

120
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,060
The newly-chosen seven clans

121
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,990
will likely side
with the Martial Soul Hall too.

122
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,970
Is there really no clan

123
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,820
that dares to challenge them?

124
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,290
Not at the moment.

125
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,990
But in doesn't mean there won't be one.

126
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:15,890
Yes.

127
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,210
No matter how hard we train,

128
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,410
in the end,

129
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,140
we'll only become grand soul masters.

130
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,190
That isn't enough to topple
the Martial Soul Hall.

131
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,380
That's right.

132
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,820
We should gather more skillful warriors

133
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,450
into our fold.

134
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,450
My father

135
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,740
once tried to teach me
what being strong truly means.

136
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,620
I thought that becoming strong

137
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,490
meant improving one's physical skills.

138
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,500
But today, when I helped
the Qibao Amber Sect's disciple,

139
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,380
I came to understand
certain obligations.

140
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,580
Then again,
maybe I don't quite understand.

141
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,890
The meaning of being strong...

142
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,210
It's to bear more responsibilities,

143
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,970
to protect those who needs protection.

144
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,820
To protect those around you,

145
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,060
to protect your own clan

146
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,700
to protect the world.

147
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,210
The... the world?

148
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,020
Isn't that a little too vast?

149
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,970
Are those things
what level 60 soul masters

150
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:21,940
should be thinking about?

151
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,890
Fatty,

152
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,450
what Rongrong meant was,

153
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,410
if more people

154
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,770
had the burden of wanting
to safeguard the world,

155
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,970
then wouldn't we grow in strength?

156
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,020
Indeed.

157
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,770
Father replied our letter.

158
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,220
(The continent is in chaos.)

159
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,620
(Hurry back to Xingluo.)

160
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,530
(Do not forget your positions
and responsibilities.)

161
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,340
(Don't do anything rash.)

162
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,620
Our friends and teachers are in trouble.

163
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,980
We can't just leave.

164
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,960
I share the same thought.

165
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,380
After we help them get through
this difficult time,

166
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,100
we can then return to Xingluo.

167
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,890
If any harm is coming Xingluo's way,

168
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,740
we can still send word back immediately.

169
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,410
But His Majesty will surely reprimand us

170
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,260
for disobeying his order.

171
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,260
It's not the first time anyway.

172
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,990
We'll just accept
the punishment together.

173
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,340
What is it?

174
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,890
You won't be able to fight alongside us.

175
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,810
So you're upset?

176
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,980
You know me too well.

177
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,050
Not being able to help

178
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,140
is making me more anxious.

179
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,340
But I know,

180
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,620
even if I'm physically present,

181
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,020
my powers are still too weak.

182
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,770
I will make haste
and gather even more power.

183
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,500
I trust you'll be able to.

184
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:03,930
Then,

185
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,380
you can establish your own clan.

186
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:12,860
What?

187
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,690
Is my idea bad?

188
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,260
Wu,

189
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,500
you really know me the best.

190
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,290
That's because I'm the Wu in your heart.

191
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,860
Now we have truly become
one body, one mind.

192
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,410
No one can separate us.

193
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,770
I'm right there in your head.

194
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,380
Even if you wish to get rid of me,

195
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,410
you won't be able to.

196
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,620
You should contemplate on

197
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,770
what name to give the clan.

198
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,290
(Xuan Tian Records, Tang Clan)

199
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,170
Look at what's written.

200
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,590
It must have been repeatedly studied

201
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,930
and edited by generations of masters.

202
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,380
What's precious aren't the techniques,

203
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,500
but the clan's determination

204
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,290
to pass on its legacy

205
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,100
and principles.

206
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,690
You're lucky to have learned their ways.

207
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,020
I suppose that makes you
a Tang Clan disciple.

208
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,380
I already have

209
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,770
(Tang Clan)
a name in mind.

210
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,620
The accuracy is still not good enough.

211
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,860
Ao?

212
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,810
(Whenever I feel down,)

213
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,650
I'd look for a place to yell out loud.

214
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,690
It always works.

215
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,620
Come on.

216
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,380
You try.

217
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,050
I don't know what I should shout about!

218
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,860
I want to be happy!

219
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,890
The more rules you give yourself,
the more trapped you'd become.

220
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,140
Once you take a step away,

221
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,100
you'll realize how beautiful

222
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,290
the world could be.

223
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,690
For instance,

224
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,740
the blue sky and white clouds.

225
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,930
Ao!

226
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,810
I miss you so much!

227
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,340
(Where are you right now?)

228
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,220
(Shrek Academy)

229
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,020
You asked me

230
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,530
what the soul bone armor is.

231
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,690
I have some inkling.

232
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,280
But I'll have to first examine
your Eight Spider Lances.

233
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:42,500
Okay.

234
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,260
There was clearly a change just now.

235
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,890
This is...

236
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,050
the precursor of
the Soul Bone Fusion Technique.

237
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,100
The external soul bone acts as a bridge

238
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,340
to help fuse all the soul bones.

239
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,650
The Soul Bone Fusion Technique

240
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,100
is an additional ability created

241
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,890
after the original
soul bones become fused.

242
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,860
It's very powerful.

243
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,620
But to obtain this ability,

244
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,620
ones needs to collect

245
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,810
six soul bone fragments
from the same soul beast.

246
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,500
But I only four soul bone pieces.

247
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,770
And they're not from the same
soul beast.

248
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,620
I get it now.

249
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,170
As an attached soul bone,
the Eight Spider Lances

250
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,140
has evolved
every time your powers increased.

251
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,100
Moreover,

252
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,260
two of your soul bones

253
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,690
came from Hectomillennium beasts.

254
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,530
Naturally, they're incredibly rare.

255
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:01,930
San,

256
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,460
don't feel bad.

257
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,860
I know the two soul bones

258
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,980
came from your mother and Wu.

259
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,290
And having them is not what you wanted.

260
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,940
But that is precisely the reason

261
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,220
you should make full use of them.

262
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,380
Sir,

263
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,650
I understand.

264
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,500
From the current situation,

265
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,410
although the Eight Spider Lances
is the connector,

266
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,290
it's not enough to assimilate
the four soul bones.

267
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,340
Whether or not the real Soul Bone
Fusion Technique can be created

268
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,620
will depend on your chances.

269
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,220
Sir,

270
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,690
who else in Douluo Continent

271
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,650
possesses the Fusion Technique?

272
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,260
If there's a person who has the skill,

273
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,890
he has to be from the Martial Soul Hall.

274
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,620
From what I know,

275
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,140
only the Martial Soul Hall possesses

276
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,140
legacy soul bones
from the same soul beast.

277
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,020
Martial Soul Hall...

278
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,650
I feel the same as you.

279
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,390
I want to beat the Martial Soul Hall
as soon as possible.

280
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,250
They have their sights set
on the entire continent.

281
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,890
Our actions are not merely for revenge.

282
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,810
It's also for the sake
of the continent's peace.

283
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,570
It's important to improve
our own abilities,

284
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,020
but with just us alone,

285
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,810
we won't be able to turn the tide.

286
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,260
You're right.

287
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,350
If we want to take on
the Martial Soul Hall,

288
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,260
we need to have our own powers.

289
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,790
Speaking of which,
I'd like to discuss something with you.

290
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,650
Would you be willing to help me

291
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,340
train Tiandou's soul master legion?

292
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,650
Sir, the reason I came today

293
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,450
was to talk to you
about an important matter.

294
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,620
Tiandou's inner royal circle

295
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,650
isn't as simple as we think.

296
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,930
It is not a bad idea

297
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,890
to work with Tiandou,

298
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,340
but we have to be careful.

299
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,980
Not long ago,

300
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,620
I bumped into Dugu Bo.

301
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,700
(Shrek Academy)

302
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,500
Emperor Xue Ye is gravely ill.

303
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,990
The Crown Prince is currently
overseeing all matters.

304
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,050
That Xue Qinghe
is not to be taken lightly.

305
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,170
What I'm saying is, we can't put
fully trust the Tiandou royals.

306
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,460
No wonder.

307
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,570
After I was given their military power,

308
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,420
the Crown Prince's attitude
toward me also changed.

309
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,130
It's it's an internal power struggle,

310
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,570
we need not be too concerned.

311
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,180
But if it's as Dugu Bo said,

312
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,980
that Xue Qinghe is secretly
colluding with the Martial Soul Hall,

313
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,660
then not only will it spell trouble
for Tiandou,

314
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,290
the whole continent

315
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,980
would risk experiencing a calamity.

316
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,850
If that's true,

317
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,570
we can't just sit by and do nothing.

318
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,850
We need to be prepared
before a disaster happens.

319
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,660
Sir,

320
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,290
I share the same idea.

321
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,530
Sounds like you have a plan.

322
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,850
I'd like to establish my own clan.

323
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,770
Good.

324
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,130
That's gutsy.

325
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,390
When a nest gets overturned,
no egg is left unbroken.

326
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:47,660
Establish my own clan

327
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,850
is something I have to do right now.

328
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,870
But you only just returned
to your old sect.

329
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,570
Now you want to establish your own clan.

330
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,360
How will you handle your position

331
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
at Haotian Sect?

332
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,130
The elders

333
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,260
want me to complete three tasks

334
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,480
before they agree to restart the clan.

335
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,980
They haven't fully acknowledged me yet.

336
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,900
The first task

337
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,050
is to reach soul power level 80
within 10 years.

338
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,130
The second task

339
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,590
is to beat a Grand Soul Master
from the Martial Soul Hall.

340
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,260
The third task

341
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,740
is to obtain
a Hectomillennium Soul Ring.

342
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:25,660
Sir,

343
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,610
say I finally manage to complete
all three tasks,

344
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,740
what do you think the situation

345
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,700
in the continent would be like then?

346
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,050
But don't worry, sir.

347
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,660
I will not disappoint Haotian Sect's

348
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,090
and my father's expectations of me.

349
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,370
Neither will I sit by
and watch the world burn.

350
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,120
The Martial Soul Hall is sent word
across the continent

351
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,500
to re-elect the seven major clans.

352
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,090
Right now, the soul master world
is in disarray.

353
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,530
You wish to establish a new clan

354
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,360
at this time to go up
against the Martial Soul Hall.

355
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,560
I foresee a lot of resistance.

356
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,980
But if you need my help,

357
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,900
I will spare no efforts.

358
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,220
Thank you, sir.

359
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,660
Something's on your mind.

360
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,090
The first step is always the hardest.

361
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,530
Starting my own clan sounds simple,

362
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,220
but when I close my eyes and think,

363
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,990
I feel like I'm about to buckle
under the weight.

364
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,610
That's for sure.

365
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,260
Starting a clan from scratch

366
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,090
means having to handle
all sorts of tasks.

367
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,420
You'll need to manage
every single detail,

368
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,290
settle every matter.

369
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,470
Just you alone,

370
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,990
you won't be able to do it
even if you have 100 pairs of hands.

371
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,900
I'm not alone.

372
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,810
So you realize you're not alone.

373
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,940
I thought you've forgotten the others.

374
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,770
That's enough teasing.

375
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,420
Of course I know everyone
wants to help me.

376
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,990
They're even willing
to join the Tang Clan.

377
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,810
But...

378
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,770
But you're afraid

379
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,380
that one day Tang Clan has to go up
against the Martial Soul Hall.

380
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,320
Everyone would have to face the danger
with you.

381
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,740
This isn't just any danger.

382
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,980
It's one where life
and death is involved.

383
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,050
San,

384
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,700
concern leads to confusion.

385
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,530
Do you think the others are scared?

386
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,420
And don't forget.

387
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,850
What Tang Clan wants to achieve

388
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,180
is a shared dream.

389
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,700
It's not up to you to stop them

390
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,770
from joining the clan.

391
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,370
Although Tang Clan

392
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,810
is still only a dream right now,

393
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,020
I believe

394
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,940
that all of us would want
to realize it with you.

395
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,570
It will become a sharp blade,

396
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,530
a tough shield,

397
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,850
clearing away evil

398
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,770
and safeguarding peace.

399
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,770
Tang Clan?

400
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,420
That's right.

401
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,050
I learned my internal strength

402
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,180
and secret weapon skills
from Tang Clan's Xuan Tian Records.

403
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,610
I am who I am today
because of Tang Clan.

404
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,180
Since it happened by chance,

405
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,420
then I'll leave the rest to fate.

406
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,090
San,

407
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:53,980
that's expected.

408
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,810
You're always one step ahead of us.

409
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,420
Enough fluff.

410
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,260
Come to Xingluo.

411
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,740
Just say it.

412
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,530
Manpower,

413
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,020
land,

414
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,530
materials,

415
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:01,850
money.

416
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,900
If I'm able, I will help you
establish your Tang Clan.

417
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:04,850
Thank you,

418
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:05,850
Boss Dai.

419
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,260
Regarding Tang Clan's future progress,

420
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,020
I already have a plan.

421
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,330
I see.

422
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:12,700
Anyway,

423
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,530
just tell me if you need anything.

424
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,660
If Tang Clan needs help,

425
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,460
I will be at the ready.

426
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:19,900
But at the moment,

427
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,700
I have no plans to join any clan.

428
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,500
I wish to be a free person for now.

429
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,050
San,

430
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,050
whatever it is, I'm with you.

431
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,530
Now, there's only you and me
in Tang Clan.

432
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,740
You can be the chief,

433
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,420
and I'll be the deputy, okay?

434
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,420
Fatty,

435
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,770
looks like you learned the gist
of being a dean.

436
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,570
Join as a stakeholder now

437
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
and you'll make a killing.

438
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,290
Me too.

439
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,180
San,

440
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,090
Qibao Amber Sect may not be
as big as before.

441
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,050
But if

442
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,220
Tang Clan needs anything,

443
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,180
just say it.

444
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,330
Rongrong,

445
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,810
I do have a favor to ask from you
right now.

446
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,740
I'd like to speak with Uncle Ning.

447
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,370
Could you arrange a meeting?

448
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:56,570
No problem.

449
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,370
Leave it to me.

450
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,500
But,

451
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,610
why are you being so secretive?

452
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,740
What's wrong, San?

453
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,090
It's nothing.

454
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,500
Please hurry back.

455
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:09,700
I have something to attend to.

456
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,900
I'll be right back.

457
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,940
(He is quite skilled.)

458
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,900
(Could he be
from the Martial Soul Hall?)

459
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,460
(Who are you?)

460
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,850
Who are you?

461
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,330
Stop following me.

462
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,090
Ao?

463
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,420
Ao!

464
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,610
It is you!

465
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,420
You're finally back.

466
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,460
Come.

467
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,850
Let's return to the academy
and have a good chat.

468
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:02,770
Rongrong will be so surprised

469
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,290
to see you.

470
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,700
I can't see her.

471
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,260
When I was in the Extreme North,

472
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,500
I trained hard every day.

473
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,850
All because I wanted to come back
earlier to see her.

474
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,900
But when I'm actually back,

475
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,610
I got scared.

476
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,810
You won't see Rongrong

477
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,090
because of that scar?

478
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,740
You've underestimated Rongrong,

479
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,770
and failed to see her acceptance of you.

480
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,530
However long you were away for,

481
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,900
that's how long Rongrong
has worried about you.

482
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,810
Are you going to let
her continue worrying

483
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,570
because of your own pride?

484
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,050
You've misunderstood, San.

485
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,980
It's because I feel guilty.

486
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,130
I remember the promise I made her.

487
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,050
When I feel like I've accomplished
what I set out to do,

488
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,290
I'd come back immediately to her.

489
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,850
But when I reached Qibao Amber Sect,

490
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,660
I knew something terrible had happened.

491
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,370
So I rushed to Tiandou City,

492
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,900
and finally saw her at the academy.

493
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,420
But then I started doubting again.

494
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,810
When she was in pain,

495
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,050
I wasn't there with her.

496
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,330
Instead, I was fantasizing
about the future.

497
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,420
The way I am,

498
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,180
I can't bring myself to face her.

499
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,290
I understand your inner conflict.

500
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,660
But even if Rongrong gets angry at you,

501
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,770
facing it

502
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,700
is better than running away.

503
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,420
If you run, you're wasting
both of your time.

504
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,180
It will be a waste.

505
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,610
At least,

506
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,020
you still have the chance
to see your beloved.

507
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,570
As for Wu,

508
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,370
she's not even human anymore.

509
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,330
You could feel sad because

510
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:06,850
of low self-esteem.

511
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,530
You could stop where you are

512
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,940
because of guilt.

513
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,050
But for me,

514
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,530
I can't even see Wu anymore.

515
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,050
San.

516
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,940
What do you mean by that?

517
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,700
Wu,

518
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,020
give San a bit more time.

519
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,090
He will surely resurrect you.

520
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,020
Ao,

521
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,660
cherish the person before you.

522
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,770
Who cares if she's the divine daughter?

523
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,420
Who cares if you're the wild orphan?

524
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,770
Be is low self-esteem,

525
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,050
or guilt,

526
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,330
none of that matters

527
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,090
more than being able to stay
by your beloved's side.

528
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,260
If one day you do lose her,

529
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:54,940
then

530
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,130
it'd be too late for regrets.

531
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,700
I always thought
I was a carefree person.

532
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,660
But when it actually mattered,

533
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,610
I get stuck in a rut.

534
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,610
You're right.

535
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,770
My worries are no more than jokes
when in the face of death.

536
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,460
San,

537
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:09,810
thank you.

538
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,090
I'll go look for her right away.

539
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:18,820
(Shrek Academy)

540
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,420
(Shrek Academy)

541
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,740
We're here.

542
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:33,980
San.

543
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,220
Uncle Ning.

544
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,610
Master Gu.

545
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:39,850
It's been a while.

546
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,420
It's been some years.

547
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,020
You look more comfortable in your shoes.

548
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,130
You...

00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:09,460
♪Longing transcends
the distance of time and space♪

550
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,160

Rongrong,

555
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,220

00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:58,420
I heard from Rongrong that your
martial soul had a second awakening.

574
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,850
The aura of this domain

575
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,180
is very similar to your
Blue Silver Plant martial soul.

576
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,500
I'm guessing it's related?

577
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,740
This is a talent domain that activates
alongside the martial soul.

578
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,570
It can cut off sound,

579
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,940
so people outside of it
cannot hear us talk.

580
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,370
Tang San,

581
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,700
you're always full of surprises.

582
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,220
I'm even more curious
what it is you wanted to tell me.

583
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,940
Let me check your injuries.

584
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:20,740
There's none.

585
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,660
Really.

586
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,420
These are the leftover scars.

587
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,370
I told you all of them.

588
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,050
The one on my face is the worst one.

589
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,050
But it's nothing serious.

590
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,420
There's nothing else to see.

591
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,460
Don't try and brush it off.

592
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,020
How did you get that wound?

593
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,980
What happened to you the past years?

594
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,050
Tell me everything.

595
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,090
Every single detail.

596
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,900
The past years?

597
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,770
I was having a blast
in the Northern Region.

598
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,850
The wine there was exquisite,

599
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,980
and the stewed meats were delicious.

600
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,290
Also, the snowscapes were breathtaking.

601
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:50,770
Rongrong,

602
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:51,940
have you seen ice sculptures?

603
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,020
Ao!

604
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,740
You think I don't know
just because you don't say it?

605
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,940
These injuries...

606
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,020
If they had veered off just a little,

607
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,660
you would've lost your life.

608
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:06,940
What if...

609
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:07,940
There is no "what-ifs."

610
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,020
It's all in the past now.

611
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,130
I'm back.

612
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:13,900
And I'm not leaving again.

613
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,900
If San hadn't noticed you

614
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:17,740
and went after you,

615
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,740
were you never going to come find me?

616
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,220
I was stuck in a rut before.

617
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,180
But later,

618
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,700
San told me about what happened to Wu.

619
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,130
That made me realize,

620
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,050
nothing matters more
than us being together.

621
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,330
So many things happened

622
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,290
during this time.

623
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,850
Sometimes when I awoke from my dream,

624
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,610
I couldn't believe
that it was actually real.

625
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,180
I was so scared.

626
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,260
I was afraid
something happened to you too.

627
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,700
I'm glad...

628
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,020
you came back.

629
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:05,740
Come with me.

630
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,420
Where to?

631
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:09,900
To see your father.

632
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:16,500
(Shrek Academy)

633
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,610
We provide the materials,

634
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,570
and you'll create secret weapons

635
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,050
for Qibao Amber Sect for free?

636
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:21,530
That's right.

637
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,500
Moving forward, Qibao Amber Sect

638
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,090
has to strengthen its defenses.

639
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,850
What I can offer

640
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,500
is to make secret weapons for you

641
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,700
in preparation for the future.

642
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,940
Rongrong told me that
you wish to establish your own clan.

643
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,460
I thought you had asked to see me

644
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,500
to request assistance
from Qibao Amber Sect.

645
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,500
I didn't expect this.

646
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,050
San,

647
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,980
thanks a lot.

648
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,460
My strength is limited.

649
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,740
I hope you'd accept, Uncle Ning.

650
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,980
You're always looking out

651
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,420
for Qibao Amber Sect.

652
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,610
Our sect will remember your deed.

653
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,090
However,

654
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,900
my sect has been passed down
to this day

655
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,740
with a strong foundation.

656
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,020
Despite suffering a huge calamity,

657
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,660
we still have the means
to lend monetary support to a junior.

658
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,460
I already had plans

659
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:06,050
to produce a batch of secret weapons
to arm the sect.

660
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,330
I guess today...

661
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,500
We, Qibao Amber Sect,

662
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,700
will finalize this deal with Tang Clan.

663
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,420
San,

664
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,290
I assure you.

665
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,180
Qibao Amber Sect will give Tang Clan

666
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,530
all the monetary assistance
that is required.

667
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:19,610
If you need anything,

668
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,900
just let me know.

669
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,660
Thank you, Chief Ning.

670
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,700
As thanks,

671
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,610
the secret weapons
Tang Clan make in the future

672
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,980
will be given to Qibao Amber Sect first.

673
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:33,900
Tang San,

674
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,500
I know the reason behind
your establishing a clan.

675
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,020
To have a junior like you
among the soul masters

676
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,700
makes me feel confident.

677
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,700
We shall look out for one another

678
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,420
and stand united.

679
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,290
A peaceful and stable continent

680
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,770
will sure be realized.

681
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,570
Someone's here.

682
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:08,980
Chief Ning.

683
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,290
Father.

684
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,810
After five years of training,

685
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,260
I'm confident that despite
being a support branch soul master,

686
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,260
I have the ability to protect Rongrong

687
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,700
and fight off war soul masters.

688
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,810
I hope you'd give me a chance.

689
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,260
I'm willing to accept
any challenge you post.

690
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,980
If you wish

691
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,850
to protect the future successor
of Qibao Amber Sect,

692
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,660
then you can challenge...

693
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,610
Grand Bone Master.

694
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,330
No!

695
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,500
Father.

696
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,900
How could you ask him
to fight Grand Bone Master?

697
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,180
Grandpa Gu is a level 96

698
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,740

699
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,940
Chief Ning,

700
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,770
I will challenge Grand Bone Master.

701
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:07,770
Ao...

702
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:10,980
I'll leave it to you then,

703
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,210
Grand Bone Master.

704
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,690
You left for five years.

705
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,690

Ao,

754
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:32,900
that's enough.

755
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,730
Don't fight anymore.

756
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,650
A support soul master

757
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,460
is able to withstand
my attacks for this long

758
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,980
and even managed to steal
a button from my robe.

759
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,170
This proves

760
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,980
you've overcome the limits
of your martial soul.

761
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,380
Let's end it here.

762
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:05,980
Ao.

763
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,380
You've proven yourself.

764
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,530
Chief Ning,

765
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,690
I will keep my word

766
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,340
and use my life to protect Rongrong.

767
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,250
I'd like you to rejoin

768
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,460
the Qibao Amber Sect.

769
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,500
Don't rush to decide just yet.

770
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,090
This isn't your only option.

771
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:29,940
San wants to establish his Tang Clan.

772
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,380
He is ambitious

773
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,980
and I trust the clan
would have a bright future.

774
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,690
But most importantly,

775
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,300
as a new clan,

776
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,860
he really needs your help.

777
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,020
Whereas Qibao Amber Sect
has been massacred

778
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,980
and in dilapidation.

779
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,530
All I can say is,

780
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,650
Qibao Amber Sect

781
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,420
also needs you.

782
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,050
But I wouldn't want that or Rongrong

783
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,420
to sway your decision in any way.

784
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,820
I hope you'd be able to choose sensibly.

785
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,570
Father.

786
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,820
I'm glad.

787
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,980
Ao now has the ability to protect you.

788
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:05,820
Of course,

789
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,130
I will devote all my sect's strength

790
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,460
to give him better training.

791
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,650
I'm looking forward

792
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,730
to the day where you two can rebuild

793
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,050
the Qibao Amber Sect.

794
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:17,820
Ao.

795
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,690
I respect whatever you decide.

796
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:28,610
I'm sorry,

797
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,210
Chief Ning.

798
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,170
I choose...

799
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:31,860
Tang Clan.

800
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,090
Despite just hearing

801
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,570
about Tan's plan to establish Tang Clan,

802
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,780
as his brother,

803
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,500
I understand where he's coming from.

804
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,210
After wandering outside for years,

805
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,130
I saw countless evil acts
from the Martial Soul Hall.

806
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,250
I too, felt the pain of what happened

807
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,130
to Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan

808
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,130
and Qibao Amber Sect.

809
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,300
Tang Clan holds

810
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,940
not only San's dream,

811
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,250
but also everyone's shared goal.

812
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,380
If at this moment,

813
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,730
I give up on joining Tang Clan
because of Rongrong,

814
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,250
I'm afraid I'd never
be able to forgive myself.

815
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,730
But neither will I give up on Rongrong.

816
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,780
Whether or not you approve
of our relationship,

817
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,530
I will quietly protect her,

818
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,570
and cherish her.

819
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,820
Even if I don't belong
to Qibao Amber Sect,

820
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,980
so long as Rongrong
or the Sect needs me,

821
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,210
I will be there.

822
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,050
I have to admit,

823
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,860
that's what I most desired,

824
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,250
the most perfect answer.

825
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,860
A man who would give up his friend
for the sake of love

826
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,210
should never be trusted.

827
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,730
You've convinced me.

828
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,650
Go on and assist San.

829
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:42,210
I'll look forward to
the Shrek Seven Devils

830
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,900
getting back on top.

831
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:44,730
Chief Ning,

832
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,650
does that mean you approve
of my relationship with Rongrong?

833
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,250
Why are you still calling me "chief"?

834
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:53,690
Father-in-law.

835
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:57,650
Ao!

836
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,820
This address is a little premature.

837
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:04,460
Come.

838
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,610
Uncle Ning.

839
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,570
Who is the man standing beside Rongrong?

840
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,460
Oscar!

841
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,170
Mr. Flander.

842
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:16,780
Ao.

843
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,380
Kid, you finally came back.

844
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,170
Long time no see.

845
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,460
Chief Ning.

846
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,170
Mr. Flander.

847
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,380
San.

848
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,690
Someone is waiting for you
in my office.

849
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:30,820
Go on.

850
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:31,530
Okay.

851
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,500
I know you're really strong now.

852
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,300
If you don't spar with us,
we won't forgive you.

853
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,340
That's right.

854
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:37,690
No problem.

855
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,090
Offer up a drop of blood

856
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,340
and I'd let you experience

857
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,980
how it feels to be bashed
by your own soul skill.

858
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,340
Fatty,

859
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,170
a round battle.

860
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,300
This dude is too obnoxious.

861
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:45,900
Beat him up.

862
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,090
Sure.

863
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,130
But,

864
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,210
if you lose,

865
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,050
you can't see Rongrong for 10 days.

866
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,050
That's right.

867
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,820
Rongrong didn't disagree.

868
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,250
I'm hungry.

869
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,940
The wonton stall at East Street
is still there, right?

870
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,210
Let's go.

871
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,860
Hey, you can't not ask me
when it comes to eating.

872
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:13,860
Who are you?

873
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,690
Grand Venom Master told me
you'd be here.

874
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:22,820
That's why I came.

875
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,170
Fourth Prince?

876
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,570
It's been a while.

877
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,570
Back then, you were
my classmate in Moon Pavilion, right?

878
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,610
Tang San.

879
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,380
Looks like my disguise there

880
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,780
wasn't good enough.

881
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,500
You're mistaken.

882
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,500
The reason I think it's you,

883
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:43,900
is because

884
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,730
I believe that in this world,

885
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,020
aside from Tang San,

886
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,650
no one else could be so young

887
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,690
and so talented.

888
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,530
As to why I didn't call you out,

889
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,340
it's because I rather not be your enemy.

890
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,500
I remember we met for the first time

891
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,690
at Tiandou's Royal Academy.

892
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:02,940
Grand Venom Master and I

893
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,940
held you and the Shrek
Seven Devils back.

894
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,820
At the time,
I was forced to do certain things.

895
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,940
Hope you understand.

896
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,570
Actually, I've always had
great admiration for you.

897
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,610
You could say I look up to you.

898
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,780
You're too kind, Your Highness.

899
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,460
You helped me numerous times
back in Moon Pavilion.

900
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,780
I know.

901
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,690
I clearly felt his Demon Domain

902
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,690
just now.

903
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:29,570
You rebellious thing!

904
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,020
Brother is talking to you.

905
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,610
Are you deaf?

906
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,420
Also, the plants in Moon Pavilion
are rare species.

907
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,650
Can you pay for any damages?

908
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,090
Stop making a fool of yourself.

909
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,090
When we were studying in Moon Pavilion,

910
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,980
you played like you were sawing.

911
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,530
Don't play.

912
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,090
Come and drink with me.

913
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,650
Thank you, Fourth Prince,
for stepping up at the time.

914
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:49,380
Now that you mention it,

915
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:50,730
I will be frank with you.

916
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,420
Tang San,

917
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,380
I have a favor to ask.

918
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,650
You're hurt.

919
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,300
Please sit down.

920
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:05,780
Quickly.

921
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,340
I'm a wanted criminal right now,

922
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,090
not some Fourth Prince.

923
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:15,940
Grand Venom Master

924
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,780
has told me about
what happened with you.

925
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,460
You came here to look
for an anecdote, right?

926
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:24,380
This is the drug

927
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,170
that Xue Qinghe's been feeding
Father every day.

928
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,690
This poison is colorless and tasteless.

929
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,210
Grand Venom Master said
to take the utmost care.

930
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,050
It's alright.

931
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:42,020
My body has been tempered
by ice, fire and poison.

932
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:43,780
This bit of poison can't harm me.

933
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,980
You really as incredible
as Grand Venom Master

934
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,130
made you out to be.

935
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,610
Grand Venom Master's
assumption is correct.

936
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,300
It is made up of a combination
of poisons.

937
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,460
I'll be straight.

938
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,170
The anecdote

939
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,250
may not be attainable.

940
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:17,170
Whatever it is,
it'll require a long time to find.

941
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:17,900
I understand.

942
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,730
Even if Father dies
before the cure is found,

943
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:22,900
I will not blame anyone.

944
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:24,340
I will do my best.

945
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:25,820
Please.

946
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,500
I hope you'll keep this matter a secret.

947
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,780
Do not let anyone else know.

948
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,530
You put your trust in me,

949
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:32,300
so I will not let you down.
