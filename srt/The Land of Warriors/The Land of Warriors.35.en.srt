00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,186
=The Land of Warriors=

2
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

3
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,860
=Episode 35=

4
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:46,640
Why don't I try channeling
some soul power into him?

5
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:49,232
I borrowed a few silver needles
from Senior Yang Wudi.

6
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,780
But where should I prick him?

7
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,832
No matter how hard I hit him,
he won't wake up.

8
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,860
How about I try casting Phoenix Flame?

9
00:01:55,136 --> 00:01:55,920
Don't be ridiculous.

10
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:57,920
Maybe I should give him
one of my sausages.

11
00:01:58,048 --> 00:01:58,890
It might wake him up.

12
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,220
It looks like San's eyelids are moving.

13
00:02:17,424 --> 00:02:18,464
What are you all doing?

14
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,700
What happened to you?

15
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,816
We came to call you
this morning to leave,

16
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:24,640
but we found you unconscious
on the floor.

17
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,464
No matter how we tried,
you wouldn't wake up.

18
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,984
We were just about to call Grandmaster

19
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:29,024
and Dean Flander for help.

20
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:29,712
That's right.

21
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:37,536
This is a treasure granted
by His Majesty,

22
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:39,210
Vast Sea and Universe Shield.

23
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,260
It's also what caused me to faint.

24
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:43,200
Though I don't remember

25
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:44,512
what happened after I fainted,

26
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,700
I can sense immense power

27
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,140
from this treasure.

28
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:48,860
A treasure?

29
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:50,576
What does it do?

30
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,730
Once you return,

31
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,100
and inject your soul power into it,

32
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,020
you'll naturally understand.

33
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,064
Rongrong.

34
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:26,800
What's wrong?

35
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:32,416
This treasure gives me an overwhelming
sense of suppression,

36
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,580
even making my martial soul tremble.

37
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,540
If my Jiubao Amber Pagoda

38
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,300
is a tower among treasures,

39
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:40,512
then this Vast Sea and Universe Shield

40
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:42,480
is a towering mountain
that stands above all.

41
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:40,530
This treasure gifted by Tiandou

42
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:41,650
is extremely precious.

43
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:43,330
What secrets does this treasure hold?

44
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,020
San.

45
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,060
San!

46
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,450
Zhuqing!

47
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,060
This is its first skill,

48
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:16,880
Vast Sea Protection.

49
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,890
It can shield us within it,

50
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,260
enveloping us entirely.

51
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:22,176
Not only does it conceal
our physical forms,

52
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,380
but it also hides our aura.

53
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:32,330
Trying to sneak an attack?

54
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,620
Take it easy..

55
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,180
San's treasure can make us invisible.

56
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,820
That's why you couldn't see us.

57
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,210
Boss Dai.

58
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,940
Try this again.

59
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,090
San.

60
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,940
This thing is terrifying.

61
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,620
I can't move at all.

62
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:02,960
This is its second skill,

63
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:04,410
Universal Freezing Protection.

64
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:05,820
It also has a third skill,

65
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,450
called Roaring Seas.

66
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,770
And a fourth skill,

67
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,020
called Demon Destruction.

68
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:11,620
They're all attack skills.

69
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,090
Roaring Seas
is an area attack skill,

70
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,380
while Demon Destruction
targets individuals.

71
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:17,488
When there's a chance,

72
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,020
I'll show them to you.

73
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,740
Calling it a magical weapon
would be an understatement.

74
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,580
His Majesty said
Vast Sea and Universe Shield

75
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,392
come in handy

76
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:26,700
when we reach Haishen Island.

77
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,210
Just for this,

78
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,090
we owe His Majesty our gratitude.

79
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:31,552
He's thought everything through.

80
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,140
Since everyone's ready,

81
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,020
let's set off for Haishen Island.

82
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:36,940
Let's go!

83
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,060
Let's go!

84
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,090
Let's go!

85
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,210
Let's go!

86
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,260
Let's go!

87
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:47,970
Masters, Seniors, rest assured.

88
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,380
We'll achieve our goal

89
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:50,210
and return soon.

90
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:51,940
Most importantly,

91
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,330
stay safe.

92
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,770
Hurry up, move faster.

93
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,890
What's the rush?

94
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,530
You're just talking from the sidelines.

95
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,180
Hey,

96
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,820
if you don't carry it, who will?

97
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:02,940
Finally caught up!

98
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,424
Ms. Erlong.

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,016
Mr. Flander.

100
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,088
What are you doing here?

101
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,210
The journey to Haishen Island
is a long one,

102
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:10,189
and you might not be used
to the food on the way.

103
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,584
Although this is a training journey,

104
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,770
you still need to eat well.

105
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,140
I prepared all of this
for you last night.

106
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:15,940
Take it with you.

107
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:16,800
Eat it on the road.

108
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,850
Ms. Erlong,

109
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,650
there's really no need for this.

110
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,650
Exactly.

111
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,168
We're not picky eaters.

112
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:26,780
We can adapt to the food wherever we go.

113
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:28,080
You don't need to worry about us.

114
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,650
Not worry?

115
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,530
How can I not worry?

116
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,740
This journey is so perilous.

117
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,850
I don't even know when you'll come back.

118
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,330
What if you face difficulties
on the way?

119
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,090
I just...

120
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,090
Alright.

121
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,330
Ms. Erlong worries too much.

122
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,976
Ever since she learned you were
going to Haishen Island,

123
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:46,480
she's been preparing all of this,

124
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:47,888
afraid she might forget something.

125
00:07:47,952 --> 00:07:48,770
No one can stop her.

126
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:49,970
Just take it.

127
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,180
He's right.

128
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,940
Just bring it with you.

129
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,700
Otherwise, once you leave,

130
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,820
Ms. Erlong won't be able to sleep.

131
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:59,072
I really don't want to have to
take all of this

132
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,256
back home again, alright?

133
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:00,890
Alright.

134
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,850
You're one to talk.

135
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,580
Who was it last night,

136
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,180
saying over and over

137
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,448
how dangerous Haishen Island is

138
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:09,680
and couldn't sleep all night?

139
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:10,896
And now you're blaming me?

140
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,020
These kids of ours

141
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,380
are all above level 60.

142
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,472
They're exceptional
no matter where they go.

143
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:18,736
What are we worrying about?

144
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,410
Exactly.

145
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,060
Masters, rest assured.

146
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,060
We'll definitely return safely.

147
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,410
As for this stuff,

148
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,256
I'll accept them on everyone's behalf.

149
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,620
It's getting late.

150
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,810
We should set off now.

151
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,050
San,

152
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,530
I leave Xiang

153
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,890
in your care.

154
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:43,980
Granduncle,

155
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,690
don't worry.

156
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,770
Masters,

157
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,220
take care.

158
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,472
- Take care.
- Take care.

159
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:57,980
Take care.

I have good news for you.

170
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,260
What good news?

171
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,890
My martial soul has awakened.

172
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,020
Grandpa said

173
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:29,979
I'm born with level 20
innate soul power.

174
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,740
He also said

175
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,672
my Angel Martial Soul
is the most beautiful soul

176
00:10:32,688 --> 00:10:33,500
on the continent.

177
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,620
Mom, look.

178
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,170
Guards!

179
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,220
Take her away.

180
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:50,410
Mom!

181
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,020
What did I do wrong?

182
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,100
Why are you treating me like this?

183
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,570
Mom!

184
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,620
What did I do wrong?

185
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,530
Mom!

186
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,570
What exactly did I do wrong?

187
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,140
Why are you treating me like this?

188
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,340
Mom!

189
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,740
What did I do wrong?

190
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,530
Why?

191
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,980
Why are you treating me this way?

192
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,140
What exactly did I do wrong?

193
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,140
I did nothing wrong.

194
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:01,456
You're the one who's in the wrong.

195
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,690
This time,

196
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,140
you're not abandoning me.

197
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,810
I'm abandoning you.

198
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,220
Grandpa,

199
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,410
why haven't I received
the Angel's trial?

200
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,140
How long did it take you back then

201
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,050
to gain the Angel's recognition?

202
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,290
The Angel's trial cannot be forced.

203
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,890
Miracles don't manifest so easily.

204
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,140
Grandpa,

205
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:29,620
I'm willing to give my all

206
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,140
to gain the Angel's recognition.

207
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,810
You've already shown great sincerity.

208
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,810
Child,

209
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,100
stand up.

210
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,020
I won't give up.

211
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,930
You said

212
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,290
I'm the most outstanding descendant
of Tribe of Angle.

213
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,260
I refuse to believe I won't receive
the Angel's trial.

214
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,776
Your Holiness.

215
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,020
Ever since Qian Renxue absorbed

216
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,490
the second soul bone of Angel's Armor,

217
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:04,672
she's been kneeling before the idol
in the Elder Hall.

218
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,570
Foolish dreams.

219
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,740
Let me go.

220
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:48,740
Go?

221
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:49,930
Go where?

222
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,340
To find Yu Xiaogang?

223
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,620
I know you're thinking of him.

224
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,410
So I met him on your behalf.

225
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,860
I wanted to give you a chance,

226
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:05,650
to persuade him to join
Martial Soul Hall with you.

227
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,460
But

228
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:10,890
he doesn't want you.

229
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,740
Impossible.

230
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,860
I want to see him.

231
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,860
I told him about us.

232
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,180
(Bi Bi Dong and I shall henceforth
part ways. Sincerely, Yu Xiaogang)

233
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,220
I'm the only one who truly
cares for you.

234
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,740
Don't harm yourself.

235
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,930
Be good and give birth to our child.

236
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,410
You don't want to be trapped
here forever, do you?

237
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,690
Tribe of Angle

238
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,930
ruined my life.

239
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,860
I, Bi Bi Dong, will never forgive them.

240
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,140
(Martial Soul City)

241
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,792
All the clan chiefs in the continent

242
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,690
are gathering at Martial Soul City.

243
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,530
They're preparing for the re-election
of the Seven Great Clans.

244
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,020
Once the assembly ends,

245
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,290
Bi Bi Dong

246
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,620
will use the new Seven Great Clans

247
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,290
to expand simultaneously
towards Tiandou and Xingluo.

248
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:04,090
Breaking up with her back then

249
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,220
was truly a wise choice.

250
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,980
Anyone who sees her true nature

251
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:09,984
would leave her without hesitation.

252
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,050
She's the one who left me.

253
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:34,520
You're finally willing to see me.

254
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,360
After you returned to Martial Soul Hall,
there's been no word from you.

255
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,830
I've come here to find you many times,

256
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:40,080
but I was stopped at the door.

257
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,050
What happened?

258
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,530
I've been in seclusion training.

259
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,610
You...

260
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,330
Did something happen?

261
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,180
Tell me.

262
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,660
I called you here

263
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,130
to tell you

264
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,460
to stop dreaming.

265
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,570
I won't leave with you.

266
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,900
But we already planned everything,

267
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,368
to travel the continent together.

268
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,570
Why the sudden change?

269
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,610
You must have some hidden trouble.

270
00:18:05,312 --> 00:18:07,872
Is it your master stopping you
from leaving the Martial Soul Hall

271
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:09,200
and forcing you to say this?

272
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,900
Don't you understand my words?

273
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,740
We were never meant to be.

274
00:18:14,048 --> 00:18:15,616
If it weren't for wanting to learn

275
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:17,248
how to cultivate Twin Martial Souls,

276
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,610
I wouldn't have approached you.

277
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,740
That's not the truth.

278
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,220
Do you think that a Mutated Martial Soul
outcast like you

279
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,130
is worthy of me?

280
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:32,980
Fine.

281
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,180
If that's how you really feel,

282
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,420
I...

283
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:42,610
I accept it.

284
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,220
Wait.

285
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,180
Write it down.

286
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,460
I'll show it to my teacher

287
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,810
to prove my loyalty
to the Martial Soul Hall.

288
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:11,260
When did you get injured?

289
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,700
Let this be the last thing
you do for me.

290
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,320
(Bi Bi Dong and I shall...)

291
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,480
(Bi Bi Dong and I shall henceforth
part ways. Sincerely, Yu Xiaogang)

292
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,740
(Bi Bi Dong and I)

293
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,090
(shall henceforth part ways)

294
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,104
(and never think of each other again.)

295
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,740
Your misfortune turned out
to be a blessing.

296
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,610
She wasn't like this at the beginning.

297
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,050
How can someone change so much?

298
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,810
Or was she inherently evil?

299
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:37,810
No.

300
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,900
Yu Xiaogang, let me warn you,

301
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,900
you had better be loyal to Erlong.

302
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,130
Don't you dare think of other women.

303
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,420
Besides, she doesn't deserve it.

304
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,330
Everything now is thanks to her.

305
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,020
Impossible.

306
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,770
I've long let go of those past events.

307
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,290
Besides, she's my enemy now.

308
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,180
I'll make sure

309
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,090
she pays for everything she's done.

310
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,570
Tang San and his group are heading
toward Hanhai City.

311
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,290
Hanhai City?

312
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,344
Are they planning to go
to Haishen Island?

313
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:17,904
Soul masters from the continent
going to Haishen Island.

314
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,740
That's a death sentence.

315
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,020
He will come back alive.

316
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,420
Don't worry.

317
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,260
I won't forget the your reminder.

318
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,330
I will definitely take his life.

319
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,090
Good.

320
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,740
I'll send someone to confirm
his current location.

321
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,380
(Hanhai City)

322
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,330
Hanhai City is a necessary stop
to Haishen Island.

323
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,610
When we get there,

324
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,890
we can take a boat from the port
to continue our journey.

325
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,330
San,

326
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,900
up ahead is Douluo Continent's

327
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,900
western coastal city,

328
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,980
Hanhai City.

329
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,460
(Hanhai City)

330
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,290
As expected of Tiandou's largest
coastal city.

331
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,020
We can get some backup medicine.

332
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:45,980
Buy it.

333
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,700
We also need to bring warm clothes.

334
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,660
Buy them.

335
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,980
If you like them, we'll buy them,
warm or not.

336
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,740
And fresh water.

337
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,940
We absolutely need that.

338
00:22:55,312 --> 00:22:56,660
We can also bring some alcohol.

339
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,460
Xiang.

340
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,220
Look.

341
00:23:02,352 --> 00:23:03,504
It's even livelier up ahead.

342
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,180
Friends, friends!

343
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,180
Welcome to Hanhai City!

344
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,810
(Captain Hai)
Would you like to join my tour group?

345
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,740
We take care of transportation,
accommodations, and delicious food.

346
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,980
Go out to sea, dive,
and watch the sunrise.

347
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,020
How about it?

348
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:26,850
Everyone,

349
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,220
why not consider it?

350
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,420
No, thank you.

351
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,180
Alright.

352
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,810
Have a pleasant journey.

353
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,220
Let's split up.

354
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,180
Xiang,

355
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,570
you check on the Soul Arena.

356
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,480
Rongrong,

357
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:52,850
Ao,

358
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,530
you go buy the supplies we need.

359
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,850
As for the rest of us,

360
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:57,632
we'll gather information about the port

361
00:23:57,632 --> 00:23:58,576
and renting a ship.

362
00:23:58,624 --> 00:23:59,136
Sir,

363
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,570
I want to go with Xiang.

364
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,610
I can go by myself.

365
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,460
Let Fatty go with you.

366
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,280
After all, we're not familiar
with this place.

367
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,590
You can look out for each other.

368
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,504
That's settled then.

369
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,740
We'll meet later at that

370
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,100
seafood restaurant by the entrance.

371
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:19,700
San,

372
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,420
see you later.

373
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:23,570
Let's go.

374
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,130
Let's go.

375
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,216
Alright.

376
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,420
San,

377
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,020
about that captain...

378
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,152
He's probably just trying

379
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,130
to make some money off us tourists.

380
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,050
As long as he doesn't step out of line,

381
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:50,300
we can ignore him.

382
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,672
(Three-Day Island Tour)
Excuse me.

383
00:24:52,688 --> 00:24:53,744
Want to go out to sea?

384
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,330
Come, come!

385
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,130
Let me give you an introduction.

386
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,850
We offer boats tailored to your needs.

387
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,912
There's bound to be one
that's perfect for you.

388
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,220
Three-day island tour...

389
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,850
So you're looking to rent a boat
to go to sea?

390
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,610
If you're renting a boat,
a sea captain is your best bet.

391
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,850
I know everything about the market.

392
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,980
And wouldn't you know it,

393
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,530
I happen to have a boat.

394
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,020
If you don't believe me,
ask the lady here.

395
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,168
Isn't that right?

396
00:25:22,544 --> 00:25:23,376
That's right.

397
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,020
Alright then,

398
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,496
let's go take a look at the boat.

399
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,020
Captain Hai,

400
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,700
you're so kind-hearted.

401
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,130
How can we repay you?

402
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,130
You're too polite, my friend.

403
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,330
Meeting is fate.

404
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,420
Is that why you've been

405
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,770
following us?

406
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,020
Ouch...

407
00:25:41,344 --> 00:25:42,290
It's a misunderstanding.

408
00:25:42,784 --> 00:25:44,224
Really, it's a misunderstanding.

409
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:46,736
If we catch you again

410
00:25:46,736 --> 00:25:47,810
sneakily following us,

411
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,330
we won't let you off so easily.

412
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:50,304
Get lost.

413
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:53,700
Alright.

414
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,610
Let's go.

415
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:05,040
Rongrong,

416
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,424
we should buy some incense sticks.

417
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,900
This could come in handy.

418
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,260
San always ends up making bets
and dueling with others.

419
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:13,664
We'll definitely need it.

420
00:26:30,592 --> 00:26:31,984
Thank you, dear customer.

421
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,260
Let's go.

422
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,570
Big fishes always put up a fight.

423
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,570
Never mind.

424
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:39,810
I've got my eye on you now.

425
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,130
Blind box opening!

426
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,090
Blind box opening!

427
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:44,940
Miss,

428
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,180
how about an ocean-themed blind box?

429
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,370
Blind box?

430
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,050
Exactly.

431
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,850
Open large seashells

432
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,810
to get pearls.

433
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,740
Each box is just 100 gold soul coins.

434
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:56,740
Are you sure?

435
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,660
No matter what kind of pearl I get,

436
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,370
it's only 100?

437
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,460
Of course.

438
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,020
As you all know,

439
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,700
these pearls

440
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,330
can't be artificially cultivated.

441
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,770
They're completely natural.

442
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:08,570
If you find one,

443
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,460
it'll be worth a fortune.

444
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,020
The third one from the left in this row.

445
00:27:15,456 --> 00:27:16,768
The second one on the right.

446
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,460
These two.

447
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:17,980
That one.

448
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,090
Open them.

449
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,050
Miss,

450
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,810
you must really know your stuff.

451
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,370
Okay,

452
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:23,700
here we go.

453
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,770
Miss, you're really lucky.

454
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,420
Look at this.

455
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,496
You're breaking even
with just this one pearl.

456
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:34,944
Great.

457
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:35,570
Let's see

458
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,900
if the rest are as good.

459
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,180
This...

460
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,260
This...

461
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,220
This...

462
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:00,980
This...

463
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,180
This is truly unbelievable.

464
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:08,980
Sir,

465
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,260
let's try a new batch.

466
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,180
Miss...

467
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,180
These are all once-in-a-lifetime
top-quality pearls.

468
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,976
I can't let you open any more.

469
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,220
Perhaps you should try another shop.

470
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,700
Then wrap up the ones I've opened.

471
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,180
Sure.

472
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:27,940
Of course.

473
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,050
Miss,

474
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,850
with the way you've been picking,

475
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,530
isn't 500 a bit too little?

476
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,090
How about...

477
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,020
How about you tip me 3,000 gold coins

478
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,420
as a token of appreciation?

479
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,500
3,000?

480
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,144
Why don't you go rob someone?

481
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,180
The pearls you opened

482
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,130
can be sold for a high price.

483
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,130
And, miss, your luck today

484
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,700
must be thanks to my daily prayers

485
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,460
to the God of the Ocean.

486
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,130
So, why not share a bit
of your fortune with me,

487
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,900
so that you'll continue to prosper
in the future?

488
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,740
It wasn't her luck.

489
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,130
It was her skill.

490
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,660
Well, if that's the case,

491
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:11,940
then no deal.

492
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,200
You're just raising the price
on the spot.

493
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,744
So what?

494
00:29:15,776 --> 00:29:16,272
Fifty.

495
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,700
Mr. Hai,

496
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,530
this is...

497
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:20,940
Fine.

498
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,850
When it comes to buying pearls,
a sea captain is your man.

499
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,370
Mr. Hai, right?

500
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,180
Thank you.

501
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,570
I'm just a helpful person.

502
00:29:39,984 --> 00:29:41,330
Always happy to assist others.

503
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:45,632
We won't let you go unrewarded.

504
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,570
Bro, this is too much, really.

505
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,740
Are you sure about this?

506
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:52,500
Impressive.

507
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,290
Mr. Hai, you're truly a gentleman.

508
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,180
Since that's the case,

509
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,016
we wouldn't want to insult you
with money.

510
00:29:58,176 --> 00:29:59,616
Your kindness speaks volumes,

511
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:00,880
so we'll take our leave now.

512
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,504
Let's go.

513
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,770
Wait..

514
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,330
I haven't introduced myself yet.

515
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,330
I am Captain Hai,

516
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,584
the all-knowing local guide.

517
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,700
If you need anything, just come to me.

518
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,460
Looking at you two,

519
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,660
you must be tourists from inland.

520
00:30:15,936 --> 00:30:17,290
You really should have someone

521
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,740
like me, a local expert,

522
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,660
to show you around.

523
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,330
(Coconut Breeze, Sea Melody:
Captain Hai at Your Service)

524
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,504
Let's help each other out.

525
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,610
I'm just looking to make a little money.

526
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,370
So feel free to "insult" me

527
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,850
with your money.

528
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,130
I can take it.

529
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,530
For example,

530
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,260
look here.

531
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,700
In this place,

532
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,850
ship models are very popular.

533
00:30:40,032 --> 00:30:41,776
The quality and craftsmanship are great.

534
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,370
But if you buy them here...

535
00:30:47,184 --> 00:30:49,488
(Made in Tiandou City)
It's really not a wise choice.

536
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,260
Made in Tiandou City.

537
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,850
Honestly,

538
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,810
I know this place inside out.

539
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,370
I know everything,

540
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,660
and I can handle anything.

541
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,810
For the right fee, that is.

542
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,370
A fee?

543
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,460
Trust me,

544
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,460
my prices are fair,

545
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,770
and I treat everyone equally.

546
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,940
Actually, we do have something

547
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,048
we'd like to ask you about.

548
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,700
You're strangers to this place,

549
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,500
so just treat me

550
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,850
as your best friend in Hanhai City.

551
00:31:26,144 --> 00:31:27,392
Whatever you want to know,

552
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,810
I'll explain everything

553
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,500
clearly.

554
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,290
Whatever requests you have, just ask.

555
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,810
Mr. Hai,

556
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,220
let's go to that seafood restaurant
on the street corner.

557
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,672
We can sit down and talk slowly.

558
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,290
You can also meet my other friends.

559
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,610
I'm a regular there.

560
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,290
When the owner sees me,

561
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,700
they either give me extra dishes
or a discount.

562
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,260
The food there is excellent.

563
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:49,700
Let's go.

564
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,530
I'll take you there.

565
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:50,980
Let's go.

566
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,700
When it comes to seafood,
Captain Hai is your man.

567
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,770
Seafood must be paired
with perilla leaves.

568
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,020
I'm not sure if you're
used to eating seafood.

569
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,130
Start by pairing it with perilla leaves.

570
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,260
I guarantee you'll enjoy it.

571
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,940
I've got a special dish

572
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,770
coming right up.

573
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,610
You are going to love it.

574
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,460
Wait for me.

575
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,050
This guy first followed us,

576
00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:18,640
then latched onto Ao and Rongrong.

577
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,180
And he's so smooth-talking,

578
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,090
always talking about money.

579
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,050
He seems dubious.

580
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,850
If he just outright asked for money,

581
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,500
it'd be simpler.

582
00:32:25,648 --> 00:32:27,504
But I'm worried he wants
more than money.

583
00:32:27,616 --> 00:32:29,248
Let's stay alert and see how things go.

584
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,610
Here it comes.

585
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,090
The special dish is here.

586
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,530
Fresh sea crabs,

587
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,530
just out of the pot.

588
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,020
Come,

589
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,610
eat up.

590
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,610
Eat while it's hot.

591
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,290
I love the smell of this fresh seafood.

592
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,460
It's so aromatic.

593
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:41,700
Xiang,

594
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,660
we've come at the perfect time.

595
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,370
Try it.

596
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,220
See if you like it.

597
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,290
Xiang,

598
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,530
you should eat more.

599
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,570
You need the energy
to report back to San.

600
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,050
We found out

601
00:32:59,264 --> 00:33:02,176
that the biggest Soul Arena in the city
is in the eastern district.

602
00:33:02,192 --> 00:33:04,016
That place is full of
all sorts of characters.

603
00:33:04,128 --> 00:33:06,784
Both land soul masters and ocean
soul masters can participate.

604
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,220
Any soul master visiting Hanhai City

605
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,536
will want to try their luck there.

606
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,940
The competition is quite brutal.

607
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,180
If we want to challenge them,

608
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,610
we must sign a death waiver.

609
00:33:16,464 --> 00:33:18,020
This young lady is no ordinary person.

610
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,370
She's really impressive.

611
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,672
She just arrived in Hanhai City

612
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,320
and already has everything figured out.

613
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,020
However, ocean soul masters

614
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,770
fight differently from you guys.

615
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,980
Even a Great Ocean Soul Master

616
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,810
can destroy

617
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,500
a Grand Land Soul Master.

618
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,330
So fighting them

619
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,680
might not work in your favor.

620
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,500
Just let it go.

621
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,472
I won't hide it from you.

622
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,050
If you want to understand
ocean soul masters,

623
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,020
you'll need to consult me, Captain Hai.

624
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,090
You sure know a lot, Mr. Hai.

625
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,260
After hearing you,

626
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,168
we're even more determined
to challenge them.

627
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,472
If we all go together,
we'll attract too much attention.

628
00:33:55,504 --> 00:33:57,330
We should send a representative
to compete,

629
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,980
while the rest observe and analyze.

630
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,020
I'll go.

631
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,330
No, let me do it.

632
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,850
It's been a while since I've
stretched my muscles.

633
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:07,770
Even if it's dangerous,

634
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,210
I think Xiang is up to the task.

635
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:09,820
Fatty,

636
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,340
don't you agree?

637
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:12,980
Yes.

638
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:13,730
Xiang,

639
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,380
I was thinking the same.

640
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:16,650
Fatty,

641
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,520
you have to go too.

642
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,380
As they say, water and fire don't mix.

643
00:34:19,616 --> 00:34:21,980
Your martial soul is the best
for testing the differences

644
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,504
between us and ocean soul masters.

645
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,300
And don't worry,

646
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,020
if you're in trouble,

647
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,730
Xiang can swoop in and save you.

648
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,860
We'll have one attacking
and one supporting,

649
00:34:32,912 --> 00:34:34,928
working together to fight
the ocean soul masters.

650
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,656
That way, the rest can observe clearly.

651
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,860
Xiang,

652
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,820
we get to fight side by side again.

653
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:43,980
Come here.

654
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:45,570
Take a look.

655
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:46,528
How about this spot?

656
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:51,820
This is the grand Soul Arena
of Hanhai City.

657
00:35:10,144 --> 00:35:11,170
I want the best seats.

658
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:11,610
Sure.

659
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,940
You can head back now.

660
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:14,820
Let's go.

661
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,420
Wait.

662
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:17,900
Can you

663
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:19,392
tell us the price first?

664
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,730
Don't worry.

665
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,780
It's only 50 gold soul coins.

666
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,570
Give me the money,

667
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,940
and I'll bargain with the manager.

668
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,420
Just watch.

669
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,300
Mr. Hai.

670
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,460
Do you remember me?

671
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,380
Of course.

672
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,610
I brought some friends today.

673
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,250
They'd like to sit in the VIP room,

674
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,776
but they only have 50 gold soul coins.

675
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,420
Do me a favor,

676
00:35:52,464 --> 00:35:53,392
and give us a discount.

677
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:54,530
Sure.

678
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,536
No problem, Mr. Hai.

679
00:35:55,632 --> 00:35:56,128
Here you go.

680
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,130
Welcome to Hanhai Grand Soul Arena's

681
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,460
two-on-two soul battle!

682
00:36:00,512 --> 00:36:01,664
After the drawing of lots,

683
00:36:01,696 --> 00:36:04,530
the participants for this match
are ready.

684
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,650
In the first match, it's the
Fengxiang Duo versus the Haipo Brothers.

685
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,170
Alright!

686
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,420
First up, we have the Fengxiang Duo.

687
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,500
Do you know them?

688
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,136
No, I don't.

689
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,820
Next up, we have the Haipo Brothers.

690
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:52,380
Haipo Brothers...

691
00:36:52,530 --> 00:37:01,620
Haipo Brothers...

692
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,816
(Hai Gui, Haipo Brothers)
Haipo Brothers...

693
00:37:04,816 --> 00:37:06,770
(Hai Bai, Sea Soul Brothers)
Haipo Brothers...

694
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:11,300
Haipo Brothers...

695
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,090
First time in a soul battle?

696
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,170
It's okay.

697
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:16,768
The first time I stepped on stage,

698
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:17,936
I nearly tripped and fell.

699
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,650
Don't be nervous.

700
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:21,248
I'm here with you.

701
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,690
The Haipo Brothers

702
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,980
have already achieved
a four-match winning streak.

703
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,090
If they win this match,

704
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,210
they'll achieve

705
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,530
bonus points for five
consecutive victories.

706
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,570
I believe in this match,

707
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,780
they'll give it their all.

708
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,730
Haipo Brothers...

709
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,170
Haipo Brothers...

710
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,170
These two brothers are so in sync,

711
00:37:52,384 --> 00:37:54,672
they most likely possess
Martial Soul Fusion Skill.

712
00:37:55,216 --> 00:37:56,976
They're going to be hard to deal with.

713
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,210
What's even scarier is

714
00:37:58,256 --> 00:38:00,064
that they're both
of the water attribute.

715
00:38:00,272 --> 00:38:02,729
A Martial Soul Fusion Skill
combining the same attribute

716
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,530
is even more powerful
than regular Soul Fusion Skills.

717
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,940
I hope Fatty and Xiang

718
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:09,690
can quickly find a way to counter them.

719
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,650
Let the match begin!

720
00:38:23,728 --> 00:38:24,976
A fire-attribute martial soul?

721
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:26,224
They must be land soul masters.

722
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,020
Most likely.

723
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,504
Fire-attribute martial souls are rare
among ocean soul masters.

724
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,456
A land soul master fighting
an ocean soul master

725
00:38:31,472 --> 00:38:32,560
has a natural disadvantage.

726
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,296
No need watching.

727
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,240
Since they don't want to come down,

728
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,460
let's send the water up to them.

729
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,610
Fatty and Xiang seem off.

730
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,130
There's something wrong
with this water curtain.

731
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,380
Xiang,

732
00:39:55,536 --> 00:39:57,300
this water curtain is draining
our energy.

733
00:39:57,424 --> 00:39:59,408
If we don't escape in time,
we might suffocate.

734
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,090
Let's work together to find a way out.

735
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,210
Today, we'll turn you into boiled fish.

736
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,860
Phoenix Meteor Shower!

737
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,460
Smart move.

738
00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:45,820
This way, they've lost
their home-field advantage.

739
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,210
It seems Fatty's Phoenix Flame

740
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,420
is slightly superior.

741
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,610
But Fatty just shielded Xiang
from an attack.

742
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,130
He's likely injured.

743
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:53,820
They need to escape quickly.

744
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,250
The poison of my Phoenix Flames

745
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,690
is your ultimate counter.

746
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,380
The stronger their attacks,

747
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,460
the more energy they'll drain.

748
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,960
No matter how skilled they are,

749
00:41:07,488 --> 00:41:08,944
they'll eventually be trapped here.

750
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,340
Ma Hongjun!

751
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:42,672
The water curtain is sapping my energy
faster and faster.

752
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:44,940
I'll distract them.

753
00:41:45,152 --> 00:41:46,688
I'll leave the rest to you.

754
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,250
Xiang!

755
00:41:52,096 --> 00:41:53,340
What is Xiang planning to do?

756
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:15,780
Not good.

757
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,860
It's their strategy.

758
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,500
Phoenix Strike!

759
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:06,980
