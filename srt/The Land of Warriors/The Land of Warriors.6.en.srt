=The Land of Warriors=

23
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from
Tangjia Sanshao's novel "Soul Land")

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,260
=Episode 6=

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,000
Blue Silver Emperor
has finally awakened.

26
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,680
I can sense

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,520
another
100-thousand-year-old soul beast.

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,520
Wu, your bracelet.

29
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,840
This is it.

30
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,560
Top plant soul beast.

31
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,030
100-thousand-year-old soul beast.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,680
I didn't expect that San's Martial Soul
isn't an ordinary Blue Silver Plant,

33
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,830
but the Blue Silver Emperor
from the forest legends.

34
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,030
Grand Haotian Master once told me

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,610
that San's mother was
a 100-thousand-year-old soul beast.

36
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,520
I didn't expect it was her.

37
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,520
It seems that Tang San's Martial Soul

38
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,280
hasn't truly awakened until today.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,430
So this is Blue Silver Emperor?

40
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,590
It's the Martial Soul

41
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,910
that my mother left me.

42
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,590
Yes.

43
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,430
The soul ring you have now

44
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
is condensed

45
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,080
according to the limits

46
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,250
of what your body can bear.

47
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,000
It evolves
as your ability to withstand it

48
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,000
increases.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,940
As long as you
have Blue Silver Plant around you,

50
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,190
it will change according to your body.

51
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,630
My fifth soul ring
can evolve on its own.

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,870
It's the power
of the Blue Silver Emperor bloodline.

53
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,630
The awakening
of your Blue Silver Emperor bloodline

54
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,750
nourishes us

55
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,080
and gives us stronger vitality.

56
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,630
We have nothing

57
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,910
but the sincerest gratitude and respect
for you.

58
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,870
Please remember.

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,120
Blue Silver Clan
will always submit to you

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,840
and assist you.

61
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,240
Now,

62
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,560
I also want to return to my peace

63
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,950
continue my long cultivation

64
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,920
and exploration of soul power.

65
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,070
Goodbye.

66
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,310
My king.

67
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,560
Goodbye.

68
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,040
Thank you.

69
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,270
(Wu.)

70
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,980
(Turns out
Blue Silver Emperor's Martial Soul)

71
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,870
(is a gift that my mother left me.)

72
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,040
(She's)

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,900
(a 100-thousand-year-old soul beast
like you.)

74
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,630
(If she were still here,)

75
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,950
(she would definitely like you.)

76
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,240
I thought

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,680
he was a useless peasant.

78
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,560
Who knew he's Blue Silver Emperor
wandering among mortals.

79
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,510
Wouldn't that be the same
as our 100-thousand-year-old soul beast

80
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:18,920
Wu...

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,870
What?

82
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,190
Sounds irrelevant.

83
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,070
Totally incompatible.

84
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,630
What a cliche story.

85
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,390
Wu.

86
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
There's nothing remarkable
about Martial Soul.

87
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,000
Ignore him.

88
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,070
I don't care

89
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
what kind of Martial Soul he has.

90
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,190
I remember when I first met him,

91
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,800
everyone laughed at him

92
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,480
for having a useless Martial Soul.

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,920
But he proved through his own efforts

94
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,730
that there's no useless Martial Soul
but only useless soul masters.

95
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,190
That's what true excellence is like.

96
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,920
That's what I admire about him.

97
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,750
There's no useless Martial Soul

98
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,630
but only useless soul masters.

99
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,950
Daming.

100
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,750
Do you also think he is excellent?

101
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,310
No way.

102
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,680
The human world is dangerous.

103
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
I don't support you going back.

104
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,360
Martial Soul Hall
will continue looking for you.

105
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,390
You really
can't leave the core area anymore.

106
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,920
Yes, Wu.

107
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,480
As long as
you don't leave the core area,

108
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
you'll be fine.

109
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,800
No soul master

110
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,680
has set foot here all these years.

111
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,070
But I can't hide forever.

112
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,560
Besides,

113
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,680
even if she doesn't look for me,

114
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,160
one day

115
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,870
I'll find her.

116
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,630
Are you obsessed with cultivation

117
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,920
because you still want revenge?

118
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,920
Not only because of Tang San.

119
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,720
Bi Bi Dong killed my mother.

120
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,120
I won't spare her.

121
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,270
Wu, don't be upset.

122
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,800
You've got a big mouth.

123
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,310
Bi Bi Dong has

124
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,240
your mother's
100-thousand-year-old soul ring

125
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,270
and is far more powerful
than the average person.

126
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,120
Revenge won't be easy.

127
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,950
More importantly,

128
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,870
how miserable would you be

129
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,270
if you lived with hatred?

130
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,720
Don't worry.

131
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,630
I'm not cultivating hard
just for revenge.

132
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,870
Soul beasts are born passive,

133
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,040
either killed or struck
by heavenly tribulations.

134
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,430
I choose to transform into a human

135
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,040
to find another possibility of life.

136
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,480
Besides, my mother
also chose to transform into a human.

137
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,340
It's a pity that she lost the chance

138
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,390
to go to the human world because of me.

139
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
That's why
I want to live my life to the fullest,

140
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,270
also living out my mother's share

141
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,360
as well.

142
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,360
Wu.

143
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,560
You're speaking so profoundly now.

144
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,190
You could never
have said something like this

145
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,360
previously.

146
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,120
As for revenge,

147
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,870
I believe that one day,

148
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,430
I will become a soul master
who is comparable to Bi Bi Dong.

149
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,870
Not only will I avenge my mother,

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,390
I will also do something for the future
of all soul beasts.

151
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,510
Facing Martial Soul Hall,

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,390
I can't back down.

153
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,740
(Martial Soul's True Form,The Whole Body
Transforms Into A Golden Spider)

154
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,120
What's the matter with you?

155
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,960
This is the new banana stinky bean curd

156
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,510
I just developed.

157
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,970
It's cold and you haven't eaten yet.

158
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,320
I'm talking to you.

159
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,030
Since you came back from the palace,
you haven't slept or eaten.

160
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,630
Even a deity can't stand that.

161
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,670
Fine, I'll eat it.

162
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,420
Does it taste good?

163
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,360
Yes.

164
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:04,960
Hold it.

165
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,790
Finish it immediately.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,630
This is
the only copy from 100 years ago.

167
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,630
Be gentle with it.

168
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,580
- I'll be gentle if you eat it.
- I'll eat it.

169
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,360
Erlong, Xiaogang.

170
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,000
His Highness is here.

171
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,890
Your Highness.

172
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,870
Grandmaster.

173
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,630
I've searched everywhere
under Father's orders,

174
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,480
but I still haven't found any clues.

175
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,480
That's why I came to ask you for advice.

176
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,790
I've been thinking
about this a lot lately.

177
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,560
I have no final conclusion,

178
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,000
but I have some ideas
that you can use as reference.

179
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,810
Grandmaster, please tell me.

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,550
I carefully compared the information
of the missing soul masters

181
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,750
and discovered that they're
from different Martial Soul clans.

182
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,660
But the number of people
increases day by day.

183
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,720
And the soul power improves.

184
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,270
So I suspect

185
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,030
that the missing soul masters

186
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,500
are being used for cultivation by soul masters
with special Martial Soul.

187
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,630
Cultivation?

188
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,150
Could soul masters
be used for cultivation?

189
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,270
Certain poisonous snakes, scorpions,

190
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,750
and spider-type Martial Souls

191
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,630
possess a killing aura
or the ability to devour.

192
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,630
If a soul master with such Martial Souls

193
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,360
has bad intentions,

194
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,720
they might use this method
to quickly improve.

195
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,440
I've never seen anyone like that.

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,360
Do you have any suspects?

197
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,270
Grandmaster.

198
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,030
This is a big deal.

199
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,600
We need evidence.

200
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,840
That's why
I can't jump to conclusions blindly.

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
But I would advise His Majesty

202
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,260
to contact Seven Great Clans
as soon as possible

203
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,210
to prevent more soul masters
from being killed.

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,960
You have a point.

205
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,030
I'll go back
and report to Father immediately.

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
Grandmaster and Deans.

207
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,670
Goodbye.

208
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,120
Take care, Your Highness.

209
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,840
Xiaogang.

210
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,630
Do you suspect her

211
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,510
to be that person?

212
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,390
I...

213
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,510
She has rare Twin Martial Souls
after all.

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,200
And these two Martial Souls

215
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,670
are Spider King of Death
and Soul Devouring Spider respectively.

216
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,790
Didn’t Xiaogang just say

217
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,440
we need evidence?

218
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,510
You're not trying to protect her, are you?

219
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,000
Of course not.

220
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,000
If she did it,

221
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,000
no one can defend her.

222
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,550
But...

223
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,120
I just hope she's not involved in this.

224
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,670
(Otherwise, it will be too complicated.)

225
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,150
You hope she's not involved?

226
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,600
Looks like

227
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,870
you're still thinking about her.

228
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,150
No...

229
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,000
That's not what I meant. I...

230
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,960
This bean curd smells pretty good.

231
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,030
- Let me try...
- Put it down. It's not for you.

232
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,000
I know you don't mean it.

233
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,120
Hurry and eat it.

234
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,390
All right.

235
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,700
Does it taste good?

236
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,320
After this ordinary sweet bean curd

237
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,120
is paired
with stinky bean juice and banana,

238
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,270
its flavor becomes so unique.

239
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,440
Yummy.

240
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,670
I'll get you another bowl.

241
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,550
Get me more.

242
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,510
Sorry.

243
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,030
I didn't make extra.

244
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,200
Thank you for your kindness.

245
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,510
Xiaogang.

246
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,720
Even if you indulge Erlong,

247
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,750
you don't have to suffer to this extent.

248
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
How did I suffer?

249
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,480
Let's be real.

250
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,600
Isn't a simple bowl of sweet bean curd

251
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,600
tasty enough?

252
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,790
Like you said,

253
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,240
sweet bean curd is too simple.

254
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,390
But

255
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,390
after Erlong's thoughtful cooking,

256
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,030
this simple bean curd
became quite extraordinary.

257
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,120
She's always had a knack

258
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,150
for turning home-cooked dishes

259
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,270
into something unique.

260
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,910
Don't you think so?

261
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,030
I have no comment.

262
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,270
Let's just say
you're a match made in heaven.

263
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,000
Goodbye.

264
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,750
Father.

265
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,670
Look.

266
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,690
My Martial Soul
has awakened for the second time.

267
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,510
It's now

268
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,080
Blue Silver Emperor.

269
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,080
Blue Silver Emperor.

270
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
My name is Yin.

271
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,000
Yin.

272
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,270
What did you say?

273
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,630
Nothing.

274
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,030
I saw Mother when absorbing

275
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
soul ring.

276
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,960
It's the first time I've seen her.

277
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,720
You said you saw your mother?

278
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,240
Where is she?

279
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,790
Tell me where she is.

280
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,960
Spiritual Sea.

281
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,120
It was just an illusory shadow,

282
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,550
but I can sense

283
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,750
that it's her.

284
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,030
There's no doubt about it.

285
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,000
She cried

286
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,080
and apologized

287
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,390
to me.

288
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,360
I'm the one who should apologize.

289
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,150
I didn't protect her.

290
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,480
I...

291
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,270
Father.

292
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,670
Father.

293
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,480
Let me be.

294
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,800
Father.

295
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,030
Father, what's wrong?

296
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,510
Father.

297
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,270
(Why is your body like this?)

298
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,510
(Is it Martial Soul Hall...)

299
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,480
(No. That's not right.)

300
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,200
I'm fine.

301
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,950
Your internal organs are displaced
and your meridians are in disarray.

302
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,720
How are you fine?

303
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,120
If you don't take good care of yourself,
you could...

304
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,790
Focus on your cultivation.

305
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,270
Stay out of my business.

306
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,870
How could I?

307
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm your son.

308
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,790
You're the same as before.

309
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,600
If you die,

310
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,910
what should I do?

311
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,750
Don't worry. I won't die.

312
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,870
It's already quite good

313
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,270
that I managed
to keep my injury under control

314
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,120
to this extent.

315
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Father, I can cure you.

316
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,360
With just you?

317
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,910
I learned Tang Clan's Xuan Tian Strike.

318
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,140
My soul power is different
from regular soul masters.

319
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,030
You probably felt it

320
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,150
when I checked your body

321
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,320
with my soul power.

322
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,670
You're only a five-ring Soul King.

323
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,720
Your soul power
is just a drop in the bucket for me.

324
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,000
It won't make a difference.

325
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,650
Just because I'm a Soul King now
doesn't mean I'll always be one.

326
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,840
Once my soul power

327
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,200
reaches the same level as yours,

328
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,750
I'm sure I can cure you.

329
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,600
But you have to promise me

330
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
not to fight others during this period.

331
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,800
Otherwise,
your old injuries will act up.

332
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,550
I still have a lot of things to do.

333
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,320
I can't be held back.

334
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,360
I've grown up.

335
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,670
You can leave it to me.

336
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,600
I just want you to be safe and sound.

337
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,200
Wait until you're really stronger.

338
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,510
Father!

339
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,590
What are you doing?

340
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,720
Let go.

341
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,030
If Mother were still alive,

342
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,550
she also wouldn't

343
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,680
want to see you like this.

344
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,920
Just think of it as doing it

345
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,110
for Mother

346
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,510
and me.

347
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,400
Father.

348
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,680
It seems that I'm really getting old

349
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,830
and need my son to protect me.

350
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,550
Fine.

351
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,400
I promise.

352
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,480
But you also have to promise me

353
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,830
not to threaten with death

354
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,240
again.

355
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,960
It's stupid and childish.

356
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,920
I couldn't
think of anything else just now.

357
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,920
Let's go.

358
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,810
Where are we going?

359
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,680
Aren't you in a hurry to die?

360
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,720
I'll take your there.

361
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,270
What is this place?

362
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,400
You'll only emerge stronger

363
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,590
when face
with the trial of life and death.

364
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,350
In order to survive,

365
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,240
do whatever it takes

366
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,750
to bring out
our greatest potential and limits.

367
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,510
Just like this.

368
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,880
Father.

369
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,070
What did you discover?

370
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,960
I almost got killed by my own father.

371
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,790
What else?

372
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,930
I don't want to die.

373
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,750
There's a domineering aura emanating

374
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,960
from deep within
that wants to keep myself alive.

375
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,960
This domineering aura
is what we call killing intent.

376
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,720
Killing intent?

377
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,350
Your practical control is good,

378
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,820
but you lack the domineering aura
needed to turn the tide in a crisis.

379
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,680
This power

380
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,270
was accidentally triggered

381
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,000
by your will to survive.

382
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,310
I can control it with ease.

383
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,790
Do you feel it?

384
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,960
This is the rebound power
a person possesses

385
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,510
when pushed to the brink.

386
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,110
Once you master this power,

387
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,640
you will be fearless

388
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,350
even if you face an opponent

389
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,920
far stronger than you.

390
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,240
Here. Put it on.

391
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,000
The road ahead is dangerous.

392
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,240
Don't let others see your face.

393
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,310
The next step

394
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,110
is to get your own power.

395
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,790
- Drink.
- Here.

396
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,750
He's even wearing a mask.

397
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,000
Why act all mysterious?

398
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,240
Is this

399
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,790
the place I can get my power?

400
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,720
You'll find out soon enough.

401
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,440
What would you like to order?

402
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,750
A glass of Netherland Shot.

403
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,400
Here.

404
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,440
Write down the materials you need to make
those top-tier concealed weapons.

405
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,720
Father, what are you trying to do?

406
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,780
I can go to Gengxin City
to look for the materials.

407
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,640
It's a city of metal.

408
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,160
Maybe I'll find what you want.

409
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,310
Thank you, Father.

410
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,660
(Pure Silver,
Cold Iron, Lath-like Gold)

411
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,720
Here.

412
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,790
Here, drink it.

413
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,720
The smell of blood is so strong.

414
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,960
What's this?

415
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,960
Netherland Shot is mixed
with a special liquid.

416
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,590
It can excite you

417
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,550
and fire you up.

418
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,110
At the same time,

419
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,310
it can also
gradually wear down your willpower

420
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,570
and make you get addicted to it.

421
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,400
This tavern
hides the entrance to Netherworld City.

422
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,550
You have to drink it
if you want to get in.

423
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,510
It's the rule
for entering Netherworld City.

424
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,440
How can I not drink?

425
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,440
If you want to break the rules,

426
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,030
you must have the ability to do so.

427
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,880
Where is this inexperienced kid from?

428
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,750
This is not the place for losers.

429
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,030
You can't even
drink a glass of Netherland Shot.

430
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,750
Yet you want to earn the right to enter.

431
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,110
You can defeat them

432
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,590
if you feel angry.

433
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,510
Strength is everything here.

434
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,440
Netherworld City is cruel.

435
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,070
Remember, Son.

436
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,160
You must try to keep yourself alive.

437
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,880
Only in this way
can you complete your cultivation

438
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,510
and see me again.

439
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,720
I'll kill you first!

440
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,830
Kill him!

441
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,550
Kill him!

442
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:29,960
Two blacks.

443
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,720
He's a Soul King.

444
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:32,550
Get him.

445
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,830
Fourth soul skill.

446
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,680
Blue Silver Spike Formation.

447
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,440
I'll wait for you to come back.

448
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,480
Welcome to Netherworld City.

449
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,070
It's a dangerous world.

450
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,000
Here,

451
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,070
you can get anything you want

452
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,550
as long as you drink
this Netherland Shot.

453
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,350
I'm not thirsty.

454
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,200
No thanks.

455
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,720
If you won't drink it,

456
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,960
you're going to get punished.

457
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,920
Our dear Scott,

458
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,270
looks like you finally

459
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,830
get to move.

460
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,680
You broke the rules.

461
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,070
So what?

462
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Those who break the rules
can only enter Netherworld City

463
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,880
if they defeat me.

464
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,920
(Where's my soul ring?)

465
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,030
(Even Haotian Hammer)

466
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,400
(has become a regular hammer)

467
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,580
(No wonder Father asked me
to seal my soul power and cultivate.)

468
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,160
What's an Haotian Sect disciple
doing here?

469
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,750
Could it be him?

470
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,310
You passed the test and are eligible
to enter Netherworld City.

471
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,720
Here's your life-and-death token.

472
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
(9528?)

473
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,000
Welcome to Netherworld City.

474
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,920
I'm your guide.

475
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,350
I'll answer all your questions
within 24 hours.

476
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,030
What can I use this for?

477
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,240
The people of Netherworld City
have no names.

478
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,290
This life-and-death token
represents your identity.

479
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,070
Losing it

480
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,110
means your life has been taken.

481
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,960
Is the tavern

482
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,480
the only entrance to Netherworld City?

483
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:39,960
Yes.

484
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,510
But let me remind you

485
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,480
that you can't leave Netherworld City
at will now that you've entered it.

486
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,370
Law enforcement
will be keeping an eye on you.

487
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,720
They are Great Soul Masters

488
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,440
allowed to use soul skills.

489
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,480
Could we only enter?

490
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,790
No.

491
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,440
There's only one way

492
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,640
to leave Netherworld City.

493
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,640
Win 100 times at Hell's Training Ground

494
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,880
and challenge Hell's Road.

495
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,200
If successful,
you will be granted the title of Demon

496
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,950
and can freely
enter and exit Netherworld City.

497
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,970
But there have only been
eight such powerful beings

498
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,680
in the past thousand years.

499
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,310
Where is Hell's Road?

500
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,960
You'll find out

501
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,960
one you win 100 times.

502
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,440
Hell's Road is the most powerful

503
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,310
and dangerous place

504
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,750
in the whole Netherworld City.

505
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,160
It's not suitable for you yet.

506
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,870
Netherworld City is said to be the realm left behind
by a powerful soul master

507
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
after breaking through level 100.

508
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,350
It's now ruled
by the great Netherworld King.

509
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,680
You can't use soul skills here.

510
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,790
You can only survive by instinct
and your own strength.

511
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,960
But you can use soul power.

512
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,030
Netherworld King?

513
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,960
Are there any other rules?

514
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,830
The rules are

515
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,920
unkind,

516
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,160
untrustworthy,

517
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,880
uncharitable,

518
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,070
and unjust.

519
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,920
As long as you're capable,

520
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,640
you can do anything you want.

521
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,300
(Netherworld City)

522
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,000
Haotian Sect.

523
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,350
(Netherworld King)
Interesting.

524
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,000
(Netherland Shot is mixed
with a special liquid.)

525
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,510
(It can excite you)

526
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,440
(and fire you up.)

527
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,030
(At the same time,)

528
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,310
(it can also
gradually wear down your willpower)

529
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,640
(and make you get addicted to it.)

530
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,000
The outer city of Netherworld City

531
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,120
is where the losers
of Hell's Training Ground gather.

532
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,550
And the inner city you're at

533
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,510
is only for those
who have won in Hell's Training Ground.

534
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,500
So you must never let your guard down

535
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,720
when interacting with them.

536
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,880
Otherwise...

537
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,070
Thank you for the reminder.

538
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,640
But don't worry.

539
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,480
As a newcomer,

540
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,680
you'll be safe for at least 24 hours.

541
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,680
It's up to you after that.

542
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,000
Netherworld City has no currency.

543
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,680
All the food is free.

544
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,920
Of course.

545
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,830
It's possible that it's poisonous.

546
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,280
Yes.

547
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,230
This is the inn where you'll be staying.

548
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,920
What's this?

549
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,110
It's the mark of a mighty Demon.

550
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,590
It's Father.

551
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,630
Looks like you don't need my protection.

552
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,550
Thank you.

553
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,920
(Hu Liena.)

554
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,590
(Why is she here?)

555
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,030
Newcomer, it's dangerous here.

556
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,480
Be careful.

557
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,000
(Tang San is nowhere
near as fast as this man.)

558
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,190
(Has the Haotian Sect disciple
left the clan to gain experience?)

559
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,190
If you want to live,
you better stay away from that woman.

560
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,230
Her methods are brutal.

561
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,110
Her current record
at Hell's Training Ground

562
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,400
is 16 wins in 16 matches.

563
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,840
She's now ranked in the top 100.

564
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,110
You can enter the top 100
with just 16 wins?

565
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,760
Mr. 9528.

566
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,200
Do you think this place is the same as
the huge Fighting Soul Arenas outside?

567
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,280
Here,

568
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,840
only one person

569
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,340
out of ten survives.

570
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,910
It can be said that every battle
is a battle of life and death.

571
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,070
Do the math.

572
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,920
How many people do you need to win

573
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,710
to maintain a 16-win record?

574
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,840
I see.

575
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:04,960
Come on.

576
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,710
Hell's Training Ground is right ahead.

577
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,630
(Looks like she's here
for the same reason I am.)

578
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,590
- You bet too.
- Yes.

579
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,320
- You have have hopes for him?
- I'll double the bet. 5743.

580
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,960
Sure, let's see.

581
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,710
Hell's Training Ground is the center
of the whole Netherworld City.

582
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,580
You need to register
with your identity token

583
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,030
and wait for the match to start.

584
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,550
One match for every ten people
with only one winner.

585
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,800
I declare

586
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,030
this match over.

587
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,670
5743 won.

588
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,880
- Good job!
- Good job!

589
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,590
- Good job!
- Good job!

590
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,130
Is he absorbing soul power?

591
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,800
You're clever.

592
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,480
The winner gets to take

593
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,480
all the property
of the other nine losers

594
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,880
as well as their soul power.

595
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:06,960
(That's a lie.)

596
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,550
(Most of the soul power
is absorbed by the training ground.)

597
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,030
(What's under the training ground?)

598
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,400
(There's so much soul power.)

599
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,670
(Where did they go?)

600
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,000
(Hell's Road is the most powerful)

601
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,800
(and dangerous place.)

602
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,400
(Is it)

603
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,320
(below the training ground?)

604
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,620
My dad insisted on sending me out
to do some shopping today.

605
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,930
I wanted to go sunbathing with you
in the wild mountains.

606
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,750
As long as I'm with you,
it doesn't matter where we go.

607
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,920
What a smooth talker.

608
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,070
We'd better pick up the pace.

609
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,630
We mustn't miss today's sunset.

610
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,550
Sure, you're making great progress.

611
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,110
Let's go.

612
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,620
Come and take a look.

613
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
Miss, have a bowl. It's still hot.

614
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,280
Who are you?

615
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,710
Why are you following us?

616
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,800
How dare two support branch soul masters
act arrogantly with me?

617
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,920
You're bold.

618
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,090
How did you know
we're support branch soul masters?

619
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,800
Looks like it's our lucky day.

620
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,630
Not only can we get some money

621
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,510
but also something else.

622
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,590
You're right, Sirs.

623
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,840
She's pretty and wealthy.

624
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,710
Grab her.

625
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,680
How about letting me go?

626
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,280
How dare you play tricks?

627
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,190
Do you know who I am?

628
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,150
How dare you provoke
Qibao Amber Sect?

629
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,360
Who would be afraid

630
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,590
of Qibao Amber Sect
disciples

631
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,370
without the protection
of War Soul Masters?

632
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,440
Ao!

633
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,230
Ao.

634
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,880
Ao!

635
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,960
Take a good look

636
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,760
at how he protects you.

637
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,760
Ao.

638
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,670
How dare a support branch soul master

639
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,840
fight War Soul Masters like us?

640
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,400
He overestimated himself.

641
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,840
Ao!

642
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,840
Buddy, what do we do with him?

643
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,510
How dare he use a concealed weapon?

644
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,190
Break his hand.

645
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,590
What do you want?

646
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,550
Ao!

647
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,110
Ao.

648
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,510
Let's go.

649
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,150
Thank you for saving us.

650
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,920
What's your name?

651
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,550
We'll visit you later to thank you.

652
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,000
(Wang Zheng)
I'm Wang Zheng. No need to thank me.

653
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,320
Miss, were you scared just now?

654
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,150
I'm fine.

655
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,840
Thank you for just now.

656
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,170
If there's nothing else,

657
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,280
we'll leave first.

658
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,710
Young Master.

659
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,840
Is Qibao Amber Sect's
little princess blind?

660
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,000
How could she be interested
in this defenseless kid?

661
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,630
How is he comparable to you?

662
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,800
Now that she has seen someone better,
she won't like someone useless like him.

663
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,840
Are you new?

664
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,840
I'm telling you.

665
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,330
The weaker you are,
the more likely you are to be targeted.

666
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:28,190
- Kill him!
- Kill him!
