=The Land of Warriors=

2
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

3
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,420
=Episode 5=

4
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,750
Father.

5
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,630
Father.

6
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,110
I can't feel Wu.

7
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,990
Did she channel her soul power to me

8
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,910
to save me

9
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,720
and end up...

10
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,680
That bracelet

11
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,830
is the product of your
martial soul's soul power.

12
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,800
If she is in trouble,

13
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,830
the bracelet will return to you.

14
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,520
So why can't I sense her?

15
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,440
If I have to guess,

16
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,750
she is deliberately

17
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,240
cutting ties

18
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,750
with you.

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,990
So, what do I do now?

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,550
You wait.

21
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,190
But I...

22
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,600
You made a mistake.

23
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,600
It's fair to punish you
with anxiety for a little bit.

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,320
Wu is loyal and honorable.

25
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,600
She risked her life for you.

26
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,040
Make sure you treat her well.

27
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,280
From now on,

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
you must stop using your soul power.

29
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,720
That's my punishment for you.

30
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,070
I can't sense her without my soul power.

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,470
Don't be a fool.

32
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,470
The bracelet she took

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,880
was part of your martial soul.

34
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,560
You don't need to use soul power.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,160
Concentrate on your thoughts,

36
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,070
and you may sense each other.

37
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,440
Well?

38
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,320
Did you find it?

39
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,230
Wu.

40
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,470
It's not in the lake.

41
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,120
Oh no.

42
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,560
It's very important to me.

43
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,070
Look!

44
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,440
Look what I found!

45
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,600
What's going on over there?

46
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,750
Look at this.

47
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,880
This is a rare treasure.

48
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,230
Fine. Impressive.

49
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,600
Hey!

50
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,320
Don't brush me off!

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,950
Fine, I'll finish this
divine herb myself.

52
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,670
Yearning Heartbroken Red.

53
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,040
Wu, you know your herb.

54
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,470
It was Wu's all along.

55
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,100
Thank goodness we found it.

56
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:56,910
Erming.

57
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,120
You did a great job.

58
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,880
I'll reward you

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,190
with a back scratch.

60
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,560
Wu.

61
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,160
With this divine herb,

62
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,750
there is no need

63
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,280
to consume the Amethyst Radish.

64
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,230
Use this herb for your cultivation.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,600
No.

66
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,670
It was a gift from San.

67
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,670
(This is Yearning Heartbroken Red.)

68
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,350
(It's said that a young man)

69
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,640
(married a flower fairy.)

70
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,040
(That angered the gods.)

71
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,870
(The couple was separated.)

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,160
(The young man became depressed
over time.)

73
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,520
(Then, someone told him)

74
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,310
the white peony in the garden

75
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,760
was the reincarnation of his wife.

76
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,960
He cried at the flower day and night.

77
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,040
He was heartbroken
and his tears dried up.

78
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,960
He died yearning and heartbroken.

79
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,960
Before his passing,

80
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,670
his blood stained the flower.

81
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,110
Therefore,
this is an extraordinary flower.

82
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,470
It chooses its master.

83
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,840
The flower can do that?

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,760
Indeed.

85
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,720
When one picks up the flower,

86
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,470
one must think
about the person one loves

87
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,600
and drip blood on the petals.

88
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,990
As long as the love is true,

89
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,470
one may obtain the flower.

90
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,760
Once it's chosen a master,

91
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,230
it will never wither

92
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,840
and will protect its master.

93
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,430
Give it a try.

94
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,990
We'll see who it chooses.

95
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,230
Who would've thought?

96
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,200
I am the destined one.

97
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,520
I finally understand
how you feel about him.

98
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,790
I presume

99
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,200
you're not going to consume this herb?

100
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,430
Never.

101
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,910
What a shame.

102
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,790
It's not a shame.

103
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,280
This is proof of my love for San.

104
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,040
I'll cherish it forever.

105
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,080
It's nothing but a legend.

106
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,720
It proves nothing.

107
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,040
All the fancy talk about destiny

108
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,640
is only a fairy tale.

109
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,790
So, you can eat it.

110
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,040
Erming,

111
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,310
why don't you try eating it?

112
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,840
Give me the bracelet.

113
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,040
I'm not mad anymore.

114
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,840
You got so worried about him.

115
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,350
Why are you letting him
off the hook so soon?

116
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,760
I couldn't sleep well
because of that thing.

117
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,720
It was shining and shivering.

118
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,670
How annoying!

119
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,200
Take it.

120
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,790
This was a reminder.

121
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,430
He's learned his mistake.

122
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,990
I forgive him.

123
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,870
Where are you going?

124
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,670
I'll be training at the mixed zone.

125
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,150
Yearning Heartbroken Red
is the greatest of all flowers.

126
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,200
It can divert

127
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,640
the plant soul beasts
near the Amethyst Radish.

128
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,640
You must not go there.

129
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,870
I know.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,470
There are many powerful soul beasts.

131
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,110
The Martial Soul Hall
is lurking around.

132
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,720
But I need the Amethyst Radish.

133
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,230
And it's in the mixed zone.

134
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,350
Don't worry.

135
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,550
I can take care of myself.

136
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:21,840
Come on.

137
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,470
Go up.

138
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,640
Plant your feet.

139
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,200
As a Controller Branch Soul Master,

140
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,310
the best weapon

141
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,960
is yourself.

142
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,400
This waterfall serves
as a forge hammer.

143
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,200
It forges your body.

144
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,870
(Yin, I'm up here!)

145
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,060
(Young Tang Hao)

146
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,260
(Yin)

147
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,070
(San,)

148
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,910
(of course I know)

149
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,790
(you're eager to see Wu again.)

150
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,910
(However,)

151
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,880
(if you don't become
strong enough to protect her,)

152
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,830
(you will regret it forever.)

153
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,520
Go up there.

154
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,070
Use it to refine
your Chaos Cloak Hammer.

155
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,400
This wooden hammer is too light.

156
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,830
With the buoyancy of the water

157
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,480
and the downward thrust,

158
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,000
the resistance is immense.

159
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,710
It's impossible to control.

160
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:26,950

Take a break if you're tired.

210
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,430
Come here.

211
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,280
Show me your hand.

212
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,640
Your internal injury hasn't healed yet.

213
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,520
Don't drink.

214
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,160
You're not fully healed either.

215
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,120
Are you on my level?

216
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,910
When we both get well,

217
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,590
we'll drink heartily together.

218
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,000
I never thought

219
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,310
I could spend time with you this way.

220
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,760
It feels

221
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,400
quite nice.

222
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,040
Tell me something.

223
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,880
So,

224
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,910
is the girl still mad at you?

225
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,430
I can sense her again.

226
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,520
I guess she's not mad at me anymore.

227
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,910
You know what?

228
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,000
Remember what she cares about.

229
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,760
Do not make the same mistake twice.

230
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,550
I'm speaking from experience.

231
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,070
Father.

232
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,520
Was Mother mad at you too?

233
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,070
This isn't about me.

234
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,000
I'd never do anything to upset her.

235
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,830
I've never seen her.

236
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,520
I don't know what she looks like.

237
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,670
Father.

238
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Tell me what she's like.

239
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,190
Your mother is gentle

240
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,480
and kind.

241
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,830
You share a lot of her virtues.

242
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,790
Including the Blue Silver Weed
martial soul.

243
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,310
Remember,

244
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,640
your mother loves you.

245
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,710
Mum...

246
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,880
Mother.

247
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,720
(Yin,)

248
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,440
(am I being too harsh on the kid?)

249
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,920
(He is still just a child.)

250
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,540
(Zhu Zhuyun)

251
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,280
(Dai Weisi)

252
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,000
It's here.

253
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,550
Sister.

254
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,630
We were born into the royal family.

255
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,550
It's either you or me.
Such is the family rule.

256
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,720
No need to be sad.

257
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,760
You are right.

258
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,390
Had we not won

259
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,870
the Soul Master Tournament,

260
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,040
we would've been executed by now.

261
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,960
To ensure the royal family
stay in power,

262
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,200
we are destined

263
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,720
to become each other's enemies.

264
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,960
Does that warrant a death sentence?

265
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,680
You came carrying the poisoned wine.

266
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,870
Do not hesitate.

267
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,480
Crown Prince, it's time.

268
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,440
You've been wandering about the world.

269
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,200
I never thought you'd surpass me.

270
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,110
Stability for the royal family
is the top priority.

271
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,390
As the Crown Prince,

272
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,350
the fate of the nation is your duty.

273
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,280
I hope you live up

274
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,630
to His Majesty's expectations.

275
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,280
I will.

276
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,000
Dismissed.

277
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

278
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,870
Who is it?

279
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,390
It's nothing.

280
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,040
Zhuqing,

281
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,720
this is not a choice.

282
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,390
It's His Majesty's will.

283
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,520
Even if they are our family,

284
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,960
they must be eliminated.

285
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,870
His Majesty has eyes
and ears everywhere.

286
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,680
This palace is a prison.

287
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,720
Zhuqing, I understand
how you feel about this.

288
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,830
I'll make sure the job is done.

289
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,390
My brother and your sister

290
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,680
are going to live.

291
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,040
Don't you know
you can be executed for this?

292
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,920
If anyone finds out,

293
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
we are all doomed.

294
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,630
From now on,

295
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,590
you are normal peasants.

296
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,110
If you are concerned about our safety,

297
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,150
you should go far away.

298
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,680
I am grateful.

299
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,790
Take care.

300
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,040
His Majesty will find out soon.

301
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:16,720
Relax.

302
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,350
My contact will pick them up.

303
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,310
They will be outside Star Luo
by they time they are found.

304
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,720
You committed treason for me
as soon as you returned to the palace.

305
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,110
I didn't do it for you.

306
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,480
We did it together

307
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,960
and made it work.

308
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,630
So, this is the Domain?

309
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,280
I can sense a powerful aura

310
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,200
suppressing me.

311
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,830
Suppressing the opponents

312
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,830
is only a part of its power.

313
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,790
Its wonders

314
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,830
can only be experienced

315
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,720
once you have it.

316
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,680
How do I obtain

317
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,150
a Domain as powerful as yours?

318
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,550
Must I go to that place?

319
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,520
The path is perilous.

320
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,830
The odds are against you.

321
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,000
You might never come back alive.

322
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,350
I want to master
the power of the Domain.

323
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,200
Please grant me permission
for this journey.

324
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,000
Are you certain about this?

325
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,150
Unless I make a breakthrough,

326
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,590
Tang San will catch up to my level.

327
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,990
For the Martial Soul Hall,
I will take the risks.

328
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,830
You've practiced our teachings.

329
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,520
You are already remarkable.

330
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,110
If your journey results in your death,

331
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,280
it will be a great loss for me.

332
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,720
I have an idea.

333
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,680
Yan, Xieyue, and you

334
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,630
may train in Death Canyon.

335
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,760
Teacher,

336
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,760
the canyon is full of dangers,

337
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,920
but the elites
of the Martial Soul Hall overlook it.

338
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,790
It's not the perfect training ground.

339
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The real training

340
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,920
requires a near-death experience.

341
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,440
Such experience
will unleash my full potential.

342
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,070
Therefore, I must go to reforge myself.

343
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,150
I can never let Tang San surpass me.

344
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,040
It seems you still dwell on your defeat

345
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,350
at the Soul Master Tournament.

346
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,760
I would've failed your teachings

347
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,760
if I'd forgotten my defeat and shame.

348
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,720
Very well.

349
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,350
I expected as much
from my hand-picked student.

350
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,350
Come closer.

351
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Come back alive.

352
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,960
That is your mission

353
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,200
and my request.

354
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:54,960
I will.

355
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,680
Absorb this before you go.

356
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,870
Teacher, I can't accept
such a precious gift.

357
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,310
You are worthy.

358
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,150
This skull is

359
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,390
just as great as the one Tang San won.

360
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,150
Take it.

361
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,480
Hu Liena, remember this.

362
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
You are a student of me, Bi Bi Dong.

363
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,200
The world is your horizon.

364
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,200
Do not be obsessed with one foe.

365
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,550
You should

366
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,310
forget about Tang San.

367
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,590
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

368
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,150
Your seal can be undone now.

369
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,390
Returning to the source
and cultivating soul power.

370
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,040
Only the Haotian Clan
knows this technique.

371
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,350
The seal suppresses your soul power.

372
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,760
The perfect time to use it

373
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,920
is when your soul power

374
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,150
is at level 40 to 50.

375
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,590
Father,

376
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,830
you thought of everything.

377
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,040
You've reached the bottleneck
of level 50.

378
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,720
It's time you obtain

379
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,920
your fifth soul ring.

380
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,480
My own soul ring?

381
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,520
I wasn't going

382
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,630
to let you obtain
the soul ring so soon.

383
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,310
However, your mental strength

384
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
is already strong enough.

385
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,550
You and the ring can't wait any longer.

386
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,760
Perhaps

387
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,390
this is your fate.

388
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,790
You found me a suitable soul beast?

389
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,920
Sometimes, killing is not required

390
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,830
to get a soul ring.

391
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,480
Come, sit down.

392
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,200
Come on.

393
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,200
Unleash the martial soul
of the Blue Silver Weed.

394
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,790
Feel it with your heart.

395
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,110
(Was it you?)

396
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,310
A familiar presence.

397
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,920
Who are you?

398
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,040
How did you enter my Spirit Sea?

399
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,110
Is it you?

400
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,760
It really is you!

401
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,150
You have finally returned.

402
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,870
Please come closer.

403
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,920
Will you?

404
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,150
Go, my son.

405
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,760
I'll wait here.

406
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,480
Thanks.

407
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,760
I'll get it from you next time.

408
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,960
(The Martial Soul Hall.)

409
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,680
(You're finally here, )

410
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,440
(my king.)

411
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,040
Who are you?

412
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,440
Who is talking?

413
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,680
My king, I am right here.

414
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,280
Who are you?

415
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,210
Why are you calling me a king?

416
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,200
Because the blood flowing in you

417
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,590
is even more noble than mine.

418
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,200
If I am the king
of all Blue Silver Weeds,

419
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,550
then

420
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,440
you are the emperor among us all.

421
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,440
You are mistaken.

422
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,110
I am no emperor.

423
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,960
I am only a soul master with the martial soul
of a Blue Silver Weed.

424
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,200
I am not mistaken.

425
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,280
The purest blood of Blue Silver Emperor
flows in you.

426
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,110
Your martial soul is actually
the Blue Silver Emperor.

427
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,240
All Blue Silver Weeds
are your subjects.

428
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,240
Haven't you felt their beckoning?

429
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,240
Blue Silver Emperor?

430
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,550
(I inherited my mother's martial soul.)

431
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,350
(It's the Blue Silver Emperor.)

432
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,040
The bloodline lives on.

433
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,240
You are the only one in this world

434
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,280
with the blood
of the Blue Silver Emperor.

435
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,590
But my Blue Silver Weed

436
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,790
has always been weak.

437
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,000
I am to be blamed for that.

438
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,280
Your bloodline

439
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,150
was not awakened.

440
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,000
Hence, you couldn't feel its power.

441
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,840
My noble king,

442
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,150
aren't you here

443
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,750
to let me awaken this power

444
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,880
inside you?

445
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,110
Do you mean

446
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,630
my martial soul can be
awakened a second time?

447
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,520
More precisely speaking,
it will be its true awakening.

448
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,520
On this continent,

449
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,230
no other Blue Silver Weed has lived

450
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,880
longer than me, except you.

451
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,630
Therefore,

452
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,800
only I can awaken your martial soul.

453
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,000
I've been waiting

454
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,550
for your arrival.

455
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,960
You're the oldest
Blue Silver Weed alive.

456
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,480
You must know my mother.

457
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,320
I inherited her martial soul.

458
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,480
Did you know her?

459
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,000
Sir,

460
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,670
this rabbit is only 1000 years old.

461
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,510
It has no intelligence.
It can't be our guide.

462
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,150
Seize it.

463
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,880
Extra meat for our brothers.

464
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,590
Thank you, sir.

465
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,840
So, can a soul beast
that is ten thousand years old

466
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,480
turn invisible?

467
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,910
All the soul masters
the Supreme Pontiff sent

468
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,360
have found nothing.

469
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,320
Sir, your martial soul is a hyena.

470
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,960
Its sense of smell is peerless.

471
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,960
If that soul beast is hiding here,

472
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,590
we can track it down.

473
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,480
Indeed.

474
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,070
Once we catch that rabbit,

475
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,520
I'll share the reward

476
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,440
with our brothers.

477
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,000
Much appreciated.

478
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,590
A high-level soft-boned rabbit is here.

479
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,040
This way!

480
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,520
(It seems they are here for me.)

481
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,720
I am only familiar with the presence
of the Blue Silver Emperor.

482
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,040
I don't know your mother.

483
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,800
When the last
Blue Silver Emperor perished,

484
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,840
the aura vanished as well.

485
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,520
My king,

486
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,630
sorry to disappoint you.

487
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,800
No.

488
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,840
Not your fault.

489
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,520
You are here.

490
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,230
It means the emperor's bloodline lives.

491
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,840
We finally have

492
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,440
a new emperor.

493
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,400
In that case,

494
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,960
I shall commence the true awakening.

495
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,000
What do I need to do?

496
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,270
Nothing at all,

497
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,320
my king.

498
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,920
Please accept

499
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,670
our worship.

500
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,960
(San.)

501
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,440
Mother.

502
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,150
Is it really you,

503
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,400
Mother?

504
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,000
Will you stay

505
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,000
and keep me company?

506
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,750
Sorry, San.

507
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,360
Mother.

508
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,440
