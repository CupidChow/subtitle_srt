=The Land of Warriors=

18
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,340
=Episode 29=

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,029
It's vastly different.

21
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,279
Our clan's top-notch secret weapon

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,660
can threaten the life
of a Grand Soul Master.

23
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,469
Once you craft it,

24
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,330
you'll be pioneering the forging world.

25
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,149
Here's a part of the blueprint

26
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,279
for the top-notch secret weapon,
the Storm Pear Blossom Needles.

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,980
Take your time to look at it thoroughly.

28
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,380
(Storm Pear Blossom Needles)

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,629
Si Long,

30
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,180
take them to rest.

31
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,109
We still want to explore the auction.

32
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,020
I wonder if you...

33
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,589
It will be available tomorrow night.

34
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:06,879
Titan,

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,679
aren't you familiar with it?

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,290
You take them there tomorrow.

37
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,679
Master.

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,890
Please don't bother me.

39
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,450
Young Master,

40
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,199
This Lou Gao

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,879
has his own plans.

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,989
Showing him a portion of the blueprint

43
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,279
neither discourages his enthusiasm

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,679
nor risks leaking it.

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,149
It would only leave him wanting more.

46
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,290
It's fine.

47
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,029
After he investigates the blueprint,

48
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,060
he'll change his perceptions
towards the Tang Clan.

49
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,620
By then, I doubt he won't
think of running off.

50
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,799
Moreover, I believe,

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,469
with his forging skills,

52
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,660
he'll be a great asset
to the Tang Clan in the future.

53
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,730
Mr. Si Long,

54
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,469
congratulations!

55
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,180
Don't joke around with me.

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,399
Our president must've gone amiss.

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,879
I'll give him some advice tonight.

58
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,020
He won't.

59
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,279
A blacksmith master
needs to possess skills,

60
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,620
and the most important thing
is his great insight.

61
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,149
Once Lou Gao investigated my blueprint,

62
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,679
he'll discover the potential
of the Tang Clan.

63
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,580
Lou Gao has been focused
solely on forging, and nothing else.

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,679
For years,

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,839
the affairs in the Blacksmiths Guild
have been handled by you.

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,839
This time, it's perfect
for you to help out.

67
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,940
(Purchase List)

68
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,879
(50 jin of tungsten steel, 10 tons
of refined iron, 300 jin of pure silver)

69
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,149
Vice President Titan,

70
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,330
is this real?

71
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,279
Ten tons of refined iron?

72
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,989
I've never seen anyone buy
that much refined iron at once.

73
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,140
Alright,

74
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,180
we'll purchase it at full price.

75
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,890
But we hope you can gather

76
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,730
all the required metals for us quickly.

77
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,770
No problem.

78
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,549
You traveled from afar,

79
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,799
let me treat you to a meal.

80
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,679
I have a group of friend

81
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,629
who has just checked in
at the Tie's Inn.

82
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,989
Why don't we go and meet them together?

83
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,589
Sure.

84
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,149
This way, please.

85
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,589
Alright.

86
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,220
Let's go.

87
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,180
Boss,

88
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,879
where can I find
those high-paying orders

89
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,810
out of town that you just mentioned?

90
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,450
My brother is also a blacksmith

91
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,980
and wants to earn some money.

92
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,660
Fatty.

93
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,850
San.

94
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,719
Grand Master Si Long,

95
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,770
please come in.

96
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,069
Senior Si Long,

97
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,239
this is Ma Hongjun,

98
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,450
one of my friends.

99
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,399
Fatty.

100
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,410
He's Senior Si Long.

101
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,879
Gather everyone downstairs.

102
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,239
We'll get a private room for dinner.

103
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,770
Senior Si Long is treating us.

104
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,620
Are we having the usual spot?

105
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,239
Um...

106
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,589
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,949
Grand Master Si Long,

108
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,239
that room has already
been occupied today.

109
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,980
But, the room is already reserved
long-term by the Blacksmiths Guild

110
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,719
for hosting

111
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,140
important guests.

112
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,620
I know,

113
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,290
but...

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,770
But what?

115
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,330
It's all because the room

116
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,500
has been reserved by me.

117
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,810
Myles,

118
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,220
what do you mean?

119
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,759
Grand Master Si Long

120
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,799
is a Grand Master Blacksmith.

121
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,509
Do you understand what being

122
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,180
a Grand Master Blacksmith means?

123
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,180
It's still just a blacksmith.

124
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,810
Don't grate on my ears!

125
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,279
I'm famous

126
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,410
for being reasonable.

127
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,069
As long as you convince Lou Gao

128
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,069
to merge the Blacksmiths Guild

129
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,359
into the Martial Soul Hall,

130
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,810
I'll make an exception

131
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,399
and allow you to use one of the rooms.

132
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,500
Myles,

133
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,180
don't forget.

134
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,930
This is Gengxin City,

135
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,770
the Capital of Metal.

136
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,100
Only blacksmiths are
the genuine masters here.

137
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,290
Yes.

138
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,629
But, even the lord of Gengxin City

139
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,810
has to bow to me.

140
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,370
You...

141
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,450
Get out of here!

142
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,330
(It seems that Myles
doesn't seem friendly.)

143
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,799
Sir,

144
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,839
that's them

145
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,290
who badmouthed the
Martial Soul Hall on the streets.

146
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,140
Senior Si Long,

147
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,799
are these ladies

148
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,700
coming along with you?

149
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,220
What are they for?

150
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,140
For you a blacksmith?

151
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,589
No way!

152
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,700
I can't stand this anymore.

153
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,319
Today,

154
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,239
you ladies come home with me.

155
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,580
Let me offer some advice for you.

156
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,069
I've tried so hard.

157
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,980
How come I have no killing power at all?

158
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,250
I can't control my body anymore.

159
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,890
Stop embarrassing yourself here!

160
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,540
It's you again.

161
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,949
Aren't you the leader of the
Tribe of Strength, Titan?

162
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,100
Yes, I am.

163
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,199
If you want to oppose
against the Blacksmith Guild

164
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,799
and the Tribe of Strength,

165
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,770
I, Titan will accompany you for that.

166
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,679
Yes, it's me again.

167
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,759
Any opinion?

168
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,509
You're not a blacksmith.

169
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,429
Why are you so stubborn?

170
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,429
Aren't you afraid

171
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,799
that the Martial Soul Hall

172
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,580
will ruin the Tribe of Strength?

173
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,069
(This Myles is far too arrogant.)

174
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,250
(I wish I could throw him down
with the Eight Flinging.)

175
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,730
(Don't rush!)

176
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,980
(It's not time to deal with him yet.)

177
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,740
Elder Token!

178
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,650
Greetings, Elder!

179
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,650
Greetings, Elder!

180
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,180
We had no idea the Elder was here.

181
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,410
Please forgive us.

182
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,410
Please forgive us.

183
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,100
We'll discuss your punishment later.

184
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,189
Get out of here by rolling!

185
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,100
Understood!

186
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,060
Wait!

187
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,330
Are you deaf?

188
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,690
The Elder said get
out of here by rolling!

189
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,980
Understood.

190
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,530
What are you waiting for?

191
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,610
Don't you know how to do it?

192
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,100
Shall I teach you?

193
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,879
Elder, they are newcomers.

194
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,389
They're just too inexperienced.

195
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:28,879
No worries.

196
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,780
Let me be their example!

197
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,140
Get down!

198
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,900
Please guide us!

199
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,180
Let's go.

200
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,020
Let's go.

201
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,780
Carry on.

202
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,250
(What a guy who changes
with the wind!)

203
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,530
(No worries.)

204
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,570
(I'll make them pay in the future.)

205
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,029
Alright.

206
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,940
It's just a farce!

207
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,220
Si Long,

208
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,439
hurry and take us to eat.

209
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,860
Everyone is hungry now.

210
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,020
Wait a moment.

211
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,690
You guys

212
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,820
are from the Martial Soul Hall?

213
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,780
Senior Si Long,

214
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,330
let's eat first.

215
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,250
This,

216
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,020
I'll explain to you later.

217
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:29,759
Sir,

218
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,980
do we still need to roll ourselves?

219
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,639
Hold on, when did our Martial Soul Hall

220
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,559
have such a young Elder?

221
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,410
Is it possible?

222
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,060
I really don't know.

223
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,780
Sir,

224
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,839
do you think that the guy
is messing with us?

225
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,650
Could that token be fake?

226
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,149
Wait.

227
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,820
Do you think I'm so dumb

228
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,100
that I can't tell the difference
between a fake and a real token?

229
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,180
I dare not.

230
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,229
But, if the token is real,

231
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,989
and if Her Holiness did send
the Elder here to Gengxin City,

232
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,020
why didn't she inform you in advance?

233
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,919
Plus, he is mingling
with the Tribe of Strength

234
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,919
and the Blacksmith Guild.

235
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,490
It just doesn't make sense.

236
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,450
The token may be real,

237
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,370
but the person might not be.

238
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,349
Let's return

239
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,389
and draft a letter to Her Holiness.

240
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,599
We'll know whether he's real or fake

241
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,989
once we ask.

242
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,380
(Tie's Inn)

243
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,570
So, you're the son
of Grand Haotian Master.

244
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,799
I apologize for my disrespect earlier.

245
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,639
Senior Si Long,

246
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,820
there's no need for such formalities.

247
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,029
I only said that

248
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,290
to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.

249
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,900
Kid, don't worry.

250
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,060
We have no ties
to the Martial Soul Hall.

251
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,250
If there's any connection to say,

252
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,980
it's only hostility.

253
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,220
San,

254
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,389
why didn't you

255
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,980
teach those useless guys
a lesson just now?

256
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,029
That Myles was so rampant!

257
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,149
We should teach them
an unforgettable lesson.

258
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,719
Fatty,

259
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,060
your brain is not functioning again.

260
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,879
We haven't even started
the initial plan yet,

261
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,479
how could we go
against the locals openly?

262
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,269
That Myles would probably
pinpoint the blame

263
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,519
on the Blacksmith Guild.

264
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,450
By then, Si Long and the others
would get into big trouble.

265
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,599
Ao,

266
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,940
what's there to fear
as San has the Elder Token?

267
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,189
After all, I'm not the genuine
Elder of the Martial Soul Hall.

268
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,389
That Myles will definitely try

269
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,519
every way possible

270
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,860
to figure out who I am.

271
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,189
So, for now, what we need to do

272
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,149
is to get our plan done here quickly

273
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,389
and leave as soon as possible.

274
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,530
So, we're just letting
Myles off like that?

275
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,989
How is that possible?

276
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,820
Don't you know San yet?

277
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,519
So, San,

278
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,519
do you

279
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,719
already have a plan

280
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,180
to handle that Myles?

281
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,530
Don't act rashly.

282
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,450
Senior Si Long,

283
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,559
can you

284
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,109
tell us about the connection
between the Blacksmith Guild

285
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,839
and the Martial Soul Hall?

286
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,180
They're incompatible
just like the water and fire.

287
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,740
Uncle Titan knows this well.

288
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,719
Back then,

289
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,639
Myles brought people
and created chaos for us.

290
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,799
Although he didn't succeed,

291
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,140
a grudge was formed.

292
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,140
After that,

293
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,919
he repeatedly brought
the Martial Soul Hall people

294
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,349
to oppress the Blacksmith Guild,

295
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,980
making trouble for us everywhere.

296
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,949
Soon after,

297
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,940
blacksmiths in the city
began disappearing.

298
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,940
Everyone was terrified,

299
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,530
no one dared leave their homes.

300
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,029
So, you suspect

301
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,919
that the Martial Soul Hall is behind
the disappearance of blacksmiths?

302
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,490
I'm certain it's them.

303
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,650
After many blacksmiths disappeared,

304
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,149
someone spotted

305
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,109
the people from the Martial Soul Hall

306
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,980
sneakily transporting weapons
out of the city at night.

307
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,980
Other than the missing blacksmiths,

308
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,330
who else could be
forging weapons for them?

309
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,029
Did Lou not take action?

310
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,140
Of course, he did.

311
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,759
Master led us from the Blacksmith Guild

312
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,330
to confront the Martial Soul Hall
for the missing people.

313
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,029
But, the eyewitness

314
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,719
was too scared to testify.

315
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,149
Without evidence,

316
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,759
we could not...

317
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,330
Why do you need evidence?

318
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,229
Just break in and find the people!

319
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,530
Uncle Titan,

320
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,759
you should know our situation better.

321
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,690
Although our master and the rest of us

322
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,349
are Great Soul Master and Soul Saint,

323
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,439
we've always

324
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,229
focused on forging.

325
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,740
If it comes to fighting,

326
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,740
we may not be their match.

327
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,140
We also don't dare

328
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,490
spread this news lightly.

329
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,860
Otherwise,

330
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,180
it would only make it harder to approach
Myles and his people in the future.

331
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,879
(No wonder we hardly see)

332
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,250
(any strong local men
since entering the city.)

333
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,370
(The Martial Soul Hall
is secretly producing weapons.)

334
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,650
(Bi Bi Dong must be
plotting something else.)

335
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,439
When I first arrived in Gengxin City,

336
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,029
I sensed something was amiss.

337
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,980
That's why I wanted
to learn more about the situation.

338
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,799
The disappearance of blacksmiths

339
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,180
is something we can't ignore.

340
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,370
But, we can't alert the enemy either.

341
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,900
So, you're saying

342
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,020
you want to help us find
the missing blacksmiths?

343
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,100
We need

344
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,220
to investigate further first.

345
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,349
For now, you just focus
on helping us to locate

346
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,109
the ores and metals we need.

347
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,229
Also, please arrange for us

348
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,940
to attend tomorrow's auction.

349
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,450
Got it. Leave it to me.

350
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,439
(Tie's Inn)

351
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,949
Ao and Si Long are busy
checking the purchase list.

352
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,389
I believe that the Blacksmith Guild

353
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,109
can quickly gather everything we need.

354
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,220
Indeed.

355
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,989
San,

356
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,639
when do you plan to take action

357
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,100
against the Martial Soul Hall?

358
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,940
A dark and stormy night

359
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,220
is just perfect for action.

360
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,439
I love taking action at night.

361
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,559
We'll take action
after tomorrow night's auction.

362
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,530
Great!

363
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,519
It's been a while
since I've performed myself.

364
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,599
Elder Titan,

365
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,599
you're the vice president
of the Blacksmith Guild.

366
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,519
If you fight against
the Martial Soul Hall,

367
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,599
it might cause trouble
to the Blacksmith Guild.

368
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,140
We need to take action discreetly.

369
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,690
Just me,

370
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,599
Fatty,

371
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,439
and Ao

372
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,799
will be enough.

373
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,109
That's right.

374
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,690
I'll stay back to take care of Wu.

375
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,740
Good.

376
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,450
Cousin San, what about me?

377
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,149
Do you assign a task for me?

378
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,220
Of course.

379
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,650
It's something only you can do.

380
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,439
You will go investigate the
Martial Soul Hall with Fatty tomorrow,

381
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,599
and figure out

382
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,949
what their current situation is,

383
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,519
ensuring that our plan

384
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,940
goes smoothly.

385
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,570
Master,

386
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,919
as per your instructions,

387
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,639
I've gathered part of the
Martial Soul Hall's forces

388
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,639
into a troop

389
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,180
and awaited your next orders.

390
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,610
Great!

391
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,140
You're fully in charge
of this operation.

392
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,330
Please work carefully with her.

393
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,109
I trust

394
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,980
that you won't disappoint me.

395
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,020
I will do my utmost.

396
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,490
In these few days,

397
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,100
I'll go into a crucial
stage of my cultivation.

398
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,599
Unless it's urgent,

399
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,140
don't disturb me.

400
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,490
Understood.

401
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,599
The Holy Lady sent a message.

402
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,610
The soul masters have gathered.

403
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,740
Your Highness, please get
ready for the next step.

404
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,029
How much longer does he have?

405
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,919
Your Highness,

406
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,250
the poison has penetrated
into His Majesty's bone.

407
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,940
He doesn't have long.

408
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,530
I can't waste more time on Xue Beng.

409
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,860
Has the news been released?

410
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,980
Yes.

411
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,820
Great!

412
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,530
If you keep pushing yourself like this,

413
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,940
your back injury won't heal.

414
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,650
It's just a small injury.

415
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,370
It's nothing compared to Father's life.

416
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,530
Has Tang San finished
developing the antidote?

417
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,799
I've checked the situation.

418
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,349
The little devils have left the city.

419
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,229
Before leaving, he made arrangements

420
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,780
for reliable people to continue
developing the antidote.

421
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,780
I'm just afraid Father
can't wait until it's ready.

422
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,229
Send someone to the palace
to find more ways,

423
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,060
and see if there's any other news.

424
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,679
Here, take a look.

425
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,919
High-quality ores!

426
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,759
Abundant supply!

427
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,029
Excellent quality at a fair price!

428
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,570
No deceit, guaranteed for everyone!

429
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,309
This is the largest ore trading market

430
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,860
in Gengxin City.

431
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,309
The ores here

432
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,309
haven't been appraised
by the Blacksmith Guild,

433
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,860
so the prices are cheaper,

434
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,250
but it's also easier to get scammed.

435
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,639
In my opinion,

436
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,439
it's better to go to
the Blacksmith Guild's trading hall

437
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,989
to buy ores that have
already been appraised.

438
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,149
That's more reliable.

439
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,519
Since Ao is there
sorting the ore purchases,

440
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,839
both of you can pick it together.

441
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,639
Thank you, Senior Si Long,
for considering this for us.

442
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,330
But, the appraised ores
are far too expensive.

443
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,639
As the Tang Clan's treasurer,

444
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,439
I must save wherever I can for San.

445
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,450
But,

446
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,949
please allow me to be frank,

447
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,309
even experts can sometimes

448
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,759
misjudge the ores here.

449
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,439
Although I can help you inspect them,

450
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,439
I can't guarantee

451
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,439
you'll be fully satisfied.

452
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,650
Take a look.

453
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,690
Let's go over there and check it out.

454
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,780
I want this one.

455
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,820
Boss.

456
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,180
1,000 gold soul coins.

457
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,250
Cut it for me.

458
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,490
Hold on.

459
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,220
You need to cut from this spot for me.

460
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,740
Sure.

461
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,389
Slice the stone,

462
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,389
and fortune rise.

463
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:47,949
Good!

464
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,180
Rise!

465
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,559
Rise!

466
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,879
Rise!

467
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,269
Rise!

468
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,839
Rise!

469
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,410
Rise!

470
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,149
One cut to heaven,

471
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,530
one to hell!

472
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,940
You will have it next time!

473
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,740
Boss,

474
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,309
your stone...

475
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,250
Sigh.

476
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,250
What a bad luck!

477
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,330
It's a dud!

478
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,309
That's

479
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,309
how it is here.

480
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,069
If it's a correct one,

481
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,479
its value multiple dozen times.

482
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,269
If it's a miss,

483
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,860
it's not worth a single copper coin.

484
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,559
Boss,

485
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,799
this stone is useless now.

486
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,599
Can I take it away?

487
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,639
Who says it's useless?

488
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,559
If the buyer doesn't want it,

489
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,949
the stone reverts to me.

490
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,719
If you want it,

491
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,759
you've got to pay.

492
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,690
Miss Ning,

493
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,330
this stone is nothing but a dud.

494
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,780
Oh, so this young lady
is a friend of Mr. Si Long.

495
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,989
Mr. Si Long,

496
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,439
I run a small business.

497
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,250
If this young lady truly likes it,

498
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,919
she can have it
with just one gold soul coin.

499
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,879
One gold soul coin?

500
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,740
Deal!

501
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,180
Thank you, young lady.

502
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,799
Miss Ning,

503
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,919
if you need this kind
of discarded raw stone,

504
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,309
I can provide it to you for free.

505
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,250
That vendor just wanted to rip you off.

506
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,820
Senior Si Long, don't worry.

507
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,490
I might have just snagged a great deal.

508
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,450
Why are you smiling?

509
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,490
Look!

510
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,309
It was just a discarded material.

511
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,140
How could you possibly
see what's inside?

512
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,900
A soul master with the
Qibao Amber Pagoda Martial Soul

513
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,919
have an extremely
strong appraisal ability.

514
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,989
Oh, so you have such an ability?

515
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,189
You're practically a born ore appraiser!

516
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,940
No wonder Chief Tang

517
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,020
sent you here to purchase ores.

518
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,389
I should thank the previous buyer.

519
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:41,949
Let's go.

520
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,490
Today, I'm going to stock up
on the clan's treasury!

521
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,900
These armors were shipped
out from Gengxin City.

522
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,610
(They're heading toward the
direction of Tiandou City)

523
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,020
It seems Bi Bi Dong is preparing
to take action against Tiandou.

524
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,290
We need to go back instantly.

525
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,940
Hurry up!

526
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,060
Hurry up!

527
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,570
Stay in line!

528
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,220
Go!

529
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,410
Go!

530
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,060
Hurry up!

531
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,389
The weapons and armor here

532
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,330
are exactly the same as those in the
Martial Soul Hall of Xingluo City.

533
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,799
It seems that Myles
has made a lot of money.

534
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,389
Hurry up!

535
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,450
Be quicker!

536
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,650
Hurry up!

537
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,220
Look!

538
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,820
Help me!

539
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,020
Uncle,

540
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,900
please save me!

541
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,490
Who's there?

542
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,060
On alert!

543
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,439
Something's wrong!

544
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,389
Someone's in the back courtyard!

545
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,330
Let's go!

546
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,519
Take him away!

547
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,639
I'll go distract them.

548
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,229
Xiang.

549
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,140
Trust me.

550
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,290
Be careful.

551
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,820
Delusion.

552
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,650
Split up and chase them!

553
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,980
Go!

554
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,250
Sir!

555
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,309
Sir!

556
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,679
Those identical women

557
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,370
suddenly disappeared
right before our eyes.

558
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,189
Oh no!

559
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,330
That's a soul skill!

560
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,919
They discovered the bodies
in the back courtyard.

561
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,100
Should we report to the lord?

562
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,780
Quickly move the bodies away

563
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,370
and send more people
to guard the back courtyard.

564
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,940
If anyone leaks today's events,

565
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,989
I'll skin them alive!

566
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,959
Alright! Follow me!

567
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,919
(Tie's Inn)

568
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,570
Thank you for saving me.

569
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,919
It's nothing.

570
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,989
Your wounds have been medicated,

571
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,220
and you'll recover quickly.

572
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,820
How did you end up
at the Martial Soul Hall?

573
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,290
Where are your parents?

574
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,370
My dad is a blacksmith.

575
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,330
He was taken by them to work a year ago.

576
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,679
They saw I could do chores too,

577
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,180
so they took me along

578
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,060
to cook for the blacksmiths.

579
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,370
People there always dying.

580
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,250
My dad was afraid
I wouldn't survive either,

581
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,060
so...

582
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,290
Smith,

583
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,799
you must live

584
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,839
and escape from here.

585
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,900
Run as far as you can, understand?

586
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,599
Dad,

587
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,759
I don't want to leave you.

588
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,389
I don't want to go.

589
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,799
No,

590
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,759
you have to go.

591
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,949
Only by leaving can you survive.

592
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,479
But I don't want to leave...

593
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:37,719
Hurry up!

594
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,269
There's no time!

595
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,290
Hurry up!

596
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:39,879
Father!

597
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,570
What are you doing?

598
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,349
Father!

599
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:42,719
Move aside!

600
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,149
No!

601
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:43,559
Father!

602
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,639
Let me out!

603
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,780
Run faster!

604
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,450
Help!

605
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,029
Hang these two

606
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,410
here tonight

607
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,180
as a warning,

608
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,940
and throw them
into the corpse pile tomorrow.

609
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,220
Kid,

610
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,490
you've been in the
Martial Soul Hall for over a year.

611
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,220
Did you hear anything about their plans?

612
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,650
For example,

613
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,530
what are those armors for?

614
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,109
My dad and the blacksmith uncles said

615
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,820
Her Holiness is
preparing for something big.

616
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,450
A few months ago,

617
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,020
all the weapons and armor
in the warehouse were shipped away.

618
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,389
Not long after, the
soul master who oversees us

619
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,860
were discussing about the
clans being annihilated.

620
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,900
Then,

621
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,479
they received new orders
from Her Holiness.

622
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,949
My dad and the others started

623
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,940
working non-stop again.

624
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,650
Oh, right!

625
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,820
The night before I escaped,

626
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,220
my dad said another batch
of armor was being shipped out.

627
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,309
Her Holiness must be
planning something evil again,

628
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,290
am I right?

629
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,290
Kid,

630
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,980
you're smart.

631
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,490
Your guess is probably correct.

632
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,740
We need to get the plan in Gengxin City
done as soon as possible.

633
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,330
We need to discuss this
with the master and Uncle Ning.

634
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,940
I think

635
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,570
something serious is about to happen.

636
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,309
(Fatty and Xiang saved the little kid.)

637
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,220
(I think they've alerted the enemy.)

638
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,389
(We must be quick and decisive
for tonight's auction.)

639
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,330
(We can't give them
a chance to retaliate.)

640
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,650
(I won't let them get away with this.)

641
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,839
This is the map I sketched

642
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,530
of the Martial Soul Hall
in Gengxin City.

643
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,679
Here's the armory.

644
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,450
This is the back courtyard,

645
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,450
and further back is the forging room.

646
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,559
We broke into the back courtyard today.

647
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,229
They will definitely

648
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,679
strengthen their security here.

649
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,389
When you go to rescue the blacksmiths,

650
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,740
you must be very careful.

651
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,799
No wonder you're
from the Tribe of Agility,

652
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,410
you investigated the place in detail.

653
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,719
It's just

654
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,029
the specialty of our tribe.

655
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,980
It's nothing.

656
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,860
You did great.

657
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,980
With this information,

658
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,690
we can be quick and decisive tonight.

659
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,989
Black iron ore for sale, cheap!

660
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,860
Buy more, get a discount!

661
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,839
Take a look!

662
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,690
Black iron ore for sale, cheap!

663
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,780
Buy more, get a discount!

664
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,490
Good things!

665
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,989
Boss,

666
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,229
if I buy several pieces,
can I get a discount?

667
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,100
Of course!

668
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,490
How many do you want, young lady?

669
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,060
Five pieces.

670
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,860
I want

671
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:15,940
this.

672
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,860
This one,

673
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,180
and also these few.

674
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:20,799
Alright.

675
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,690
The total is five gold soul coins.

676
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,439
Make way!

677
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,250
Step aside!

678
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,149
Give me the protection fee.

679
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:30,949
Sir,

680
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,189
I just paid yesterday.

681
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,029
Yesterday was yesterday.

682
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,029
Today is today.

683
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,100
How outrageous!

684
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,140
This is Xingluo's ore trading market.

685
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,250
What gives the Martial Soul Hall
the authority to charge fees here?

686
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,069
What a coincidence!

687
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,290
How coincidentally!

688
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,690
Are you all here for a stroll?

689
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,250
The talented young elder
didn't come with you?

690
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,020
The elder's friends are my friends.

691
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,570
But I don't think I've met
this elder before.

692
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,719
Do you want to explain?

693
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,020
There's nothing to explain.

694
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,650
But, you should

695
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,919
explain

696
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,229
what qualifies the Martial Soul Hall

697
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,719
to be so over and extort money here.

698
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,780
Misunderstanding!

699
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,020
Hmm,

700
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,570
Grand Master Si Long,

701
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,309
it's all your fault.

702
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,309
You came with this young lady.

703
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,989
Why didn't you introduce her properly?

704
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,140
Half of this street's

705
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,479
management rights

706
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,439
belong to the Martial Soul Hall.

707
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,599
If it weren't for the city lord

708
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,940
personally asking me to help manage it,

709
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,439
who'd want this thankless job?

710
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,140
Am I right?

711
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,250
You tell me, am I right?

712
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,559
Yes.

713
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,290
Sir, you managed here really well.

714
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,389
The security here has improved greatly.

715
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,290
What else?

716
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,229
We...

717
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,439
We pay willingly.

718
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,530
You see?

719
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,879
Don't worry.

720
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,389
If you don't have enough money with you,

721
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,610
you can use
these worthless stones instead.

722
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,900
This useless thing is also fine for me.

723
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,530
I'm just so softhearted
and easy to negotiate with.

724
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,759
Move it!

725
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,530
Hold on!

726
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,650
I already wanted these iron ores.

727
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,559
Are you picking a fight with me?

728
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,570
Business operates on
a first-come, first-served basis.

729
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,479
As the manager here,

730
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,290
you should uphold the rules.

731
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,799
I am the rule.

732
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,570
You...

733
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,269
Even though you're the manager here,

734
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,109
you don't understand ores at all.

735
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,189
Taking this back
would just waste resources.

736
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,100
I...

737
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,180
don't know about ores?

738
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,269
Are you challenging me?

739
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,490
It's just the truth.

740
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,820
You don't believe?

741
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,719
I bet that this is
the most valuable piece

742
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,250
in this entire pile of ore.

743
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,370
Because it contains the iron essence.

744
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,140
Can you pick out something like this?

745
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,719
Although she is young,
she is quite bold.

746
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,599
Today, I'll show you
what I'm capable of.

747
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,740
Which one is the most expensive?

748
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,839
This one, sir.

749
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,479
Open the two of them at once!

750
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,250
Open them!

751
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,389
It's real!

752
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,610
It's real!

753
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,250
How is that possible?

754
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,349
Yeah,

755
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,860
how is this possible?

756
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,679
The one you opened has nothing in it!

757
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,140
That's just my mistake.

758
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,439
You just have good luck today.

759
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,559
But,

760
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,940
there's a win or lose in gambling.

761
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,060
How about this?

762
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,060
We go for another round.

763
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,780
But, we'll have a little extra at stake.

764
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,820
Dare to play?

765
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,250
Why not?

766
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,020
How do you want it to be carried out?

767
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,220
We each pick one ore from this street,

768
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,250
the one we think is most valuable.

769
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,349
Then,

770
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,029
open it up here

771
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,530
and see whose is worth more.

772
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,439
The vendors on this street
are all experts.

773
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,989
They can serve as witnesses.

774
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,109
If you win,

775
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,879
you can take any ore on this street.

776
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,269
If I win,

777
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,919
I will take you away with me

778
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,020
and do what I want.

779
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,740
Fine!

780
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,940
How dare you agree to this!

781
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,060
Let's do it!

782
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,980
But, add one more condition.

783
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,220
If I win,

784
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,370
you can't collect
the protection fees here anymore.

785
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,879
You've already agreed to my terms

786
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,389
so I'll agree with yours.

787
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,570
I'll let you pick first.

788
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,060
Go ahead

789
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,479
and bring me the 'King of Ore'

790
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,180
from this street.

791
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,450
Myles,

792
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,250
you're cheating.

793
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,490
Why am I cheating?

794
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,100
The conditions are clear.

795
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,250
I pick what I think
is the most valuable ore.

796
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,450
What's unfair about that?

797
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,479
Senior Si Long.

798
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,740
That's fine.

799
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,490
He's just using
the rules to his advantage.

800
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,940
The 'King of Ore' here
is the Five Colors Shining Stones.

801
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,250
I guarantee

802
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,490
you won't find

803
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,759
anything rarer

804
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,330
in this market anymore.

805
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,140
Sir.

806
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,140
Here you go.

807
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,450
Take a look.

808
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,180
Truly worthy of the title 'King of Ore'.

809
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,149
Do you like this?

810
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,450
Take it.

811
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,949
We're done here.

812
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,799
Let's go home.

813
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,020
Don't rush off, sir.

814
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,980
It's my turn now.

815
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,799
Ah, you want a sense of ritual?

816
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,860
I understand.

817
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,479
Go ahead,

818
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,220
pick.

819
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,780
I pick...

820
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,410
This one!

821
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,740
Miss Ning,

822
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,679
this isn't the time for jokes!

823
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,610
That's just an ordinary piece of ore.

824
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,559
Let me take you to another place

825
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,980
and pick another one.

826
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,530
No, I choose this one!

827
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,349
My dear Long,

828
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,490
you have no sense at all!

829
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,719
She's doing this on purpose,
with the intention to follow me back.

830
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,180
Stop meddling!

831
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,900
Boss,

832
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,290
please chip off a small piece for me.

833
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,309
Let's make sure he loses
fair and square.

834
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,140
Yes.

835
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,519
Let's follow the procedure.

836
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,330
Chip it off.

837
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:50,639
Young lady,

838
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,900
are you sure you want it
chipped from here?

839
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,639
This is Cold Iron Essence.

840
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,650
What iron essence?

841
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,530
You just simply name it now.

842
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,740
Cold Iron Essence!

843
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,490
It is Cold Iron Essence!

844
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,189
This piece of Cold Iron Essence

845
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,370
was hidden inside the ordinary ore,

846
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,860
making it hard to detect,

847
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,220
Sir,

848
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,330
do you believe me now?

849
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,639
Even if it is an iron essence,

850
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,740
how could a black rock

851
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,940
is worth more than
the Five Colors Shining Stones?

852
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,639
Sir,

853
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,759
of the same weight,

854
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,570
the Cold Iron Essence

855
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,180
is ten times more valuable
than the Five Colors Shining Stones.

856
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,940
This is incredibly rare.

857
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,439
As far as I know,

858
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,599
there're less than five kilograms
of it in Gengxin City.

859
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,349
This piece weighs
several dozen kilograms,

860
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,719
making it worth a fortune.

861
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,570
Well,

862
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,740
thank you for being so humble.

863
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,740
I win.

864
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,229
It's mine.

865
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,309
I'll take it now.

866
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,140
Don't be rushed.

867
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,559
How could you

868
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,029
have such good luck?

869
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,189
I now

870
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,309
suspect you and the vendor

871
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,330
are working together

872
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,759
to scam the customers

873
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,410
and disrupt the market.

874
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,290
So, I'll take this piece back with me

875
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,900
as evidence for further investigation.

876
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,309
And you too.

877
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:34,989
You're a liar!

878
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,060
You have to come with me!

879
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:36,719
Let's go!

880
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,610
Who dares?

881
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,690
We're here on orders
from the elder to collect ores here.

882
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,389
What elder?

883
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,740
The elder from the Martial Soul Hall?

884
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,479
The Martial Soul Hall
has plenty of resources.

885
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,370
Why would they need
something inferior like this?

886
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,530
It seems that you're unaware
of the Martial Soul Hall's rules.

887
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,650
What our Elder

888
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,109
needs every time,

889
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,599
he only needs to send word
to the branch halls

890
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,309
and we'll collect it
before sending it there.

891
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,309
There's no need to pick

892
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,759
piece by piece like you're doing here.

893
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,370
Your branch halls

894
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,719
have been skimming profits

895
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,269
off the ore trade,

896
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,570
and substituting the good ones
with inferior products,

897
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,370
do you think the elders won't notice?

898
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,719
They've turned a blind eye

899
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,879
because of the
Supreme Pontiff's leniency.

900
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,100
But if you insist on doing this,

901
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,189
I might

902
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,900
just expose all the works of darkness.

903
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,900
Fine, you want the ore, right?

904
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,839
Take them with you.

905
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,610
Wait!

906
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,610
One more thing.

907
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,370
Should I demonstrate
how to leave by rolling again?

908
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,060
From now on,

909
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,229
you're not allowed
to bully the vendors here.

910
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,410
Alright, small matter.

911
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,820
And also, no more protection fees!

912
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,140
That's great!

913
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,740
Is this real?

914
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,940
Just admit defeat that you lose the bet.

915
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,780
They have long been the vendors here.

916
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,940
They can all testify to what happened.

917
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,330
I can testify!

918
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,780
Me too!

919
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,940
Me too!

920
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,029
I can also testify!

921
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,650
We all can testify!

922
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,980
Me too!

923
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,479
I can testify!

924
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,740
I can testify!

925
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,410
Me too!

926
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,140
We all can testify!

927
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,740
Let's go.

928
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,349
Thank you, young lady.

929
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,189
Thank you, young lady.

930
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,759
Thank you, young lady.

931
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,980
Thank you, young lady.

932
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,029
Young lady,

933
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,109
these years,

934
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,639
Myles has been oppressing us

935
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,109
here in the ore market.

936
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,949
Yeah!

937
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,740
He's been robbing us blind!

938
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,450
Life has been so hard for us.

939
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,439
You defeated him,

940
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,229
and canceled the protection fees.

941
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,940
How can we ever repay you?

942
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,250
Everyone,

943
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,650
no need to repay me.

944
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,900
We just couldn't stand injustice.

945
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,309
Especially

946
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:21,900
against bullies like Myles!

947
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:22,839
Great!

948
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,029
Well said!

949
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,250
Good!

950
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,229
Young lady, look at my stall here.

951
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,269
You can take any stone for free.

952
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,570
I'll give them to you.

953
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,109
Yes, young lady.

954
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,479
Thank you for helping us
vent our frustration.

955
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,490
Exactly.

956
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,220
It's my fault.

957
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,330
I shouldn't have used
carrots to teach you.

958
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,980
(Why am I always obsessed with eating?)

959
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,820
(It seems we can't use food.)

960
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,610
(Should we change something else?)

961
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,940
(Someone's coming!)

962
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,330
Hey you,

963
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,370
I want all the blueprints.

964
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,149
No problem.

965
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,330
Didn't I already tell you?

966
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,599
Once you return with the Tang Clan,

967
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,269
you will see the rest blueprints.

968
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,980
At that point,
we'll need your expertise.

969
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,799
Kid,

970
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,229
stop lying to me.

971
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,799
I've carefully examined
the blueprints you gave me.

972
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,679
This so-called magical weapon,

973
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,189
its materials are rare,

974
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,109
and the chances of crafting it are slim.

975
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,980
What's the use
of having a good blueprint?

976
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:34,069
You have to make it real
by inventing it.

977
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,559
Otherwise, it's just a waste of paper.

978
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,490
Yeah.

979
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,919
You're right, Elder.

980
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,879
The materials
for the Storm Pear Blossom Needles

981
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,490
are indeed extremely demanding.

982
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,370
But once crafted,

983
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,530
it'll be an unprecedented divine weapon.

984
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,029
The Tang Clan will spare no effort
to help you invent it,

985
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,309
so you can become

986
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,180
a legendary craftsman like no other.

987
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,220
You think I'm a child?

988
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,029
I'm too old

989
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,940
to fall for your empty promises.

990
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,149
San,

991
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,650
we're back.

992
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,820
Master,

993
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,919
Miss Ning won a bet with Myles

994
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,719
over ore appraisal,

995
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,559
and forced him to cancel the protection
fees for the market vendors.

996
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,349
The vendors are absolutely thrilled.

997
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,389
It seems that Myles

998
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,410
suffered a real defeat today.

999
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,740
Rongrong,

1000
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,370
did you find any rare ores?

1001
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,650
I just heard Elder Lou
say materials are scarce.

1002
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,060
I wonder how about
these materials I found.

1003
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,290
Cold Iron Essence!

1004
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,949
It is Cold Iron Essence!

1005
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,530
It's such a large piece!

1006
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,290
How impressive!

1007
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,060
The appraisal skills of the
Qibao Amber Sect are truly exceptional.

1008
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:57,879
Chief,

1009
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,919
I plan to use this Cold Iron Essence

1010
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,309
to craft the Storm Pear Blossom Needles.

1011
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,450
What do you think?

1012
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,410
These materials are just sufficient.

1013
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,410
This Cold Iron Essence is not usable.

1014
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,949
Its hardness is fine,

1015
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,559
but its toughness is too poor.

1016
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,189
If we use it for the mechanisms,

1017
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,490
it would ruin under excessive force.

1018
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,519
What a shame!

1019
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,519
Why can't we craft
the Storm Pear Blossom Needles

1020
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,109
using this Cold Iron Essence?

1021
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,439
How can I ever craft

1022
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,330
the Storm Pear Blossom Needles soon?

1023
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,559
If I can only imagine it
but never craft it,

1024
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,370
I'd rather die.

1025
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,719
Master,

1026
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,519
please don't be like that!

1027
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,269
Let me die!

1028
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:30,759
Elder,

1029
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,820
please calm down.

1030
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,410
Don't be rushed.

1031
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,100
You can make this!

1032
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,189
This is

1033
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,349
an exceptional secret weapon
even more powerful

1034
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,140
than the Storm Pear Blossom Needles.

1035
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,860
And, the Cold Iron Essence

1036
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,919
happens to be

1037
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,530
one of its three core materials.

1038
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,980
Are you insane?

1039
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,919
This is such a top-secret blueprint!

1040
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,069
How could you just
give it to me like this?

1041
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,069
Since you've agreed
to join the Tang Clan,

1042
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,189
and I'm the chief,

1043
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,519
I can't be skimped on this.

1044
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,439
You have such a deep obsession
with crafting weapons.

1045
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,639
I shouldn't just leave you

1046
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,690
and watch you lose yourself to despair.

1047
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,639
I'm insane.

1048
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,229
And you're a fool.

1049
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,949
We're perfect to be in the same clan!

1050
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,599
Chief, don't worry.

1051
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,069
I, Lou Gao, swear

1052
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,799
to craft this ultimate

1053
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,490
weapon for you.

1054
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,250
Sorry to interrupt.

1055
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,389
Actually, I found another material.

1056
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,989
I've never seen it before,

1057
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,479
but I believe

1058
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,189
it's the most valuable

1059
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,290
of all these materials.

1060
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,389
What kind of metal is this?

1061
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,349
It's incredibly tough.

1062
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,349
I've been forging my whole life,

1063
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,650
but I've never encountered
something this strong.

1064
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,639
Even my unbreakable Diamond Chisel

1065
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,980
shattered instantly against it.

1066
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,100
Amazing... Truly amazing.

1067
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,490
But alas,

1068
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,570
my Diamond Chisel is ruined.

1069
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,740
I'll need to find another tool.

1070
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,519
If I'm not mistaken,

1071
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,980
this is the core of the Deep Sea Silver.

1072
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:28,330
It's exactly what's needed
to craft the Storm Pear Blossom Needles.

1073
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,309
The core of the Deep Sea Silver!

1074
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,189
I never thought

1075
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,229
I'd see such a rare material
in my lifetime.

1076
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,690
If I can craft
the Storm Pear Blossom Needles,

1077
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,029
I'll have no regrets in life.

1078
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,570
You will succeed.

1079
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,799
As for the materials you need,

1080
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,029
the Tang Clan will ensure
everything is provided.

1081
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,189
With that promise,

1082
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,570
I'll join the Tang Clan.

1083
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,559
For making these divine secret weapons,

1084
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,389
I won't accept any reward.

1085
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,370
However,

1086
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,940
I have one small request.

1087
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,220
Please go ahead.

1088
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,780
On these legendary crafts,

1089
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,650
aside from the Tang Clan's name,

1090
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,330
I want my name, Lou Gao,
engraved as well.

1091
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,330
No problem.

1092
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,989
In the future, any secret weapon

1093
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,679
with your name on it

1094
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,309
will be the Tang Clan's masterpiece.

1095
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,610
Deal!

1096
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,229
For the Storm Pear Blossom Needles,

1097
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,140
I'll start crafting right away.

1098
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,820
All these...

1099
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,450
Chief,

1100
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,650
it seems we're still
lacking some materials.

1101
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,759
Elder, you're worthy
of being the God Blacksmith.

1102
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,269
You can even determine
the materials needed

1103
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,650
just by looking at the blueprints.

1104
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,479
But besides the materials,

1105
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,719
the blueprints also stated
many intricate aspects.

1106
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,349
You could discuss and study them

1107
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,450
with Elder Titan.

1108
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,269
Today,

1109
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,820
Rongrong and I will head
to the auction place.

1110
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,330
I'm confident
we'll acquire some materials there.

1111
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,290
Alright.

1112
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,479
I need to remind you,

1113
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,799
although the auction is held
by the Blacksmith Guild,

1114
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,559
the prices are fair to everyone,

1115
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,109
so it all depends on
how full your pockets are.

1116
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,389
Thank you for the reminder, Elder.

1117
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,220
By the way,

1118
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,109
I also have a personal favor

1119
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,189
to request.

1120
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,610
