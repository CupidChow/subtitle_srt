=The Land of Warriors=

18
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,300
=Episode 27=

20
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,780
How do you feel now?

21
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,660
Was the young man who beat me Tang San?

22
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,744
It's a misunderstanding.

23
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,450
This is a misunderstanding.

24
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,090
You probably lost your temper

25
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,020
and started it.

26
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,730
And

27
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,020
the chief didn't recognize you,

28
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,220
so he acted in self-defense.

29
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,060
Did I get it right,

30
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,780
Old Goat?

31
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,500
It must be.

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,700
He likes to joke around.

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,780
He's humorous.

34
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,380
Exactly.

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,820
Actually, Tang San is a nice person.

36
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,672
Before you arrive,

37
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,390
Elephant Armored Tribe, the lackey
of Martial Soul Hall, attacked us.

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,100
Chief stepped up
and fought them off.

39
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,490
Yes.

40
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,210
The reason why
he established the Tang Clan

41
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,300
was to unite all of us

42
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,420
and stand against Martial Soul Hall.

43
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,860
He's Master Tang Hao's son.

44
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,730
But don't worry.

45
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,770
He absolutely won't merge
with the Haotian Sect.

46
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,820
The three of you

47
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,980
won't stop calling him a chief

48
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,930
and even said he was Tang Hao's son.

49
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,650
Are you hiding some big plan from me?

50
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,420
Old Goat,

51
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,730
as of now,

52
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,792
Martial Soul Hall is
overwhelmingly powerful.

53
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:49,140
If our tribes stand alone,

54
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,580
we won't survive down the road.

55
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,890
Tang Clan

56
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,930
means a different story to us.

57
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,580
But both of you got off
on the wrong foot.

58
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,210
Says who?

59
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,770
Am I that unreasonable to you?

60
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,330
His father and he

61
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,210
are not the same.

62
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,380
I know the difference.

63
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,420
Besides,

64
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,580
Tang San helped me mature my herb,

65
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,820
and we got to know each other
through a fight.

66
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
I have a good impression of him.

67
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,300
This young man

68
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,210
is ambitious and insightful.

69
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,330
He's capable as well.

70
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,930
So you won't argue over this, will you?

71
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,610
What's there to argue about?

72
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,770
I just want to know how he's doing now.

73
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,512
He got pierced
by the Soul Breaking Spear.

74
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,810
If he doesn't get treatment,
there could be side effects.

75
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,420
Let's go

76
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,330
and check on him.

77
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,100
That young man is more capable
than we thought.

78
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,450
His injury has already
healed on its own.

79
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,420
- Exactly.
- Yes.

80
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,420
It healed on its own?

81
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,050
Exactly.

82
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,930
A young man with only over level 60

83
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,260
can be that amazing?

84
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,700
And all his friends

85
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,890
are also more capable
than we were back then.

86
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,450
Old Goat,

87
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,650
let me tell you a secret.

88
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,980
Tang San has prepared
Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng for you.

89
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:14,770
What?

90
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,260
Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng?

91
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,380
Right.

92
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,140
We wouldn't have to fight
if he had shown that earlier.

93
00:04:21,952 --> 00:04:23,180
He didn't feel the pain,

94
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,820
but I sure did.

95
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,380
Looks like

96
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,290
our four single attribute tribes

97
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,260
are going to reunite.

98
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,940

99
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,210

Why are you nervous?

106
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,580

but also part of my consciousness.

172
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,216
However, my consciousness
isn't strong enough,

173
00:09:45,456 --> 00:09:47,260
so I have to stay in your Spiritual Sea.

174
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,650
Are you saying

175
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,380
that your body is unconscious

00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:52,496

in my Spiritual Sea?

Wu,

178
00:09:55,264 --> 00:09:56,890
if I reach the soul power of nine rings

179
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,648
and return your soul bones
and soul rings to you,

180
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,504
your consciousness will return
to your body

181
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,220
and revive?

182
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,050
No.

183
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,140
You can't risk all your soul power

184
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:07,072
and remove the soul bones to revive me.

185
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,890
That's too dangerous.

186
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,740
I won't agree.

187
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,140
This is just nothing

188
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:15,152

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,260
no matter what the price is,

191
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,650
reviving you

192
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,930
is something I must do.

193
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,410
San,

194
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,860
I'm very satisfied

195
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,860
to be with you here.

196
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,650
I may not

197
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,690
be able to control my own body yet,

198
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,530
but I can talk to you
anytime and anywhere.

199
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,740
From now on, the Spiritual Sea
is a home to me.

200
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,260
Don't think I'm annoying.

201
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,410
How could I ever think that way?

202
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:04,530
I'm more worried you'd think
I talk too much.

203
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,050
During the time you were gone,

204
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,050

I'm Rongrong.

258
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,140
She's Zhuqing.

259
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,620
Don't you recognize us?

260
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,260

she only acts on instinct

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,570

(don't take advantage of me.)

(I'm the big sister here.)

267
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,740
Let me remind you this.

268
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,570
Wu's consciousness is now
in my Spiritual Sea.

269
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,050
We're symbiotic,

270
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:56,810
so she can

00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,620

00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,530
Zhuqing,

273
00:15:00,848 --> 00:15:02,410

274
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,170
just now.

275
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,620
San,

276
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,770
your taste is terrible.

277
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,570
Wu won't tolerate it.

278
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,770
Really?

279
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,100
Look.

280
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,050
I think Wu looks pretty in anything.

281
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,100
Wu,

282
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,020
let's go

283
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,260
and change clothes.

284
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,020
I'll help you.

285
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,650

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,460
All of you

287
00:15:30,592 --> 00:15:31,376
go over there.

288
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:31,890
Come on.

289
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,260
Wait over there.

290
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,140

291
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,020
Come,

292
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,460
Wu.

293
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:37,690
Let's go.

294
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,890
Stop watching her.

295
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,290
Ao,

296
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,100
is my taste that bad?

297
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,620
See?

298
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,584
She's gorgeous, right?

299
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,530
This is how girls should dress like.

300
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:58,770
Go.

301
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:05,130
(Girls always have better taste)

302
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,980
(when it comes to clothing.)

303
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,370
Wu says she likes it.

304
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,330
If Fatty finds out

305
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,740
Wu is back,

306
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,330
he'll be surprised for sure.

307
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,460
The Shrek Seven Devils

308
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,980
are finally reunited again.

309
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,220
Fatty and Xiang have gone out
for a while.

310
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,700
Why haven't they returned yet?

311
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,900
Boss Dai,

312
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,260
this is a rare chance
for them to go out.

313
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:37,610
We have to give them a chance

314
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,090
to spend more time together.

315
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,260
You know quite a lot.

316
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,130
Open it.

317
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,260
Oh, Ma.

318
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,850
Ma.

319
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,980
Finally, you're at my mercy.

320
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:03,940
Beat me if you can.

321
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,740
Come on.

322
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,610
Come.

323
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,570
Miss Bai,

324
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,850
I find

325
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,096
the way you fled familiar.

326
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,610
Were you the one

327
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:20,048
who ruined my plan at the tavern

328
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,850
that day with Ma?

329
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,500
Speak up.

330
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,700
Capture her.

331
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,570
Ma.

332
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,530
You go first.

333
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,330
I'm talking to you.
Why are you looking at him?

334
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,330
Don't tell me you have bad taste

335
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:10,050
and actually like him.

336
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,610
I'm pretty good.

337
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,700
How about considering...

338
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,220
Ouch!

339
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
Let go.

340
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,770
You wench!

341
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,530
Wench!

342
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,700
Boss!

343
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,460
Boss!

344
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,260
Hold him down!

345
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,330
Ma!

346
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,700
How dare you!

347
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,420
Ma Hongjun.

348
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,220
Stop it!

349
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,220
Enough.

350
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,120
Don't be impulsive.

351
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,340
Chief said not to kill him yet.

352
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:41,040
Please calm down.

353
00:19:41,104 --> 00:19:41,770
Calm down.

354
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,740
Mark my words.

355
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,850
Once the chief
takes over the four tribes,

356
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,020
you'll be in great trouble.

357
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,810
That's right.

358
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,940
Are you all right?

359
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,130
I remember now.

360
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,420
Someone helped me that day.

361
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,460
But they had their face covered,

362
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,330
so I couldn't see them clearly.

363
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,220
So it was you.

364
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,610
Why isn't Tang San here yet?

365
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,810
I'm waiting for his
Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng.

366
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,810
Old Goat, calm down.

367
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,020
When San is here,

368
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,220
the treasure will be yours.

369
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:27,980
Look.

370
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,660
He's here.

371
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,740
Hurry up.

372
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:33,810
Isn't this girl

373
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,330
the one who fought with me?

374
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,660
She's Wu.

375
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,220
She's my beloved.

376
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,420
Seniors,

377
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,288
she doesn't have consciousness now,

378
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,780
so she's unable to greet you properly.

379
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,130
Please forgive her.

380
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,392
She lost her consciousness?

381
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,570
Is it a brain trauma,

382
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,900
fright,

383
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,370
or poisoning?

384
00:20:56,928 --> 00:20:57,700
None of those.

385
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,180
None of those?

386
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,700
Her complexion is rosy,

387
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,940
and she has a round forehead.

388
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,530
This is a sign of great vitality.

389
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,610
She almost killed me.

390
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,330
This is a rare condition.

391
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,900
She's healthy but without consciousness.

392
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,220
If you trust my Yangs' healing skills,

393
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,460
I'll try to diagnose her

394
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,810
and find the cause.

395
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,460
Of course, I trust your skills,

396
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:26,640
but Wu is a hectomillennium soul beast
before transforming into a human form.

397
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,660
She sacrificed herself

398
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,736
to rescue me from Martial Soul Hall

399
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,180
and almost perished.

400
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,530
Even though her body has been restored,

401
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,740
she lost consciousness.

402
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,500
With her current state,

403
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,770
healing skills can't help her much.

404
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,660
I see.

405
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,370
Surprisingly,

406
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,460
you and your father

407
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,530
have such similar fates.

408
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,900
Anyway, don't lose hope.

409
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,370
If Old Goat

410
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,530
joins the Tang Clan,

411
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,050
he'll slowly treat

412
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,370
Miss Wu.

413
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,420
Perhaps there's still hope.

414
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,420
Right,

415
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,260
Old Goat?

416
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:09,660
Yes.

417
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,460
If you can join us,

418
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,610
I'll be very glad.

419
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,810
I heard

420
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,850
you have a precious gift

421
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,980
for me.

422
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,130
I'm ashamed to say

423
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,130
I was rude today,

424
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:24,976
but you've treated me
with kindness instead.

425
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,500
I was too assertive before.

426
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,940
I hope you won't mind.

427
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:30,900
I wouldn't dare.

428
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,020
You flatter me.

429
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,370
The gift for you is
Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng.

430
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,500
However,

431
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:41,568
I'm afraid I can't present it to you.

432
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,980
Because the Crystal Bloody
Dragon Ginseng

433
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,370
was eaten by Wu.

434
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,370
What did you just say?

435
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,050
You ate such an immortal herb?

436
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:51,850
Right.

437
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:54,530
Old White Bird.

438
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,770
Don't worry, sir.

439
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,570
I've prepared another immortal herb.

440
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,610
No need.

441
00:22:58,736 --> 00:22:59,810
There's no immortal herb

442
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,090
rarer than Crystal Bloody
Dragon Ginseng.

443
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,740
Forget it.

444
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,500
Seems like I'm not fated to have it.

445
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,260
Sir,

446
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,130
I know Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng
is rare.

447
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,610
But

448
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:15,810
please look at this.

449
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,980
Young Master,

450
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,050
Old Goat agreed to join Tang Clan

451
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,610
for Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng.

452
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,130
But it's gone now,

453
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,850
nothing will work,
no matter what you show him.

454
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,260
Old Goat,

455
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,980
he didn't mean that.

456
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,130
This is

457
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,020
the Fragrant Silk Woven Flower?

458
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,330
Precisely.

459
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:52,980
Are you sure

460
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,180
you want to give me this?

461
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,260
That's right.

462
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:57,700
It chooses its own master.

463
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,740
I believe it will be more useful

464
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,370
in your hand.

465
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,850
I have some knowledge of herbs,

466
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,330
and I hope I can seek your guidance.

467
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:14,850
Very well.

468
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:15,980
Very well.

469
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,180
I'll follow you from now on.

470
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,770
You must keep your word.

471
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,020
I will.

472
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,660
(I was feeling guilty)

473
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,976
(about accidentally consuming)

474
00:24:32,992 --> 00:24:34,400
(the Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng,)

475
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,432
(but it seems
you have planned out everything.)

476
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,130
(Of course.)

477
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,900
(I'm always prepared.)

478
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:41,360
(Thanks to Granduncle's
Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng,)

479
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,610
(if not,)

480
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,416
(I didn't know how long
I'd have to wait)

481
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,050
(to speak with you like this.)

482
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,740
I've been searching for it for life.

483
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,090
Fragrant Silk Woven Flower...

484
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,020
With you,

485
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,660
I'll have no fear
in concocting any poison.

486
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,660
Old Goat,

487
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,050
didn't you say

488
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,664
that my Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng

489
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,770
was the most valuable?

490
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,180
Fragrant Silk Woven Flower
can combat all the poisons.

491
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,050
It can't detoxify,
but it can resist poison.

492
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,700
With it, I don't have to fear poisoning
while refining medicine.

493
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,900
To the Tribe of Destruction,

494
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,900
this is priceless.

495
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,700
I'm willing to trade it
with my own life.

496
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:22,240
He's so obsessed with it.

497
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:23,900
Oh no!

498
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,330
Old Goat has lost his mind

499
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:28,220
because of this flower.

500
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,130
Tang San,

501
00:25:30,336 --> 00:25:31,460
you're really something.

502
00:25:32,112 --> 00:25:33,460
You shouldn't call him by his name.

503
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,660
We're members of the Tang Clan now,

504
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,530
so we should call him

505
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,810
the chief.

506
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,130
All of you are my seniors,

507
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,130
and you'll be the clan elders.

508
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,460
Friends older than me and my seniors

509
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,290
call me San.

510
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,610
I hope you'll do the same.

511
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,220
Sure.

512
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:49,940
San.

513
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:54,850
Move.

514
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:56,480
Something bad has happened!

515
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,530
Kneel.

516
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,020
I was just about to take a walk

517
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,610
when I saw this fellow sneaking around
at the gate.

518
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:04,940
I came to deliver a letter.

519
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,810
I have a letter.

520
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,660
(To meet with you, I've invited Miss Bai Chenxiang.
I'll await your arrival. From Huyan Zhen)

521
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,050
What did you do to Xiang?

522
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,610
The chief would like
to invite the four of you

523
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,810
to Elephant Armored Tribe.

524
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,220
Miss Bai Chenxiang
has been waiting there.

525
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,850
Huyan Zhen must've set up traps.

526
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,330
We need to be prepared.

527
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,260
This darned Huyan Zhen!

528
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,460
I'm going to destroy
the Elephant Armored Tribe.

529
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,020
This letter specifically calls for

530
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,810
the four single attribute tribes.

531
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,020
Looks like we're meeting
Huyan Zhen together.

532
00:26:49,181 --> 00:26:50,451
He's dead meat!

533
00:26:51,552 --> 00:26:54,624
(Longxing Town)

534
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:20,100
(Elephant Armored)

535
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:20,980
Huyan Zhen,

536
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,130
you vile scoundrel!

537
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,420
Come out!

538
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,900
(Elephant Armored)

539
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,810
Everyone says the four tribes are tight,

540
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,020
and now I see it.

541
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,090
You lackey of the Martial Soul Hall,

542
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,020
where's my granddaughter?

543
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,570
If you dare to hurt her,

544
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,660
I'll take you down to hell

545
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,570
even at the cost of my life.

546
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,500
Mr. Bai,

547
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,420
simmer down.

548
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,420
Miss Bai is my guest.

549
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,770
How could I harm her?

550
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,900
I believe you know what I mean.

551
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,460
Please submit to
the Elephant Armored Tribe.

552
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:58,500
There's no need to make things ugly

553
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,290
over a trivial matter.

554
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,370
As if!

555
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,180
You actually abducted Xiang

556
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,664
to coerce us to submit to you.

557
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,720
I, Yang Wudi, will never

558
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,810
join you despicable scum.

559
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,500
It's fine if you don't agree,

560
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,500
but if Miss Bai gets injured

561
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,500
or is poisoned

562
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,940
in our tribe,

563
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,020
I can't make any promises.

564
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,090
You!

565
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,290
Sirs,

566
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,180
you have 15 minutes.

567
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,180
Sirs,

568
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,770
take your time.

569
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,330
Stop trying.

570
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,020
You've been poisoned.

571
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,020
If you force your soul power,

572
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,392
the poison will only enter
your heart meridian faster.

573
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,660
Huyan Zhen captured you

574
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,660
to threaten the four tribes.

575
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,610
Don't worry.

576
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,220
No matter what happens,

577
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,900
I'll risk my life to keep you safe.

578
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,660
You can't even summon
your soul rings now

579
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,570
or use your martial soul
even though it's powerful.

580
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,180
If anything happens,

581
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,330
save yourself first.

582
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:16,940
Xiang,

583
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,180
what's in your sachet?

584
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,330
It smells nice.

585
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,700
It's the agarwood.

586
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,660
It's time to make yourselves useful.

587
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:34,740
Take them away.

588
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,220
Come out.

589
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,700
Move.

590
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,500
Hey,

591
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,290
if you don't want to die,

592
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,180
convince your grandfather

593
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,260
to submit to Elephant Armored Tribe.

594
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,290
Even if I have to die today,

595
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,610
I will never bow down

596
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,330
to you lackeys of Martial Soul Hall.

597
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,850
You've got backbone.

598
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:01,940
If so, you'll die.

599
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,260
Let's go.

600
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,090
Go.

601
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,610
Give chase!

602
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,130
Come on!

603
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,610
Save him now.

604
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,980
He's been poisoned.

605
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:33,370
We'll leave Fatty to you.

606
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,530
It's venom.

607
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,020
He's over there.

608
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:51,616
Hunt him down.

609
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,500
Place this pill

610
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,320
at the Haiquan acupoint
under Fatty's tongue.

611
00:31:54,352 --> 00:31:55,600
It helps to detoxify the venom.

612
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,050
So you want it the hard way, eh?

613
00:32:19,344 --> 00:32:20,912
You haven't given me the answer yet.

614
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,900
Do you really think those reckless guys

615
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,900
could save them?

616
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,530
Mr. Yang,

617
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,940
I've heard you're a poison expert.

618
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,770
You probably didn't even realize

619
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,290
this incense

620
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,992
contains a colorless
and odorless poison.

621
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,940
You four can't summon
your soul power now.

622
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,660
Surrender peacefully,

623
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,850
and I'll spare you.

624
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:53,552
This is impossible.

625
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,330
You all...

626
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,330
Scoundrel,

627
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,090
sorry to disappoint you.

628
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,260
With it,

629
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,020
no poison can hurt us.

630
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,020
I could see through

631
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,090
your incense trick from the start.

632
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,940
I was just buying time

633
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,050
to fool you.

634
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,700
Chief!

635
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,610
Chief,

636
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,980
Bai Chenxiang and the fatty
have been rescued.

637
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,050
We're suffering heavy losses.

638
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,420
Kill them!

639
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:26,032
(Elephant Armored)
(Huyan Zhen,)

640
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,180
(you'll suffer)

641
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,050
(because of your own action one day.)

642
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,220
Everything is settled.

643
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,700
It's time for us to leave.

644
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:47,940
Rongrong is helping Xiang
to take care of Fatty,

645
00:33:47,952 --> 00:33:49,290
so she couldn't bid you farewell.

646
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,020
Actually, she's sad about your leaving.

647
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,940
Saying farewell is
what she hates the most now.

648
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:56,940
I understand.

649
00:33:56,976 --> 00:33:58,800
All reunions must come to
an end one day.

650
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,130
Before we meet again,

651
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,160
let's take good care of ourselves.

652
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,850
If you're tired of
being the crown prince and princess,

653
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,050
come back to Tang Clan.

654
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:07,850
San and I

655
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,340
will hide you well.

656
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,500
Boss Dai and Zhuqing

657
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,340
aren't the kind who hide.

658
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,050
But Ao is right.

659
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,250
Tang Clan

660
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,900
always welcomes you.

661
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,380
We've caused you trouble

662
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,730
in Longxing Town this time.

663
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,250
Will Huyan Zhen...

664
00:34:25,488 --> 00:34:27,344
He wouldn't dare to raise a stink here.

665
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,090
He can only accept this.

666
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,200
Otherwise, he won't get any good

667
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,480
from Martial Soul Hall.

668
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,340
As for Longxing Town,

669
00:34:34,736 --> 00:34:35,860
it's under our jurisdiction,

670
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,650
so it's no trouble at all.

671
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,340
Xingluo doesn't plan

672
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,420
to confront Martial Soul Hall for now,

673
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,650
so we can't interfere too much

674
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,860
with Elephant Armored Tribe.

675
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,300
San,

676
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,940
you should leave this place.

677
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,650
The four elders are making arrangements.

678
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,090
Once we're done,

679
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,488
we'll return to Tiandou City.

680
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:00,500
Take care.

681
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,020
Take care.

682
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,500
Take care.

683
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,530
Why didn't Xiang

684
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,530
take the same carriage with us?

685
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,050
Perhaps she's afraid you'd force her

686
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,380
into accepting you.

687
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:40,900
Rongrong.

688
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:43,312
Give it back to me.

689
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,460
What?

690
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,300
I use that to save Wu.

691
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,570
You should've told me earlier.

692
00:35:49,936 --> 00:35:51,860
I noticed something special
about this inner pill

693
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,032
and wanted to borrow it
for a few days to cultivate.

694
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,500
If I'd known it was
for Wu's resurrection,

695
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,940
I wouldn't have kept it.

696
00:35:58,544 --> 00:36:00,624
This is the inner pill
of an ancient soul beast.

697
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,240
It can suppress all kinds of venom.

698
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,610
You'll be done for

699
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,900
without it.

700
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:10,130
Even though we left safely,

701
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,460
we made

702
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,650
a huge commotion here.

703
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,690
Martial Soul Hall won't let it slide
so easily.

704
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,020
We'll have to face

705
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,380
anything that's thrown at us.

706
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,960
Now, the Tang Clan united
the four single attribute tribes.

707
00:36:21,024 --> 00:36:21,900
We only need to

708
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,570
expand the clan quickly,

709
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,090
and we can face any danger.

710
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:26,420
Deal!

711
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,300
(Tang Clan)

712
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,380
Greetings, Chief.

713
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,530
Greetings, chief.

714
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:16,900
Please take a seat.

715
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,936
Tribe of Defense truly lives up to
its reputation as the greatest builder.

716
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,600
You've managed to expand the Tang Clan

717
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,130
in such a short period

718
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,300
to let all the four tribes settle down.

719
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,780
You're indeed a godsend for me.

720
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,090
This is the expertise
of the Tribe of Defense.

721
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,860
Although the time given was short,

722
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,048
and we only managed to
expand the building,

723
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,780
many critical defense projects

724
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,820
have yet to be implemented.

725
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,736
That's right.

726
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:56,176
There are many matters to address

727
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,776
in the early stages
of establishing Tang Clan.

728
00:37:57,824 --> 00:37:58,816
To facilitate the effort

729
00:37:58,848 --> 00:38:00,368
in establishing the Tang Clan,

730
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:00,980
I'm going to

731
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,020
announce the responsibilities
of each tribe.

732
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:05,530
Ao,

733
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,744
the vice chief,

734
00:38:08,608 --> 00:38:10,736
is responsible for coordinating
all Tang Clan matters.

735
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,752
Ning Rongrong,

736
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,352
the vice chief,

737
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,780
is responsible for finances

738
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,170
and all business dealings.

739
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,420
Ma Hongjun,

740
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,904
the vice chief,

741
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,300
is responsible for combat operations.

742
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,900
You'll select disciples
suitable for battle

743
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,264
and form the Hall of Martial Arts.

744
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,860
External operations of the Tang Clan

745
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,848
will be taken charge
by the Hall of Martial Arts.

746
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:34,704
The four single attribute tribes
will form four halls.

747
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,640
The Tribe of Strength
will form Hall of Strength,

748
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,840
which will be in charge
of hidden weapon forging.

749
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,368
This is also the main profit source

750
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,216
for Tang Clan.

751
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,780
Elder Titan serves as the hall leader.

752
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:47,632
The Tribe of Defense
will form the Hall of Defense,

753
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,456
which will be in charge
of Tang Clan's defense

754
00:38:49,472 --> 00:38:50,656
and building projects.

755
00:38:50,784 --> 00:38:52,420
Elder Niu Gao serves as the hall leader.

756
00:38:54,128 --> 00:38:56,250
The Tribe of Agility
will form the Hall of Agility,

757
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,360
which will be in charge
of intelligence gathering,

758
00:38:58,368 --> 00:38:58,970
reconnaissance,

759
00:38:58,976 --> 00:39:00,100
and information collecting.

760
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,250
Elder Bai He serves as the hall leader.

761
00:39:04,128 --> 00:39:06,304
The Tribe of Destruction
will be the Hall of Medicine.

762
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:07,530
Like the Tribe of Defense,

763
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,420
you're in charge of defense

764
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,896
and alchemy as your main focus.

765
00:39:10,912 --> 00:39:11,760
It consists of

766
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,980
medicinal and poisonous concoction.

767
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,072
I'll discuss the details

768
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:16,420
with Elder Yang.

769
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,500
Elder Yang serves as the hall leader.

770
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,250
Aside from that,

771
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,730
all the vice chiefs, elders, and I

772
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,300
will form the Hall of Council

773
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,624
to decide on important matters
of Tang Clan.

774
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,340
Do you have any objections, elders?

775
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,130
We'll follow what you say, chief.

776
00:39:33,616 --> 00:39:36,050
Currently, the Tang Clan is
in great need of money.

777
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:37,664
All the expenses can be drawn

778
00:39:37,664 --> 00:39:40,080
from the down payment
paid by the Qibao Amber Sect.

779
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:41,730
Elder Titan,

780
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,940
it's time to start forging
the hidden weapon

781
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,250
for Qibao Amber Sect.

782
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,250
Of course.

783
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,500
My father has only paid a down payment.

784
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,050
We need to deliver the goods

785
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,300
to secure this large sum of money.

786
00:39:53,008 --> 00:39:54,800
Leave it to the Hall of Strength.

787
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,980
However, we need to purchase
a lot of metals

788
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,050
for the forging.

789
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,456
I was planning to discuss this
with Elder Titan.

790
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,980
Please confirm the purchasing list

791
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:05,570
and we'll choose a date
to depart for the city of steel,

792
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:06,940
Gengxing City.

793
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,530
Yes, chief.

794
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,380
Everything has been arranged.

795
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:14,780
Now,

796
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,020
I'm going to announce
the first clan rule.

797
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:20,980
Starting today,

798
00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:22,530
all disciples of the Tang Clan

799
00:40:22,592 --> 00:40:24,864
are forbidden from hunting
unless they need soul rings.

800
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,460
Those who need them
must follow the seasonal rules.

801
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,020
Between winter and spring,

802
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,130
don't hunt flying beasts.

803
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,032
Between summer and autumn,

804
00:40:32,064 --> 00:40:33,856
don't hunt beasts living
in swamps or waters.

805
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,050
Soul ring seekers

806
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:36,800
must avoid harming the natural order.

807
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,980
Don't hunt young beasts,

808
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,340
pregnant beasts,

809
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,300
or sprouts.

810
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,312
Anyone who violates this
will be considered killing at will

811
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,610
and publicly punished

812
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,020
to set an example.

813
00:40:53,058 --> 00:40:54,128
You may not understand

814
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,648
the meaning behind this rule,

815
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,650
as it's natural

816
00:40:57,776 --> 00:40:59,130
for soul masters to hunt soul beasts

817
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,860
for their soul rings and soul bones.

818
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,860
I used to think that way

819
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,730
until I learned that my mother

820
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,130
was also a soul beast

821
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,690
hunted by a soul master

822
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,820
and that Wu

823
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,820
sacrificed herself to save me.

824
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,530
They let me realize

825
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,420
the harm soul masters do

826
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,090
to soul beasts.

827
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,820
So I hope all the disciples

828
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,020
will show respect

829
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,608
to every creature on this continent

830
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,530
and not kill as they please.

831
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,420
Well said.

832
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,050
As soul masters,
we mustn't become arrogant.

833
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,090
In the end,

834
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,020
we are just

835
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,300
one part of this diverse world.

836
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,690
All living beings

837
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,820
share this continent.

838
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,570
Only by living in harmony
can we achieve lasting peace.

839
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,530
I'll bring this rule

840
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,130
to Qibao Amber Sect.

841
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,570
Everyone in the clan

842
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,170
must obey this rule

843
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,500
without exception.

844
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:03,872
Everyone has a lot on your plate,

845
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,650
so please get back to your business.

846
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:06,980
Elder Yang,

847
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,576
I need to discuss something with you.

848
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:09,690
Yes,

849
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,380
chief.

850
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,570
This is mixed with multiple poisons

851
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,860
concocted by a poison expert.

852
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,130
Where did you get this from, chief?

853
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,730
A friend entrusted me with it.

854
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,050
He hopes I can develop an antidote

855
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,020
from this.

856
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,050
I tried,

857
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,530
but I failed.

858
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,090
So I hope you can give it a try.

859
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,130
The poisoned person is nearing death.

860
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,130
We don't have much time.

861
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,800
It's useless to give me
this poison pill.

862
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,380
Take me to the patient now.

863
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,210
I believe my Yangs' healing skills

864
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,420
could save them.

865
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,420
We're not able to meet this person,

866
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,530
and I can't say more.

867
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,130
Elder Yang,

868
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,300
please try to create an antidote

869
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,340
from this poison pill.
