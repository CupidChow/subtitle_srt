Tangjia Sanshao's novel "Soul Land")

=Episode 12=

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,600
However, your music is bad.

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
I've always been clueless about music.

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,050
I'd rather be tortured

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,490
by the experts at Soul Arena

29
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,010
than play music.

30
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,080
Master,

31
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,080
why do you know I'm here?

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,410
The Crown Prince returned to the palace
and said a Haotian Sect disciple

33
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,690
obtained the Demon Domain.

34
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,930
My intuition tells me

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
that you are the one.

36
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,080
Where is Wu?

37
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,930
Wu returned to Xingdou Forest.

38
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,850
I can't find her as long as I haven't

39
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,370
achieved Father's standards.

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,480
Your father is right.

41
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,880
Wu will be safer there.

42
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,600
We have to be separated

43
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,040
because of Martial Soul Hall.

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,160
It seems like you've grown up
in Netherworld City

45
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,290
and it has a huge effect on you.

46
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,160
No wonder you were sent here.

47
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,720
Your heart isn't calm now.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,150
It's not just because
of the killing intent's effect,

49
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,990
but you also have too many things
in your heart.

50
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,060
It is caused by
your impatience to achieve success.

51
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,850
I know

52
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,320
you still miss Wu, right?

53
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,880
When Wu left,

54
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,760
a part of my Blue Silver Plant Martial Soul
was worn on her.

55
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,530
So, I can always

56
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,640
feel Wu's presence.

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,200
Wu is overcoming a critical moment
of soul ring conversion right now

58
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,760
and I

59
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,370
can't help at all.

60
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,090
Your martial soul can resonate with her?

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,990
My martial soul had a second awakening
and turned into Blue Silver Emperor.

62
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,810
Moreover, I also obtained
the Blue Silver Domain.

63
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,850
With the Blue Silver Domain,

64
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,760
I can sense Wu more clearly

65
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,130
and I'm feeling
more impatient to find her.

66
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,640
If it wasn't for my promise to Father,
I would go find Wu now.

67
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,850
Your martial soul
can achieve a second awakening?

68
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,130
Amazing.

69
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,130
It's amazing.

70
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,530
The world of martial souls
is unpredictable.

71
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,600
I've been researching it for many years

72
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,720
and thought I'd found its true meaning.

73
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,640
Right now, it seems like
I'm still very inexperienced.

74
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,570
I, Yu Xiaogang,
might not have a bright future,

75
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,970
but my disciple

76
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,850
is a genius of the continent.

77
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,160
San.

78
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,410
You've shown me

79
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,710
that I'm still inexperienced

80
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,250
after training and researching
for so long.

81
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,400
Master, that's not what I mean.

82
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,370
It's not important.

83
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,570
Quick. Tell me

84
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,490
how you sense each other.

85
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,280
In that case,

86
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,280
you might still be able to help

87
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,930
in Wu's soul ring conversion.

88
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,690
Do you have a way, Master?

89
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,320
First of all, you must learn
how to control your domain.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,130
Don't be too happy or angry.

91
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,570
Keep your emotions calm.

92
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,690
Otherwise,

93
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,640
it might be bad for Wu.

94
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,250
Sit down first.

95
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,810
Release your Talent Domain.

96
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,730
All right.

97
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,690
Blue Silver Plants are
scattered across the continent.

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,400
Your blood of Blue Silver Emperor

99
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,050
can control the world's
Blue Silver Plant.

100
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,200
It is an extremely powerful
and unique power.

101
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,050
So, even if Wu is doing soul ring conversion
in another place,

102
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,280
you can attempt

103
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,840
to connect with her
with the Blue Silver Clan's power.

104
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,960
Finally, you can
achieve mutual cultivation.

105
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,010
This form of cultivation

106
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,050
not only benefits yourself,

107
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,490
but also benefits Wu

108
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,400
to help her speed up her conversion.

109
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,440
Mutual cultivation?

110
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,610
Wu, can I really do that?

This Blue Silver Plant.

It's Tang San.

116

He is helping Wu.

117
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,200
At least, he's kind.

118
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,610
They might be separated,

119
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,490
but they don't give up on each other.

120
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,170
Is this what humans call love?

121

What humans say

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,370
has nothing to do with soul beasts.

123
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,490
But it has something to do with Wu.

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,200
It seems like Wu is in deep sleep,

148
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,930
but she is full of vitality.

149
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,570
However, for some reason,

150
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,640
I can understand her feelings.

151
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,490
She is sad and afraid.

152
00:07:56,682 --> 00:07:59,760
The improvement
of one's cultivation is not easy.

153
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,930
She is also overcoming her difficulties.

154
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,370
Moreover, a soul beast
doing soul ring conversion

155
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,290
is different
from humans absorbing soul rings.

156
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,690
It takes time and patience.

157
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,200
San,

158
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,930
what you need to learn now

159
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,490
is to control your own domain

160
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,640
and not harm Wu.

161
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,320
It'll only be better for the cultivation

162
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,130
if you help her calm her emotions.

163
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:23,690
Master,

164
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,520
I'm relieved to hear
that I can cultivate with Wu.

165
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,400
I also understand

166
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,880
that cultivating one's heart
is a necessary lesson.

167
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,680
Don't worry, Master.

168
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,090
Oh.

169
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,090
Grand Venom Master came to find you.

170
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,450
I shouldn't go and greet him.

171
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,760
Martial Soul Hall is
keeping a close eye on me.

172
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,040
I'm afraid I might cause him trouble.

173
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,330
They forced you and Wu
to leave back then.

174
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,400
Although the Shrek Seven Devils
won the competition,

175
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,280
all of you had to be separated

176
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,090
to ensure your safety.

177
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:09,920
That's right.

178
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,330
We promised to venture into the world

179
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,730
after we graduated,

180
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,210
but no one expected

181
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,040
Martial Soul Hall
to corner us to this point.

182
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
Don't be sad.

183
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,090
They have agreed

184
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,680
to gather at the academy
after five years during Dashu season.

185
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,490
I hope you and Wu can come.

186
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,520
Sure.

187
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,370
I will do my best to be there.

188
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,010
Ms. Yue,

189
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,520
that soul master has left.

190
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,160
His music might not be in tune

191
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,880
but it sounds a lot calmer now.

192
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,330
He is a good teacher indeed.

193
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,400
Love can overcome mountains and oceans.

194
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,970
Love only ends at death.

195
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,620
What are you talking about death?

196
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,610
Say something auspicious.

197
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,760
Erming.

198
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,730
Water the Blue Silver Plant.

199
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,880
Daming, you've changed.

200
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,090
Do you also think

201
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,130
Tang San is a match for Wu?

202
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,370
A match?

203
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:52,680
Bah.

204
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,920
I don't understand.

205
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,210
Daming

206
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,250
is really stubborn.

207
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,040
I lost.

208
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,370
I know your skills.

209
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,450
You are trying to make me happy.

210
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,730
That won't do. Let's play another game.

211
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,490
Father,

212
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,160
the imperial physician said

213
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,920
you can't take it anymore.

214
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,160
You should rest.

215
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,850
You've helped me
manage the empire recently.

216
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,400
You must be exhausted.

217
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,010
Sharing your burden

218
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,280
is what I should do as your son.

219
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,520
I heard

220
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,090
the palace is preparing
a birthday banquet for you.

221
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,280
You've never liked something like this.

222
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,450
I'm sure you have something else in mind

223
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,010
by doing something so grand.

224
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,010
Nothing goes past you.

225
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,210
Do you still remember

226
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,490
the Haotian Sect disciple

227
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,970
who obtained the Demon Domain?

228
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,760
Naturally.

229
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,920
How wonderful would it be

230
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,760
if Tiandou empire

231
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,610
could get a talent like him?

232
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,280
I share the same idea with you.

233
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,800
Moreover, I think

234
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,490
that person is in Moon Pavilion.

235
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,520
Why?

236
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,330
After what Martial Soul Hall did there,

237
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,450
I realised

238
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,440
the cautious Ms. Yue

239
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,920
was nervous.

240
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,250
That is one of the reasons.

241
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,370
Two.

242
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,610
I heard

243
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,390
Moon Pavilion has had
a mysterious masked student recently.

244
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,360
He has extraordinary skills
in playing the Guqin.

245
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,610
Ms. Yue treats him well too.

246
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,520
So, I think he is that person.

247
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,760
If Ms. Yue purposely hides the fact,

248
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,160
I'm sure she has her reasons.

249
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,970
Don't ask her directly.

250
00:14:59,130 --> 00:14:59,850
Of course.

251
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,800
I want to invite him
to the birthday banquet.

252
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,640
Apparently, people who escaped
from Netherworld City

253
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,400
like to fight and get angry easily

254
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,450
due to killing intent.

255
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,210
This is a good opportunity to test him.

256
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,610
Even if we make a mistake,
it won't hurt our harmony.

257
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,040
If I realise it's him,

258
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,850
you can invite him

259
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,210
to serve Tiandou Empire.

260
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,800
You are thorough.

261
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,250
In that case,

262
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,800
I will issue an edict to invite him

263
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,800
so Ms. Yue can't decline.

264
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,610
I'll rely on you
for what happens after that.

265
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,330
Thank you, Father.

266
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,840
(Invitation for Ms. Yue to attend
Crown Prince's birthday banquet)

267
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,090
(Birthday Banquet)
I can't decline His Majesty's edict.

268
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,250
There must be something fishy going on.

269
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,090
When I was studying at Shrek Academy,

270
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,400
I met the Crown Prince before.

271
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,560
He is a very smart

272
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,450
and sharp person.

273
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,400
When Hu Liena came looking for me,

274
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,370
he was around.

275
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,330
Perhaps he discovered some flaws.

276
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,450
It has been many years

277
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,280
since I last met the Crown Prince.

278
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,800
I'm no longer the same person.

279
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
I don't think
he can recognise me easily.

280
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,970
It's fine even if he recognises you.

281
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,130
The Crown Prince appreciates a talent

282
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,450
and wants to use this opportunity
to recruit you and find out who's your support.

283
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,640
It's the same as why His Majesty
invited me to Moon Pavilion.

284
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,880
He is just not doing it on the surface.

285
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,310
I don't want to have
anything to do with the royal family.

286
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,640
I have my own things to do.

287
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,450
In that case,

288
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,280
think of this banquet as your test.

289
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,760
If you pass,

290
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,920
I will let you leave
and find your father.

291
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,370
What do you think? Are you happy?

292
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,490
I guess.

293
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,210
However, I hope you don't cry too loudly

294
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,640
when I leave.

295
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,730
Otherwise, the servants might need to
put lotus seeds in their ears again.

296
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,560
Now that you mention it,
I've started to regret it now.

297
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,760
Why don't I

298
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,130
keep you here for a while longer?

299
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,010
I take back what I said.

300
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,210
Where are you going?

301
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,170
Find someone to make a new outfit

302
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,800
for the banquet.

303
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,180
(Thank you)

304
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,650
This brat.

305
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,980
Congratulations on your birthday,
Your Highness.

306
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,650
I find you familiar.

307
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,320
Have we met somewhere before?

308
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,170
If I meet someone as handsome

309
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,320
and noble as Your Highness,

310
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,650
I will surely remember you.

311
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,730
It's a pity that we didn't
get to know each other sooner.

312
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,750
It's not too late
to know each other now.

313
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,010
I heard you are good at music.

314
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,040
Why not perform a song?

315
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,760
Sorry for embarrassing myself then.

316
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,250
Stop embarrassing yourself.

317
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,730
When I studied with you
at Moon Pavilion,

318
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,450
you played as if you were using a saw.

319
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,560
Don't play.

320
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,730
Come and drink with me.

321
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,930
Fourth Prince.

322
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,490
I am still inexperienced,

323
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,900
but I can't bring myself
to decline His Highness' invitation.

324
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,250
No matter how I played,

325
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,600
just think of it as making it fun

326
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,360
for other people.

327
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,490
Don't you know what's good for you?

328
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,730
Don't think you are a noble
just because you have a better outfit.

329
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,170
Ms. Yue

330
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,930
is just a female teacher Father hired.

331
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,730
Do you think she can teach you well?

332
00:19:45,202 --> 00:19:45,882
Come.

333
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,700
His Majesty is
the ruler of Tiandou Empire.

334
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,410
All of us are equal.

335
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,120
We are all his people.

336
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,170
Fourth Prince, Drinking too much
is bad for your health.

337
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,450
Please take care.

338
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:58,690
Someone,

339
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,520
send Fourth Prince back to his bedroom.

340
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:03,690
Yes.

341
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,210
I'm not leaving! I haven't drunk enough!

342
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,560
Let go!

343
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,840
Let go!

344
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,600
Ms. Yue...

345
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,520
I'm not leaving!

346
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,690
Allow me to apologise
on behalf of my fourth brother.

347
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,890
It's all right, Your Highness.

348
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,280
Those were drunken words.

349
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,080
Why not calm ourselves
and listen to the song?

350
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,560
(All of them are soul masters.)

351
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,360
What you need to learn now

352
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,840
is to control your killing intent.

353
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,310
Don't harm Wu.

354
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,490
It'll only be better for the cultivation

355
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,170
if you help her calm her emotions.

356
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,520
As expected from Ms. Yue's disciple.

357
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,210
Thank you for your praise,
Your Highness.

358
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,840
It was just a solo.

359
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,170
I didn't expect many people
to play in harmony.

360
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,410
I'm sure
you arranged for this, Your Highness.

361
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,080
Please forgive me, Ms. Yue.

362
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,800
I guess you are not just
good at playing musical instruments.

363
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,410
I intended to test you just now.

364
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,760
It was a little abrupt.

365
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,210
Those musicians

366
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,360
were Soul Kings.

367
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,480
Their martial souls
are musical instruments.

368
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,690
Since you weren't at a disadvantage,
I'm sure you are better than them.

369
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,560
I wonder which soul master academy
did you study in?

370
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,410
Are you willing to serve our hall?

371
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,170
Thanks for your appreciation

372
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,490
but I've loved being free since young

373
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,930
and don't enjoy being tied down.

374
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,600
I came to Moon Pavilion

375
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,080
just to stay for a short while.

376
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,800
Soon, I will leave.

377
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:18,202
I have no choice
but to apologise to Your Highness.

378
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,170
Your Highness, you don't know this.

379
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,690
Before coming here,
he already said his farewell to me.

380
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,840
He is still young.

381
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,010
He only thinks about

382
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,010
the person he loves.

383
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,290
I'm afraid he is not suitable
to hold any responsibility.

384
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,490
He will disappoint you.

385
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,080
In that case,

386
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,730
I won't say anything else.

387
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,840
You chased me away

388
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,970
in front of all the guests.

389
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,410
I'm so embarrassed!

390
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
Father,

391
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,600
you must seek justice for me.

392
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:50,600
Father.

393
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,120
Xue Beng.

394
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,320
Your Second and Third Brother
passed away early,

395
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,690
so I doted on you.

396
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,730
However,

397
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,250
I spoiled you instead.

398
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,120
Right now,

399
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,080
you even dare cause trouble
at your brother's birthday banquet.

400
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,970
This is ridiculous.

401
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,600
Father.

402
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,520
Your Majesty,
it's time to take medicine.

403
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,840
What medicine?

404
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,560
That quack

405
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,690
can't treat Father after so long.

406
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,410
I'll punish you!

407
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:28,930
What's going on?

408
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,120
Nonsense!

409
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,360
If you do this again,
I won't allow you to see Father anymore.

410
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,320
Someone!

411
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,320
Your Highness.

412
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,170
Take him away.

413
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,970
Yes!

414
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Father!

415
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,930
I'm not leaving!

416
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,320
I'm not leaving!

417
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,170
I'm not leaving!

418
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,360
Imperial Physician Yang,
take another dose of medicine.

419
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,320
I will serve Father.

420
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:53,930
Yes.

421
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,360
Father.

422
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,320
Don't treat Xue Beng like that.

423
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,250
He might be naughty

424
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,840
but he is your only sibling.

425
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,800
I spoiled him.

426
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,280
In the future,
you should educate him slowly.

427
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,360
I understand, Father.

428
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,420
When you were playing
in front of the crown prince,

429
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,590
the musicians used their musical instruments
to attack you with their soul power

430
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,906
but you didn't
block with your soul power directly.

431
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,737
You changed the music instead.

432
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,320
You hid your soul power
in the musical notes

433
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,520
to play in harmony with them

434
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,170
and cleared the attack.

435
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,520
Well done.

436
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:45,930
I passed.

437
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,120
Your performance was full of love

438
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,250
and longing.

439
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,410
Even if I want you to stay,

440
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,360
I won't be able to.

441
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,120
I must find Father first

442
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
before I can find her.

443
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,760
She has waited for me for too long.

444
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,490
I can't let her wait any longer.

445
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
What is her name?

446
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,690
How old is she?

447
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,730
What do her parents do?

448
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,080
Have my second brother met her?

449
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,600
Her name is Wu.

450
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,450
I guarantee you will see her soon.

451
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,930
As for the rest, I will tell you about it
when the time comes.

452
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,120
Wu.

453
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,280
Wu is good.

454
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,410
The name

455
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,450
is pleasant.

456
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,250
That's right, Aunt.

457
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,800
Do you know the Fourth Prince well?

458
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,170
The fourth prince?

459
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,360
He is the child
that His Majesty worries about most.

460
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,520
Otherwise, he wouldn't
be sent to my place.

461
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:46,730
What's wrong?

462
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,970
I don't think

463
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,930
he tried to trouble on purpose.

464
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,250
He realised the Crown Prince
was testing me

465
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,190
and purposely helped me
overcome the situation.

466
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,800
Perhaps,

467
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,730
I was overthinking as well.

468
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,840
If you have doubts,

469
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,170
I can help you observe him.

470
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,010
Go and find your father.

471
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,040
I will be waiting at the sect
for you to come back

472
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,490
See you, Aunt.

473
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,520
Let go!

474
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,280
I'm the Fourth Prince!
Who dares to stop me?

475
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,450
Let go!

476
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,280
Let me go.

477
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,320
I'm not drunk.

478
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,250
Fourth Prince.

479
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,450
Fourth Prince.

480
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,120
Nonsense

481
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,650
If you do this again,
I won't allow you to see Father anymore.

482
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,210
Sorry to trouble you with this.

483
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,730
Don't worry. Just leave it to me.

484
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,600
I'm still doing the accounts.

485
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,010
What are we doing here?

486
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,250
Rongrong, you are here.

487
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,410
Come and try my cooking.

488
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,890
Are you cooking or wrecking the house?

489
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,450
Here you go.

490
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
Why are you cooking

491
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:34,970
for no reason?

492
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,210
Come. Let's eat over there.

493
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,250
You have a bad appetite recently.

494
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,210
I remember you loved

495
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,190
eating your mother's noodles
when you were young.

496
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,800
I made it from memory.

497
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,120
Try it.

498
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,800
What do you think?

499
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,650
It does taste like Mother's noodles

500
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,210
when I was young.

501
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,520
However, it can't get a perfect score.

502
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,880
You get a pass.

503
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:14,800
Yes.

504
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,650
I'll make it for you tomorrow
if you like it.

505
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,490
Forget it.

506
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:20,840
You made a mess

507
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,360
and the sect has to pay
for the kitchen's repair.

508
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,210
Since Ao left,

509
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,250
this is my first time seeing you smile.

510
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,040
After all, I can't be happy
for no reason every day.

511
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,840
Because the person who makes you happy

512
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,890
is no longer here, right?

513
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,800
The sect has its own rules,

514
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,800
but I can clearly see

515
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,800
that you like Ao a lot.

516
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,800
I regret it a lot.

517
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,840
But if you want,

518
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,010
I can send someone

519
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,210
to find Ao immediately.

520
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,490
Leaving the sect is his choice.

521
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,520
Before he achieves his goal,

522
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,010
he won't come back.

523
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,760
He is very talented.

524
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,040
I believe

525
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,410
he will become
the best support branch soul master.

526
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,480
One that can hold himself
against a war soul master.

527
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,010
Then,

528
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,760
you'll be suffering
while waiting for him to come back.

529
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:35,650
Perhaps this is the best arrangement.

530
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,010
Moreover,

531
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,970
I'm not just waiting and doing nothing.

532
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:43,010
We improve and grow together.

533
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,730
I am also very busy. I...

534
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,360
It's bad.

535
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,840
Something terrible is going to happen.

536
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,560
Why are you so anxious?

537
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,040
I asked Grandpa Sword
to give me a private lesson.

538
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,800
If I'm late,

539
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,170
I have to run 50 kilometres.

540
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,800
I'm leaving, Father.

541
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,010
Wait. A private lesson?

542
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,170
Father, the noodles were delicious.

543
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,730
But don't make it again.

544
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,690
I can only protect myself
if I find an attacking method

545
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,930
that suits me.

546
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,970
Grandpa Sword,
stop giving me a handicap.

547
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,250
Again.

548
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,970
Be careful.

549
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,040
It will be faster after this.

550
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,220
♪Ending the despair of suffering♪

551
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,380
♪Justice runs deep in our veins♪

552
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,900
♪The humble but powerful♪

553
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,220
♪Will break open the world of darkness♪

554
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,410
Ao, be careful.

555
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,600
Come on.

I can't hide forever.

576
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,810
Do you know where your advantage is?

577
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,010
It's dodging.

578
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,560
You dodged
a few moves wonderfully just now.

579
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,080
So, you must practice dodging

580
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,200
and use it as your shield

581
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,120
and even your weapon.

582
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,120
Make it unique.

583
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,600
The thing that Ao and I
assumed to be a weakness

584
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,930
can actually become a strength of ours?

585
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,330
I must practice dodging more

586
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,200
and utilise this skill to the extreme.

587
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,450
You are wise.

588
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,410
People think escaping
is a sign of weakness,

589
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,240
but they don't know

590
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,600
that a controlled escape
is also an important way.

591
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,640
During the process of dodging,
you can bait,

592
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,770
set traps and even prepare a formation.

593
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,110
Yes. As long as I'm still alive,
I'll be able to make a comeback.

594
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,850
All right.

595
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,560

(Let it accompany you and protect you)

607
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,890
(in my place.)

608
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,850
(You must come back safely.)

609
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,160
(Otherwise,)

610
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,810
(I will ignore you in my life forever.)

611
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,490
There's no soul bone.

612
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,120
A support branch soul master

613
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:17,842
killed an ice bear

614
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,330
with that weapon alone.

615
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,850
This person is extraordinary.

616
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,450
We failed to get a soul bone
on this journey,

617
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,970
but I'm sure we can get a good price

618
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,770
for his weapon.

619
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,930
However, he still doesn't trust us now.

620
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,240
We'll wait until he lets his guard down.

621
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,330
Amazing.

622
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,080
We worked together

623
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,040
to create this item.

624
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,410
However,

625
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
this is the only one.

626
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,930
Ao, as support branch soul masters,
both you and Rongrong need this.

627
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,930
However, Rongrong has
the clan's protection.

628
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,770
So, you should keep this.

629
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:13,640
I hate it.

630
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,890
I wished I wasn't a War Soul Master.

631
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,850
Why don't you get rid of your martial soul
and let San beat you up?

632
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,560
What do you think?

633
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,080
I'll keep forging objects.

634
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,330
I'll go with you.

635
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:24,970
Sure.

636
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,490
There will be times
when the clan can't protect you.

637
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,770
You should keep it.

638
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,080
I will just keep relying on you.

639
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,290
No.

640
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,490
San said you need it more.

641
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,200
I don't need it.

642
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,850
I need you.

643
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,970
I'm having goosebumps.

644
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,640
I'll go help San.

645
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,560
I can't take it as well.

646
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,810
Let's go, Zhuqing.

647
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:49,890
Let's go to work too.

648
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,680
Zhuqing, I'll go with you.

649
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,970
San, let me help you add coal.

650
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,080
What are you trying to do?

651
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,850
You are pretending to sleep indeed.

652
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,040
I'm interested in that weapon of yours.

653
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,040
Give it to me

654
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,680
and I promise I won't kill you.

655
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,080
Impossible.

656
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,560
It's just an item

657
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,450
that is slightly valuable.

658
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,290
Why sacrifice your life

659
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,160
over something like that?

660
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,930
You are wrong.

661
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,770
This item

662
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,160
is more important than my life.

663
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,850
I joined the team to train

664
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,680
and find a suitable soul ring.

665
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,640
I'm not interested in a soul bone,

666
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,290
but other people shouldn't
covet my item as well.

667
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,400
Since this team doesn't want me in it,

668
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,850
I'll leave.

669
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,490
If you want to go,
leave your item behind.

670
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,720
After him!

671
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,850
A support branch soul master like you

672
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,290
is trying to escape from us?

673
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,240
Dream on.

674
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:23,410
It's a fierce beast.

675
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,520
We have gone too deep.

676
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:27,680
Retreat!

677
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:31,970
Boss.

678
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,560
Boss!

679
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,040
Save me.

680
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,010
Save me.

681
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,520
I beg you to save me.

682
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,240
I am the only son in my family.

683
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,810
My parents are sick in bed.

684
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,680
I joined this team
to earn some commission.

685
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,410
I was wrong.

686
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,010
Please save me.

687
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,490
I can't help you.

688
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,970
Wait.

689
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,890
I am a seven-ring War Soul Master.

690
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,010
My Martial Soul is the Snow Demon Bear.

691
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,770
I can see that you are not
an ordinary support branch soul master.

692
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,040
Let's team up.

693
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,240
I'll be helpful to you.

694
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,520
No!

695
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,850
I can't die.

696
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,640
I can't die.

697
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:43,680
Father!

698
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,600
I've been waiting for you to come back.

699
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,010
