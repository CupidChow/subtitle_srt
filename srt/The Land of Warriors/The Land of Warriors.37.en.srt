=The Land of Warriors=

00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,580
=Episode 37=

4
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,610
Is this Purple Pearl Island?

5
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,170
The Purple Pearl Pirates

6
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,984
are located on Purple Pearl Island

7
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:43,792
which is a two days' journey away
by boat.

8
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:45,150
They make a living from plundering.

9
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:46,860
Their captain, Purple Pearl,

10
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,420
is a 73-Level Soul Saint.

11
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,250
Is Purple Pearl your island master?

12
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,220
Do you know her?

13
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:55,664
I've heard about her.

14
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,730
I had an accident on the sea

15
00:01:57,776 --> 00:01:59,220
and got separated from my teammates.

16
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:01,250
I want to ask the Purple Pearl Pirates

17
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,660
to help me search for them.

18
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,610
I can hire them at a high price.

19
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,450
Hire them?

20
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,770
You might not be able to afford

21
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,140
our island master's fee.

22
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:10,890
Besides,

23
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,290
if you know about our Island Master,

24
00:02:12,336 --> 00:02:14,496
you should know what she does
to make a living.

25
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,100
No matter what she does,

26
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:18,020
she is also doing it for money.

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,840
I will give her a satisfying price.

28
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,170
Fine.

29
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,930
The Island Master
went out to sea with the pirates.

30
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,140
She's not on the island.

31
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,540
Ji Xiang!

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,540
Dr. Ji Xiang!

33
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,650
Coming!

34
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,580
Rest well.

35
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:32,864
When the Island Master is back,

36
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:33,952
I'll take you there.

37
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:35,984
The porridge on the table
was made this morning.

38
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:37,136
You slept for a few days.

39
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:37,792
Have some.

40
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,050
Thank you.

41
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,930
Ji Xiang's cooking

42
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,140
is not bad.

43
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,610
(I envy you.)

44
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,580
(You are eating seafood porridge.)

45
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,050
Wu?

46
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,770
Wu.

47
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,540
You're awake.

48
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,610
How do you feel?

49
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,930
I feel fine.

50
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,540
I woke up just now

51
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,050
but I felt like sleeping in.

52
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,980
Ji Xiang is Purple Pearl's subordinate.

53
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,020
He doesn't seem like a bad person.

54
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,930
You did wake up early.

55
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,610
Looks like the seafood porridge
has made you energetic.

56
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,020
San,

57
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,848
are you sure
you want to ask Purple Pearl

58
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:36,576
to help you find Boss Dai
and the others?

59
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,420
I wonder where Boss Dai is at

60
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,664
while bringing you with them.

61
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,020
I read the map previously.

62
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,980
There were many scattered islands around

63
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,860
and they are

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,700
not close by.

65
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,170
If we want to find them,

66
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,100
we must rely on Purple Pearl.

67
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,140
Discussing business
with the pirate captain

68
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,540
is as risky as getting a tiger's skin.

69
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,490
If we want to find them,

70
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:57,890
we have to give it a try.

71
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,380
Wu.

72
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,540
Close your eyes later.

73
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,490
Why?

74
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,140
Ji Xiang's clothes don't fit me.

75
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,584
I want to change into something else.

76
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:14,330
I see.

77
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:29,890
Wu,

78
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:31,650
have you closed your eyes?

79
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:33,568
You won't know
whether I closed them or not.

80
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:34,752
Just assume I've closed them.

81
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,770
That won't do.

82
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,940
Fine.

83
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,816
I'll close them.

84
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,330
San.

85
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,500
(You must train harder recently.)

86
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,700
Wu.

87
00:04:57,456 --> 00:04:58,368
What's wrong?

88
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,450
Why hasn't the bleeding stopped?

89
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:02,352
Press on him
and don't let him move around!

90
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,210
Quick!

91
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,650
Ji Xiang!

92
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,530
You must save my buddy's leg,
you hear me?

93
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,620
My skills are limited.

94
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:13,728
I can't guarantee anything.

95
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,770
If you don't believe me,

96
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,650
find someone else.

97
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,580
Do you want to die?

98
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:23,264
You're still being so rude
when you're begging him to save someone?

99
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,260
Just let him die.

100
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,700
Ji Xiang.

101
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:28,928
How dare you bring an outsider
onto the island!

102
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:29,970
Catch him!

103
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,210
Do you still want to save him?

104
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:42,580
Yes.

105
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:43,770
Yes.

106
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,500
Brat,

107
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,890
what...

108
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:06,020
What did you do to my buddy?

109
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,260
The bleeding has stopped.

110
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,850
If you want to save his leg,

111
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,260
apply medicine

112
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,290
and suture the wound.

113
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,260
Quick,

114
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,450
carry him to the bed.

115
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,530
Hurry.

116
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,450
You can take him away now.

117
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,090
Just use the medicine

118
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,020
I gave you previously

119
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,060
and let it recover.

120
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,020
Kneel.

121
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:29,696
Miracle Doctor Ji Xiang,

122
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,530
thank you for saving him.

123
00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:33,180
No need to thank me.

124
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,416
If you want to thank someone,

125
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,856
thank Mr. Tang San instead.

126
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,456
If he didn't stop the bleeding in time,

127
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:38,944
his leg would have to be amputated.

128
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:41,500
Thank you. Mr. Tang San.

129
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,290
Buddy,

130
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:45,376
I'm sorry for what happened just now.

131
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,650
He got hurt

132
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:47,530
and I was anxious.

133
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:48,944
If there's a chance in the future,

134
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,176
I'll treat you to a drink.

135
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,330
Sure.

136
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,530
Let's go.

137
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:02,820
Be careful.

138
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,820
Forgive them.

139
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,770
These pirates are hot-tempered

140
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,020
but they are sincere

141
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,264
and know what's right and wrong.

142
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:13,440
The silver needle
was your martial soul, right?

143
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,140
It's unique indeed.

144
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,560
What's the use of having
a silver needle as my martial soul?

145
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,112
I am an Innate Zero Soul Power.

146
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,330
A trash among trash.

147
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:36,608
A useless martial soul,
Blue Silver Grass.

148
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,500
No offense,

149
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,260
no defense,

150
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,529
and no supporting power.

151
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,380
Blue Silver Grass

152
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,160
is the standard form
of useless martial soul.

153
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:43,648
Even if you become a soul master,

154
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,280
you will still be a useless one.

155
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,020
If I had soul power,

156
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,890
I could also seal his vessel
with my silver needle

157
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,090
but I had none.

158
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,500
I will forever be a trash.

159
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:56,260
Who told you
an Innate Zero Soul Power is useless?

160
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,380
If you want to change,

161
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,020
there's a way to solve it.

162
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,330
Don't try to comfort me.

163
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,700
I've read many medical books

164
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,770
but to no avail.

165
00:08:06,256 --> 00:08:08,290
Only the legendary
Ten Thousand Year Ginseng

166
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:10,620
can help my soul power
achieve a breakthrough from zero.

167
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,380
However, that treasure is too precious.

168
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,890
It's not something

169
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:16,576
an ordinary person like me can obtain.

170
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:17,650
I've given up on it.

171
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,330
Although I have no soul power

172
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:24,144
and I'm destined not to become
an amazing healing soul master,

173
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,500
I can just become a normal doctor.

174
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:26,770
Saving the people I can save

175
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:27,776
is good enough.

176
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,500
Ji Xiang,

177
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,740
I'm not joking with you.

178
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,050
I have a way
to let you obtain soul power.

179
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:50,500
Ten Thousand Year Ginseng?

180
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,290
Right now,

181
00:08:57,552 --> 00:08:58,544
it belongs to you.

182
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,570
No.

183
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,740
This is too precious.

184
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,530
How much is it?

185
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,496
I'll buy it from you.

186
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,380
This is to repay you for saving me.

187
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,770
You deserve it.

188
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,220
You don't know

189
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,980
how long I've been looking for it.

190
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,050
Right now,

191
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,170
I can finally obtain soul power.

192
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,220
Ji Xiang,

193
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,890
as far as I know,

194
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,020
the Ginseng King
is just a medicinal catalyst.

195
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,220
If you want to achieve a breakthrough,

196
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,140
you need the appropriate technique.

197
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:30,340
Coincidentally,

198
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,020
I know the technique.

199
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:34,930
I thought
there was no longer hope for me.

200
00:09:34,944 --> 00:09:36,432
I didn't expect to meet my benefactor.

201
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:37,380
Please teach it to me.

202
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,980
If I can obtain soul power,

203
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,560
I'm willing to do anything for you.

204
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,570
You saved my life.

205
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,170
It is only natural for me to help you.

206
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,460
However,

207
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,530
the technique belongs to the clan.

208
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,260
I can't teach you in private.

209
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,100
So, I must think of a perfect way

210
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,620
or accept the punishment

211
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:57,810
according to the rules.

212
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,380
No.

213
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,100
How you can be punished to save me?

214
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:02,240
Please accept me as your disciple.

215
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:05,650
Ji Xiang.

216
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,810
Seeking a master is serious.

217
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,410
I am sincere.

218
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:10,860
Please accept me as a disciple.

219
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,570
I can only

220
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:15,200
use my medical skills to the utmost
if I obtain soul power.

221
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,570
Besides pirates,

222
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:18,784
there are also many normal islanders
on this island.

223
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,690
However, I am the only doctor
on this island.

224
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,380
Whenever I see

225
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,980
some people I can't save,

226
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,020
I hate myself for being too weak.

227
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,260
You are benevolent

228
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,140
and respect life.

229
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,140
You are born to become a doctor.

230
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,380
Since you are sincere
in becoming my disciple,

231
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,290
I will accept you

232
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,944
and teach you the technique

233
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,264
to help you
break through your own limits.

234
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,260
Master.

235
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:00,528
The Island Master is back.

236
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,220
Let's go.

237
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,100
Master.

238
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,690
The Island Master

239
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,040
might not agree to your request.

240
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,400
She might even punish you

241
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:08,440
for hiding on the island
without permission.

242
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:09,696
I'm worried about your safety.

243
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:10,290
Ji Xiang.

244
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,740
Do you know Captain Hai?

245
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,530
I know.

246
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:16,140
He is a pirate captain
who surrendered to the island master.

247
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,570
He caused harm to my friend.

248
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:20,144
They encountered the ocean soul beast

249
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:21,072
and we lost contact.

250
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,650
Since he is
a subordinate of Purple Pearl,

251
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:26,032
I'm going
to get an explanation from Purple Pearl.

252
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,860
I see.

253
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,890
Captain Hai is unorthodox

254
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,620
and evil.

255
00:12:29,968 --> 00:12:31,984
The Island Master
reprimanded him many times.

256
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,696
The Island Master
had the intention

257
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:35,568
to remove him
from the Purple Pearl Pirates.

258
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,740
Captain Hai did such evil things

259
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,020
and perished at sea.

260
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,690
However,

261
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,460
Purple Pearl is
the leader of the pirates.

262
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,020
Does he still care about

263
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,860
what his subordinates do?

264
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,872
You've misunderstood.

265
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,890
The Island Master

266
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:50,640
has been robbing the rich
to help the poor.

267
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:52,290
Most of the items they plundered

268
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,390
were given to fishing villages
that live a poor life.

269
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:55,740
You can tell the Island Master

270
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,690
what Captain Hai did.

271
00:12:56,928 --> 00:12:59,008
I'm sure
she will give you an explanation.

272
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,340
I didn't expect you to hold
Purple Pearl in such high regard.

273
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:06,496
However, I don't care
how he is as a person.

274
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,260
The explanation I want

275
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,020
is to use her power

276
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,410
to help me find my friends.

277
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,500
Master,

278
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:39,056
that is the place
where our Island Master is living.

279
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:46,650
Boss Dai.

280
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,340
San.

281
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,290
Wu!

282
00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:59,376
(Purple Pearl,
Island Master of Purple Pearl Island)

283
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,810
Hectomillennium Soul Ring?

284
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,050
The leader of a pirate is a woman?

285
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,770
Master,

286
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,410
stop!

287
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,620
San!

288
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,872
This is a misunderstanding.

289
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,008
She is not a bad person.

290
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:12,140
But she bullied Wu!

291
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,890
She is your woman?

292
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:14,930
That's right.

293
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,380
I am bullying her.

294
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,930
Who told her to starve?

295
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,170
Do you know?

296
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:22,140
She was floating at the sea for too long

297
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,770
and she was too hungry

298
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,620
and almost choked on the food.

299
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:35,980
Stop.

300
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,340
No!

301
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:40,340
You...

302
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,650
Stop eating.

303
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:49,890
Stop eating.

304
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,290
Then,

305
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,890
what about them?

306
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,690
She tied us outside

307
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,568
so the sunlight
could help resist our chilling poison.

308
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,290
After we fell into the sea,

309
00:16:12,352 --> 00:16:13,648
we exhausted all our strength

310
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:15,408
so we could only float on the ocean.

311
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,650
However, we met a
Hectomillenium Ocean Soul Beast.

312
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,260
It has a unique chilling poison on it.

313
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:22,464
Apart from Wu
who ate Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng

314
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:24,592
and Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet,

315
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:26,288
the rest of us have been poisoned.

316
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:29,376
Finally, the Purple Pearl sailed past
and saved us

317
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:30,496
back on the island.

318
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:31,690
The poison cannot be cured

319
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:34,368
so the Island Master had no choice
but to put us under the sun

320
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,376
to resist the poison.

321
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,260
I want to torture them.

322
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,650
I dare you to kill me.

323
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,860
You are a coward

324
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,050
if you dare not do it.

325
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,690
Come!

326
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:45,690
Sorry.

327
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,530
I was being reckless.

328
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,736
I don't accept your apology.

329
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,689
If you want a fight,

330
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,140
fight me fair and square.

331
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:52,170
Island Master,

332
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:54,880
my friends are still
suffering from the chilling poison.

333
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,570
Please let me treat them first.

334
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,660
This inner core has so many uses.

335
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,770
I would've taken it from you

336
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,728
if you weren't planning
to use it to treat Wu.

337
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:28,589
As expected of San,

338
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,952
our chilling poison has been cured.

339
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:30,960
Thank you, San.

340
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,420
I misunderstood.

341
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,980
I apologise once again.

342
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,130
Captain Hai purposely sailed
to the Whale King region

343
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,610
and awakened it to attack us.

344
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:50,640
That was why the incident happened.

345
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,420
Island Master,

346
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,090
thank you for saving my friends.

347
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,850
All of you came back
from the Whale King region alive?

348
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:57,920
That's impossible.

349
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,740
You must be bluffing.

350
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,980
Even I dare not
approach the Whale King region.

351
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,570
Why would that coward Captain Hai
bring you there?

352
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,050
Wasn't he afraid of death?

353
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,610
Captain Hai lured us onto his boat

354
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,020
and wanted to rob us.

355
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,770
After we saw his plans,

356
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,328
I pushed his only son down the sea

357
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,640
while we were fighting.

358
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,770
To take revenge,

359
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,130
he lost his mind.

360
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,770
Right now, he is perished at the sea.

361
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,130
Captain Hai

362
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,900
cannot change his behaviour.

363
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,180
He deserved to be punished.

364
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:26,330
There was a reason why he died.

365
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,050
I saved all seven of them

366
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:30,816
so consider it as helping my
former subordinate do the right thing.

367
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:31,728
In that case,

368
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,330
we are even.

369
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:36,460
Island Master, take care.

370
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,810
We are leaving.

371
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,420
Who allowed you to leave?

372
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:42,940
Island Master.

373
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,850
Master.

374
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,370
Let's talk this out.

375
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,090
Shut up!

376
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,740
I haven't punished you

377
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,408
for bringing someone onto the island.

378
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,290
These are two different matters.

379
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,260
Captain Hai's issue has been dealt with

380
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,420
but you trespassed on my place

381
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,530
and ruined my reputation.

382
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,370
How can I lead my men in the future?

383
00:18:58,464 --> 00:18:59,520
If you want to leave,

384
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,500
you must follow the island's rules

385
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,850
and take me on.

386
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,330
Let's have a fight.

387
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,370
Hurry.

388
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,370
What if I don't want to fight?

389
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,530
I will keep your cute girlfriend here

390
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,660
to accompany me.

391
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,850
Don't forget.

392
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,370
This is my turf.

393
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,980
With a single command,

394
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,648
I'll have a thousand ways
to stop you from leaving this island.

395
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,660
If you want a competition,

396
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,660
I can entertain you.

397
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,740
However, Wu must never be the wager.

398
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,090
If I win,

399
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,090
let us go.

400
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,220
If I lose,

401
00:19:35,728 --> 00:19:37,090
you can do whatever you want to me.

402
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:37,660
Fine.

403
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,810
Let's make it a big one.

404
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:40,940
At this place,

405
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,700
the stronger person

406
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,180
is the leader.

407
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,980
If you win against me today,

408
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,700
I'll accept you as my leader

409
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,700
and obey you.

410
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:49,850
All right.

411
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:51,290
Here's the joss stick.

412
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,370
There's no need.

413
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,660
We don't do this here.

414
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,330
Someone,

415
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,180
get the equipment.

416
00:19:59,050 --> 00:19:59,660
Do you know this?

417
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,176
I've never tried it before

418
00:20:04,322 --> 00:20:06,652
but I can give it a try.

419
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:13,216
Whoever throws further away
from the bullseye

420
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,050
will drink.

421
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,220
The person who gets drunk first loses.

422
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:17,500
All right.

423
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,220
Great!

424
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,220
See?

425
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,220
That was an example.

426
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:41,984
Thanks for going easy on me.

427
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:48,850
Again.

428
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,610
Great!

429
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,980
Great!

430
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,460
Again!

431
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,530
Again!

432
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:21,610
Again!

433
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,850
Again!

434
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,370
Again!

435
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,700
Island Master,

436
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,220
do you still want to continue

437
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,850
or are you going to surrender?

438
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,740
Don't be arrogant.

439
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,220
I, Purple Pearl, will never be drunk.

440
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,700
However,

441
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:50,740
I'm very full now.

442
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,050
I see it now.

443
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,290
You set me up.

444
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,770
You were not being honest.

445
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,090
This doesn't count.

446
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,940
What do you want?

447
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,610
Let's have a fight.

448
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,500
If you win,

449
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,090
I'll keep my promise.

450
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,290
However, we will do it
according to my rules.

451
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,180
Let's fight at the beach.

452
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,420
Sure.

453
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,180
A delicious dish from the continent.

454
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,020
Strawberry Mapo Tofu.

455
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,460
The cook

456
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,700
is Miss Liu Erlong.

457
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,900
The first bite takes your soul.

458
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,168
The second bite
makes you lose your mind.

459
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,700
The third bite brings you to paradise.

460
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:47,980
If Purple Pearl loses,

461
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,850
all of you must eat this.

462
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,130
There's finally a way

463
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,660
to use the food
Ms. Erlong prepared for us.

464
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,180
This is

465
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,460
a precious gift of Purple Pearl Island.

466
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,660
Dragon Fruit Lobster Bisque.

467
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,020
The cook

468
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,500
is Captain Purple Pearl.

469
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,420
It lets you experience having
rotten prawns dancing in your stomach.

470
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,740
You can't swallow it

471
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,768
but you can't chew it as well.

472
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,130
Its highlight is how disgusting it is.

473
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,810
If Tang San loses,

474
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,660
this plate belongs to all of you.

475
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,090
All right!

476
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,940
Now that the stage is set,

477
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,020
Tang San, the chief of Tang Clan,

478
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,330
and Purple Pearl,
the master of Purple Pearl Island

479
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,180
will decide their fate in this battle.

480
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,050
Let's look forward to it.

481
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,130
Purple Pearl is familiar with the area.

482
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
She has the home-ground advantage.

483
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,770
She has reached the beach.

484
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,940
What did I say?

485
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,420
Our leader won't lose.

486
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:38,700
Exactly.

487
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,260
This is bad.

488
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,290
Purple Pearl is an ocean soul master.

489
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,530
How could San let her go to the beach?

490
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,290
No one can win against Island Master

491
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,260
on this ocean.

492
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,020
If you don't believe it,

493
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,180
just wait until you are served
with the Dragon Fruit Lobster Bisque.

494
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,610
Teleport?

495
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,770
Interesting.

496
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,020
It has been a long time

497
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,290
since an opponent
who piques my interest appeared.

498
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,260
Tang San,

499
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,130
do you know

500
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,940
what the ocean means
to ocean soul masters?

501
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,130
It means you will surely lose.

502
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,220
Xiang,

503
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,460
how's the situation?

504
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,850
They are gone.

505
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,810
Both of them vanished
after entering the ocean.

506
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:46,770
San.

507
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,260
Cousin?

508
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,330
I'm sure the Island Master won.

509
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,420
You fool!

510
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,020
Shut up!

511
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,770
Island Master?

512
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,180
Where are you?

513
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,610
There's no need to find her.

514
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,220
Your Island Master

515
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:02,850
is here.

516
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,700
That's impossible.

517
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,420
How can she be inside?

518
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:11,500
You used a trick.

519
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,570
I said shut up!

520
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,980
This is the second skill of my
Vast Sea and Universe Shield,

521
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,500
Vast Sea Stabilizing Shroud.

522
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,500
It can trap someone inside

523
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,740
so they can't move around freely.

524
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:23,980
That's enough.

525
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:24,850
Let me out!

526
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,260
Don't forget your promise.

527
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:32,940
Island Master!

528
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,020
Purple Pearl.

529
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,570
Winning and losing is common.

530
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,330
Don't take it to heart.

531
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,020
Come.

532
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,020
Be my guest.

533
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:52,940
What is this?

534
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,660
Island Master,

535
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,980
I thought they would surely lose

536
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,370
so I made a wager with them.

537
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,500
Fine.

538
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,420
I admit my defeat.

539
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,420
I'll eat it first.

540
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,020
Actually,

541
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,370
this dish

542
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,500
is quite delicious.

543
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,020
It's not bad.

544
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,810
It's as delicious as my cooking.

545
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,420
In the future,

546
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,090
I want to have
a cooking competition with her.

547
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,180
What a surprise.

548
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,290
What a surprise.

549
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,330
If Ms. Erlong is here,

550
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,020
she will be so touched that she cries.

551
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,740
We agreed on this.

552
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,220
If you win,

553
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,220
I will obey your command.

554
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,180
Leader,

555
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,850
I'll serve you from now on.

556
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,020
Leader,

557
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,770
we will serve you from now on.

558
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,530
All of you, stand up.

559
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,770
All of you can go back and rest.

560
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,530
Purple Pearl,

561
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,900
I need

562
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,420
to use your room.

563
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,940
My friends need to rest here.

564
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:10,740
Leader,

565
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,130
let me serve you.

566
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,090
No need.

567
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,460
You just need
to prepare some food and drinks.

568
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:21,740
That's all?

569
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,420
Nothing else?

570
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,980
Yes.

571
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,460
Let's go.

572
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:34,900
Master.

573
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,290
Martial Uncles.

574
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,090
Please enjoy.

575
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,370
Thank you.

576
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,020
I didn't expect San

577
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,050
to get another disciple here.

578
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,260
Something special must have happened.

579
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:45,740
That's right.

580
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,420
Thanks to Ji Xiang for saving me.

581
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,660
Otherwise,

582
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,370
all of you
might not be able to see me again.

583
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,460
Master,

584
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,500
don't say that.

585
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,080
I was born on Haishen Island

586
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,330
and was an Innate Zero Soul Energy

587
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,050
so my parents sent me here

588
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,570
and asked Captain Purple Pearl
to take care of me.

589
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,570
Besides the Captain,

590
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,330
you are my most important benefactor.

591
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,370
Your house is on Haishen Island?

592
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,610
We are heading to your home.

593
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,370
Why are you going to Haishen Island?

594
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,130
To train.

595
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,570
Master,

596
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,530
I advise you

597
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,700
to forget about going to Haishen Island.

598
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,610
Why?

599
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,180
Because outsiders who go there
only end in two ways.

600
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,420
They either get chased out of the island

601
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,770
or get the chance
to take the God of Ocean's trial.

602
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,660
If they pass,
they can stay on Haishen Island

603
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,980
but they can no longer leave.

604
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,610
However, we need to improve

605
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,980
to fight against Martial Soul Hall.

606
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,420
Martial Soul Hall?

607
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,980
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

608
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,530
They've always wanted us to join them.

609
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,180
They caused us a lot of trouble

610
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,130
publicly and secretly.

611
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,700
I fully support you

612
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,900
for going against them.

613
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,460
I didn't expect Martial Soul Hall

614
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,180
to extend their influence to this place.

615
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,500
Haishen Island is a sacred land
for ocean soul masters.

616
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,500
As the envoy of the God of Ocean,
Grand Priests of the past

617
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,700
led the strongest ocean soul masters

618
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,420
to worship the God of Ocean.

619
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,330
Natives have
the right to live on the island

620
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,370
until they are 18 since they were born.

621
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,610
Their right to stay will be decided
after taking the God of Ocean's trial.

622
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,420
After outsiders arrive on the island,

623
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,610
they must pass

624
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,500
the trial of arrival
if they want to stay.

625
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,420
God of Ocean?

626
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,020
Does God really exist

627
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,050
in this world?

628
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:15,940
Yes.

629
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,980
God of Ocean exists.

630
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,770
Most soul masters on Haishen Island

631
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,900
saw the God of Ocean
with their own eyes.

632
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,020
Is the trial given by the God of Ocean

633
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,050
a way to show himself?

634
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,900
The God of Ocean doesn't show himself
during the trial.

635
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,980
It is carried out by the Grand Priest.

636
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,810
The Grand Priest is known
as the God of Ocean's servant.

637
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,940
The Grand Priest guards

638
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,130
the Ocean of God's might all his life

639
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
and carries out the duties
the God of Ocean bestows upon it.

640
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,700
In that case,

641
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,020
this is still a trial given by humans.

642
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,130
I can't describe it.

643
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,420
However, only those
who went through the trial before

644
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,260
could understand what happened.

645
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,500
Ji Xiang.

646
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,530
You grew up on Haishen Island.

647
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,810
Do you know
what is the God of Ocean's trial

648
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,020
specifically?

649
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,980
I heard different soul masters

650
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,940
will have different trials

651
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,460
so they can't
share the experience with others.

652
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,500
However, I want to remind you.

653
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:08,810
The God of Ocean

654
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,180
will fully utilize
the power of the ocean

655
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,090
and no one can go against it.

656
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,570
The trial given by Him

657
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,330
is a disaster
for soul masters of the land.

658
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,370
All of you might die in the trial.

659
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,220
When a person's power

660
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,260
has reached a point that cannot be met,

661
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:23,980
this person

662
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,050
might have exceeded
the limits of human soul masters.

663
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,050
The God of Ocean
whom all of you speak of

664
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,980
should be

665
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,530
a 99-Level Ocean Soul Master

666
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,900
who has exceeded
the limits of human soul masters.

667
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,020
Yes.

668
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,900
The Grand Priest
has Level 99 soul power.

669
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,500
The God of Ocean

670
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,660
must be an existence
who exceeds Level 99.

671
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,220
Exceeds Level 99?

672
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,130
From what you told us,

673
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,610
we know of an incredibly strong presence
called the God of Ocean.

674
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,220
Our goal of this journey is firmer now

675
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,220
which is to exceed our limits.

676
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,330
All right.

677
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,810
Here's a toast for all of you.

678
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,290
The ones who win against me
are different indeed.

679
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,980
I will send you off

680
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,290
on your trip to Haishen Island

681
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,770
and give you all the help I can.

682
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,020
Cheers!

683
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,420
Cheers!

684
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,090
Cheers!

685
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,180
Island Master.

686
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,130
We will be able
to see Haishen Island soon.

687
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,290
Drop the anchor

688
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:02,980
and stop the ship!

689
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,020
Drop the anchor!

690
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,090
Stop the ship!

691
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,770
Haishen Island is ahead.

692
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,530
I can only send you off here.

693
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,180
If we go further,

694
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,180
we will enter
the region of the protection beast,

695
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,530
Devil White Shark King.

696
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,180
They will attack

697
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,770
any ships that approach the island.

698
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,420
I don't want to offend
the might of the God of Ocean.

699
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,420
The protection beast was once
the God of Ocean's mount.

700
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,370
The God of Ocean left it here

701
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:34,810
to protect Haishen Island.

702
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,660
It has extremely strong offense.

703
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,020
Even the Magic Whale King
is afraid of it.

704
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,940
Let us off here.

705
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,500
When we see Haishen Island,

706
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,180
we will think of a way to get on it.

707
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,020
What is a protection beast?

708
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,700
Is it more aggressive
than the Magic Whale King?

709
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,220
The protection beast

710
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,290
is a great white shark
with ten thousand years

711
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,460
of cultivation.

712
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,900
Moreover, it has great speed

713
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,020
and strong offense.

714
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,290
It is known as the Ocean Hunter.

715
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,180
I heard it killed many soul masters

716
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,460
before they could get on the island.

717
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,180
Master,

718
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,850
it's still not too late to turn back.

719
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,700
Since we are already here,

720
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,130
how can we go back?

721
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,020
Don't worry.

722
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,330
We will arrive on Haishen Island alive.

723
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,900
I still need to remind you.

724
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,900
Besides the protection beast,

725
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,660
there are also hundreds of
great white sharks around here

726
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,740
and they are extremely fast.

727
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,460

759
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,980
It's the activation button

760
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,080
and also the steering wheel.

761
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,860
This Dragon Boat is amazing.

762
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,050
The Sea Elder said

763
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,210
if there's danger,

764
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,050
the crystal wheel will turn red

765
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,860
and show a warning.

766
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,340
Look!

767
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,500
It sends out
such a huge amount of energy.

768
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,650
This should be the protection beast
that the Purple Pearl spoke about,

769
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,460
the Devil White Shark King.

770
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,690
Those behind its back
must be a school of great white sharks.

771
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,250
They are catching up.

772
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,050
This is the limit of the Dragon Boat.

773
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,780
The Devil White Shark King
is the Ocean God's mount.

774
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,500
We will lose in a battle of speed.

775
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,530
We have to battle no matter what.

776
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,820
Should we take a gamble?

777
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,500
Didn't we come here

778
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,650
to take a gamble?

779
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,020
Vast Sea Protective Barrier.

780
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:46,730
Wu,

781
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,420
are you all right?

782
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,500
We will meet again.

783
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,980
The Vast Sea Protective Barrier
has blocked the waters.

784
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,730
The Dragon Boat
is no longer in the water.

785
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,940
I didn't expect
the Vast Sea Protective Barrier

786
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,820
to have the ability to repel water

787
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,050
which made the boat lose its buoyancy

788
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,210
and fall here.

789
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,460
However, the boat can't do anything

790
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,380
without the movement of the seawater.

791
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,610
The Vast Sea Protective Barrier

792
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,860
is enduring
the pressure of the seawater.

793
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,460
Even if I use my soul power,

794
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,380
I still can't get it to move.

795
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,340
I wished
this thing could move on its own.

796
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,050
We can walk out of this place

797
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,020
under the Vast Sea
Protective Barrier's protection.

798
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,820
The power of Vast Sea Protective Barrier

799
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,650
seems to be stronger under the sea
compared to when it was used on land.

800
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,460
Your observation is sharp.

801
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,130
The Vast Sea Protective Barrier

802
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,250
has a strong affinity with the sea.

803
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,820
Once it is in the deep sea,

804
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,460
the blue energy will become stronger.

805
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,730
It's very amazing.

806
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,380
It is fated with the sea.

807
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,300
You used it to win against
the Purple Pearl pirates

808
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,130
and avoided the Devil White Shark King.

809
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,650
I hope it can still bring us good luck

810
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,090
when we arrive at Haishen Island.

811
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,130
We will arrive on the island soon.

812
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,570
Let's pack up.

813
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,940
We finally arrived at Haishen Island.

814
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,530
They don't seem hostile.

815
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:26,780
Let's go.

816
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,690
Let's follow them

817
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,730
and see where they bring us.

818
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,300
What's going on?

819
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,900
Is this a welcoming ritual?

820
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,020
They are so welcoming.

821
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,170
Why didn't we have such treatment

822
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,090
at Purple Pearl Island?

823
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,780
The outside world has
a huge bias against Haishen Island.

824
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,300
Let's rectify its reputation.

825
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,500
How did

826
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:04,860
all of you sneak in here?

827
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,210
Elder,

828
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,250
we've heard about
the reputation of Haishen Island

829
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,610
and came here for a trial on purpose.

830
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,530
For decades,

831
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,420
only a few people have arrived here

832
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,300
by breaking through
the protection beast's protection.

833
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,500
We just got lucky.

834
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:22,980
We hope you can

835
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,530
bring us to accept the trial.

836
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,460
The trial of the God of the Ocean
is unrelated to your cultivation.

837
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,500
It can be as easy as grasping sand

838
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,090
or as hard as

839
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,900
asking you to challenge
a Hectomillennium Soul Beast.

840
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,900
Once you accept it,

841
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:38,860
you cannot back down.

842
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,860
I advise you
to leave as soon as possible.

843
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:42,860
We have decided.

844
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,730
We will never change our decision
to participate in the trial.

845
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,090
Come with me then.

846
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:05,900
Once you are in Haishen Island,

847
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,210
don't use your spiritual power
to search for something

848
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,210
or use any secret art.

849
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,500
Everything here

850
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,650
is protected by the God of the Ocean.

851
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,900
His might isn't something
you can go against.
