=The Land of Warriors=

2
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

3
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:35,340
=Episode 3=

4
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,330
Father.

5
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:00,740
Father.

6
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,610
(A test.)

7
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,260
Is the test over?

8
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,610
Of course not.

9
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,100
Don't hold back

10
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,410
because it's me.

11
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,690
Unleash your all.

12
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,780
Show me what you're truly made of.

13
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,260
That's more like it.

14
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,260
(My Profound Jade Hand)

15
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,980
(couldn't block the secret weapons
Father used.)

16
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,360
(Is this)

17
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,160
(the difference of our strengths?)

18
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,060
The fruit is pretty good.

19
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,410
Come down.

20
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,450
Give me your hand.

21
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
Not too bad.

22
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,570
But you're still too weak.

23
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,290
I won't be weak forever.

24
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,220
Those moves didn't seem like
they were taught by Yu Xiaogang.

25
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:12,850
Who taught you?

26
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,370
The Sacred Record
of the Profound Heaven.

27
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,730
Tang Faction.

28
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,240
Where did you get this?

29
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,190
I found it at the hill behind
Spirit Saint Village when I was little.

30
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,580
How come I never heard about it?

31
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,540
I took it as a leisurely book.

32
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,660
Later I noticed

33
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,140
that the skills written in it

34
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,990
were different from
what Soul Masters learned.

35
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,660
At the time,

36
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,900
you were feeling down and under
after Mother died.

37
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,660
So I didn't want to bother you with it.

38
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:55,980
Father.

39
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,790
Don't drink so much.

40
00:04:59,250 --> 00:04:59,850
Eat this.

41
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,290
(Father.)

42
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,900
(Don't drink so much.)

43
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,170
Eat this.

44
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,250
Yeah.

45
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,050
Do you know how to become a good smith?

46
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,290
In manuals,

47
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,850
one who can use good quality materials
to create sacred relics

48
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,930
is a master smith.

49
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,250
One who can create sacred relics
using normal ores

50
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,990
can be called a master smith.

51
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:43,930
Come.

52
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,250
Take the hammer.

53
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,730
If you can keep on hitting
for 10,000 times,

54
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,220
then you'll become a good smith.

55
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,930
These secret weapons

56
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,810
are made with rare

57
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,370
and precious metals.

58
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,540
Where did you get the money?

59
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,370
I earned some money working
at the blacksmith shop.

60
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,100
There's also the prize money
from the Fighting Soul Arena.

61
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,890
Previously, I made a batch
of secret weapons

62
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,240
and sold them to
the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Clan.

63
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,200
That got me a good sum.

64
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,410
Learn how to survive
while you learn new skills.

65
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,100
Making secret weapons
is a way of cultivation too.

66
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,340
Besides,

67
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,540
the Clear Sky Hammer martial soul
is the world's best forging tool.

68
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,700
When I find the rare metals,

69
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,900
I will make all the powerful weapons

70
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,100
written in the Sacred Record

71
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,250
of the Profound Heaven.

72
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,050
The Sacred Record did teach you
many things.

73
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,900
But as your father,

74
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,170
I taught you too little.

75
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,020
No, Father.

76
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,610
What you taught me

77
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,340
is priceless.

78
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,700
If I didn't have the Chaos Cloak Hammer,

79
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,990
I wouldn't have been able
to make the Tang weapons.

80
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,100
Tang Faction.

81
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,730
I've never heard of this faction.

82
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,660
Maybe it's

83
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,410
an ancient faction
that no longer exists.

84
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,660
Or perhaps

85
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,580
it came from a different world.

86
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,540
If such a faction did exist,

87
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,020
it must have perished because of

88
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,980
a great disaster.

89
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,930
Just look at what's written.

90
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,460
It must have been repeatedly studied
and edited by generations of masters.

91
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,050
(Purple Demon Eye)
What's precious aren't the techniques,

92
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,290
but the determination of the faction
to pass on its legacy

93
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,370
and principles.

94
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,410
You were lucky
to have learned their ways.

95
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,980
So you're considered a Tang disciple.

96
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,370
Indeed.

97
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,930
I appreciate this stroke of luck.

98
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,570
And I've long considered myself

99
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,980
a true Tang disciple
and study its ways diligently.

100
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,460
Wu said something similar as well.

101
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:13,660
Father.

102
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,780
How much long do I have to practice
before I can look for Wu?

103
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,980
Maybe another 10 years.

104
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,020
Ten years?

105
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,700
What if I put in double the effort?

106
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,370
Twenty years.

107
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,780
Why?

108
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,250
No way. Wu
can't wait for me that long.

109
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,140
What if I practice all day and night?

110
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,580
If you do that, you'll kill yourself.

111
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,340
You haven't grasped
the premise of cultivation.

112
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,340
I get it.

113
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,710
I won this at
the Soul Master Tournament,

114
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,340
a wisdom skull for spiritual cohesion.

115
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,010
If I absorbed this,

116
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,100
my soul will become stronger.

117
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,980
I'll be able to handle
harder cultivation.

118
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:48,850
Father.

119
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,730
Help me absorb it.

120
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:58,940
You mean now?

121
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,340
Absorbing any Soul Bones

122
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,530
is a test on both your body and mind.

123
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,010
A Soul Bone containing over 50,000 years

124
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,180
of wisdom

125
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,420
can indeed elevate your spiritual power
ten-fold.

126
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,220
However,

127
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,010
we scaled mountains and rivers
to get here.

128
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,300
If you absorbed it

129
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,250
while in a fatigued state,

130
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,730
it'd be akin to suicide.

131
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,300
I...

132
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,700
That's enough.

133
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,370
Focus on recuperating.

134
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,300
I'll help you absorb it tomorrow.

135
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,990
But I don't want to waste anymore time.

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,710
Tomorrow has its own share
of things to do.

137
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,820
I've explained myself.

138
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,180
Go to sleep.

139
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,160
♪The wind whispers,
shaking the moonlight♪

140
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,320
♪Sprinkling it on the starry forest
and grassy fields♪

141
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,640
♪Your image is etched in my heart♪

142
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,560
♪No matter where we go♪

♪If fate stirs up waves♪

♪I will stand before you to shield you♪

145
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,280
♪Without retreating♪

146
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,220
(Wu,)

147
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,490
(your mother is gone.)

148
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,220
(You must feel so alone
returning to the forest.)

149
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,620
(Don't worry.)

150
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,380
(I will become stronger
with my father's help.)

151
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,700
(You won't have to wait long.)

152
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,420
(In fact,)

153
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,700
(I've always wondered why)

154
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,560
(he left back then.)

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,730
(Where did he go,)

156
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,580
(what did he do?)

157
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,370
(What grudges does he hold
against the Martial Soul?)

158
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,130
(Also,)

159
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,180
(who was my mother?)

160
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,730
(He wouldn't let me ask.)

161
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,530
(We are father and son,)

162
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,780
(but it feels awkward to be around him.)

163
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,590
(Maybe it's been too long
since we've seen each other.)

164
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,100
Erming!

165
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,530
Remove your gravity field

166
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,700
and let me out.

167
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,060
Daming said no.

168
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,730
Daming!

169
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,180
I want to go practice.

170
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:38,940
Show her.

171
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,580
Although the Amethyst Radish
is the best divine herb

172
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,090
that can help you soft-boned rabbits
increase spiritual power,

173
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,580
it grows in the mixed zone.

174
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,420
There are fierce plants
and beasts in the area.

175
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,650
Right now, you are just
a normal human soul master.

176
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,940
It's too risky to look for it yourself.

177
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,770
If you come across someone
from the Martial Soul Hall,

178
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,700
it would be disastrous.

179
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,340
That's why you should just focus
on your cultivation.

180
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,340
We'll go and pick the herb.

181
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,420
Have you two forgotten

182
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,640
that I grew up here too?

183
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,100
I'm familiar with how to safely
leave and enter the core zone.

184
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,340
Moreover, the key to cultivation

185
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,700
is not relying on outside help.

186
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,730
Every advancement

187
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,530
has to be achieved with one's own hands.

188
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,060
So stop holding me back, you two.

189
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,650
Whatever it is,

190
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,730
I do not agree.

191
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,100
Then I'll have to do it by force.

192
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,370
Stop it!

193
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,220
You'll get hurt in the realm.

194
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:42,890
Erming!

195
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,610
Miss Wu.

196
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,730
You two...

197
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,580
Are you hurt, Miss Wu?

198
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,460
You two.

199
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,700
Stop getting in the way
of my cultivation.

200
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,610
If I can't improve on my own,

201
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,890
how am I supposed to protect myself
from enemies later on?

202
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,980
Miss Wu,

203
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,730
don't be angry.

204
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,570
Give it to me.

205
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,530
Stop acting dumb.

206
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,420
The Amethyst Radish.

207
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,630
You've already picked it.

208
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,580
Might as well eat it.

209
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,970
I'm going somewhere else to practice.

210
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,060
I don't want you two following me.
Got that?

211
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,370
Come here.

212
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,100
Look over there.

213
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:54,990
They're here again.

214
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,420
Watch them. I'll inform the teacher.

215
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,770
(Shrek Academy, Heaven Dou City)

216
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,700
Ms. Erlong.

217
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,580
Did you have to embarrass me like that

218
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,130
in front of the juniors?

219
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,060
It was only a demonstration

220
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,530
You went too hard.

221
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,180
Enough whining from you.

222
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,940
Yeah, it's just a scratch.

223
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,890
Ms. Erlong,

224
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,980
I'll do it myself.

225
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,820
I don't get it.

226
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,420
My Martial Soul without the evil fire

227
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,790
is still considered a top-level
Phoenix Martial Soul.

228
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,730
How did it fail to beat Boss Dai and San?

229
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,580
San and Mubai

230
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,300
have been molded by life itself.

231
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,580
The setbacks help nurture a Soul Master's
mental strength.

232
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,580
They tend to test the limits
during cultivation.

233
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,340
It's only natural to achieve more.

234
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,460
I see.

235
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,300
That's right.

236
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,700
All the flavors of life
aid in cultivation.

237
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,850
You've never experienced
love nor suffering.

238
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,990
So how would you level up?

239
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,730
You mean,
love affects one's cultivation?

240
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,580
Definitely.

241
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,770
Skills strengthen your body,
love strengthen the mind.

242
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,060
As we know, knowing the way is easy,
but finding in love is hard.

243
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,610
So being in love is a kind
of cultivation in itself.

244
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,770
How is it?

245
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,700
Is it dislocated?

246
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,340
It hurts.

247
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,370
I know it hurts.

248
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,700
That's why I'm fixing it for you.

249
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,060
Ouch! It hurts, Ms. Erlong!

250
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,060
Ms. Erlong!

251
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,340
How is it?

252
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,130
Feel better?

253
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,460
Give it a twirl.

254
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,060
I can't stay cooped up at the academy.

255
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,770
I'm going on an adventure.

256
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,890
I will experience the flavors of life.

257
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,700
Dean,

258
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,300
Grandmaster,

259
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,100
Ms. Erlong.

260
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,420
Farewell.

261
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,340
I don't suppose you're trying
to run from me.

262
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,220
Of course not.

263
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,420
I've always wanted to travel the continent.

264
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,820
So how is the reset?

265
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,060
Should I strengthen it for you?

266
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,820
Ms. Erlong.

267
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,250
I'm all good.

268
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,490
Feels as good as new.

269
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,700
Don't worry.

270
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,580
That's good.

271
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,890
Have a safe trip then.

272
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:00,980
Safe trip.

273
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,730
We finally got rid of him.

274
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,460
Men from the Martial Soul Hall
has been lurking outside.

275
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,850
They even tried to trick the students

276
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,850
into divulging Wu's whereabouts.

277
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,850
How brazen.

278
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,130
We've sorted out the kids.

279
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,850
Now we can focus on the matter at hand.

280
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,010
It is time

281
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,370
to put an end to it.

282
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,730
Phoenix Roar Air Strike!

283
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,420
This is Shrek's grounds.

284
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,100
Who said you guys could make a mess?

285
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,700
I'll show you.

286
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,370
Sir.

287
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,240
You are blatantly going against
the Martial Soul Hall.

288
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,660
To hell with the Martial Soul Hall.

289
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,620
Don't forget.

290
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,570
This is the Shrek Academy.

291
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,490
You don't have permission to be here.

292
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,490
Get lost!

293
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,290
Insolence.

294
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,190
Get them!

295
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,140
Lord elder.

296
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,240
Sorry for my impudence.

297
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,730
Tell your men

298
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,660
to quit messing around at Shrek Academy.

299
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,200
Yes, My Lord.

300
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,090
Retreat.

301
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,900
Let's go.

302
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,290
Why are you still here?

303
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,220
You dared lie to us?

304
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,530
Miss,

305
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,290
I didn't lie to you.

306
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,250
I only wanted to do a little something

307
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,980
for the academy before I left.

308
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,050
Besides,

309
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,730
you guys lied to me first.

310
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,090
I know you wanted to get rid of me

311
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,090
so you could take on
the Martial Soul Hall's men.

312
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,490
I said this before,

313
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,000
that I wanted to travel the continent.

314
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,090
I want to take on real challenges

315
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,490
that have no rules and without
the teachers' protection.

316
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,140
Then,

317
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,460
if I did come across
these despicable members

318
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,460
of the Martial Soul Hall,

319
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,460
I will defeat them with my own power.

320
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,570
Way to go!

321
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,190
Going out to see the world
is a good thing.

322
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,940
But you need to know your limits.

323
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,770
Even when you're standing up
for justice,

324
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,560
you have to first keep yourself safe.

325
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,290
Alright, let me wrap this up.

326
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,490
We're telling you

327
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,530
to be smarter.

328
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,660
This isn't like the usual group fights.

329
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,010
When you're on your own,

330
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,140
you have to be more aware.

331
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,530
Thanks for the reminder, miss.

332
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,620
I will do my best

333
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,220
to meet a companion
who shares my beliefs.

334
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,010
Is that what I said?

335
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,860
Weren't you?

336
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,940
He's right here.

337
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,520
Be thrifty at home and spend liberally
while travelling.

338
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,420
I don't have anything else to give you.

339
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,090
My only wish is
for your travels to be light.

340
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:52,980
Sir,

341
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,290
I didn't expect such generosity.

342
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,220
You actually gave me money for the road.

343
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,490
I'm so touched.

344
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:00,940
It's an empty pouch.

345
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,690
The money pouch is expensive!

346
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,880
It's a treasured collectible.

347
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,570
Now I remember.

348
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,050
I made food.

349
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,860
Let me grab them
and put them in the pouch.

350
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,460
Don't trouble yourself, Ms. Erlong.

351
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,730
Save them for the two teachers.

352
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,380
Disciple Ma Hongjun

353
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,090
hereby bids farewell to the teachers.

354
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,090
Do take care of yourselves.

355
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,730
Wait and see.

356
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,820
The teachers and student

357
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,940
shall meet again.

358
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,290
If I had known,

359
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,330
I wouldn't have beaten him so hard.

360
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,940
If not for the elder token today,

361
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,290
it would've been disastrous
for Shrek Academy.

362
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,570
Thankfully, when Haotian Douluo

363
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,900
entrusted his son to you,

364
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,250
he also gifted you the token.

365
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,330
He thought of everything.

366
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,180
He didn't gift it to me.

367
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,390
Excuse me. Who
is Grandmaster Yu Xiaogang?

368
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,490
That's me.

369
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,570
I bring an invitation
from the Emperor Xue Ye

370
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,420
to meet him at the palace
for a discussion.

371
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:24,940
Please come with me.

372
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,700
(Heaven Dou Palace)

373
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,660
(Snowy Night Emperor)

374
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,598
(Missing Soul Masters. Fire Sword Soul Saint)

375
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,800
(Steinbok Clan Soul King 4 persons,
Soul Elder 4 persons)

376
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,530
So many Soul Masters have gone missing.

377
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,980
In the last few years,
there were occasional news

378
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,620
of Soul Masters missing
in different cities.

379
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,290
As it's common for Soul Masters
to lose their lives

380
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,960
while hunting for soul rings
in the forest

381
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,380
or even participating
in underground fights,

382
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,770
I haven't paid it any heed.

383
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,490
Until the reports became more regular

384
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,900
in the past months.

385
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,670
His Majesty told me
to quietly investigate the matter.

386
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,210
Just last night, three members of the Sacred Condor Clan
and the Fire Sword Soul Saint

387
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,420
failed to return to their residences
in Heaven Dou City.

388
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,930
We're still in talks
for a potential partnership.

389
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,250
They have no reason to leave.

390
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,860
So something must be up

391
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,770
with their disappearance.

392
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,460
Your Majesty.

393
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,980
This is serious.

394
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,570
I can't wrap my head around it just yet.

395
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,900
Please allow me to return
and think it through.

396
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,570
I'll be counting on you.

397
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,090
I'll have the Crown Prince
look into it quietly for now.

398
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,050
Why are coughing again, Father?

399
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,220
Did you not have a good rest?

400
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,380
(Xue Qinghe, Heaven Dou's Crown Prince)

401
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,810
It's just a chill. Fret not.

402
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,490
This is the grandmaster I mentioned,

403
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,250
Yu Xiaogang.

404
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,620
Good to finally meet you.

405
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:30,900
Your Highness.

406
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,180
Grandmaster Yu,

407
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,730
there's another reason
why I asked you to come.

408
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,460
I'd like to appoint you
as the royal Soul Master Chief.

409
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,730
You will be conferred
the title of Count.

410
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,460
Your Majesty, I am not qualified.

411
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,620
Do not say no. I believe in you.

412
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,570
The Martial Soul Hall
is gaining more power.

413
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,380
The Star Luo Empire is watching closely.

414
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,220
I require someone like you

415
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,900
to cultivate talent.

416
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,810
That's right, Grandmaster.

417
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,460
The Shrek Seven Devils you trained
are known to be formidable.

418
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,860
Each one is an elite.

419
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,220
Especially the one named Tang San.

420
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,220
We are well aware of it.

421
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,220
My father appreciates
your teaching methods

422
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,180
as well as principles.

423
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,460
If you are personally at the helm

424
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,700
to cultivate talent,

425
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:23,530
I'm sure Heaven Dou will be able
to attract many skilled warriors

426
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,940
and no longer fear outside threats.

427
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,250
The Crown Prince speaks my mind.

428
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,580
You are born into

429
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:33,590
the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan
with three generations of grandmasters.

430
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,570
You are a citizen of Heaven Dou too.

431
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,620
I hope you'd be willing
to share my burden

432
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,530
and look after Heaven Dou's welfare.

433
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,420
I accept Your Majesty's offer
with gratitude.

434
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,660
(A beast trap.)

435
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,980
(A soul master from Soul Hunting Ring
likely set it up.)

436
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,380
Don't be scared. I'm here to help you.

437
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,900
Don't move. It's alright.

438
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,810
You're a little thing.

439
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,980
Why aren't you
in the outskirts of the forest?

440
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,530
Why did you come to the mixed zone?

441
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,290
Do you want me to bandage your wound?

442
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,860
Are you trying to lead me somewhere?

443
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,830
(It's the Martial Soul Hall.)

444
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,490
(Did they come looking for me?)

445
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,830
A few hundred years old piece of trash.

446
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:09,420
It's useless.

447
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,810
Is that

448
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,050
your mother?

449
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,250
There are some more traps ahead.

450
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,890
Maybe it caught some higher tier beasts.

451
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,010
Let's go check them out.

452
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,700
(The Martial Soul Hall
isn't here for me,)

453
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,220
(but to hunt for soul beasts.)

454
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,090
(Looks like a big operation.)

455
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,680
(What exactly is
the Martial Soul Hall up to?)

456
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,490
If my guess is correct,

457
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,980
this skull

458
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,290
was prepared by Bi Bi Dong

459
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,570
for her own pupil.

460
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:01,660
Hu Liena?

461
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,220
That's right.

462
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,570
She's like you.

463
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,090
She also needs

464
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,330
a spiritual skull.

465
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,900
As the Bi Bi Dong's successor,

466
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,620
I believe

467
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,660
she'd become your most
formidable opponent.

468
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,570
(So Father has been
observing my growth closely.)

469
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,380
Once I've absorbed this wisdom skull,

470
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,210
and my spiritual power is enhanced,

471
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,290
she would more likely submit to me.

472
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,730
There are a lot of risks
in absorbing this soul bone.

473
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,050
I will protect you from the side.

474
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,860
But remember this.

475
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,140
The most important thing

476
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,900
is to have a clear mind.

477
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,490
I can do it.

478
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,490
Let us get to it then, Father.

479
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,660
(With such impatience,)

480
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,250
(I wonder how you'd fare)

481
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,980
(in the wisdom soul bone's test.)

482
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,290
Another piece of trash.

483
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,570
Let's go.

484
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,380
(You dare treat Star Dou Forest)

485
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,860
(as the Martial Soul Hall's
hunting ground?)

486
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,220
Go and take a look.

487
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:25,530
My lord.

488
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,330
The traps were tampered with.

489
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,460
Let me down!

490
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,770
Let me down!

491
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,730
(Looks like the test has begun.)

492
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,420
San.

493
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,490
San.

494
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,180
San?

495
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,220
San.

496
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,220
Wu.

497
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:25,980
Wu.

498
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,420
Wu.

499
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,180
What are you doing here?

500
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,730
I missed you so much,

501
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,180
so I snuck away.

502
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,010
Let's not be apart again.

503
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,180
Okay.

504
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:50,770
Father.

505
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,220
Don't push Wu away.

506
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,330
Silly boy.

507
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,290
I can see

508
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,700
how important Wu is to you.

509
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,940
I wouldn't have the heart
to separate you two.

510
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,330
Life is short.

511
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,760
What matters is your own happiness.

512
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,380
Wu,

513
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,660
do you know

514
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,490
that you're always on my mind?

515
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,090
I do.

516
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,900
That's why I came to see you.

517
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,090
San,

518
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,050
let us stay here forever.

519
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,660
Just you and me,

520
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,010
growing old together.

521
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,140
Let's not bother
with the outside world, okay?

522
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:21,860
Okay.

523
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,050
But the teachers are worried about us.

524
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,460
We should go back to Shrek Academy.

525
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,490
No, I don't want to.

526
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,420
We'll be free

527
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,460
in this paradise.

528
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,730
The real Wu wouldn't be so indifferent
toward Shrek Academy.

529
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,970
Neither would she change her mind
about something.

530
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,290
She said she'd wait for me.

531
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,380
So she couldn't have left
Star Dou Forest.

532
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,660
Who are you?

533
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,140
Wu is right.

534
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,420
It wasn't easy for you to be together.

535
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,250
How could you think risking it now?

536
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,220
No.

537
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,150
You wanted me to focus
on my cultivation

538
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,190
and persuaded Wu to leave.

539
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,280
This can't be happening.

540
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:19,730
San.

541
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,940
You're the real Wu.

542
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:21,530
San.

543
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,660
You're not going anywhere.

544
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,140
And you're not my real father.

545
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,700
San, don't leave me.

546
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,010
Your spiritual power

547
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,900
is stronger than I thought.

548
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,490
I didn't expect
you'd pass the test so quickly.

549
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,730
If only it was real.

550
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,460
You saw Wu?

551
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,620
I knew it was fake,

552
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,220
but I couldn't let it go.

553
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,420
I've fully absorbed the wisdom skull.

554
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,730
How long will it take

555
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,620
if I give it my all?

556
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:20,980
Five years.

557
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,700
If you're able to withstand

558
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,240
ten attacks from me within five years,

559
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,980
then consider my condition met.

560
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,010
Let's begin then.

561
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,130
Father.

562
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,170
That's 10 attacks.

563
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,300
I said five years.

564
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,610
But

565
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,980
you managed to do it in three.

566
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,010
Father, does that mean
I can look for Wu now?

567
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,690
Take care, Father.

568
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:20,820
Wu!

569
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,460
Wu!

570
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,980
Wu!

571
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,010
Wu.

572
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,740
Who are you?

573
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,460
I don't know you.

574
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,130
I am San.

575
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,090
Tang San.

576
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,570
You left this for me.

577
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,490
Got you worried?

578
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,210
That's for making me wait so long.

579
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:05,780
Wu.

580
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,700
It's been three years.

581
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,460
You've finally come.

582
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,420
I'm sorry.

583
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:14,650
I came late.

584
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,010
From now on,

585
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,260
I will never leave you again.

586
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,780
You must have suffered

587
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,530
while I was away these years.

588
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,210
But I'm back now.

589
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,300
I'll protect you.

590
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:30,940
Now, listen.

591
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,740
We're supposed to cultivate
and become stronger together.

592
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,260
Who knows who'd protect who?

593
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,780
Well then,

594
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,210
I'm sure Miss Wu would be stronger.

595
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,780
I sense danger.

596
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:08,900
San.

597
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,900
This place is safe.

598
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,090
There is no danger.

599
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,210
No,

600
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,340
it's you.

601
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,420
You're in danger.

602
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,130
I'm right here.

603
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,260
I'm perfectly fine.

604
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,260
No.

605
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,690
My instinct is never wrong.

606
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,130
Wu.

607
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,460
Wu,

608
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,010
where is your bracelet?

609
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,980
I accidentally lost it.

610
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:38,980
What's wrong?

611
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,090
San!

612
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,050
Are you angry with me because

613
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:51,900
I lost the bracelet?

614
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,610
Please don't. I'm scared.

615
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,130
San!

616
00:38:59,130 --> 00:38:59,690
Stay away!

617
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:03,980
San.

618
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,690
I am Wu.

619
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,260
Sorry.

620
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,650
I'm sorry, Wu.

621
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,460
What came over me?

622
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,340
It's okay.

623
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,490
You wouldn't hurt me on purpose.

624
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,130
I will always be with you.

625
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,460
We'll live here together.

626
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,860
No one will interrupt us.

627
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:35,740
Okay.

628
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,570
My Lord, there are traps everywhere!

629
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,650
You little wench, you dare mess with me?

630
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,210
Cut the ghost vines right now
and I'll spare your life.

631
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,740
Is that how you plead for your life?

632
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,010
Speak.

633
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,650
You set up the traps
to catch soul beasts.

634
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,780
Why?

635
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,610
We received orders from Ghost Douluo

636
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,380
to hunt high tier soul beasts
for his lordship's cultivation.

637
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,530
Please, save me.

638
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,610
You're killing innocents

639
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,650
just for the sake of
Bi Bi Dong's cultivation?

640
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,340
Why be so upset
over those dastardly beasts?

641
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,740
Hurry, save me.

642
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,010
I'll put in a good word for you
before his lordship.

643
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,420
You killed indiscriminately.

644
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,750
This shall be your punishment
from Star Dou Forest.

645
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,610
San.

646
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:05,460
(What's happening?)

647
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,890
(Why is the bracelet's
soul power diminishing?)

648
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,460
What's the matter?

649
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,300
What's wrong?

650
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,570
Wu.

651
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,380
Don't you find this place off?

652
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,340
This is Star Dou Forest's mixed zone.

653
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,340
Usually, there would
be high tier soul beasts.

654
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,900
Why is it so quiet?

655
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,260
I can't sense an ounce of soul power.

656
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,790
Isn't it a good thing
we're not being attacked by soul beasts?

657
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,230
But the Star Dou Forest
that I know isn't like this.

658
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,780
Wu knows it better than I do.

659
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,490
She wouldn't have ignored this.

660
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,900
Everything was going accordingly.

661
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,090
Why did you have to wake up?

662
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,010
How come you know
the Chaos Cloak Hammer?

663
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,210
I see.

664
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,880
I'm still in the illusion.

665
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,860
(San, hang in there.)

666
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:18,900
You are not her.

667
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,530
The real Wu

668
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,610
is waiting for me in Star Dou Forest.
