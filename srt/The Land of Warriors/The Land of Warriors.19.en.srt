=The Land of Warriors=

24
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from
Tangjia Sanshao's novel "Soul Land")

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,180
=Episode 19=

26
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,990
This calls for a celebration!

27
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,510
What a joyous occasion indeed!

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,510
What's the matter?

29
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,030
His Majesty handed
the tiger tally to Yu Xiaogang.

30
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,380
Xue Qinghe was so furious!

31
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,790
The soul army legion is
the strongest military unit in Tiandou.

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,790
Although Xue Qinghe is supervising
the nation as the crown prince,

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,290
he doesn't have the imperial seal
or military power.

34
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,540
Now, Yu Xiaogang
has obtained the tiger tally.

35
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,310
I'm sure he won't give up that easily.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,990
And, he's hesitant to act
under the circumstances.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,860
I'm sure he doesn't dare
to harm Father now.

38
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,740
Not only that,

39
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,660
but he also has no time
to keep an eye on us.

40
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,310
Doesn't that call for a celebration?

41
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,870
His Majesty can finally be saved!

42
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,110
Father can be saved?

43
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,700
Have you managed to create the antidote?

44
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,550
No, I haven't.

45
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,590
All of these

46
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,310
are failed experiments.

47
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,830
How can they be antidotes when
I can't save people with them?

48
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,990
What are you doing?

49
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,270
I cannot save His Majesty.

50
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,550
However, there's someone who can.

51
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,660
Who is it? Bring me to him.

52
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,430
No.

53
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,390
I don't know whether
he'll help you out or not.

54
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,940
You can seek him out

55
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,220
when he's in favor of the proposal.

56
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,900
Who's powerful enough for you
to treat him this cautiously?

57
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,660
He's my bosom friend.

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,740
There's hope for His Majesty

59
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,430
as long as

60
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,940
he agrees to it.

61
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,940
(Shrek Academy)

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,900
Your Highness.

63
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,420
Imperial Chaplain.

64
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,150
Come.

65
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,220
Let me introduce him.

66
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,180
This is Marshal Ge Long,
one of the pillars of Tiandou.

67
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,550
(Marshal Ge Long)

68
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,550
He's also known as
Magical Dragon with Nine Lives.

69
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,150
He's also the commander-in-chief
of our army.

70
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,460
He just returned from the borders.

71
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,740
After this,

72
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,150
he'll assist you

73
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,590
in training the soul master legion.

74
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,900
He's just a scholar
with barely any soul power.

75
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,070
How could he lead an army
without going to battle before?

76
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,590
The illness must've affected
His Majesty's intelligence.

77
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,860
I'm sure Father did so

78
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,710
for his own reasons.

79
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,220
However, the future of Tiandou Empire

80
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,150
still depends on veterans like you all

81
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,300
who've rendered countless merit.

82
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,980
Therefore, I need Marshal Ge Long to supervise
the soul master legion personally.

83
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,540
It's not that easy to command
the soul master legion of Tiandou.

84
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,270
Very soon,

85
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,150
he'll withdraw from the legion
and hand over the tiger tally personally.

86
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,950
By then, Your Highness,
I shall hand the tiger tally to you.

87
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,660
Marshal, I've long heard of your name.

88
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,270
You flatter me.

89
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,270
This is Yu Xiaogang,
the imperial chaplain appointed

90
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,980
by His Majesty while he was bedridden.

91
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,950
He's an expert at training soul masters.

92
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,950
Many soul masters call him Grandmaster

93
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,220
out of respect.

94
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,900
So, Grandmaster,

95
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,660
please guide me in the future.

96
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,030
I was in charge of Tiandou's
soul master legion before this.

97
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,710
I'm not talented.

98
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,340
I'm just an
Eight-Ring Great Soul Master.

99
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,950
I assume

100
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,390
you're a Grand Soul Master, right?

101
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,540
I'm truly ashamed.

102
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,540
I'm merely a Four-Ring Soul Ancestor.

103
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,150
Imperial Chaplain,
you're quite humorous.

104
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,830
However, there are some things
you shouldn't joke about.

105
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,420
I'm not joking.

106
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,980
I couldn't raise my level
due to a Martial Soul mutation.

107
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,300
My current soul power
is merely Level 41.

108
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,950
Marshal, His Majesty
chose Imperial Chaplain

109
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,950
because of his talents.

110
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,750
Therefore, you don't need to worry
about the training of the soul masters.

111
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,340
You want me to hand
the soul master legion

112
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,780
to a Soul Ancestor?

113
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,630
I'll never agree to that.

114
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,100
They're going overboard!

115
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,970
How could they pick on him
for his weakness?

116
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,340
I!

117
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,300
Come here.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,750
Lower your volume.

119
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,030
You would've rushed inside

120
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,150
under normal circumstances.

121
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,960
How could they say something like that?

122
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,750
Since Xiaogang has accepted the task,

123
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,270
he has to prepare for the criticisms.

124
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,540
And, I believe that the soul master legion
will definitely be the force

125
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,590
that can defeat Martial Soul Hall
after receiving Xiaogang's training.

126
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,540
By then,

127
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,190
I'm sure that Ge Long
will be speechless.

128
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,590
Erlong, you're right.

129
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,270
You've grown up, huh?

130
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,830
It's because I know

131
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,190
we need to unite

132
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,860
all the available forces

133
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,100
if we wish to seek revenge.

134
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,660
Marshal,

135
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,660
I don't need your permission
to command my army, right?

136
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,390
Imperial Chaplain,
this is a kind reminder.

137
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,220
Only the strong command authority
within the military.

138
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,340
Imperial Chaplain, I'm afraid
they will remain unconvinced.

139
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,270
One's strength isn't proved
by soul power alone.

140
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,510
Understanding the nature
of each soul master

141
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,750
and applying different teaching methods
to assist them in their growth

142
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,270
is a kind of strength too.

143
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,660
According to my survey,

144
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,780
the soul master legion
has 7,000 members.

145
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,860
50% of them are
Storm Attack Branch Soul Masters.

146
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,540
30% of them are
Agility Branch Soul Masters.

147
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,780
20% of them are
Support Branch Soul Masters.

148
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,990
They went through the same training
after being recruited by Tiandou.

149
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,710
In five years, the lower-level
soul masters leveled up by five levels.

150
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,590
The higher-level soul masters
leveled up by three levels.

151
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,780
But Marshal,

152
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,710
do you know how many levels
the lower-level soul masters

153
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,340
have leveled up in five years
in Shrek Academy?

154
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,300
Ten.

155
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,340
The soul masters in the military
are leveling up slowly

156
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,060
because all of them receive
the same training.

157
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,780
However, Shrek Academy

158
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,580
has the most suitable training
environment for soul masters.

159
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,420
By training environment, I mean

160
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,180
that each soul master has
the best spot for them

161
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,030
to train and cultivate their soul power.

162
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,540
For example, Plant Branch Soul Masters

163
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,060
can undergo training in the forest...

164
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,660
Fine. I shall cease our empty talk.

165
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,380
Since you're confident
in your abilities,

166
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,990
I shall look forward to the result.

167
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,940
Excellent.

168
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,580
I hope that Tiandou's soul master legion

169
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,180
will achieve a breakthrough
in their levels as soon as possible

170
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,580
under both of your guidance.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,350
Your Highness, please don't worry.

172
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,660
I'll definitely do my best.

173
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,470
I never expected Wu

174
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,630
to be protected by two strong
and fierce beasts.

175
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,510
But even so,

176
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,470
I can't let Wu take the risk.

177
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,870
Tang Yin?

178
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,470
Tang Yin?

179
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,060
You're awake.

180
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,350
Hu Liena?

181
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,300
How are you? Are you okay?

182
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,510
(I never expected them)

183
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,300
(to rescue me while I was unconscious.)

184
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,390
(I can only adapt
to the situation for now.)

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,470
(I'll think of something else later.)

186
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,870
Is this the Tang Yin
you were looking for?

187
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,870
Shut up.

188
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,990
Why did you come

189
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,230
to Xingdou Forest alone?

190
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,270
My soul power has plateaued.

191
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,780
I need to hunt for more soul rings.

192
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,350
Thank you for saving me.

193
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,700
Farewell.

194
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,270
Tang Yin.

195
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,700
Stop right there.

196
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,700
59, huh?

197
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,780
I guess your soul power
has plateaued indeed.

198
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,870
However, you have quite
the spiritual power.

199
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,540
What were you doing just now?

200
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,990
What injured you?

201
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,150
That's none of your business.

202
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,550
Grandpa Chrysanthemum, Grandpa Ghost,

203
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,030
Tang Yin rescued me
when I was in Netherworld City.

204
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,390
Please don't hurt him.

205
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,470
I'll question him later.

206
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,510
A disciple of Haotian Sect
has appeared out of the blue.

207
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,660
We have to get rid of him.

208
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,350
I already fell out with my sect.

209
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,580
I left Haotian Sect long ago.

210
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,470
You fell out with Haotian Sect?

211
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,180
But why?

212
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,270
It's personal.

213
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,450
I can't tell you about it.

214
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,790
How dare you act like this when
you don't even dare to show your face?

215
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,150
He rescued me before.

216
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,270
Now, he's our captive.

217
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,830
There's no need to put him on the spot.

218
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,700
Young man, we came here to complete
an important task.

219
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,830
There's no room for mistake.

220
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,660
But since you rescued Na before,

221
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,350
I shall spare you.

222
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,470
If you stay obedient,

223
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,390
I'll get you a soul ring
if you're lucky.

224
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,270
(Now, I can't afford to act recklessly.)

225
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,230
(If not, they'll grow
more suspicious of me.)

226
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,780
Tang Yin,

227
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,700
let's put aside your so-called feud

228
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,030
with Haotian Sect for now.

229
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,700
Her Holiness is interested
in you as well.

230
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,630
We'll keep you alive for now.

231
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,900
You better don't try anything funny.

232
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,290
If not, don't blame me
for disregarding your past favor.

233
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,150
Fine.

234
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,990
I'm held captive anyway.

235
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,420
I'm defenseless as well.

236
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,300
I have no other choice.

237
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,150
I disagree!

238
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,590
Tang Yin is a member of Haotian Sect!

239
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,550
We must kill him
to prevent unnecessary trouble!

240
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,230
Stop.

241
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,940
Keep an eye on him.

242
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:00,820
Na.

243
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,940
Besides inquiring about his usage
of spiritual power,

244
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,870
there's another reason
I'm keeping him here.

245
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,900
Do you intend

246
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,230
to fish out Haotian Sect's intel
from him?

247
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,630
Maybe he can help us resolve the emotional
blockage Her Holiness had faced.

248
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,750
Once we capture
that Hectomillennium Soul Beast alive,

249
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,470
we'll take the kid back
to Martial Soul City as well.

250
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,540
If he could provide us with
information about Haotian Sect,

251
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,580
it'll be hugely beneficial
to Martial Soul Hall.

252
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,230
However, if he isn't
willing to cooperate,

253
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,350
Her Holiness will never keep him alive.

254
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,180
If so,

255
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,820
this is a great opportunity for you.

256
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,510
Use this period to convince him.

257
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,230
Make him swear loyalty
to Martial Soul Hall.

258
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,690
This way, we'll be killing
two birds with one stone.

259
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,390
It's not that I desire him.

260
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,450
I'm doing this
for Martial Soul Hall's sake as well.

261
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,420
Just like you,

262
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,660
he possesses the Demon Domain.

263
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,750
Both of you are
outstanding young talents.

264
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,540
However, Her Holiness will
only acknowledge him

265
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,580
if he leaves his sect

266
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,870
and render huge merit
for Martial Soul Hall.

267
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,150
However,

268
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,300
I'm afraid it'll be difficult
for him to leave Haotian Sect.

269
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,190
He wouldn't even have
the chance to survive

270
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,150
our encounter had
he not rescued you before.

271
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,150
Tell him to think about it.

272
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,630
I never expected Tang San
to have such strong spiritual power

273
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,110
and killing intent.

274
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,230
San's martial soul
is the Blue Silver Emperor.

275
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,750
In order to seek me out,

276
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,990
he activated all the Blue Silver Plants
in the forest.

277
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,870
I'm sure he was injured
after receiving your blow.

278
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,700
Don't panic.

279
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,870
The skylark is inquiring
about him outside.

280
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,940
I'll bring him here

281
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,030
once I know his exact location.

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,350
I'm sure Martial Soul Hall has
sent plenty of members here.

283
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,110
If not, they wouldn't need to panic.

284
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,190
I'm sure San is together with them now.

285
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,090
I need to look for him.

286
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,630
Wu,

287
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,540
stay here.

288
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,270
Erming can go.

289
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,180
Even if Tang San is
under Martial Soul Hall's control,

290
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,870
we'll be able to rescue him.

291
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,060
No.

292
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,540
San doesn't know who Erming is.

293
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,230
It'll create a huge mess

294
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,990
if there's a misunderstanding
between them.

295
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,750
Martial Soul Hall is confident
this time around.

296
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,630
San is risking his life for my sake.

297
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,630
I can't just sit idly by.

298
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,420
Leave us for now.

299
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,900
I need to speak with him in private.

300
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:26,990
You've changed.

301
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,990
What do you mean by that?

302
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,390
You're no longer covered in

303
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,410
killing intent, when
you were in Netherworld City.

304
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,230
You're gentler

305
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,300
and more composed now.

306
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,300
You've also grown better

307
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,150
with your killing intent control.

308
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,700
We're considered

309
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,290
companions who had been through
life-or-death situations together.

310
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,970
Since you already fell out
with your sect,

311
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,470
why don't you join Martial Soul Hall?

312
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,580
Her Holiness will definitely
acknowledge your talent.

313
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,940
Haotian Sect and Martial Soul Hall
are sworn enemies.

314
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,390
Do you think Martial Soul Hall

315
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,780
will accept a member of Haotian Sect?

316
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,030
I'm sure you can move Her Holiness

317
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,420
as long as you're sincere enough.

318
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,100
I saw you using
Spiritual Detection just now.

319
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,470
Did you discover anything?

320
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,140
Are you guys looking for something?

321
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,230
You guys already have me under control.

322
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,140
Don't tell me you're afraid
that I'll leak your secret?

323
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,340
I'm just curious as to

324
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,910
why Martial Soul Hall

325
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,470
had sent so many
powerful soul masters here.

326
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,340
And,

327
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,270
you need a secret

328
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,670
in exchange for another secret.

329
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,910
You need a secret

330
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,990
in exchange for this secret.

331
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,140
You're still the same, huh?

332
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,400
I don't think it's a secret anyway.

333
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,290
I guess I can tell you about it.

334
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,780
We're seeking a powerful soul beast
for Her Holiness's soul ring.

335
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,840
Since you guys are causing
such a huge commotion,

336
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,270
I assume you guys have
pinpointed its location.

337
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,060
Martial Soul Hall has been seeking
this soul beast for many years.

338
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,380
Based on various indications,

339
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,990
she should be

340
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,230
within the deepest corners
of the forest.

341
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,710
It's just that we don't know
its exact location.

342
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,750
(Seems like they're quite sure
about Wu's location by now.)

343
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,730
(I need to think of a solution now.)

344
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,470
I've already told you everything
you want to know.

345
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,910
So, can you tell me
what you've discovered just now?

346
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,820
When I was scouting the area
with Spiritual Detection,

347
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,030
I was attacked by
a soul beast's spiritual power.

348
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,480
What kind of soul beast?

349
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,030
It was kind of strange.

350
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,780
I don't know either.

351
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,820
But I could detect

352
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,990
a slight human scent

353
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,950
from its soul power.

354
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,620
What's wrong?

355
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,380
I think Tang Yin discovered
the soul beast we were seeking.

356
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,470
It was the one
who attacked Tang Yin as well.

357
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,510
Which direction?

358
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,990
Hmm...

359
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,620
Over there.

360
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,990
That's a different direction
from the one we pinpointed.

361
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,990
Are you sure about that?

362
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:27,990
I'm sure.

363
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,430
He's not trustworthy!

364
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,340
Don't trust him!

365
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,820
Suit yourself.

366
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,380
If what he said was true,

367
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,860
we'll be able to fulfill
Master's wish very soon.

368
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,030
You're seriously injured.

369
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,670
Your spiritual power
was seriously damaged.

370
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,710
But a soul beast that can

371
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,580
damage his spiritual power
to such an extent

372
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,430
must be as powerful as us.

373
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,230
It's definitely not
the soul beast we're looking for.

374
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,270
You lied to us!

375
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,060
Tang Yin!

376
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,030
(Welcome to Xingdou Forest.)

377
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,430
(Wu?)

378
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,390
(Weren't you guys looking for me
all this while?)

379
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,060
(Now that you guys have found me,)

380
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,780
(why aren't you guys approaching me?)

381
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,140
Follow me!

382
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,300
Come.

383
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,270
(San.)

384
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,990
(It's you indeed.)

385
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,910
(You're finally here.)

386
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,950
This Titan Giant Ape
is at least 100,000 years ago.

387
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,090
You guys are no match for it!

388
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,990
Do not act recklessly!

389
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,060
In order to find me,
Martial Soul Hall has committed

390
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,230
all kinds of evil deeds
in Xingdou Forest

391
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,740
and slaughtered countless soul beasts.

392
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,540
Today,

393
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,100
I shall settle things with you guys

394
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,750
for the sake
of the innocent soul beasts.

395
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,780
It's a gravity control field.

396
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,140
Ghost!

397
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,510
Go to hell!

398
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,060
Chrysanthemum!

399
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,340
Erming!

400
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,510
Stop them!

401
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:17,750
(This is bad!)

402
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,620
Bipolar Still Domain!

403
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,340
Daming! Erming!

404
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,540
Wu,

405
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,190
run!

406
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,300
We can only

407
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,820
immobilize them for a short period!

408
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,430
Grab that rabbit and leave!

409
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,030
Hurry!

410
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,470
Run!

411
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,300
What are you doing?

412
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,540
Scoundrel!

413
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,340
I'll kill you!

414
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,510
Why are you doing this?

415
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,140
Tang Yin

416
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,140
is actually Tang San?

417
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,860
San, be careful!

418
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:03,950

No.

That's the parasitic skill

and clean my wound for me

514

right in time.

532

The Blue Silver Emperor's right leg bone
was left for me by my mother.

533
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,310
It has regenerative capabilities.

534
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,060
Your martial soul has evolved
for the second time, huh?

535
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,700
Did it evolve too?

536
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,700
It's my first time seeing this.

537
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,910
I managed to survive all these years
all thanks to it.

538
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,260
I only found out that your mother
was the Blue Silver Emperor after using it.

539
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,100
It's very difficult for
Plant Soul Beasts

540
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,430

541
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,100

542
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,660
what she had experienced
after she took on a human form,

543
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,030
I thought her passing

544
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,830
was truly a shame.

545
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,350
Martial Soul Hall

546
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,910
forced my mother to give up on her life.

547
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,830
In order to save my father and I,

548
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,710
my mother chose to become an offering.

549
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,140
An offering?

550
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,730
That's the process where a soul beast
sacrifices its life

551
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,390
and all of its power

552
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,260
to become the soul ring
of a human willingly.

553
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,950
Your mother made that choice, huh?

554
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,580
I'm sure she loves your father deeply.

555
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,260
I'm sure she loves you deeply too.

556
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,990
That's the reason

557
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,460
my father couldn't recover
from her passing.

558
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,660
But luckily,

559
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,390
Mother left behind a seed
after she became an offering.

560
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,220
I planted the seed

561
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,990
at Ice Fire Mouth Spring.

562
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,510
That place can help plants
to grow quickly.

563
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,700
Father is keeping her company there.

564
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,160
I'll take you to them

565
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,260
when we have the chance.

566
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,180
Just now,

567
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,700
the two fierce beasts in the lake,

568
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,310
they're your friends, right?

569
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,950
I think you called them
Daming and Erming.

570
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,430
They grew up together with me.

571
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,910
They're just like my younger brothers.

572
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,180
Daming is an
Emperor Sky Azure Bull Python.

573
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,060
Erming is a Hectomillennium
Titan Giant Ape.

574
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,580
San, don't worry.

575
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,100
They won't be immobilized for long.

576
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,790
Once the Martial Soul
Fusion Skill's duration is over,

577
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,840
those guys from Martial Soul Hall
will be done for.

578
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,100
By then,

579
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,350
let's visit them at Star Lake, okay?

580
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,310
Okay.

581
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,260
All these years,

582
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,910
it must've been tough on you

583
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,290
as you had to escape
the pursuit of Martial Soul Hall.

584
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,100
Not at all.

585
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,990
I wasn't the only one who had it rough.

586
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,390
Xingdou Forest and all of its residents
were affected too.

587
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,910
I must

588
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,310
settle our debt with Martial Soul Hall.

589
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,540
Let's do it together.

590
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,350
By the way, San,

591
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,510
how did you manage
to infiltrate their ranks?

592
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:26,910
Xieyue?

593
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,380
The two fierce beasts
will regain mobility soon.

594
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,580
We don't have much time.

595
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,710
Tang San had already escaped

596
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,750
with that soul beast
when I regained consciousness.

597
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,090
Yan told me to stay here
and went after them with our men.

598
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,410
You trusted the wrong person.

599
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,510
You and Hu Liena left
Netherworld City together,

600
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,990
yet she didn't strike you down?

601
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,790
No, she didn't.

602
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,060
But why?

603
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,030
Even if she failed to recognize you,

604
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,510
she would've killed you anyway

605
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,990
as you were a member of Haotian Sect.

606
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,870
She wouldn't have allowed you

607
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,790
to travel together with her
in Xingdou Forest.

608
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,220
We had to rely on each other

609
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,910
to survive in Netherworld City.

610
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,260
That's why we spared each other.

611
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,700
As for this trip,

612
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,540
it's because I told them

613
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,910
that I've left Haotian Sect.

614
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,540
She had doubts about me as well.

615
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,350
I think she kept me on her team

616
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,100
in order to keep me under control.

617
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:27,990
If that's the case,

618
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,830
does that mean Hu Liena
was the one who wanted you to stay?

619
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:32,870
I guess.

620
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,283
She managed to convince
Grand Ghost Master

621
00:38:35,285 --> 00:38:36,500
and Grand Chrysanthemum Master.

622
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,570
She's the sacred lady
of Martial Soul Hall now.

623
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,620
She wants me to join Martial Soul Hall.

624
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,060
However,

625
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,790
I think she was just testing me.

626
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,220
I knew it.

627
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,510
You're still as slow
to catch on as always.

628
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,470
Hu Liena has feelings for you!

629
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:56,260
I...

630
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,510
Where are they?

631
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:02,870
You're awake.

632
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,910
Did you lose them?

633
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,870
They're very cunning.

634
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,460
Split up and search for them
We can't afford to fail the mission.

635
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,580
You guys,

636
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,430
follow me.

637
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:13,990
Over here.

638
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,790
You're overthinking it.

639
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,190
You're not thinking about it at all!

640
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,790
But I guess she'll give up

641
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,100
since she already found out

642
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,790
about your identity.

643
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,950
But Tang San...

644
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,660
Tang San!

645
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,300
Why did you call me by my name?

646
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,510
I know you didn't mean
to get close to her.

647
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,620
But you better stay away
from Hu Liena in the future.

648
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,910
You deceived her.

649
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,660
If she hates you because of that,

650
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,580
she might do everything
to seek revenge against you.

651
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,620
So, you're just worried about me.

652
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,030
Don't forget.

653
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,660
Her master is Bi Bi Dong.

654
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,530
I'm afraid a lunatic like her
will give rise to another lunatic.

655
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,580
I'll remember that.

656
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,660
When I was here, I only found out that
Martial Soul Hall initiated a beast horde

657
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:06,870
in order to find you.

658
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,480
It must've been tough on you

659
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,390
all these years.

660
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,660
I guess I wasn't alone.

661
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,510
I had Daming and Erming with me.

662
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,540
However, life was tough.

663
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,990
How do you plan to reward me, then?

664
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,740
Follow me.

665
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:44,740
Close your eyes.

666
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,990
You may open them now.

667
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,350
Is this Blue Silver Emperor's
Talent Domain?

668
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,740
It's so beautiful.

669
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,740
I have another gift for you as well.

670
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,840
Is this a soft-boned rabbit?

671
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,870
Is this me?

672
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,390
I made this with Blue Silver Emperor.

673
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,950
I hope that we can

674
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,700
stay together forever.

675
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,700
I'll definitely cherish it.

676
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,790
Just like my bracelet,

677
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,830
it's also a part of your martial soul.

678
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,430
It's also an important part

679
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,100
of my life that I never want to lose.

680
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,180
I don't think you can
keep that bracelet.

681
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,260
