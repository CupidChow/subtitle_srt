You are not her.

The real Wu

6
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,930
is still waiting for me
at Star Dou Forest.

(What is this place?)

26
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,260
(It's so familiar.)

27
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,860
(This is the aura of Soul Bone.)

28
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,100
It seems like this skull

29
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,660
benefited you a lot.

30
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,580
Water. Give me water.

31
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,540
Here.

32
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,130
Water.

33
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,250
I was caught in an illusion just now.

34
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,460
That was the trial
given to you by the Wisdom Skull.

35
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,780
You had a hard time overcoming it.

36
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,980
Why did Wu

37
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,660
use Chaos Cloak Hammer in the illusion?

38
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,100
I used my mental power

39
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,610
to affect the skull's illusion.

40
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,020
San,

41
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,170
don't blame me for being harsh.

42
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,900
If you don't let go
of your obsession with Wu,

43
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,020
you will never focus
on your cultivation.

44
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,340
Why?

45
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,460
To let you face your inner demons,

46
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,050
I used my mental power

47
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,580
to affect the illusion.

48
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,810
My son.

49
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,050
If you keep thinking about Wu,

50
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,220
you can't focus on your cultivation.

51
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,810
Since you found the flaw

52
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,050
and came out of the illusion,

53
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,490
that means

54
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,730
you can already
suppress your inner demons.

55
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,900
Thank you, Father.

56
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,130
I understand.

57
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,170
Being obsessed with results

58
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,340
will only make me lose my path.

59
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,170
Remember, Son.

60
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,100
Always keep an eye on yourself.

61
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,660
Being obsessed with the result

62
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,660
will make you forget
how to reflect on yourself.

63
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,580
No one can help you

64
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,020
overcome this obstacle

65
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,810
besides yourself.

66
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,580
Focus on the present.

67
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,860
Your Purple Demon Eye

68
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,810
should now be

69
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,050
at the peak of Level 3, Jiezi Realm.

70
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,460
How do you feel?

71
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,540
My whole body feels relaxed.

72
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,170
I entered a mystical realm just now.

73
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,340
It was huge

74
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,250
and borderless.

75
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,980
It made me feel comfortable.

76
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,490
It felt safe.

77
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,620
There was also
a lot of aura I'm familiar with.

78
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,220
You entered the Spirit Sea?

79
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,780
What is the Spirit Sea?

80
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,250
It is a place
where you store your spiritual power.

81
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,930
When you entered the Spirit Sea,

82
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,460
the body you saw

83
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,780
wasn't your real body

84
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,830
but a body formed from spiritual power.

85
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,900
You are only
at the Soul Ancestor rank now

86
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,130
but with the help of a soul bone,

87
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,690
your spiritual power

88
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:17,498
has increased
to the rank of Soul Douluo.

89
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,490
Does it mean I've become stronger?

90
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,980
Theoretically,

91
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,580
you've become stronger.

92
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,490
However,

93
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,370
if you only become stronger
because of Wu,

94
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,610
you are still far away
from becoming a truly strong person.

95
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,540
A strong person is a strong person.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,690
What do you mean by
a truly strong person?

97
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,810
The strength you know now

98
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,730
is just

99
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,730
on this level.

100
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,170
How do I put this?

101
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,610
There's no rush.

102
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,170
Take it slow.

103
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,050
Take it slow.

104
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,780
It's already good enough for me.

105
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,420
I understand now that I cannot rush
when it comes to cultivation.

106
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,860
From now on,

107
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,490
I'll try to improve steadily.

108
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,250
You fool.

109
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,580
Have you forgotten what I just said?

110
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,130
No matter how talented a person is,
he must take it slow.

111
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,810
Remember.
You just absorbed the Soul Bone.

112
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,580
You cannot be in a rush to cultivate.

113
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,220
You must train your physicality first.

114
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,250
Yes.

115
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,020
What did the person
with the Elder Token say?

116
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,460
He asked Your Holiness

117
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,500
not to send people
to disturb Shrek Academy again.

118
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,580
(Yu Xiaogang)

119
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,220
(You only know how to go against me.)

120
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,580
What about the rabbit?

121
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,650
It hasn't been seen
after all these days.

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,700
Soft-boned rabbits
come from the mountains.

123
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,130
It might be hiding in the vast forests.

124
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,060
The continent has many forests.

125
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,980
Trying to find a soul beast

126
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,410
that is deliberately hiding

127
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,410
is the same
as looking for a needle in a haystack.

128
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:51,770
Search.

129
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,370
What Ghost Douluo means

130
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,700
is for you to lead
a few soul master units

131
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,580
and search every forest
on the continent.

132
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,890
You must help Her Holiness

133
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,100
bring back the soft-boned rabbit
as soon as possible.

134
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,580
Search thoroughly.

135
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,860
Don't miss an inch.

136
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,610
Yes.

137
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,180
It's time to begin the plan.

138
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,770
Yes, Your Holiness.

139
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,060
Haotian Clan has gone missing
for many years.

140
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,820
The remaining six clans

141
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,410
are defending the empires,
Heaven Dou and Star Luo respectively.

142
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,860
Right now, Martial Soul Hall
and the two empires

143
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,410
are in a tripartite confrontation.

144
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,860
Martial Soul Hall might seem like
it is in a leading position

145
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,610
but this is a deadlock.

146
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,060
Douluo Continent has been at peace
for a long time.

147
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,610
We have waited for a long time as well.

148
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,410
It's time to disrupt the situation

149
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,220
and dominate
all the soul masters of the land

150
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,770
and dominate the whole continent.

151
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,980
What we need to do now

152
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,580
is to gather our power

153
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,610
so we can complete our ambition
in one go.

154
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,610
Your Holiness' is ambitious.

155
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,860
The Elder Hall.

156
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,770
Ghost, you're also worried

157
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,820
the elders of Elder Hall will interfere.

158
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,580
Back then, it was them
who were against your plan.

159
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,340
There's also a way
to stop them from knowing temporarily.

160
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,490
Erming.

161
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,370
Look.

162
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,410
What is this?

163
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,340
Don't care what it is.

164
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,610
Just remember.

165
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,010
If you see it,

166
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,940
seal it with your soul power

167
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,490
so low-level soul beasts

168
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,820
dare not approach it.

169
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,410
Are these traps made by humans?

170
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,940
Erming,

171
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,820
you are getting smarter.

172
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,410
Bi Bi Dong sent her men

173
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,460
to Star Dou Forest to set up traps

174
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,450
and catch soul beasts
to help her cultivate.

175
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,650
It's so despicable.

176
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,460
I've lived in the human world
for so long.

177
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,060
Although I can't do much for everyone,

178
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,180
I can lower the chances

179
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,210
of soul beasts being harmed
by the traps, at least.

180
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,610
Humans are shameless!

181
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,580
They don't even dare have a fair fight!

182
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,130
Not all humans are the same.

183
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,130
I really hope

184
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,010
that one day

185
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,650
humans and soul beasts

186
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,820
can find a way

187
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,730
to live in harmony.

188
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,340
A way to live in harmony?

189
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:30,347
Just like you

190
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,610
and Tang San?

191
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,180
We

192
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,130
are different.

193
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,580
How so?

194
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,980
I'm going to seal the traps.

195
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:40,860
Erming!

196
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,770
What is this?

197
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,580
The fruits are not fresh.

198
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,700
Let me tell you.

199
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,860
Fruits will rot after an hour.

200
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,940
You've been running
for more than ten trips now.

201
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,340
Are you running out of strength?

202
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,010
No.

203
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,220
When we were at Shrek Academy,

204
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,180
our teacher would let us
train our stamina

205
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,530
by not using our soul power.

206
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,010
It's a form of training. I know.

207
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,820
Using this fruit to treat my injury

208
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,730
was your suggestion.

209
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,100
You shouldn't act tough.

210
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,130
If you can't do it,
you can take a break.

211
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,370
It's no use trying to instigate me.

212
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,610
Many people will be at a disadvantage
when their stamina decreases

213
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,010
but I'm the opposite.

214
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,410
An hour is too long indeed.

215
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,010
I think

216
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,820
I'd be dead

217
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,250
when I get to eat fresh fruits.

218
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,060
I'll definitely come back

219
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,860
before this flame goes out.

220
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,820
You brat!

221
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,460
Bluff all you want!

222
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,220
Why did you ruin my wine?

223
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,860
(Soul beasts often appear
in the Wild Fruit Forest.)

224
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,300
(You must be careful.)

225
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:43,980
San,

226
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,700
in the future,

227
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,820
if you want to add soul rings
to your Haotian Hammer,

228
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,460
these power-type soul beasts suit you.

229
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,460
Especially the Scale-armored Beast.

230
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,060
Its defense is extremely scary.

231
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,700
(Scale-armored Beast,
Soul Ring Level and Skills)

232
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,770
(Scale-armored Beast
has an extremely strong defense.)

233
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,180
(Taking one down alone might be...)

234
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,460
(It's blood?)

235
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,490
It's hurt.

236
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,370
(Although Father asked me
not to rush to seek success,)

237
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,130
(the soul beat is hurt.)

238
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,860
(This is a rare opportunity.)

239
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,930
(It's a pity if I don't take a gamble.)

240
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,780
It's a Scale-armored Beast indeed.

241
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:18,980
I'll make you

242
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,130
into my Haotian Hammer's
first Soul Ring.

243
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,060
San,

244
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,020
are you doing something dangerous?

245
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,260
San, stop immediately.

246
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,100
Don't force yourself.

247
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,890
San.

248
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,260
What are you doing?

249
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,130
This bangle

250
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,060
is made from a part
of San's martial soul.

251
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,030
When I first returned to Star Dou Forest

252
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,060
and got attacked by
the Human-faced Demonic Spider,

253
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,970
San used this bangle's power

254
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,650
to awaken
the forest's Blue Silver Grass.

255
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,880
Erming came to save me
because he was alerted.

256
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
That means

257
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,020
I can also give him soul power.

258
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,820
You don't even know his situation.

259
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,820
You might hurt yourself.

260
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,340
But he didn't think about

261
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,500
whether he would get hurt
when he helped me.

262
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,260
Protection Spell.

263
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,420
♪The wind whispers, shaking the moonlight♪

264
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,380

♪Even if my soul disperses♪

271
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,210
This girl is affectionate.

272
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,580
♪I'll use a lifetime of courage♪

273
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:24,787

279
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,300
Father.

280
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,840
You lost the gamble?

281
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,210
The Scale-armored Beast was hurt.

282
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,890
I thought I could win by taking a risk.

283
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,650
So, you know

284
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,740
you were
taking your life lightly, right?

285
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,410
I know.

286
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,860
Isn't it tough to become strong?

287
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,820
Becoming strong

288
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,170
is to overcome
one obstacle after another.

289
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,970
You've let go of
your obsession with Wu

290
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,750
but you can't let go
of your obsession to become stronger.

291
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,340
But isn't my goal now

292
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,410
to become stronger?

293
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,930
There's no shortcut to becoming strong.

294
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,890
You must take one step at a time.

295
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,020
What are you doing?

296
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:13,690
Father.

297
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,100
Go away!

298
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,170
You deserved to be beaten
because you failed as a son.

299
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,740
I also deserve to be beaten
because I failed as a father.

300
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:30,780
In the past,

301
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,260
I didn't do my duty to educate you.

302
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,060
Today, I'll make up for my mistake.

303
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,260
Father, I know I my mistake.

304
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,740
I shouldn't be reckless

305
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,930
and make my own decisions.

306
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,170
I've made you worried.

307
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,740
You didn't just make me worried.

308
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,340
Do you know?

309
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,860
Wu has been

310
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,500
sending soul power to you to save you.

311
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,650
She was cultivating
at Star Dou Forest alone.

312
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,020
She must be affected

313
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,010
after exhausting her powers for you.

314
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,590
What a relief.

315
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,370
She should be safe now.

316
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,755
Is this the way
you protect the people you love?

317
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,890
What if you die today?

318
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,580
What will this girl do in the future?

319
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,930
You overestimated yourself.

320
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,210
Two martial souls increasing
a soul ring at the same time

321
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,170
is not something
your body can take right now.

322
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,890
Not only did your recklessness

323
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,540
cause a 4,000-year-old soul beast

324
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,860
die in vain for you,

325
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,540
but you also almost lost your life.

326
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,260
How can you

327
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,260
face your late mother if you do this?

328
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:53,970
Father.

329
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,370
I know my mistake.

330
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,220
I will take responsibility for myself

331
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,820
and the people I love.

332
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,540
I won't be reckless

333
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
and do something stupid
behind your back anymore.

334
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,370
Stand up.

335
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,650
Remember, Son.

336
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,100
Let go of your obsession
so you can achieve enlightenment.

337
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,130
When you wake up today,

338
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,700
you are still worried about his safety.

339
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,540
Why do you remove it now?

340
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,970
He is too daring.

341
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:44,970
Yesterday,

342
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,780
I sensed that
his other Haotian Hammer martial soul

343
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:48,780
was almost dispersed.

344
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:49,860
What does it mean?

345
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,300
It means

346
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,340
he was dying?

347
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,970
It means he used
the Haotian Hammer martial soul

348
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,300
to do something he shouldn't do.

349
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,740
He might be forcefully
increasing his soul ring.

350
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,450
He is seeking death.

351
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,610
Since he doesn't love himself,
I will ignore him.

352
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,290
You should have done that sooner.

353
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,930
He risked his life

354
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,690
but you were the one who felt anxious.

355
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,260
I might as well

356
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,580
throw this away.

357
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,060
You can't!

358
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,780
I'm just letting you
keep this bangle temporarily.

359
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,790
You must return it to me
when I'm no longer angry.

360
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,300
(Star Luo Palace)

361
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,610
Isn't this Zhu Zhuyun's room?

362
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,210
This is Your Highness' room.

363
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,130
Everything is new.

364
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,610
If you don't like them,

365
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,130
I can change them for you.

366
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,580
No need.

367
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,500
I'll return to my room.

368
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,540
Calm down, Your Highness.

369
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,780
This is your room.

370
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,410
Crown Prince Consort
took an arduous journey

371
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,210
to come here.

372
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,740
I've prepared a hot bath for you

373
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,210
in the inner chamber

374
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,970
so you can relax and rest.

375
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,990
I'm still not
the Crown Prince Consort yet.

376
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,540
His Majesty issued the order.

377
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,130
We dare not defy him.

378
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,330
Where were my servants in the past?

379
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,710
Your Highness has a noble identity.

380
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,760
Every servant of yours

381
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,450
is carefully selected by His Majesty.

382
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,740
But I remember you served Zhu Zhuyun.

383
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,370
I am your servant, Your Highness.

384
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,020
Can you stop smiling?

385
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,450
It's our fault.

386
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,580
Please punish us.

387
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,880
All of you can leave. I have something to say
to the Crown Prince Consort.

388
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,300
Yes.

389
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,630
It seems like I'm the only one
who feels uneasy about this.

390
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,610
Don't care about such worldly things.

391
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,340
I don't want to

392
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,710
but as soon as I'm back at this palace,

393
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,130
I feel uneasy.

394
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,390
We've grown up here together
since young.

395
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,540
Don't you know
what kind of place this is?

396
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,370
If you want to go against it,

397
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,450
you'll be the one who suffers.

398
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,610
Shrek Academy is better.

399
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,020
There might not be a lavish life

400
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,820
but everyone is simple

401
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:32,690
unlike here.

402
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,500
Back then, I went to Shrek Academy

403
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,990
to avoid a royal competition.

404
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,990
You were unhappy
about your family's arrangements

405
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,980
so you escaped as well.

406
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,370
We finally defeated
Zhu Zhuyun and Dai Weisi

407
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,930
at the Martial Soul Competition

408
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,990
and no longer
needed to be suppressed by them.

409
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,690
We can finally control our own fate.

410
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,930
Do you still feel unhappy about that?

411
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,060
Do you think

412
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,340
we've controlled our fate?

413
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,260
At least this is not like the past
where we can't even be sure

414
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,450
if we will be dead or alive.

415
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,060
But Dai Weisi is your brother

416
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,580
and Zhu Zhuyun is your sister.

417
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:04,890
What will they do?

418
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,100
What will we do?

419
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,210
Before I went to Shrek Academy,

420
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,990
I had an agreement with my father.

421
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,410
If I defeat Zhu Zhuyun,

422
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,970
I can give up on my identity as a noble

423
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,990
to travel the continent.

424
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,580
Give up your identity
and travel the continent?

425
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,690
It's my first time hearing you say this.

426
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,020
Zhuqing, you...

427
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,590
It's not that I didn't want to tell you

428
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,400
but I've been having doubts
about my father's agreement.

429
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,690
Since I've come back with you,

430
00:28:31,374 --> 00:28:32,860
I am prepared to face everything.

431
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,610
I know what you are thinking.

432
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,470
I will be by your side no matter what.

433
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,340
(Emperor Star Luo)

434
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,340
Both of you have come back
with academic success.

435
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,650
You mustn't be lazy.

436
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,690
I prepared the best soul master team

437
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,060
to work with you
in your future cultivation.

438
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,060
Remember.

439
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,580
You don't just have
your own pride on your shoulders

440
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,100
but the whole future of Star Luo.

441
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:15,820
I understand.

442
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,100
I heard there's
a 10,000-year-old soul beast

443
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,690
who has gained a human form
among your Shrek Academy students.

444
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:23,930
Where is she now?

445
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,130
Father, Wu has gained the form of a human.

446
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,210
She is a member
of the Shrek Seven Devils.

447
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,300
It seems like she is indeed
a 10,000-year-old soul beast.

448
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,170
Yes.

449
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,930
She is also a friend of ours
who shares our woes.

450
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,890
A friend?

451
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,580
Does it mean

452
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,210
you will help her

453
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,210
if Bi Bi Dong wants to hurt your friend?

454
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,020
Yes.

455
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:55,890
Enough!

456
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,500
Remember your identity.

457
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,320
You're willing to risk your life
for a mere soul beast.

458
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,580
Do you think I can hand
the empire's future over to you?

459
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,880
Calm down, Your Majesty.

460
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,690
His Highness and my daughter
just came back.

461
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,050
(Duke Lingmao)
They had little knowledge as the ruler of an empire.

462
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,060
Your Majesty, please guide them slowly.

463
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:14,610
Whatever.

464
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,500
I hope you can understand this
on your own.

465
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,130
Mubai. Zhuqing.

466
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:27,860
Since both of you

467
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,500
defeated Dai Weisi and Zhu Zhuyun

468
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,300
to become the new heir
of the royal family,

469
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,060
there is one thing
that both of you must do.

470
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,930
Star Luo will never have two heirs.

471
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,210
I will never do it.

472
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,930
Do we become strong

473
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,500
so we can live alone

474
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,100
and kill our close ones?

475
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:53,820
Zhuqing.

476
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,540
I will not do what I hate most

477
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,370
to other people.

478
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,740
If

479
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,020
the people in this room

480
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,340
were Dai Weisi and Zhu Zhuyun,

481
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,540
do you think they'd spare us?

482
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,410
But the one who is here

483
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,300
is me.

484
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,500
The emperor's order must not be defied.

485
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,170
We must be cruel

486
00:31:24,747 --> 00:31:26,347
to those who can't stay here

487
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,020
even if they are our close ones.

488
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,810
Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Clan

489
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,490
has the most number and strongest
Support Branch Soul Masters

490
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,780
in the continent.

491
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,970
However, I think

492
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,710
all of you share the same trouble as me
and that is weak in offence.

493
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,060
Today,

494
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,300
Rong and I will show you how to use
throwing weapons in a real battle

495
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,820
to make up for our weaknesses.

496
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:56,930
Grandpa Jian,

497
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,890
please work with us.

498
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,580
You and Ao

499
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,340
can use the throwing weapons
as you wish.

500
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,340
I'll just defend.

501
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,210
Look out then.

502
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,410
Be careful.

503
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,780
The Sand Needles

504
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,820
are poisonous.

505
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,410
Poisonous?

506
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,610
Grandpa Jian, don't worry.

507
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,170
The poison for today's demonstration
is fake.

508
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,170
However,

509
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,780
can you show some respect

510
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,340
for San's weapons?

511
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,060
I was about to praise

512
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,210
how good these things were.

513
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,580
Chief.

514
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,300
This batch of weapons is valuable.

515
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,860
Especially the crossbow.

516
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,970
Soul masters under level 40

517
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,860
will be at a disadvantage easily.

518
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,060
This is nothing.

519
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,060
Ao!

520
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,100
There's more?

521
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,410
You forced me to use my martial soul.

522
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,650
Impressive.

523
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,610
Chief.

524
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,260
These things are interesting.

525
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,580
I'm very satisfied.

526
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,610
In a real battle, it's more effective

527
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,980
if two people have good teamwork.

528
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,740
Especially the one
who acts as the support.

529
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,260
Using a feint

530
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,810
and knowing the time to retreat

531
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:49,780
are very important.

532
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,300
Ao,

533
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,970
lead everyone's training in teamwork

534
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,610
to utilize the maximum value

535
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,860
of the weapons.

536
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,840
Don't worry, Chief.

537
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,370
I will do my best.

538
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,650
Rongrong, you've abandoned
the clan's duties for so long.

539
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,901
It's time to pick them up again.

540
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,260
Come with me to the study.

541
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,920
(605,400 Gold Soul Coins, 300,000 to the treasury)
(Balance of 400,000 coins cleared by Ning Rongrong.)

542
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,570
Rongrong, why are the accounts
you spent a whole day calculating...

543
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,530
Rongrong's handwriting has improved.

544
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,450
They are well-written.

545
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,820
Rongrong, it's fine.

546
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,560
It's fine to make wrong calculations.

547
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,090
Our clan has money.

548
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,870
Your father is
not afraid of losing money.

549
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,570
Rongrong, if you keep making mistakes,

550
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,490
the clan

551
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,340
will soon go bankrupt from losing money.

552
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,820
Father,

553
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,970
I will be more careful next time.

554
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,970
Don't blame me

555
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,050
for being too strict on you.

556
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,150
You are the heir of
Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Clan.

557
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,740
Everyone has high hopes for you

558
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,890
and loves you a lot.

559
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,740
You mustn't let them down

560
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,250
so you can shoulder the responsibility

561
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,410
of protecting and developing
the clan in the future.

562
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,370
Understand?

563
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,050
I understand.

564
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,530
Making correct calculations for the clan

565
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,820
is the most important thing to me.

566
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,970
Rongrong, don't be sad.

567
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:24,450
Rongrong,

568
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,460
do your best.

569
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,620
Don't annoy me.

570
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,140
Can't you see that I'm busy?

571
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,140
Don't fool around next time.

572
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,930
I'm sure they noticed you.

573
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,260
They didn't expose you
to save you some face.

574
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,090
Don't be so gloomy.

575
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,530
I heard everything.

576
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,860
They were praising you.

577
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,450
How you comfort me is so perfunctory.

578
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,610
(Income from Zhenpin Court)
I did these things well in the past.

579
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,490
I never disappointed Father before.

580
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:25,860
This is...

581
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,930
I might not understand

582
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,700
but I'm impressed.

583
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,820
Our clan is really rich.

584
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,490
They are right.

585
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,140
You won't lose all the clan's money.

586
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,260
Stop making a mess.

587
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,660
Our clan has so many disciples

588
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,890
and so many businesses.

589
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,900
My father is the one
who manages all of them.

590
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,660
If I don't help share his burden,

591
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,060
I'll be too embarrassed to face him.

592
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,260
I can't let everyone down.

593
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,370
Why should you live
with someone else's expectations?

594
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,140
If you weren't born,

595
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,970
do you think the clan would disappear?

596
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,660
Moreover, working hard
and taking things seriously is necessary

597
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,180
but you can't force yourself

598
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,540
to get a perfect score immediately.

599
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,530
Moreover, working hard might be useless

600
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:06,740
on some occasions.

601
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,300
Ao.

602
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,970
Are you making me angry on purpose?

603
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,780
You don't sound serious at all.

604
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,620
Let me finish.

605
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,970
I always think

606
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,140
that you should take a break

607
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,340
whenever you fall.

608
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,990
Lie down
and you won't have any pressure.

609
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,490
See? It's so pretty.

610
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,740
This is how a table should look like.

611
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,700
What do you mean?

612
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,340
Your head is a mess
when you are stressed.

613
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,690
You won't do anything well.

614
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,620
You must first manage your mood well.

615
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,090
Manage it?

616
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,140
How do I do that?

617
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,960
Let me bring you to a place.

618
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,340
Why are you shouting?

619
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,620
When I was in a bad mood,

620
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,090
I would find a place to shout.

621
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,450
It's very useful.

622
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,890
Try it.

623
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,740
I...

624
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,220
I don't know what I can shout.

625
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,370
You can shout anything you want.

626
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,370
If you don't know,

627
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,790
just shout that you don't know.

628
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,220
I don't know what I'm going to shout!

629
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,820
Ledgers, don't annoy me!

630
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,080
I want to be happy!

631
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,980
Being an heir of the clan
is tiring enough.

632
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,970
If you want everyone to be satisfied,

633
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,930
your life will be torture.

634
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,140
However,

635
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,770
I'm still far away
from making everyone satisfied.

636
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,530
You shouldn't think that at all.

637
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,450
I just want

638
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,370
to do my best in everything.

639
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,050
See?

640
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:15,890
What can you do?

641
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,340
It's impossible for you
to do everything well.

642
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,410
Ao.

643
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,140
Don't be angry.

644
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,620
I just want to say

645
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,770
that no one can do everything perfectly.

646
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,089
Look.

647
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,970
If you are afraid
of disappointing others,

648
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,230
your vision will decrease.

649
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,000
If you are worried
about not being good enough,

650
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,120
your vision decreases again.

651
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,090
The more rules you set for yourself,

652
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,450
the less freedom you'll feel.

653
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,220
If you see the big picture,

654
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,700
you will realise

655
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,970
many beautiful things in life.

656
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,340
For example,

657
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,620
the blue skies and white clouds.

658
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,010
You...

659
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,530
How dare you
use soul masters to cultivate!

660
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,140
All of you will die a worthy death

661
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,140
to aid my cultivation.

662
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,010
Someone like you

663
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,930
isn't fit to lead Martial Soul Hall!

664
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,370
You betrayed all soul masters

665
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,140
and will be condemned by everyone!

666
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,370
When I ascend the legendary peak,

667
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,660
the whole continent

668
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,530
is insignificant to me.

669
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,570
When the time comes,

670
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:02,450
the world will belong to me.

671
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,490
I'll see who dares condemn me.

672
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,620
Your ambition is too scary.

673
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,660
The Martial Soul Hall
was built for soul masters.

674
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,010
You are defying Heaven by doing this.

675
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,090
How can you face

676
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,620
the late Supreme Pontiff?

677
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,410
You are too noisy.

678
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:22,961
I'm not the one who should be condemned

679
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,340
but the person
who dragged me down to hell.

680
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,780
He created me

681
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,930
and destroyed me.

682
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,450
However,

683
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,970
he will no longer control me.

684
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,530
I, Bi Bi Dong,

685
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,700
control my fate.

686
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,970
I will crush the entire world

687
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,620
under my feet.
