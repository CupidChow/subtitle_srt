=The Land of Warriors=

24
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from
Tangjia Sanshao's novel "Soul Land")

25
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,700
=Episode 18=

26
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,490
Wu, are you sure this will work?

27
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,820
I have no idea either.

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,260
This bracelet is formed by a fraction

29
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,210
of San's soul power.

30
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,460
It contains the power
of Blue Silver Emperor.

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,670
I'll give it a try.

32
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,290
Wu, look!

33
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,890
You succeeded.

34
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,820
I never expected myself

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,160
to be able to activate the bracelet
left behind by San.

36
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,130
Now, it's much easier to create fences.

37
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,730
They can finally have their own place.

38
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,450
These bunnies

39
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,100
lost their parents
during the beast horde.

40
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,540
I hope they can grow up safely here.

41
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,700
You always manage to find a solution.

42
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,100
With these,

43
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,730
even if danger is coming,

44
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,980
we can be notified of
the danger in time.

45
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,450
But when we're facing a crisis,

46
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,290
help from afar is useless.

47
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,760
And, some of the younger beasts
have to be placed separately.

48
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,540
We'll be in trouble if danger occurs
in multiple places

49
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,010
at the same time.

50
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,450
Yeah.

51
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,010
Which of them should I save first
if a crisis does hit us?

52
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,260
I got it.

53
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,170
Come here.

54
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,220
Will this work?

55
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,980
It'll definitely work.

56
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,240
Just leave your
Hectomillennium Soul Beast scent near the fence.

57
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,340
Other soul beasts
don't dare to approach this place.

58
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,190
This is what the human teacher taught me
when I was in a human school.

59
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,380
All right, then. I'll heed your advice.

60
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,690
Erming, we have to help a lot
of soul beasts to settle down later.

61
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,730
You should eat up.

62
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,490
You might not have enough.

63
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,100
I can do that.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,260
I'll wait for you outside, then.

65
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,690
I'll give you some private space.

66
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,170
Once you're done,

67
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,610
let's return to Star Lake.

68
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,260
Let's help these kids

69
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,410
to settle down by tonight.

70
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,930
If not, I think Daming will
suffer a breakdown

71
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,450
looking after them the entire night.

72
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,700
Don't worry. I'll be quick.

73
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,900
I'll wait for you outside, then.

74
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,930
(Xingdou Forest looks quiet
and is in order.)

75
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,580
(It doesn't seem like
there was a beast horde.)

76
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,410
(Has the forest already
recovered from it?)

77
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,140
(Soft-boned rabbits?)

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,700
(I think Wu looks like this
when she was young.)

79
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,560
(Something's off.)

80
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,700
(Why are the younglings)

81
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,220
(living as a herd?)

82
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,990
(And, Blue Silver Plant doesn't
grow like this naturally.)

83
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,410
(It's obviously the work of man.)

84
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,140
Could it be Wu?

85
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,410
(I have no idea where you get)

86
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,540
(the feces of a high-level soul beast.)

87
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,270
(But it does scare off
other soul beasts.)

88
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,440
(Our teacher taught us this
when we were in Shrek Academy.)

89
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,660
(This is your work indeed.)

90
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,170
(You wish to protect them, huh?)

91
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,250
(Let me upgrade
your defense for you, then.)

Seems like they're in danger.

96
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,850

(It's San.)

101
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,290
(Are you here to look for me?)

102
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,410
(Where are you?)

103
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,980
(This is the third fence
I've discovered.)

104
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,160
(One has to expend a huge amount
of soul power)

105
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,210
(to activate Blue Silver Plant
using the bracelet.)

106
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,930
(I'm sure Wu has worn herself out)

107
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,860
(trying to restore peace to the forest.)

108
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,730
(Wu, leave this to me.)

109
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,250
(Let's work hard together.)

110
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,020
Not bad indeed.

111
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,250
You guys have grown tremendously
in five years.

112
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,690
But as your soul power gets stronger,

113
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,580
it'll get harder and harder

114
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,460
for you guys to achieve a breakthrough.

115
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,490
What Master said just now

116
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,190
describes what
I'm experiencing perfectly.

117
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,550
I didn't slack off in my training.

118
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,170
However, my soul power
is increasing at an insignificant rate.

119
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,100
Me too.

120
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,780
Master, could it be
that our previous training methods

121
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,810
no longer suit us?

122
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,370
You guys have already graduated

123
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,350
and still want me
to give you guys extra lessons?

124
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,460
I'll charge you guys extra for this.

125
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,460
That's simple.

126
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,660
Fatty can become
one of the teachers here.

127
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,390
That's enough
for our tuition fees, right?

128
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,140
Agreed.

129
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,140
The academy is my home.

130
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,550
I'll do everything
you ask me to do

131
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,970
as long as you provide free food
and accommodation.

132
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,850
Are you serious?

133
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,410
That sounds great!

134
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,850
Come. Let's drink.

135
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,830
Stop messing around.

136
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,140
Rongrong, you were right.

137
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,980
You guys do have to change
your training methods.

138
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,850
You have to find a way

139
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,220
to push your limits.

140
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,980
This wind is eerily strong.

141
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,140
I assume the weather
will change drastically later.

142
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,540
Yi, don't you think
the wind is too cold?

143
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,930
Yeah, a little.

144
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,810
There's something strange
about the wind.

145
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,780
Stay here. I'll go and take a leak.

146
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,700
Okay. Go ahead.

147
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:35,940
Who's there?

148
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,370
Xiao Yi...

149
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,770
There are enemies!

150
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,100
Storm the place.

151
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,490
Qibao Amber Sect,

152
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,820
your glory and grace have faded.

153
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,140
I'm the first person

154
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,210
in Qibao Amber Sect
to refine the Qibao Amber Pagoda

155
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,650
into the Jiubao Amber Pagoda.

156
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,700
However, no one in the sect
could tell me

157
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,490
how to break through my limits.

158
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,130
Father!

159
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,700
Chief Ning.

160
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,460
Qibao Amber Sect is gone.

161
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,860
(Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan)

162
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,300
Kill all of them!

163
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,770
The Martial Soul Hall isn't
targeting Tiandou.

164
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,890
They're targeting the Soul Master Clan.

165
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,460
Master,

166
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,850
I'm afraid the Blue Lightning Tyrant
Dragon Clan is in danger too.

167
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,850
Erlong, let's return to the sect.

168
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,530
Wait!

169
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,940
I'll join you guys.

170
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,610
It's chaotic out there.

171
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,610
You guys should...

172
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,700
We'll defend the academy.

173
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,330
Teachers, don't worry about it.

174
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,850
Father, how many casualties
have our sect sustained?

175
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,820
What should we do next?

176
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,460
Once Martial Soul Hall acts,

177
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,700
they won't give us a chance to relax.

178
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,220
Therefore, I've decided

179
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,100
to relocate the sect from the outskirts
to within the city.

180
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,910
We need to seek protection from
the royal family of Tiandou

181
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,770
to stand a chance of surviving.

182
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,370
Let me join you.

183
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,850
You've sustained
serious internal injuries.

184
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,790
The sect has plenty
of affairs to tend to.

185
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,530
I can look after the wounded

186
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,010
and buy medicine for the sect.

187
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,700
I can also...

188
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,330
You should remain
in the academy for now.

189
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,530
It's safest here.

190
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,460
Rongrong,

191
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,010
you're the only hope of our sect.

192
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,250
Nothing must happen to you.

193
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,010
Don't worry.

194
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,610
I'm still here to support the sect.

195
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,580
Father!

196
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,820
Qibao Amber Sect

197
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,180
is gone!

198
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,580
Little Martial Sister?

199
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,340
Little Martial Sister!

200
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,220
Where's Tianheng?

201
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,130
Where's Tianheng?

202
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,340
Were they so cruel that they
turned their remains into ashes?

203
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,530
Erlong, try to think positively.

204
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,700
Maybe they managed to escape.

205
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,820
(Blue Lightning Tyrant)

206
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,860
(Blue Lightning Tyrant)

207
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,660
(Blue Lightning Tyrant)

208
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,890
(Father, sorry for being unfilial.
I've brought shame to the clan.)

209
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,940
(This is your favorite snack.)

210
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,460
(Take it with you.)

211
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,460
(Your grandfather told me to give it
to you before you leave.)

212
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,300
(No matter what,)

213
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,890
(you're always my son.)

214
00:14:58,770 --> 00:14:59,610
Father.

215
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,940
Bi Bi Dong!

216
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,100
She's very upset now.

217
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,530
We should give her some time alone.

218
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,610
We can keep watch outside.

219
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,730
We have to write to His Majesty
and report this situation to him.

220
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,650
We think so too.

221
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,780
Martial Soul Hall has already
launched their attack.

222
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,220
Xingluo must take early precautions.

223
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,940
We have to do something.

224
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,460
We can't just let Martial Soul Hall
get their way like this.

225
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,100
Rongrong?

226
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,610
Zhuqing.

227
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,130
Boss Dai.

228
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,010
Fatty.

229
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,610
Qibao Amber Sect was suddenly attacked.

230
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,890
I understand
that Father wants to protect me.

231
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,460
But this battle concerns
the survival of my clan.

232
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,580
I can't keep hiding

233
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,820
under everyone's wings.

234
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,420
Will you guys help me out?

235
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,490
Of course,

236
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,530
the current Qibao Amber Sect

237
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,250
has many things to handle.

238
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,130
Even if you don't say anything,
we won't just stand idly by.

239
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,250
Anyway, Rongrong, I'll follow

240
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,490
all of your arrangements.

241
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:02,650
(Grave of Late Father, Yu Yuanzhen)

242
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,990
Father, I'll definitely avenge you

243
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,570
and our sect.

244
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,770
The soul skill that killed the old chief

245
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,250
was none other than
Bi Bi Dong's Death Web Restriction.

246
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,940
Not only did she murder the old chief,

247
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:23,180
but she also destroyed his remains
and broke his bones!

248
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,050
I must kill this woman today!

249
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,530
Erlong!

250
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:29,900
Calm down!

251
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,810
Let me go!

252
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,180
You and Xiaogang are the sole survivors

253
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,610
of the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan.

254
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,660
How can I withstand this?

255
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,570
Not only did she destroy my sect,

256
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,660
but she also humiliated my elder!

257
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,330
I shall avenge them
even if it means I'll die doing it!

258
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,330
Erlong!

259
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,420
We'll definitely avenge them.

260
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,730
But this isn't the time.

261
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,620
Brother is right.

262
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,570
If all of us fall now,

263
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,330
(Grave of Late Father, Yu Yuanzhen)
no one will avenge them.

264
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,770
But Xiaogang,

265
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,570
we lost our home!

266
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,490
Ning Fengzhi and the survivors
of Qibao Amber Sect

267
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,900
had escaped into Tiandou City.

268
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,400
But the sect has suffered so much
and is no longer what it used to be.

269
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,760
And, the Blue Lightning Tyrant
Dragon Clan has no survivors.

270
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,330
We've eradicated all members.

271
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,420
What about our men?

272
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,050
After counting our men,

273
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,660
we've lost a total of
7,000 soul masters.

274
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,690
The Upper Two Clans
do live up to their reputation.

275
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,810
They actually killed
7,000 of my soul masters.

276
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,690
Although we've sustained
heavy casualties,

277
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,260
we've gotten rid of the Upper Two Clans.

278
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,410
Now, there's no leader
of the soul masters.

279
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,960
No one can stop
the Martial Soul Hall.

280
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,580
The first step of your plan
has been implemented successfully.

281
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,090
It's time to re-capture
that soft-boned rabbit again.

282
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,010
This time, you're not allowed to fail.

283
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,140
Yes, Master.

284
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,380
I should've returned here earlier.

285
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,490
What's your next plan?

286
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,460
I'll report the tragedy
of the Upper Two Clans to His Majesty.

287
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,990
I'll request permission
to train the troops.

288
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,770
Martial Soul Hall destroyed
the Upper Two Clans

289
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,460
with their strength alone.

290
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,010
They're powerful indeed.

291
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,570
If you wish to seek revenge,

292
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,570
relying on Tiandou is your only way.

293
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,570
I'm not training the troops merely
to seek revenge on them.

294
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,770
Bi Bi Dong's ambition
is obvious to all now.

295
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,140
She'll definitely target Tiandou
in the future.

296
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,220
By then, when I see her
on the battlefield,

297
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,530
I'll avenge both my family
and my nation together!

298
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,980
(Grave of Late Father, Yu Yuanzhen
Son, Yu Xiaogang)

299
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,050
Where's Erlong?

300
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,080
She said she was heading back
to inspect the sect again.

301
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,380
She's afraid that she might've
omitted some of the bodies.

302
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,860
This is bad!

303
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,060
(Blue Lightning Tyrant)

304
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,660
Bi Bi Dong!

305
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,730
Today, you shall pay for what you did
to Blue Lighting Tyrant Dragon Clan!

306
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,140
How could I forget about you?

307
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,940
You actually slipped through our grasp.

308
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,090
I'm going to kill you!

309
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,050
You're too full of yourself.

310
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,660
Xiaogang?

311
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,420
Are you here to kill me too?

312
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,900
You destroyed my clan
and killed my father.

313
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,530
Of course I'm here to kill you!

314
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,900
Don't waste your breath on her!

315
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,860
Since we're here,
let's attack her together!

316
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,180
Farting like thunder.
Blasting Luo Sanpao!

317
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,770
Your face annoys me.

318
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:13,940
Erlong!

319
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,250
What are you trying to do?

320
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,290
Bi Bi Dong! Hurry and release Erlong!

321
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,140
Xiaogang.

322
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,770
Surrender to Martial Soul Hall,

323
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,530
and I'll release her.

324
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,660
In your dreams!

325
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,860
You're the person I hate the most!

326
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,390
How could I let you manipulate me?

327
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,140
I'm the person you hate the most?

328
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,810
Did you forget how your clan

329
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,660
belittled you and humiliated you?

330
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,500
Did you forget how your sect
ostracized you?

331
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,250
I killed all of them for you,

332
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,050
yet you say that you hate me?

333
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,700
All of them are my kin!

334
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,250
Who am I to you, then?

335
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,050
(In my heart,)

336
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,290
(you're the best soul master
in the entire continent.)

337
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,570
(Even if you don't trust yourself,)

338
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,900
(you have to trust me.)

339
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,140
(I, Bi Bi Dong,)

340
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,050
(have a very high standard, you know?)

341
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,900
You slaughter my kin without mercy.

342
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,240
Now, you want to talk about bonds?

343
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,330
You're such a joke!

344
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,290
Hurry and release Erlong!

345
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,420
You chose her, huh?

346
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,770
This is the second time.

347
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,090
Yu Xiaogang,

348
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,250
this is the second time
you've abandoned me.

349
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,140
I'm the only person who remembers

350
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,940
all of the good moments we had together.

351
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,010
Bi Bi Dong.

352
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,530
Ask yourself this question truthfully.

353
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,620
Are you sure you miss me?

354
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,980
Or do you miss yourself?

355
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,620
Do you know how many
soul masters you've slaughtered?

356
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,330
How many of them
will you slay after this?

357
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,090
Hurry and release Erlong!

358
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,330
Slaughtered?

359
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,900
Since when has fate
stop slaughtering me?

360
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,010
There are plenty of people
who've hurt me and let me down.

361
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,420
I'm going to trample all of them.

362
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,050
Come at me if you harbor hatred!

363
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,330
Erlong is innocent!

364
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,530
She's not

365
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,460
when she's together with you.

366
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,250
Erlong!

367
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:46,460
Erlong!

368
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:47,530
Erlong!

369
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,290
I'll definitely avenge my sect!

370
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,940
You better come at me now!

371
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:09,810
Xiaogang,

372
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,330
do you know

373
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,620
that I've been leading
a freakish life all these years?

374
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,700
You were the only person

375
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,570
who made me feel like a human.

376
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,380
There's no difference
in killing you or me.

377
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,700
Bi Bi Dong,

378
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,980
the past version of you
has already died.

379
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,290
If you don't kill me now,

380
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,450
I shall see you on the battlefield!

381
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,810
Why are you busy again?

382
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,690
You didn't sleep a wink last night.

383
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,410
You should eat something
and take a break.

384
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,980
We need to treat the wounded

385
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,050
when Mubai and Fatty
bring back the healers

386
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,530
from outside the city.

387
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,660
You've been working non-stop yourself.
You should rest too.

388
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,220
What is this?

389
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,220
This is the new layout plan
for Qibao Amber Sect.

390
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,220
The remaining members

391
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,530
have been transferred to the city.

392
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,810
However, there are too many wounded.

393
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,620
We're severely lacking in medicine.

394
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,490
The entire sect is in chaos.

395
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,770
It can't go on like this.

396
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,180
Right now, our priority is
to tend to the wounded

397
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,560
and distribute the scarce
medicinal supplies logically.

398
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,420
Therefore, I plan to set up
temporary medical centers at

399
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,700
Area A, B, and C.

400
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,530
Those who cannot be saved will
be sent to Area A.

401
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,600
I'll send some men to look after them

402
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,620
to reduce as much
of their suffering as possible.

403
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:14,980
And,

404
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,490
we must write down their last wish.

405
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,290
The sect will do everything they can
to achieve them.

406
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,560
Those who are seriously wounded
will be sent to Area B.

407
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,170
All of the medical supplies will be
distributed to them primarily.

408
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,570
We'll do everything we can
to make sure they survive.

409
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,310
Those who are lightly wounded
will be sent to Area C.

410
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,700
They can ask for medicine themselves
and treat each other.

411
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,780
We'll minimize our manpower
as much as possible.

412
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,810
Those who aren't wounded
don't need to stay at these areas.

413
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,180
They can contribute to the sect

414
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,860
by handling daily affairs
and defensive duties.

415
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,700
They need to be prepared for
Martial Soul Hall's attack.

416
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,460
Rongrong, you finally look like
a worthy successor.

417
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,420
I know you're upset and angry.

418
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,810
We'll help you to seek revenge.

419
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,730
Qibao Amber Sect will
definitely rise again.

420
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,420
Chief Ning, you...

421
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,460
I'm fine. Our audience with
His Majesty is more important.

422
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,200
Please notify Crown Prince

423
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,760
that Chief Ning and I have
something important to report to him.

424
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,680
We have to see His Majesty today
no matter what.

425
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,420
Under His Highness's command,
His Majesty shall not see anyone today.

426
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,050
You two should leave.

427
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,530
Your Highness.

428
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,530
Chief Ning, Grandmaster.

429
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,620
I've heard about the tragedy
of the Upper Two Clans.

430
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,460
Please accept my condolences.

431
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,180
We came here to seek His Majesty
to discuss a countermeasure.

432
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,250
The two clans were
slaughtered for no reason.

433
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,590
Martial Soul Hall hunted them down
like nobody's business.

434
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,580
We're also worried about
the safety of Tiandou's royal family.

435
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,380
But you see, His Majesty
is in a daze now.

436
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,460
Even if you do meet him, I'm afraid
a discussion will prove to be difficult.

437
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,250
In a daze?

438
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,250
When did that happen?

439
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,810
Your Majesty, you're awake.

440
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,290
Imperial Physician, how long
have I been unconscious?

441
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,900
It's been quite some time.

442
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,050
Here, help me up.

443
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,690
His Majesty needs
to rest and recuperate now.

444
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,990
Since you two have
urgent matters to discuss,

445
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,900
please follow me to my study room.

446
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,490
Your Highness,

447
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,220
let them in.

448
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,700
How dare Martial Soul Hall
do such a thing?

449
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,530
Both Chief Ning and Grandmaster

450
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,380
are trusted ministers of Tiandou.

451
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,770
The Upper Two Clans are pillars
of our empire as well.

452
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,380
It's obvious that she's provoking us.

453
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,490
I command millions of soul masters.

454
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,180
I will never let her get her way.

455
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,290
Summon all of my subjects here.
We shall discuss war.

456
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,180
Your Majesty,
please take care of your health.

457
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,730
Your Majesty,

458
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,390
I also wish I could charge into
Martial Soul Hall right now.

459
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,220
But in reality,

460
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,420
instead of facing them now,

461
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,290
we should hide our strength
and bide our time.

462
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,770
Hide our strength and bide our time?

463
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,220
Grandmaster,

464
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,290
do you have no confidence
in the army of Tiandou?

465
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,250
Your Majesty, please pardon me.

466
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,390
My clan was annihilated.

467
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,090
Qibao Amber Sect was devastated as well.

468
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,010
I infer

469
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,730
that Martial Soul Hall

470
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,770
still commands
20,000 powerful soul masters.

471
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,290
There are Grand Soul Masters
among their ranks too.

472
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,250
1 soul master can fight up to

473
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,810
100 troops at once.

474
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,730
And, Grand Soul Masters
are extremely powerful.

475
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,620
If we go to war now,

476
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,250
we'll sustain heavy casualties
and lose influence.

477
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,380
Grandmaster is right.

478
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,980
Moreover, Martial Soul Hall

479
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,550
is supported by the seven elder priests

480
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,940
and other sects.

481
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,700
But Tiandou?

482
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,770
We're severely lacking in soul masters.

483
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,890
And, we don't have any
outstanding commanders.

484
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,090
Therefore,

485
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,660
we have to endure.

486
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,380
Your Majesty,

487
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,790
we cannot deal with Martial Soul Hall

488
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,180
in the blink of an eye.

489
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:45,140
Relay my order to Marshal Ge Long.

490
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,980
All soul masters in the army will

491
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,010
join Tiandou's soul master legion.

492
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,220
After that, lead the soul master legion

493
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,570
to Tiandou City for immediate training.

494
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980
Yes, Father.

495
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,010
Bi Bi Dong has devastated
the Upper Two Clans.

496
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,730
Now, the soul masters lack a leader.

497
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,490
She'll surely use the chance
to expand Martial Soul Hall's influence.

498
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,250
What we need to do now

499
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,010
is to be one step quicker than her.

500
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,530
Besides training the soul master legion,

501
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,930
we also need to contact

502
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,570
all forces who are willing
to resist Martial Soul Hall's invasion.

503
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,570
Now, the other sects are panicky.

504
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,290
Your Majesty, Grandmaster
and I intend to

505
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,870
gather the other sects under your name

506
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,080
so that we can stop Martial Soul Hall's
next operation.

507
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,980
We won't let Bi Bi Dong get her way.

508
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,050
Excellent.

509
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,980
I'll draft a decree immediately

510
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,490
and request all sects
to defend the nation together.

511
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,840
This is the emperor's decree.

512
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,530
The Qibao Amber Sect and
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan

513
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,940
were devastated.

514
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,220
The soul masters of the continent
are in danger.

515
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,900
I hereby issue a special decree
to request your help.

516
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,070
I hereby invite all sects
to Tiandou City

517
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,800
to defend our nation
against the enemies.

518
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,530
This shall be proclaimed to the world
for all to hear.

519
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,590
They're inviting all sects
to join hands with them?

520
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:06,560
That's right.

521
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,450
However, Martial Soul Halls
have sent their men to intercept

522
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,870
and suppress the sects to join them.

523
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:11,860
Very good.

524
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:13,860
Relay my order.

525
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:19,250
Martial Soul Hall will re-select
the Seven Clans after one year.

526
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,470
Yes, Your Holiness.

527
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,380
This is just the beginning.

528
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,900
Stop!

529
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,810
For this operation, no soul beasts
or soul rings shall be hunted.

530
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,530
This is an order.

531
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,700
Even if I don't kill it,
it won't be able to survive.

532
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,260
Our target is the
Hectomillennium Soft-Boned Rabbit.

533
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,480
Don't cause additional trouble.

534
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,443
You cannot afford

535
00:34:27,444 --> 00:34:28,790
for disrupting Her Holiness's plan.

536
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:29,940
Yes, ma'am.

537
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,260
From now on, you're not allowed
to move by yourself.

538
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,860
I will tell Xieyue to search for

539
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
the soft-boned rabbit's tracks nearby.

540
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,900
(Wu, where exactly are you?)

541
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,820
(Martial Soul Hall is here.)

542
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,580
(You have to look after yourself.)

543
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,490
(Wait for me.)

544
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,860
I've found new
Blue Silver Emperor fences again.

545
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,260
But I'm always one step late.

546
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,530
I still never got to see San.

547
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,490
He did quite a lot of work, huh?

548
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,780
You guys missed out
on each other perfectly.

549
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,190
That means you guys
aren't destined to see each other.

550
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,050
How come I never realized

551
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,380
that Xingdou Forest
was this huge in the past?

552
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:37,900
Watch out!

553
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:39,860
Stop!

554
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,380
I never expected an intruder
to attack the core area

555
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,690
with spiritual power.

556
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,170
That's not an attack. It's San's aura.

557
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:02,380
Tang San?

558
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,260
Is San telling me to leave?

559
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,130
I'm sure he's in danger.

560
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,130
Tang Yin?

561
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,530
Not even a single sect is here?

562
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,900
I can understand
why the Lower Four Clans

563
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,460
are hesitant to act.

564
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,900
I heard that many of the smaller sects

565
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,340
were either intercepted or divided by
the local Martial Soul Hall

566
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,900
on the spot.

567
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:48,420
The devastation of the Upper Two Clans
has divided all the sects in the world.

568
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,800
It's hard to unite them again.

569
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,860
Bi Bi Dong was too ruthless.

570
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,820
This might only be the first step
of her plan.

571
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,860
Martial Soul Hall...

572
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,130
Father.

573
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,980
Martial Soul Hall has announced

574
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,140
that they'll re-select the Seven Clans
after one year.

575
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,820
What?

576
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,870
His Majesty was overcome by rage

577
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,730
and hasn't recovered
from his old injuries yet.

578
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,990
He can only rest and recuperate.

579
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:28,820
I'm afraid

580
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,170
he has no strength
to deal with state affairs.

581
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,210
Wait outside.

582
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,990
Yes, Your Highness.

583
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,980
Has His Majesty's health

584
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,010
deteriorated to such a condition?

585
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,780
Now, I'll be honest with you two.

586
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,820
Before this, I said

587
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,820
that a crook infiltrated the palace

588
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,130
and poisoned Father.

589
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,490
Not long after that,

590
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,340
the imperial physician found out

591
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,780
that Father was struck
by a mystical poison.

592
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,570
Mystical poison?

593
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,940
This is a huge deal. How could
none of the subjects know about this?

594
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,380
Father didn't want me
to reveal it to the rest.

595
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,890
He was afraid that
the court's morale might be affected.

596
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,940
Now, Xingluo is raring to act.

597
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,780
Martial Soul Hall has their eyes on us.

598
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,980
If news of this gets out,

599
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,490
it'll be detrimental to Tiandou.

600
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,650
Luckily, the imperial physician
is a poison expert.

601
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,830
He's regulating Father's condition
one step at a time.

602
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,210
Your Highness, I'm somewhat
of a physician myself.

603
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,980
May I give His Majesty a diagnosis?

604
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:27,610
Please.

605
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,250
The poison has infiltrated his muscles.

606
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,160
This is not
the result of a single day's effort.

607
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,940
Could it be that the crook
had poisoned him more than once?

608
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,860
I'm afraid so.

609
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,380
But I already have a plan in mind.

610
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,740
If that crook comes again,

611
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,900
I'll definitely arrest him.

612
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,130
Father's condition will improve

613
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,980
as long as we get our hands
on the antidote.

614
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,870
It's obvious that the crook
harbor ill intention toward the nation.

615
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,480
He managed to poison
His Majesty many times?

616
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,050
Your Highness,

617
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,940
don't you think you should investigate
all suspicious individuals in the palace?

618
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,740
Grandmaster.

619
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,170
Father.

620
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,260
Your Majesty.

621
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:37,130
You can command Tiandou's
soul master legion with this.

622
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:43,010
I hereby appoint you
as the imperial chaplain.

623
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:49,610
You can train powerful troops
with this token

624
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,980
to defend our nation
against the enemies.

625
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,570
Tiandou's soul master legion
is a crucial national asset.

626
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,420
Your Majesty, don't you think
you're being too hasty?

627
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,170
Father, he's right.

628
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,460
The nation is honored

629
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,420
to have Grandmaster
as our imperial chaplain.

630
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,530
However, it takes time to form a legion.

631
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,250
And, you have to go through
an official process to appoint someone

632
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,420
to a position in the military.

633
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,090
Why don't you wait
until you get better...

634
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,530
There's no time to waste.

635
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,570
Get to it immediately.

636
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,050
Yes, Your Majesty.
I shall serve you with my life.

637
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:38,420
Crown Prince is too young.

638
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:44,490
You guys have to back him up.

639
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,900
Crown Prince,

640
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,210
you're too inexperienced.

641
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,780
You need to discuss
future affairs with them.

642
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:11,380
Yes, Father. I'll do my best
to protect Tiandou.

643
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,170
Imperial Chaplain, please wait.

644
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,340
Imperial Chaplain.

645
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,200
Martial Soul Hall suddenly announced

646
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,930
that they would
re-select the Seven Clans.

647
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,090
They intend to control
the soul masters of the world.

648
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,900
Judging from Bi Bi Dong's ambitions,

649
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,650
we'll definitely face her
in battle in the future.

650
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,980
Father may have handed
the tiger tally to you,

651
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,090
but you have no
practical war experience.

652
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:44,540
You have to shoulder the
heavy responsibility all by yourself.

653
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,090
I'm truly ashamed.

654
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,090
Your Highness, thank you
for being understanding.

655
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,690
But now, our nation is facing a crisis.

656
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,090
Even if I'm inept,

657
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,260
I'll do my best.

658
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,940
I won't let down His Majesty's trust.

659
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,980
Shrek Academy has
the most complete training ground

660
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,820
in Tiandou City.

661
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:02,040
Soul masters can go through
all kinds of training there.

662
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,750
And, Imperial Chaplain, I know
you prioritize our nation above all.

663
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,980
I deeply respect that.

664
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,610
But this is a huge deal.

665
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,860
I still wish to choose

666
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,690
a war veteran to be your assistant

667
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,790
so that you two can
manage the army together.

668
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,300
Imperial Chaplain, what do you think?

669
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,820
Your Highness, I appreciate the thought.

670
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:26,860
However, I'm afraid it's going against
the imperial decree.

671
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,570
Should we seek His Majesty's opinion...

672
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:31,460
There's no need to bother Father
with such a trivial matter.

673
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,300
I believe that Imperial Chaplain
can train the soul master legion

674
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,460
more efficiently with an assistant.

675
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,900
This way, we can nurture the forces

676
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:41,330
required to go against Martial Soul Hall
as soon as possible.

677
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,490
Your Highness, I see
where you're coming from.

678
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,860
It's a given that I need
an assistant with experience.

679
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,780
Once the soul master legion
enters the city,

680
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,900
they'll be stationed at Shrek Academy.

681
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,820
There's no time.
I'll head back to make preparations.

682
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,900
I shall take my leave.
