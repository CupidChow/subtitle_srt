(Douluo Continent Northern Map)

26
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,270
Why did you ask me to come here?

27
00:01:59,370 --> 00:01:59,910
See this map?

28
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,550
(Douluo Continent Northern Map)

29
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,550
This is where Tiandou is.

30
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,630
Qibao Amber Sect is right here.

31
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,750
I just realized how vast
the Douluo Continent really is.

32
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,920
I heard the environment
of this place is extremely harsh.

33
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,830
(Extreme North)
It can fully test

34
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,550
a person's willpower
and physical strength.

35
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,700
I know.

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,990
That place is called Extreme North.

37
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,580
Rongrong.

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,550
If I can survive the trials here,
I'll definitely be able to protect you.

39
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,900
Did you ask me to come here
so you can give me a geography lesson?

40
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,840
I don't want to hear it.

41
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,990
The flower cake shop you love is closed

42
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,950
on the 1st and 15th of every month.

43
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,670
Make sure you don't go there on these days.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,180
You can help me remember that.

45
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,410
Our Rongrong is as beautiful
as the blooming flowers.

46
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,660
Make sure to be happy every day.

47
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,740
Don't do things you don't like.

48
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,860
Never let yourself suffer in silence.

49
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,180
Just follow the voice of your heart.

50
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,580
Don't say anymore.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,960
I don't want to hear it.

52
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,110
But Rongrong,

53
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,420
there's something

54
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,420
I still want to tell you.

55
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,270
I'm leaving the Qibao Amber Sect.

56
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,670
No, I won't allow it.

57
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,070
Don't overthink it.

58
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,180
A lot of things
that seem troublesome now

59
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,120
aren't that important.

60
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,540
No matter how many difficulties,
we can overcome them together.

61
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,700
Didn't you say that no matter what happens,

62
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,950
we'll always be together?

63
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:29,700
Why...

64
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,110
Rongrong.

65
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,620
I must be someone powerful enough
to rival the War Soul Masters.

66
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,860
Only then will I be able to protect you.

67
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,070
That's why I must leave
Qibao Amber Sect temporarily

68
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,230
to venture into the world and train.

69
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,830
But you're already a genius
among the support branch soul masters.

70
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,990
You don't need
to change anything for me.

71
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,140
I'm not changing anything.

72
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,670
I have my aspirations.

73
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,420
I must face the truth about myself

74
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,450
and confront the dangers
and my shortcomings.

75
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,270
Only by truly growing stronger
and defying fate

76
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,110
can I bravely stand by your side.

77
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,300
Aspirations?

78
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,460
That's right.

79
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,620
Wang Zheng rescuing us
was all part of a scheme.

80
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,510
But it was also a reminder for me.

81
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,180
Even San and Boss Dai won't be content
with their current strength,

82
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,270
I definitely can't be either.

83
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,350
It looks like

84
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,590
you've thought this through.

85
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,590
So much that it gives me a headache.

86
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,230
You're always thinking of ways

87
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,620
to make me happy.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,890
Where do you find the time
to think about these?

89
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,670
When I think

90
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,550
about how to make you truly happy,

91
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,300
carefree, and without worries,

92
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,590
that's when I think about all of this.

93
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,110
But the Extreme North
is a dangerous and harsh place.

94
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,260
How can you assure your safety?

95
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,600
When have the Shrek Seven Devils ever
been defeated by difficulties in our training?

96
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,940
I never gave up before,
and I won't give up in the future.

97
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,860
But

98
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,060

99
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,910

The rule of the training ground is

174
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,780
that people with over fifty victories
won't be matched against each other.

That's not right.

177
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,110
You did not arrange it when it was
under fifty victories, either.

178
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,430
Consider it good luck then.

179
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,860

00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,830
It looks like
I won't get any answers from you.

183
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,190
What's understood doesn't need
to be said.

184
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,380
♪Scarred and worn♪

185
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,740
This is the second time today
with ninety-nine straight victories!

186
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,990
Let's give them a cheer!

187
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,780
Incredible! Great!

188
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,500
- Emissary of Hell! Emissary of Hell!
- Emissary of Hell!

189
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:31,230
- Emissary of Hell! Emissary of Hell!
- Emissary of Hell!

190
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,430
(Help...)

191
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,860
(Help!)

192
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,500
These soul beasts are acting strange.

193
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,110
If this continues, we'll all die.

194
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,020
We need to retreat.

195
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,710
Release the signal for reinforcements.

196
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,350
All right.

197
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,260
How dare you steal my things?

198
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,260
I'll chop you up right now!

199
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,140
Stop it.

200
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,380
How dare you meddle in my business?

201
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,500
King Asura...

202
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,950
No... Don't kill me.

203
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,350
You can have the kid.

204
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,660
Don't be scared.

205
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,310
San.

206
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,350
San.

207
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,430
San.

208
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:01,900
San.

209
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,470
(San.)

210
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,860
Do you want to die?

211
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,710
Stop it.

212
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,260
Did I hear that wrong?

213
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,110
The King Asura of Netherworld City

214
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,620
cannot afford to be merciful.

215
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,380
He's still a child.

216
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,500
But this is the Netherworld City.

217
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,660
There are only enemies, no children.

218
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,760
If you want to blame someone,

219
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,470
blame him for being born
in the wrong place.

220
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,990
It's not his fault he was born here.

221
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,110
It's Netherworld City's oppressive rule

222
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,620
that deprived him of his choices.

223
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,190
Haven't you gotten used to it
after all this time?

224
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,230
This world is a survival of the fittest.

225
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,140
The weak don't deserve to live.

226
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,860
No.

227
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,430
The strong have their way of living,

228
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,350
and the weak have their way of survival.

229
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,430
In a normal world,

230
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,260
the weak also have the right to live.

231
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,310
Only the paths we choose are different.

232
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,230
One day,

233
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,540
I will give the children here

234
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,900
a new world to live in.

235
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,710
Your Holiness.

236
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,830
What's your name?

237
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,540
My name is Hu Liena.

238
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,620
Good.

239
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,260
From now on,

240
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,310
you'll be under my care.

241
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,590
The weak

242
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,900
do not deserve to live in this world.

243
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,350
Keep that in mind.

244
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,260
(The weak)

245
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,230
(do not deserve to live in this world.)

246
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,740
(Keep that in mind.)

247
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,220
You're being controlled
by the killing intent.

248
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,140
Get a hold of yourself.

249
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,590
Get a hold of yourself!

250
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,660
(Not every child is lucky enough)

251
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,070
(to have someone give them
the chance to choose.)

252
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,950
Oh, no! Something bad had happened!

253
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,350
What happened to it?

254
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,860
I was checking the surroundings

255
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,020
when I found out
it led its tribe to release

256
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,380
a large amount of mist and toxins
to protect the core area.

257
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,140
But it was discovered
by the Martial Soul Hall.

258
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,660
Martial Soul Hall.

259
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,190
I will make you pay with your lives.

260
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,990
It can't hold on much longer.

261
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,260
I will heal it now so don't worry.

262
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,190
Erming, you scared it.

263
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,540
I'll do it.

264
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,390
No, it's scared of you two
so I'll do it.

265
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,610
No, you cannot.

266
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,230
You are about to undergo
the soul ring transformation.

267
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,190
It requires a lot of soul power
to heal it.

268
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,740
You'll be in danger
if you exhaust your soul power.

269
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,930
Saving life is more important.

270
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,540
It sacrificed its life for me.

271
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,780
I must save it.

272
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,260
The massacre of the Wide-Eared Ghost Fox
by the Martial Soul Hall

273
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,430
has caused many soul beasts
in the core area to wake up

274
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,710
from their long slumber.

275
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,340
I have a bad feeling about this.

276
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,150
Are you worried about the beast rampage?

277
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,550
The Martial Soul Hall
may repeatedly commit evil deeds.

278
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,100
But if the beast rampage happens,

279
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,540
it will affect everyone.

280
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,990
The consequences will be unimaginable.

281
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,050
I may not have the ability
to prevent the disaster.

282
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,980
But I must hurry to undergo
the soul ring transformation

283
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,400
and leave here as soon as possible.

284
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,300
No.

285
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,950
Your soul ring transformation
was unexpectedly interrupted,

286
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,020
and you just used
a great deal of soul power

287
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,540
to treat the Wide-Eared Ghost Fox.

288
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,260
Now, you must wait for your body to heal

289
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,630
before continuing.

290
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,340
But as long as I'm here,

291
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,710
the Martial Soul Hall won't
stop targeting Xingdou Forest.

292
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,710
Wu, don't push yourself.

293
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,260
Let me heal you today.

294
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,300
Then you can start again tomorrow.

295
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,540
All right.

296
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,500
It took you half a month
to report this to me?

297
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,340
I was too focused on going after
that soft-boned rabbit.

298
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,390
Do a secret search now.

299
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,300
The Elder Hall must not know
about the soul beasts' unusual behavior.

300
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,150
Do you hear me?

301
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,840
Yes, Your Holiness.

302
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,340
You're dismissed.

303
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,630
Let him in.

304
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,060
Serve the tea.

305
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,740
I see you already know.

306
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,300
Xingdou Forest's power is unfathomable.

307
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,910
The deeper you go into the forest,

308
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,630
the higher the intelligence
and soul power of the soul beasts.

309
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,430
If the Martial Soul Hall continues
to destroy it recklessly,

310
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,190
it will surely backfire.

311
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,890
The rain has been plentiful this year.

312
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,540
This Yinxu tea is wonderfully fragrant.

313
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,430
Once the soul beasts start to retaliate,

314
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,290
the consequences will be far worse
than you can imagine.

315
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,670
It could even plunge
the entire Douluo Continent into disaster.

316
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,050
What does that have to do with me?

317
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,390
It has everything to do with you.

318
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,090
If you didn't go
against the natural order,

319
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,780
would Xingdou Forest be in such turmoil?

320
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,390
When the heavens punish,

321
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,780
no one is exempt,

322
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,780
and neither is the Martial Soul Hall.

323
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,190
Then for the sake of the world,

324
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,580
hand over that rabbit.

325
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,150
Bi Bi Dong!

326
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,300
If you remain stubborn,
you will surely suffer the consequences.

327
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,500
Stopping now is the only correct path.

328
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,160
What identity are you using
to meddle in my affairs?

329
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,390
The former Yu Xiaogang,

330
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,670
or the current Elder Yu?

331
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,020
Stop!

332
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,540
Move aside now.

333
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,860
The soul ring will dissipate
if I don't absorb it in time.

334
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,470
Farting like thunder.
Thunder Flame of Luo San Pao!

335
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,210
Are you all right, Xiaogang?

336
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,500
Are you hurt?

337
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,390
Having two martial souls coexist

338
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,740
can be destructive to your body.

339
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,590
If you absorb the soul ring carelessly,

340
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,100
it could easily cause a backlash.

341
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,020
But if I succeed,

342
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,540
I'll have eighteen soul rings.

343
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,580
You once told me that their soul rings

344
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,120
are suitable for my second martial soul.

345
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,850
Why are you saying
it's not possible now?

346
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,870
Based on my research, your current body
can't handle adding soul rings

347
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,710
to both martial souls at the same time.

348
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,580
What is so funny?

349
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,120
Do you know how serious this is?

350
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,620
It could cause you to explode and die.

351
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,800
Are you that worried about me?

352
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,100
Actually,

353
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,990
you still care about me, right?

354
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,580
I'm not.

355
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,390
I'm just stating the facts.

356
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,580
How nice

357
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,990
it would be

358
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,340
if your words were as tender
as your heart.

359
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,300
Listen to me.

360
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,950
When you reach level 90
with your first martial soul,

361
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,910
then we can talk
about adding a soul ring

362
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,150
to your second martial soul.

363
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,100
Fine, I understand.

364
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,390
I thought I could get stronger.

365
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,340
I didn't expect having
two martial souls would be of no use.

366
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,740
You will definitely be strong.

367
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,540
My Mutated Martial Soul
is a family disgrace.

368
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,990
But your Twin Martial Souls
are completely different.

369
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,540
If you reach the level
of a Grand Soul Master in the future,

370
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,500
you will have even more options

371
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,630
when adding soul rings.

372
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,190
Xiaogang, you sure know a lot.

373
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,710
There's no other soul master
in the entire continent

374
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,820
as knowledgeable as you.

375
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,950
Stop talking nonsense.

376
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,780
I wasn't speaking nonsense.

377
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,190
I'm speaking from the heart.

378
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
The Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan
has no idea

379
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,540
what a loss it is to lose you.

380
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,150
Thank you.

381
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,090
The Lantern Festival
is famous across the continent.

382
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,390
It's my first time here.

383
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,390
What about you, Xiaogang?

384
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,500
Xiaogang.

385
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,950
Mister, I want this book.

386
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,580
Pack it for me.

387
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,300
All right.

388
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,630
Look at what I've found.

389
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,670
I've packed it for you.

390
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,990
I don't want it anymore.
Just leave it here.

391
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:53,780
Excuse me.

392
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,630
Have you seen a lively girl

393
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,870
with big eyes?

394
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,470
No.

395
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,150
Where were you?

396
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,870
Did you run into any danger?

397
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,820
It's your fault
for not focusing on me just now.

398
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,150
It was my fault earlier.

399
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,820
I'm sorry.

400
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,470
Don't scare me like that again
next time.

401
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,310
It's so crowded here.

402
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,470
What if you get lost?

403
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,340
All right.

404
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,740
Since you were really worried

405
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,230
about me earlier,

406
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,100
I'll forgive you for now.

407
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,540
I have something good to show you.

408
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,580
What is it?

409
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,020
Well? Do you like it?

410
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,430
I made it myself.

411
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,670
It's for you.

412
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,500
I like it.

413
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,100
What kind of look is that?

414
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,430
How could you say you like it
with that gloomy look?

415
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,150
You're just humoring me, aren't you?

416
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,710
Do you also mind that I...

417
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,710
Stop right there.

418
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,740
Look at it carefully.

419
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,300
See how adorable it is.

420
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,230
This is your martial soul.

421
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,500
Besides,

422
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,340
don't forget it was you who said

423
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,300
there are no useless martial souls,

424
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,100
only useless soul masters.

425
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,820
But I can't progress past level 29

426
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,670
because of my martial soul mutation.

427
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,910
Their martial souls aren't useless,

428
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,670
mine is.

429
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,060
Yu Xiaogang,

430
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,390
listen to me carefully.

431
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,740
To me,

432
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,150
you're the best soul master
in the entire continent.

433
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,340
So what

434
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,390
if you can't cultivate?

435
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,630
Focus on your martial soul research.

436
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,990
No one in Douluo Continent

437
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,390
has a thorough understanding
of soul masters like you.

438
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,950
You will certainly make your own mark.

439
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,260
Even if you doubt yourself,

440
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,540
you should believe in me.

441
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,780
I, Bi Bi Dong,

442
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,670
have a keen eye for talent.

443
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,060
Have some tea.

444
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,360
The rain has been plentiful this year.

445
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,990
This Yinxu tea is wonderfully fragrant.

446
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:18,990
All right.

447
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,710
Listen to my advice.

448
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:47,190
Stop the hunt
in Xingdou Forest right away.

449
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,150
I will get

450
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,470
what I want.

451
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,300
Since everything's already in chaos,

452
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,820
why not let it get even worse?

453
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,870
Someone,

454
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,380
dispatch more people and search for
the soft-boned rabbit with all your strength.

455
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,560
If any soul beasts stand in the way,
just kill them.

456
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,300
Bi Bi Dong!

457
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,950
The tea has gone cold.
You may leave now.

458
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,950
You're beyond help now.

459
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,950
Your Holiness...

460
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,630
Leave!

461
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,910
Come back.

462
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,230
Elder Yu's words make sense.

463
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,190
We should act discreetly.

464
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,020
You may all leave now.

465
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,670
Those from the Martial Soul Hall
are out of control.

466
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,870
Those soul beasts are...

467
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,470
Let them cause chaos all they want.

468
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,540
As long as Wu remains at the Star Lake

469
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,060
with us,

470
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,390
she won't get hurt.

471
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,950
Something is not right.

472
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,060
Wu's soul ring transformations
were never this intense in the past.

473
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,300
She used a lot of soul power yesterday.

474
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,910
Although you've helped her recover,

475
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,020
her body still lacks soul power.

476
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,340
Now isn't the right time
for the soul ring transformation.

477
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,260
So

478
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,060
she'll surely face crises and trials.

479
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,150
Then what can we do to help her?

480
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,020
She only depends on herself.

481
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,150
There's nothing we can do

482
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,150
except protect her here.

483
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,190
Wu,

484
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,300
why are you in so much pain right now?

485
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,670
(Wu,)

486
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,630
(I can feel your soul power)

487
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,950
(has reached a bottleneck.)

488
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,390
(Are you going)

489
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,390
(through the soul ring transformation?)

490
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,100
(Wu,)

491
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,990
(you can overcome this)

492
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,710
(just like before.)

493
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,710
(Picture yourself embraced tightly
by the ocean, by the forest,)

494
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,020
(and by a mother's gentle arms.)

495
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,970
(Imagine yourself surrounded)

496
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,340
(by a soothing aura,)

497
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,780
(like the air we breathe in deeply
on the training grounds)

498
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,150
(after the rain.)

499
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,660
(No. 9528)

500
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,260
- King Asura! King Asura!
- King Asura!

501
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,500
(The weak also have the right to live.)

502
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,260
(No. 9528)

503
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,280
(Win 10 Matches. Win 20 Matches.
Win 30 Matches.)

504
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,780
(Win 90 Matches. Win 100 Matches.)

505
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:34,188
(No. 9528. Disciple of Haotian Sect.)

506
00:31:34,189 --> 00:31:35,890
(Skilled in hidden weapons.)

507
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,540
Is this how you treat your guest,
King Asura?

508
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,230
If you have something to say, say it.
If not, leave.

509
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,630
Those from the Haotian Sect

510
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,150
sure are boring.

511
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,150
You still have one match left.

512
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,390
I suggest you save your energy.

513
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,300
Are you concerned about me now?

514
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,230
I'm only curious.

515
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,990
Haotian Sect has been reclusive
for so long.

516
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,260
Why the sudden interest in Demon Domain?

517
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,540
Demon Domain?

518
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:31,500
You sounded like

519
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,630
you didn't know
about the secret of the Demon Domain.

520
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,100
No matter. I can tell you about it.

521
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,390
But a secret like this requires

522
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,630
another secret as an exchange.

523
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,740
We will complete
our hundredth match on the same day,

524
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,910
and Hell's Road doesn't restrict
the number of participants.

525
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,470
If I am not mistaken,

526
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,430
you're here tonight

527
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,950
to propose an alliance.

528
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,710
Hell's Road allows
the use of soul skills.

529
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,580
It seems like we're on the same page.

530
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,100
I'm your only option.

531
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,250
If you don't want to face it alone,

532
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,390
then show some sincerity

533
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,340
and tell me everything.

534
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,340
Anyone who makes it through Hell's Road

535
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,910
not only gains free passage
in and out of Netherworld City

536
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,300
but

537
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,060
also earns an incredible reward,

538
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,670
which is the Demon Domain.

539
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,340
It not only channels your killing intent

540
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,430
to your martial soul,

541
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,910
but this enhancement

542
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,780
is having one more soul skill

543
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,880
than ordinary soul masters.

544
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,670
Moreover,

545
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,470
Domain-type skills are incredibly rare.

546
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,190
They continuously evolve,

547
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:05,060
growing stronger
as your killing intent intensifies.

548
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,990
(So this is the reason)

549
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,270
(Father sent me here to train.)

550
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,830
Are Domain-type skills truly
that valuable?

551
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,580
Of course.

552
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,100
Within the Domain you possess,

553
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,990
your strength is amplified,

554
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,990
while your opponent's power
is suppressed.

555
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,310
If used effectively,

556
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:28,140
the results can be devastating.

557
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,660
You seem to know a lot
about Domain skills.

558
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,970
Is it because you've seen
your teacher using it?

559
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,910
I've already shown my sincerity.

560
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,790
So, what's your answer?

561
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,350
This is my answer.

562
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,060
Whenever a new Demon emerges,

563
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,500
the Hell's Road suffers
immense destruction.

564
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,580
You would also be gravely affected
and your sacred body weakened.

565
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,750
Should we take early measures this time

566
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,540
before King Asura's hundredth match

567
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,870
and kill them?

568
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,540
Foolish.

569
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,750
Please calm down.

570
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,490
I was worried that if King Asura

571
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,750
and the Emissary of Hell
truly passed through Hell's Road

572
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,990
to become new Demons,

573
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,950
it would bring heavy losses
to Netherworld City.

574
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,220
What are these losses compared

575
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,620
to Netherworld City's
complete annihilation?

576
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,470
In this era,

577
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,870
the only ones capable
of threatening Netherworld City

578
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,790
are the Supreme Pontiff
of the Martial Soul Hall

579
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,310
and the Grand Haotian Master.

580
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,660
Both of them have already surpassed
the limits of Netherworld City.

581
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,830
If King Asura and the Emissary of Hell

582
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,220
die here,

583
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,100
the entire Netherworld City
will perish alongside them.

584
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,830
My King, forgive me
for my shortsightedness.

585
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,830
Then what should we do now?

586
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,950
If they choose to risk their lives

587
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,500
and perish in Hell's Road,

588
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,790
they will have only themselves to blame.

589
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:24,790
Understood.

590
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,140
The Martial Soul Hall in Gengxin City
needs a person in charge.

591
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,910
Depart immediately.

592
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,990
(Myles, Martial Soul Hall)
Thank you for your trust, Your Holiness.

593
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,180
Gengxin City is the City of Metal.

594
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,580
There must be a deeper purpose
for sending me there.

595
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,910
May I ask for clarification?

596
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,700
Make the Blacksmiths Guild there
pledge allegiance

597
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,060
to the Martial Soul Hall.

598
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,470
What use could
this mere Blacksmiths Guild

599
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,350
have for Your Holiness?

600
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,350
Even ants can form an army.

601
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,430
Blacksmiths may have a lowly status.

602
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,350
But they forge armor and weapons,

603
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,390
which is crucial
to achieving my grand ambition.

604
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:06,970
I shall see to it

605
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,750
that this task is accomplished.

606
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,820
(Gengxin City)

607
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,220
(Blacksmiths Guild, Gengxin City)

608
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,660
Move aside and do your work!

609
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,310
Oh no, Myles is here!

610
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,220
Get out of the way!

611
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,270
Move aside!

612
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,180
Get lost!

613
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,620
Are you blind?

614
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,350
How dare you block Mr. Myles' path?

615
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,620
We must settle matters with the Tribe
of Strength and the Blacksmiths Guild today.

616
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,750
Or none of us will be able

617
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,790
to answer to Her Holiness.

618
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,830
- Yes.
- Yes.

619
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,800
Could you lower the price a little more?

620
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,390
A Smith Scholar crafted this.

621
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,180
This is excellent.

622
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,830
This shield.

623
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:12,580
You can try.

624
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,790
This one, this, and this too.

625
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,640
Martial Soul Hall.

626
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,990
The people
from the Martial Soul Hall are here!

627
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,790
Let's get out of here.

628
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,870
Mr. Lou, I've come

629
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,650
(Lou Gao, Blacksmiths Guild President)
with the utmost sincerity.

630
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,350
Please take a look.

631
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,140
A small gift, just a token of respect.

632
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,700
Lath-like gold?

633
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,140
Mr. Lou, you have such discerning taste.

634
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,830
But I cannot accept gifts for nothing.

635
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,060
You should take it back.

636
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,660
Take it back!

637
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,910
I understand

638
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,870
that God of Ironsmith Lou Gao

639
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,830
is dedicated to weapon crafting
with all his heart.

640
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,570
If you join the Martial Soul Hall,

641
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,430
I will provide

642
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,540
whatever you need.

643
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,320
Don't listen to him.

644
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,100
Back then, the Martial Soul Hall used

645
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,270
(Tai Nuo, Tribe of Strength)
the same methods to entice

646
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,760
the Four Single Attribute Tribe
in exchange for information.

647
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,270
We refused them back then.

648
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,060
Then you...

649
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,950
Tai Nuo!

650
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,620
That was old grievances
from many years ago.

651
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,870
Bringing it up

652
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,140
only damages the relationship.

653
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,390
We should look to the future.

654
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,580
Her Holiness
currently thinks highly of you.

655
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,020
In the future, blacksmiths will stand

656
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,220
on equal footing with soul masters.

657
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,870
You are carrying

658
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,660
the future of all blacksmiths
on your shoulders.

659
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,270
Don't let instigation
by some outsiders stop you

660
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,870
from seizing this opportunity.

661
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,310
Thank you
for your thoughtful arrangement.

662
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,500
But the Blacksmiths Guild

663
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,390
is made up of nothing
but honest craftsmen.

664
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,750
We can't offer Martial Soul Hall much.

665
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:45,270
Let alone worthy of your favor.

666
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,470
Please leave.

667
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,700
Since you refuse my offer,

668
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,430
then I'll have to use force.

669
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,750
You wouldn't dare!

670
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,660
(Tai Tan, Tribe of Strength Chief)

671
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:07,180
So, are you Tai Tan,
the Chief of the Tribe of Strength?

672
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:07,990
Yes.

673
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,220
If you plan to oppose
the Blacksmiths Guild

674
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,910
and the Tribe of Strength,

675
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,700
I, Tai Tan, will take you on!

676
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,430
You are

677
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,950
a Grand Soul Master?

678
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:39,790
Fine.

679
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:42,350
Then I will return

680
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,060
and tell Her Holiness exactly
what happened today.

681
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,750
Old pal!

682
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,750
Luckily, you came just in time.

683
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,140
Otherwise, I would have...

684
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:01,950
Father?

685
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,310
Why are you glancing around?

686
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,220
It wasn't only my strength
that stunned them earlier.

687
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,190
There was also

688
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,100
a powerful aura

689
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,140
and a familiar one.

690
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,580
It feels like

691
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:17,700
Master's aura.

692
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,580
Master?

693
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:20,790
Father,

694
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,870
I'm sure you're mistaken.

695
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,790
Master has gone missing for years.

696
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,540
How could he suddenly appear here?

697
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,100
I will make them know the consequences
of going against the Martial Soul Hall.

698
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,060
Understood.

699
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,020
Who took them!

700
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,350
