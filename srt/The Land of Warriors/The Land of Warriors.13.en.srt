00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from
Tangjia Sanshao's novel "Soul Land")

25
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,260
=Episode 13=

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,460
I've been waiting for your return.

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,380
Father.

28
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,050
Who did it?

29
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,690
Who did this to you?

30
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,100
Silly boy, did your Aunt
teach you for nothing?

31
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,770
Father, tell me who did this.

32
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,130
I want them dead!

33
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,050
Listen here.

34
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,100
In the entire Douluo Continent,

35
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,890
no one can do this to me.

36
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,170
I did it myself.

37
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,610
After I left Moon Pavilion,

38
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,220
I severed my arm and leg

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,540
to extract the fused soul bones.

40
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,570
Why?

41
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,800
Once the soul bone
is fused with the body,

42
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,850
it can never be removed.

43
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,970
It can only be removed
if the soul master dies.

44
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,290
Father...

45
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,260
I am still alive, am I not?

46
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,130
As a Grand Soul Master,

47
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,730
the soul bones fused

48
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,540
with my limbs can be extracted
as long as I wish.

49
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,340
But the cost was too high.

50
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,660
Currently, my soul power is at level 75,

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,170
and I have seven soul rings left.

52
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,290
As for why I did this...

53
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,570
San,

54
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,540
you've always wanted to know
about my past, right?

55
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,610
Come on.

56
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,450
Thank you.

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,130
I didn't lie to you.

58
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,570
You saved my life,

59
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,500
so you're my family's benefactor.

60
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,660
I saved you

61
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,610
because you can be of help.

62
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,690
I plan to find a new hunting team.

63
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,660
Two people

64
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,570
are always safer than one.

65
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,290
Don't worry.

66
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,730
I owe you my life.

67
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,690
From now on,

68
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,570
I will do

69
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,340
whatever you say.

70
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,730
What are you doing?

71
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:25,850
Start a fire.

72
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,900
If we want to travel together,

73
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,700
you need to heal your injuries first.

74
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,800
You are really kind to your friends.

75
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,980
My friends are even kinder to me.

76
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,250
Where are they now?

77
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,020
I suppose

78
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,850
they are undergoing training
in different places now.

79
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,490
Come with me.

80
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,100
Yin,

81
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,140
I brought our son to see you.

82
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,050
Father.

83
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,700
What did you just say?

84
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,290
On your knees.

85
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,900
She's your mother

86
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,980
and also a Hectomillennium Soul Beast.

87
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,370
Yin,

88
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:41,980
can you see him now?

89
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,980
Our son is an adult now.

90
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,980
You were also the one

91
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,370
who named him San.

92
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,460
Can you feel it?

93
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,410
You left the Blue Silver Domain for him.

94
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,170
Mother,

95
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,170
I am here

96
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,490
to see you.

97
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,930
Since your mother is gone,

98
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,490
I lost the will to live.

99
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,290
Yin,

100
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,020
I didn't take good care of our son.

101
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,170
Forgive me.

102
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,460
Mother,

103
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,980
Father treats me well.

104
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,820
He taught me how to be a blacksmith
and the Random Air Hammer Skill.

105
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,250
He secretly protected me
when I was studying at the academy.

106
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,300
I didn't tell you about this before

107
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,100
because your mother and I wanted you

108
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,010
to live a simple and happy life.

109
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,530
Father.

110
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,340
When your Martial Soul awakened,

111
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,940
and I saw the Blue Silver Plant
and the Haotian Hammer in your hands,

112
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,890
only then I understood.

113
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,770
You have your path to follow.

114
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,980
San,

115
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,300
you're more outstanding
than I have expected.

116
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,420
That's why I'm telling you about my past

117
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,490
and your mother's story.

118
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,530
I was like that too.

119
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,250
Your uncle was the one

120
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,730
who taught me how to drink.

121
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,530
I never heard you mention of Uncle.

122
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,700
What kind of person is he?

123
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,730
He's a poor guy

124
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,580
I've been teasing

125
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,980
since young.

126
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,220
(Young Tang Xiao)

127
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,770
I think you're itching for a beating.

128
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
I've already reached level 70 now.

129
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,890
We still don't know
who'll get the beating.

130
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:11,940
Come on.

131
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,700
Father is here.

132
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,300
Both of you should stop now.

133
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,340
Father.

134
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,460
Father.

135
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,460
Hao,

136
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,460
come here.

137
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,490
Hao.

138
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:14,530
Come

139
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,980
and take it.

140
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,820
Father,

141
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,940
this is the Haotian Sect's inherited
Right Arm Bone.

142
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,530
I already have one soul bone.

143
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,650
Why not give it to Hao?

144
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,130
Stop talking nonsense.

145
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,530
You've reached level 70 today.

146
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,220
It's a form of support to you
by the Haotian Sect.

147
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,610
Take it.

148
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,820
Take it quickly.

149
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,580
Hao,

150
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,700
Xiao and I are more reserved.

151
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,850
But you're different.

152
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,100
I have confidence in you.

153
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,980
You will lead the Haotian Sect to glory.

154
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,770
You have now possessed two
out of the three soul bones

155
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,370
that the Haotian Sect has.

156
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,460
You won't let us down, right?

157
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,490
Father.

158
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,180
Come.

159
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,370
Get up.

160
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,700
All these years,

161
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,940
both of you never left the sect.

162
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,370
Without experiencing
the vastness of the world,

163
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,010
how can you have the ability
to lead a sect?

164
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,250
This is the Martial Soul Hall's
Elder Token.

165
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,010
It will be helpful during your journey
across the continent.

166
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:25,850
Hao,

167
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,890
take it.

168
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,130
Ten years.

169
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,490
I'm giving you ten years
to go out and gain experience.

170
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,850
After ten years,

171
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,980
I want to see your confidence

172
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,100
and ability to lead the sect here.

173
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,300
Can you do that?

174
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,100
- Yes!
- Yes!

175
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,580
Father, rest assured.

176
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,180
Within ten years,

177
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,940
we will reach the level
of Grand Soul Master.

178
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,530
Well said.

179
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,060
Father,

180
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,530
I want to go too.

181
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,940
Father, let me go.

182
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,130
Let me go with them.

183
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,940
Behave yourself.

184
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,300
Be good.

185
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,100
I'll bring you tasty treats
when I return.

186
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,060
All right, then.

187
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,460
Go and get ready.

188
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,700
(Becoming a Grand Soul Master)

189
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,730
(only means you can protect the sect.)

190
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,530
(But beyond that,)

191
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,850
(you must also have the maturity
and sense of responsibility)

192
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,700
(to bring the sect's progress forward.)

193
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,370
(Without me by your side,)

194
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,370
(both of you must support)

195
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,940
(and protect each other.)

196
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,470
(Remember these advice.)

197
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,100
(Essence lies beneath.)

198
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,220
(Adapt to change.)

199
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,850
(Act as needed.)

200
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,460
(Nothing is permanent.)

201
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,700
We quickly made a name

202
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,530
for ourselves

203
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,010
in the world of soul masters.

204
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,730
Back then, they called us
the Double Star of Haotian.

205
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,100
It was also the time

206
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,700
I met your mother.

207
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,130
Her name was Yin,

208
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,520
after the name of Blue Silver Plant.

209
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,220
Are we just going to leave
those clothes behind?

210
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,700
Yuehua made those for us.

211
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,100
Her needlework skills are too poor.

212
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,700
We just fought with some soul beasts,

213
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,130
and the clothes are all torn up.

214
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,340
Look how handsome you look now.

215
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,370
As an older brother,
you sure have no conscience.

216
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,650
Her first time making clothes
was pretty good.

217
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,180
Take my undeserved gain for granted?

218
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,230
Return the clothes to me.

219
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,490
Don't ruin my new clothes.

220
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:44,880
Let's go!

221
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,700
Help me.

222
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,130
What do you want?

223
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:08,850
Get lost!

224
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:21,850
Let's go.

225
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,640
That girl stole so many
of our gold coins.

226
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,770
Catch her and bring her back!

227
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,420
Head that way!

228
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,980
My name is Yin.

229
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,610
Thank you for saving me.

230
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,300
Hello,

231
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,700
I'm Tang Xiao.

232
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,980
I'm Tang... Tang Hao.

233
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,850
Did you really steal their gold coins?

234
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,060
You're here.

235
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,220
Miss.

236
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,060
Thank you, Miss.

237
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,730
Thank you, Miss.

238
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,730
Thank you, Miss.

239
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,340
Here you go.

240
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,060
Thank you.

241
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,610
Thank you.

242
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:38,980
Thank you.

243
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,100
Thank you.

244
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,530
Thank you so much.

245
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,770
What do you want?

246
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,650
Hand over the money.

247
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,450
Miss Yin gives it
to the disaster victims.

248
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,360
Why should I give you?

249
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,820
Because you're not a disaster victim.

250
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,420
These people are starving and naked.

251
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,500
They can't have clean hands
or clothes like yours.

252
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,770
I...

253
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,160
Look at that fellow.

254
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,650
Since you're strong and young,

255
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,380
you should find
something meaningful to do.

256
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,250
If I see you sponging off others again,

257
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,390
I won't let you off easily!

258
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:14,900
That's shameful.

259
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,380
You seem a bit awkward.

260
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,700
But you're not as dull as you look.

261
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,620
I... I'm not dull.

262
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,330
It depends on who I talk to.

263
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,900
Let me treat you to a meal

264
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,860
as my way of thanking you
for saving me.

265
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,490
But

266
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,940
how did you get involved
with those people earlier?

267
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,860
I'm curious too.

268
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,730
Those people robbed
the disaster relief funds.

269
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,900
I was only giving it back to the people.

270
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,330
But I accidentally got caught.

271
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,420
So you were standing up
against injustice to help the less fortunate.

272
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,180
I wonder if you'd be willing
to travel with us after this.

273
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,050
Please don't misunderstand.

274
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,860
I... I... I don't mean anything else.

275
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,530
I just think

276
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,490
we could go on a journey together to...

277
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,460
To gain experience.

278
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,050
I have no other ulterior motives.

279
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,660
We... We're from the Haotian Sect.

280
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
He's the eldest,

281
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,730
and I'm the second.

282
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,810
Everyone calls us...

283
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,900
The Double Star of Haotian?

284
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,940
- Yes.
- Yes.

285
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,380
I should be younger than both of you.

286
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,530
So I guess I'll be the third.

287
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,860
(That was the happiest time of my life.)

288
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,660
(We roamed the land upholding justice,)

289
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,570
(training together,)

290
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,330
(and traveled to almost
every corner of the continent.)

291
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,530
(But our growing presence
also drew more attention.)

292
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,980
Which is more tender? You or this plum?

293
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,900
Your uncle returned
to the Haotian Sect alone

294
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,490
at the sect's request.

295
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,140
Later, your mother confessed

296
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,810
her true identity to me.

297
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,380
She was a Hectomillennium Soul Beast,

298
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,090
the Blue Silver Emperor, on the verge
of entering the Mature Phase.

299
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,330
You must've faced many dangers.

300
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,330
We were deeply in love at the time.

301
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,140
We only care for each other.

302
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,420
How could we sense any danger?

303
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,730
It was under this very sky

304
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,420
that your mother and I vowed

305
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,180
to be together

306
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,530
as husband and wife.

307
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,290
Right here?

308
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,330
Yes.

309
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,810
I had already become
a Great Soul Master at that time.

310
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,140
So I decided to bring your mother home.

311
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,180
I thought,

312
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,570
with your grandfather being open-minded,

313
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,220
he would surely accept us.

314
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,220
But I didn't expect

315
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,010
to encounter great trouble

316
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,010
on the way back to Haotian Sect.

317
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,420
The Martial Soul Hall?

318
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,940
Yes.

319
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,380
The Martial Soul Hall
had already been keeping an eye on us.

320
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,770
They had discovered

321
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,220
that your mother is
a Hectomillennium Soul Beast.

322
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,460
At that time,

323
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,940
Qian Xunji coveted
your mother's Hectomillennium soul ring

324
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,180
and was determined to hunt her down.

325
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,420
For this reason,

326
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,180
they even sent a Grand Soul Master
to go after her.

327
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,810
Hand her over!

328
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,380
Then I will spare your life!

329
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,510
What happened after that?

330
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,010
Did you and mother make it back
to the sect safely?

331
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,520
We couldn't return to the sect anymore.

332
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
Since the Martial Soul Hall failed
to capture us,

333
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,790
they would definitely demand
the Haotian Sect to hand us over.

334
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,530
As expected,

335
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,980
the Martial Soul Hall's
Supreme Pontiff, Qian Xunji,

336
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,090
issued a decree,

337
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,730
forcing the Haotian Sect
to hand us over.

338
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,220
At that time, your grandfather
was already critically ill.

339
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,620
In his fury, he passed away.

340
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,380
We never got to see him
for the last time.

341
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,570
Your mother was already pregnant

342
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,050
and couldn't move around freely.

343
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,140
So we found a place to hide.

344
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,420
We planned to wait until you were born
before deciding what to do.

The Martial Soul Hall does not wish
to be enemies with the Haotian Sect.

377
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,899
(Qian Xunji, former Supreme Pontiff)
But protecting soul beasts

378
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:39,520
(of Martial Soul Hall)
is against the natural order.

379
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,180
You're the heir to the number one sect
on the Douluo Continent.

380
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,050
Do not go against the natural order.

381

382
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,570
You're delusional!

383
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,810
She is my wife.

384
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,180
Since you insist on your way,

385
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,140
don't blame the Martial Soul Hall
for being ruthless.

386
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,140
Eighty-one Strikes in One!

387
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,860
You're finally here.

388
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,090
You come after me
to obtain a soul ring and a soul bone.

389
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,490
But do you know what kind of ability

390
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,490
the Hectomillennium
Blue Silver Emperor possesses?

391
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,810
Do you know what is the highest secret
of the Blue Silver Domain?

392
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,220
What are you trying to say?

393
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,460
The highest secret
of the Blue Silver Domain

394
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,660
is immortality.

395
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,050
No one can kill me.

396
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,250
Let alone can anyone obtain
my soul ring and soul bone,

397
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,250
unless I choose to end my life.

398
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,220
Don't doubt it.

399
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,730
As long as you
let Tang Hao and my child go,

400
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:00,900
I will go with you

401
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,220
and end my life

402
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,700
to offer my soul ring and soul bone.

403
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:07,860
All right.

404
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,250
I promise you.

405
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,380
Yin,

406
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,290
don't do it.

407
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,730
You must not.

408
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,180
You can't do this.

Don't cry.

414
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,570

Your mother possessed
the Blue Silver Domain.

467

She could have survived.

468
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,820
But she chose to sacrifice herself
without hesitation

469

to protect us both

470

she truly merged with me.

Qian Xunji died from his injuries.

473

This debt isn't just on me.

474
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,940
The Haotian Sect was also blamed.

475

In the aftermath,
all kinds of forces began to stir.

476
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,420
After several conflicts,

477
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,050
your uncle was forced
to expel me from the sect to save

478
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,900
the lives of thousands
of the sect's people.

479
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,650
From today on,

480
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,710
the Haotian Sect will expel Tang Hao,

481
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,460
withdraw from the sect rankings
of the Douluo Continent,

482
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,420
live in seclusion,

483
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,570
and no longer interfere
with the continent's affairs.

484
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,460
The four tribes that depended on
the Haotian Sect,

485
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,130
such as the Strength, Defense,
Agility, and Destruction were left

486
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,820
with no support to rely on.

487
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,650
They were suppressed
by the Martial Soul Hall

488
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,900
and gradually grew weaker.

489
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,090
Over the years,

490
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,900
I could only help them in secret.

491
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,490
Your mother's voice

492
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,820
often echoes in my ears.

493
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,980
She keeps saying
that she has no regrets in this life.

494
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,570
But I have spent my life blaming myself

495
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,780
for not being able to protect her.

496
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,380
Mother,

497
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,530
forgive me for only coming
to see you today.

498
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,260
Today, I finally understand

499
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,050
your intentions.

500
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,900
You were strict with me before

501
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,650
because you didn't want me
to make the same mistake.

502
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,210
The old injuries I have now

503
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,820
were from that time.

504
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,860
At that time, I was already
an eight-ring Great Soul Master.

505
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,940
But I couldn't protect your mother.

506
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,490
Now,

507
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,420
I see how you and Wu love
each other so deeply.

508
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,860
How can I bear

509
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,050
to see you two go through

510
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,340
the same pain we did back then?

511
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,090
I understand now.

512
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,940
Your mother only left behind
her soul bone

513
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,300
and a seed.

514
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,380
I have already planted the seed.

515
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,380
But I'll never get to see her

516
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,780
in human form again.

517
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:05,780
Perhaps

518
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,740
we still have a chance to see Mother.

519
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,530
This is the wish we both share
as father and son.

520
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,860
Your mother left this for you.

521
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,340
Absorb this soul bone.

522
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,980
Your mother will be very happy

523
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,340
to see her son receiving her protection.

524
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,220
You can start absorbing it now.

525
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,130
Good boy, San.

526
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,690
Don't cry.

527
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,210
Forgive me, San.

528
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,090
I can't watch you grow up anymore.

529
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:00,980
Mother.

530
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,460
Father.

531
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,340
Father,

532
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,090
I just saw Mother.

533
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:30,900
Perhaps some of her memories
are preserved within the soul bone.

534
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,130
You should be able
to feel her love for you.

535
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,690
I have completely fused
with the soul bone.

536
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,300
Well done.

537
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,690
My greatest comfort
in the past two decades

538
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,690
has been watching you grow up.

539
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:50,900
Son,

540
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,900
I'm proud of you.

541
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,740
All right, silly boy.

542
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,530
Don't feel sad. I'll survive.

543
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,740
My old injury
has become life-threatening.

544
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,900
Before severing my limbs,

545
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,210
I forced the internal injury deep
within my body.

546
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,980
As my limbs were severed,

547
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:26,130
the threat to my life
was temporarily resolved.

548
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,380
At least I can live a few more years.

549
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,380
I wish to be there and see you

550
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,530
bring the sect back to its former glory.

551
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,340
Rest assured, Father.

552
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,530
I will not only bring
the sect back to glory

553
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,460
but will also avenge you and Mother.

554
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:47,050
I didn't tell you all this
so you could seek revenge.

555
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,570
I only want you to know

556
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,300
that if a strong person chases

557
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,210
their goals at all costs,

558
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,860
it could bring a great disaster
to the world.

559
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,090
Just like what Qian Xunji and I did
in the past.

560
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,570
You didn't do anything wrong.

561
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:05,010
The fault is on Qian Xunji
and the Martial Soul Hall.

562
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:09,490
They will pay for what they did.

563
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,010
You still don't understand what I meant.

564
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,340
But I believe

565
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,210
you will understand it one day.

566
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,570
At that moment, you will understand

567
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,090
the true meaning of becoming strong.

568
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,780
