=The Land of Warriors=

00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

3
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,860
=Episode 34=

4
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,260
First Uncle,

5
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,930
I was the one who established
the Tang Clan.

6
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,930
How dare you establish your own sect?

7
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,220
Tang San!

8
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,959
Did you forget about the promise

9
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,500
you made to us

10
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,260
when you came to Haotian Sect last time?

11
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,570
Elders,

12
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,220
the world outside Haotian Sect

13
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,700
is going to face a storm.

14
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,090
Martial Soul Hall intends
to take over Douluo Continent.

15
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,039
I understand that Haotian Sect
doesn't want to handle the situation

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,750
as it has gone into hiding
for many years.

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,090
But out of the Upper Three Clans,

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,860
the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan
and Qibao Amber Sect

19
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,930
have been eradicated by
Martial Soul Hall.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,620
Yuehua already told us about that.

21
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,250
I never expected

22
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,690
Martial Soul Hall
to be as arrogant as this.

23
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,300
Douluo Continent is in chaos.

24
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,780
There's no leader to lead them.

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,510
The soul master world is in urgent need

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,550
of a sect that can
go up against Martial Soul Hall.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,320
Elders, I haven't fulfilled
the promises I made to you two.

28
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,780
That's why Haotian Sect
cannot come out of hiding yet.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,500
Therefore, I established the Tang Clan

30
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,850
and gathered
the four single attribute tribes

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,900
and all those
who are determined to stop them

32
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,850
in order to fight
Martial Soul Hall to the very end.

33
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,509
So, you gathered the four
single attribute tribes,

34
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,170
which was under
Haotian Sect before this?

35
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,130
That's right.

36
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,580
The Haotian Sect has let down
the four single attribute tribes.

37
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,810
You established the Tang Clan
to go against Martial Soul Hall.

38
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,759
Due to that, you called them again.

39
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,090
I guess this can be seen as a way
of our sect giving them an account.

40
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,900
Tang Clan is an independent sect.

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,900
It has nothing to do with Haotian Sect.

42
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,710
That's the promise I made
to the four single attribute tribes.

43
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,970
First Uncle, elders,
I hope you guys can understand.

44
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,580
I understand.

45
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,750
Although we didn't
have a choice back then,

46
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,810
Haotian Sect did let them down indeed.

47
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,410
Since Tang Clan is your sect,

48
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,060
I suppose

49
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,740
you'll treat them well.

50
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,650
Forget it.

51
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,300
San, I'll only tell you this.

52
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,370
Even if you've established
your own sect,

53
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,300
you're still a member of Haotian Sect.

54
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,810
You must remember the promises

55
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,970
you made to us.

56
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,300
I'll definitely remember them.

57
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,020
And, I won't go back on my promises.

58
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,530
Once your soul power reaches level 80,

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,250
you need to acquire
a Hectomillennium Soul Ring.

60
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,460
Second Elder,

61
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,850
even most Grand Soul Masters
can't achieve that.

62
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,690
However,
the future leader of Haotian Sect

63
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,020
must be capable of that much.

64
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,549
I never expected you
to complete one of the three conditions

65
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,140
Elder gave to you in such a short period.

66
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,820
You've already acquired
a Hectomillennium Soul Ring

67
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,460
when you're still a soul emperor.

68
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,050
Seems like you didn't let down
our expectations at all.

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,090
San didn't let us down.

70
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,380
Elders, I suppose you two
can have peace of mind now.

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,780
Excellent.

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,140
Excellent indeed.

73
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,820
I wasn't wrong about you.

74
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,730
The Hectomillennium Soul Ring

75
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,380
proves that you're a kid
with accountability

76
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,050
and guts.

77
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,079
San,

78
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,340
you can do whatever

79
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,260
you want to do.

80
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,940
Haotian Sect will always back you up.

81
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,580
Okay.

82
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,650
First Uncle,

83
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,260
I need to discuss with you

84
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,850
the case of Senior Lou Gao.

85
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:17,780
All right.

86
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,940
You guys can go ahead.

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,820
Leave Wu to me.

88
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,460
Wu,

89
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,650
I'm San's aunt.

90
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,140
You don't need to be scared.

91
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,820
Follow me, okay?

92
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,970
(His aunt already discovered
that I'm not a human.)

93
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,730
(She's so gentle.)

94
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,669
(San,)

95
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,020
(I like your aunt.)

96
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,730
These are the hidden weapons
used by the Tang Clan.

97
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,900
Senior Lou Gao is responsible
of creating them solely.

98
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,159
Ever since

99
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,079
Tang Clan absorbed
the four single attribute tribes,

100
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,220
we're growing stronger day by day.

101
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,850
We need a large number
of hidden weapons.

102
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,189
However, I'm afraid Senior Lou Gao alone

103
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,730
cannot forge all these two
elite hidden weapons by himself.

104
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,900
Take a look.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,100
(Storm Pear Blossom Needles)

106
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,780
Do you need my help?

107
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,610
That's right.

108
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,780
Senior Lou Gao requires the help

109
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,530
of a Grand Soul Master's Haotian Hammer.

110
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,140
After giving it some thought,

111
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,380
First Uncle,
you're the only suitable candidate.

112
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,820
Sect Leader Tang,

113
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,490
I'll be honest with you.

114
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,610
I hate myself for being incompetent.

115
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,349
I cannot forge these weapons

116
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,260
in a short period.

117
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,519
But today, fate has led me to you,
Sect Leader Hao.

118
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,410
Now, there's hope for us!

119
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,260
With the help

120
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,380
of Haotian Sect's Grand Soul Master,
which is you,

121
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,919
there's nothing we cannot achieve!

122
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,820
Am I right?

123
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,580
That's right.

124
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,700
Yeah.

125
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,700
Now, our biggest goal

126
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,820
is to revitalize the Tang Clan.

127
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,220
Revitalize the Tang Clan!

128
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,290
That's right.

129
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,820
Although Haotian Sect is no longer related
to the four single attribute tribes,

130
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,220
I still feel like I've let them down.

131
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,429
It's good that I can contribute

132
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,650
to the Tang Clan.

133
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,599
Take this as our way
of making it up to them.

134
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,090
Is that a yes, then?

135
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,730
Sect Leader, you're the best!

136
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,580
I'll leave the creation
of the two hidden weapons to you!

137
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,479
I'll leave them to you!

138
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,039
I'll leave them to you!

139
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,479
Elder Lou.

140
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,580
Elder Lou!

141
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,730
First Uncle,

142
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,900
thank you.

143
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,170
You don't need to thank me.

144
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,170
You helped yourself out.

145
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,170
Did you notice

146
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,189
how the two elders looked

147
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,140
when they saw your
Hectomillennium Soul Ring?

148
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,290
I would rather

149
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,140
be rid of this soul ring.

150
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,140
I understand your feelings.

151
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,309
I'll do my best to help Lou Gao

152
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,959
create the hidden weapons you need.

153
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,490
Just tell me if you need anything else.

154
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,290
We're a family.
There's no need to be courteous.

155
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,530
First Uncle,

156
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,919
I heard that Martial Soul Hall

157
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,669
has a Level 99

158
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,940
Grand Soul Master called Qian Dao Liu.

159
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,730
Have you heard of him?

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,890
Of course I've heard of him before.

161
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,660
Do you think

162
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,639
Haotian Sect would be afraid
of Martial Soul Hall

163
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,180
if he didn't exist?

164
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,180
Without him,

165
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,220
no one dares to say

166
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,770
that they're powerful enough
to eradicate Haotian Sect.

167
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,069
Actually, Haotian Sect

168
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,970
once had
a Level 99 Grand Soul Master as well.

169
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,420
His strength is on par
with Qian Dao Liu.

170
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,420
That man is your great-grandfather,
Tang Chen.

171
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,669
Your great-grandfather, Tang Chen,
and Martial Soul Hall's Qian Dao Liu

172
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,789
were known as the Two Peaks
of the soul master world.

173
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,700
The two engaged in a duel

174
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,890
to see who was superior.

175
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,850
Challenging is the Haotian Hammer,

176
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,180
lofty is the Haotian Sect.

177
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,060
That's a grand technique indeed.

178
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,890
But Tang Chen,

179
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,970
in this world,

180
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,429
there's only one place
for a Level 99 Grand Soul Master,

181
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,540
and that is me!

182
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,090
Qian Dao Liu,

183
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,180
you're mistaken!

184
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,890
If Level 99 is the only thing you see,

185
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,770
you can remain here forever!

186
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,970
The peak we're standing on right now

187
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,250
is the venue where they held
their final battle.

188
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,010
Qian Dao Liu lost that battle
by a tiny margin.

189
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,820
After that, both of them retired.

190
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,180
With the gradual passing
of soul masters of their generation,

191
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,250
fewer and fewer people know about them.

192
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,060
Where did Great-Grandfather go, then?

193
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:09,789
I heard that the old man

194
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,250
sought a higher realm of soul power.

195
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,919
He hoped that he could
break the shackles

196
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,460
of a Level 99 Grand Soul Master

197
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,490
and reached the legendary Level 100.

198
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,250
Level 100?

199
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,340
Level 100, huh?

200
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,250
What kind of realm is that?

201
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,540
I don't know.

202
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,940
No one knows either.

203
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,250
Legend has it that the realm
is close to the realm of gods.

204
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,090
They're known as god-like beings.

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,429
But the old man never returned
to Haotian Sect

206
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,890
upon leaving.

207
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,789
Maybe he had already
reached Level 100 successfully

208
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,610
and reached another level.

209
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,090
Maybe he failed

210
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,770
to reach Level 100

211
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,940
and had perished.

212
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,730
What about Qian Dao Liu, then?

213
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,340
He didn't dare to take the risk.

214
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,180
He's been staying at
Martial Soul Hall ever since.

215
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,130
He's in charge of the Elder Hall.

216
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,340
Level 99 is already a level
that most soul masters

217
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,730
can never achieve.

218
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,610
That's right.

219
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,850
All these years, I've been trying
my best to reach Level 97,

220
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,239
but I haven't succeeded.

221
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,999
I'm afraid I can't reach
Grandfather's level

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,130
in this lifetime.

223
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,220
However,

224
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,279
your father had the potential
to do so initially.

225
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,540
First Uncle, don't worry.

226
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,850
What Father hasn't accomplished,

227
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,250
I will surely accomplish it.

228
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,879
After leaving Haotian Sect,

229
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,180
I'll undergo training at a place
called Haishen Island.

230
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,370
What?

231
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,829
You're heading to Haishen Island?

232
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,370
First Uncle, do you
know about that place?

233
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,700
Of course.

234
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,340
San,

235
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,239
Haishen Island

236
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,090
isn't a place to be trifled with.

237
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,829
Your great-grandfather, Tang Chen,
and Qian Dao Liu

238
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,639
were defeated by
the residents there before.

239
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,540
Great-Grandfather and Qian Dao Liu
were actually defeated?

240
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,890
Could their opponent be...

241
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,940
It's the Grand Ocean God Master
of Haishen Island.

242
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,039
Although
Grand Ocean God Master's strength

243
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,250
is close to that of Qian Dao Liu's,

244
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,119
she can utilize
all the resources on the sea

245
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,069
as long as she's on

246
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,180
Haishen Island.

247
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,189
No one except

248
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,039
Level 100 Grand Soul Masters
can defeat her.

249
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,250
It's no wonder Great-Grandfather
and his rival lost to her.

250
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,090
San,

251
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,119
if you guys insist on
heading to Haishen Island,

252
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,589
I have two pieces of advice for you.

253
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,309
Firstly,

254
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,789
ocean soul beasts are ferocious.

255
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,420
And, they're very powerful.

256
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,090
You must be cautious.

257
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,189
Secondly,

258
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,180
do not kill on the island.

259
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,370
Ocean soul masters might
resist outsiders,

260
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,919
but they usually chase them away.

261
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,340
They won't kill them.

262
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,180
However, if you guys
kill anyone on the island,

263
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,429
they shall

264
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,130
seek revenge with
no intention of stopping.

265
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,700
They will do so until
they've avenged their fallen comrade.

266
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,370
I will remember that.

267
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,850
San,

268
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,060
I know

269
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,549
you're in a hurry to fulfill
the promises you made to the elders

270
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,370
and your father's wish.

271
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,829
But remember this.

272
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,340
Nothing is as important

273
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,730
as your life.

274
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,540
No.

275
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,789
I'm not in a hurry to grow stronger

276
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,490
for the reasons above.

277
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,730
Maybe those reasons
did motivate me in the past.

278
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,119
But when I saw
the innocent living beings

279
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,090
that was slaughtered
by Martial Soul Hall,

280
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,130
when I saw Wu sacrificing herself
to rescue me,

281
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,730
when I saw the rampant

282
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,180
chaos and battle
occurring in the continent,

283
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,850
I only understood why
I needed to become stronger.

284
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,460
Someone who's truly powerful
won't act for their own desires.

285
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,429
People like them

286
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,730
will shoulder the world
as their responsibilities,

287
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,940
even if people who are unrelated to them
might be involved.

288
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,180
For the peace of our continent,

289
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,090
for the sake of our loved ones,

290
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,180
for the people to sleep in peace,

291
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,580
for a tomorrow

292
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,940
that all beings can look forward to.

293
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,060
A tomorrow that all beings
can look forward to, huh?

294
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,039
I never expect you

295
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,399
to grow this much

296
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,060
after our previous encounter.

297
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,130
San.

298
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,130
You're the pride
and joy of Haotian Sect.

299
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,309
Are you ready to absorb
the second soul bone?

300
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,540
I'm ready.

301
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,460
Focus and calm the mind!

302
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,180
You inflicted harm upon yourself

303
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,490
to acquire Emperor Xue Ye's trust.

304
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,660
Excellent job.

305
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,639
He has promised to appoint me
as the crown prince.

306
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,660
The person he cares about
is Xue Qing He,

307
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,770
not a fake like you.

308
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,460
If you take the act too seriously,

309
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,850
you might not be able
to finish the task in the future.

310
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,130
I always remember the task
you've assigned to me.

311
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,090
I won't let anyone bewitch me.

312
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,279
Traitor.

313
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,970
Your Holiness,

314
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,340
please spare me!

315
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,490
Did you see that?

316
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,130
All traitors shall die.

317
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,540
Mother...

318
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,180
Your Holiness, do you think

319
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,709
I'll betray you?

320
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,820
Will you?

321
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,890
I've never thought of betraying you.

322
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,490
But Mother, to you,

323
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,660
am I the same as everyone else?

324
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,010
Am I your daughter?

325
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,090
Or am I a pawn that you can

326
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,359
cast away easily when you don't need me?

327
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,460
I told you this before.

328
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,700
Do not call me that.

329
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,999
And, remember this.

330
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,829
Those who are useful are called pawns.

331
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,130
Those who aren't useful
are called good-for-nothings.

332
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,940
I understand now.

333
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,010
I did everything as per her will!

334
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,700
I never expected her

335
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,090
to treat me like a pawn!

336
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,940
Is she truly my mother?

337
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,130
Xue,

338
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,090
if you're not willing to continue,

339
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,490
you may return from Tiandou.

340
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,490
You may return to Elder Hall.

341
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,420
I shall protect you.

342
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,660
She doesn't dare

343
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,940
to do anything to you when I'm around.

344
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,970
Grandfather, I can't just live
under your protection forever.

345
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,970
Since she doesn't care about
our mother-daughter bond,

346
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,330
there's no need to dwell on it.

347
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,900
Since she's placing me at Tiandou,

348
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,010
I will own Tiandou in the future.

349
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,330
One day, she shall pay

350
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,810
for her actions.

351
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,180
Focus!

352
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,330
Hurry and get up.

353
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,010
Xue,

354
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,770
you're my pride and joy.

355
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,559
You've absorbed the second
Angel Set soul bone

356
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,919
successfully.

357
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,469
If you wish to inherit the title
of Elder Hall's High Priest,

358
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,770
you have to receive
the recognition of the Angel.

359
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,330
You may pray here.

360
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,919
The Angel will give you a trial.

361
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,730
You may only achieve your goal faster

362
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,860
under the guidance of a god.

363
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,319
Remember, you mustn't be distracted.

364
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,970
Understood,

365
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,730
Grandfather.

366
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,469
(You can rest at ease)

367
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,100
(now that Senior Lou Gao
has met First Uncle.)

368
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,709
(Shouldn't we head back
and prepare ourselves)

369
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,220
(before departing for Haishen Island?)

370
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,570
No.

371
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,530
There's one more important thing to do.

372
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,490
Are you ready?

373
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,570
We'll meet my parents soon.

374
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,290
What?

375
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,010
Why didn't you discuss it with me first?

376
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,599
We'll depart for Haishen Island soon.

377
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,599
Before that,

378
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,730
I think we should meet them.

379
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,509
But this is too sudden.

380
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,029
I didn't prepare anything, you know?

381
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,140
My family is your family.

382
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,530
There's no need to prepare gift
for your own family.

383
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,810
What matters is the reunion.

384
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,180
You do have a point.

385
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,429
But this is our first meeting after all.

386
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,380
You didn't even
prepare any gifts on my behalf.

387
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,900
You're the best gift there is.

00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,029
I've never met your mother before.

391
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,189
Do you think she'll like me?

392
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,970
She'll definitely like you.

Yin,

407
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,250
the children have returned safely.

408
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,250
Father,

409
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,460
Mother,

410
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,100
I've brought Wu here to visit you guys.

411
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,460
What happened to Wu?

412
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,229
Not long ago, your mother and I sensed

413
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,290
that you two might be
in some kind of danger.

414
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,620
That reaction only happens
when a sacrifice is being carried out.

415
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,949
This Martial Soul Hall move

416
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,970
is a long-term one indeed.

417
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,700
It's just that your youth
has gone to waste.

418
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,330
Tang San,

419
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,570
you shouldn't become my enemy.

420
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,229
You should become my teammate

421
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,420
and fight alongside me.

422
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,250
What a shame.

423
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,490
People of different aspirations
like us cannot get along!

424
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,460
Xue,

425
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,290
stay focused!

426
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,319
Bi Bi Dong is no longer

427
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,700
hiding her ambitions.

428
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,010
San,

429
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,900
since you've chosen

430
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,220
to go against her
by establishing Tang Clan,

431
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,399
that means

432
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,140
you've understood the true meaning
of being strong.

433
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,140
The strong help the weak.

434
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,810
I won't let Bi Bi Dong get her way.

435
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,669
We'll undergo training at Haishen Island

436
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,250
to go against her.

437
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,709
We'll engage
Bi Bi Dong in a final battle

438
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,660
upon our return.

439
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,079
I'm truly happy

440
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,620
that you have such aspirations.

441
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,810
As your father,

442
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,220
I should've lent you a hand.

443
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,570
But look at the current state I'm in.

444
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,530
I'm afraid I cannot do anything for you.

445
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,490
No.

446
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,469
Father,
you've already done a lot for me.

447
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,220
I will accomplish the tasks

448
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,770
you couldn't.

449
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,010
What is this?

450
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,570
Father, this is my gift to you.

451
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,140
It's called a prosthetic limb.

452
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,399
I designed this for the injured members

453
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,220
of Qibao Amber Sect.

454
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,810
I reserved a set for you.

455
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,709
You can move freely as you did before

456
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,220
after putting this on.

457
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,810
Father,

458
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,810
I'll deal with the unrest outside.

459
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,460
I just hope that you and Mother

460
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,620
can live here peacefully.

461
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,250
Okay.

462
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,380
I brought Wu back

463
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,420
so that you and Mother

464
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,460
can bear witness to our union.

465
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,490
Uncle?

466
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,380
- Wu.
- Wu?

467
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,879
Your consciousness will be damaged

468
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,919
if you return it
to your body forcefully.

469
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,730
You should go back.

470
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,970
Don't worry.

471
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,229
The Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet
in my body

472
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,570
came from Ice Fire Mouth Spring.

473
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,799
Strong life energy
is all over the place.

474
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,330
I'll be fine if I return
to my body temporarily.

475
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,100
San,

476
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,380
I know what you're trying to do.

477
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,860
I won't miss out
on such an important moment.

478
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,810
Father,

479
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,250
I want to get engaged to Wu.

480
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,770
I hope you

481
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,180
and Mother

482
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,050
can be our witnesses.

483
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,660
Wu,

484
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,730
I'll be honest with you.

485
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,330
To us,

486
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,460
you were already
a part of our family long ago.

487
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,660
I lost my mother when I was very young.

488
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,250
I barged into
the human world by accident.

489
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,860
Luckily, I got to know
San when I was young.

490
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,050
We supported each other
throughout our journey.

491
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,940
We've been through
many hardships together.

492
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,460
San and I were already one long ago.

493
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,050
Our hearts were in sync.

494
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,860
To me,

495
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,420
you were a part of my family
long ago as well.

496
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,330
I'm very happy

497
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,420
that you can accept me.

498
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,839
Yin,

499
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,010
did you hear that?

500
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,250
Once, I blamed the heavens
for being unfair to me.

501
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,319
But ever since I met San,

502
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,570
I knew

503
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,220
that I would become

504
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,420
the luckiest person in the world.

505
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,050
No.

506
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,460
I'm the luckiest person in the world.

507
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,220
What have I done to deserve
a great wife like you?

508
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,380
I will notify my parents,

509
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,010
the gods and deities,

510
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,330

511
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,420

At least 3 years, and at most 50 years.

688
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,620
So, once we part ways,

689
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,810
we might not be able

Xue Beng as your student.

I hope that you can look after him.

703
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,719
Therefore, it's reasonable
for him to bow to you.

704
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,810

706
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,949

Xue Beng

711
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,660
has always been mischievous.

712
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,770
However, he's actually
enduring in silence.

713
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:38,060
I'm willing to hand Tiandou to him.

714
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,220
However, he isn't fully fledged yet.

715
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,810
I'm worried about him.

716
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,949
He needs someone

717
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,980
who can support him

718
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,700
and who he can trust.

726
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,700
However, according to our identities,

727
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,220
I'll always be your subject.

728
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,890

00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

735
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,100
Prince Lan Hao,

736
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,660
from now on, this will be
the symbol of your identity.

737
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,290
This is
the Vast Sea and Universe Shield.

738
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,060
In a sense,

739
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,250
it can be considered a soul tool.

740
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,620
This item serves as the symbol
of Prince Lan Hao.

741
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,290
It has plenty of functions.

742
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,220
Prince Lan Hao,
just inject your soul power

743
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,700
into it when you head back.

744
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,330
You'll understand it after that.

745
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,250
It should be of use to you

746
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,450
during your training.

747
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,879
Your Highness, I shall

748
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,450
do my best to assist you
as long as I'm around.

749
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,620
I shall assist you in creating
a prosperous Tiandou.

750
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,810
How did this happen?

751
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,890
It feels like a mysterious power
has flowed into this realm

752
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,620
after the appearance
of the Vast Sea and Universe Shield.

753
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,580
I even feel a little giddy.

754
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,850
(How many years has it been?)

755
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,989
(Now, I've finally found someone)

756
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,180
(who can withstand
the power of the vast ocean.)

757
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,890
(But the result will depend on)

758
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,220
(whether or not
you can withstand the upcoming trials.)
