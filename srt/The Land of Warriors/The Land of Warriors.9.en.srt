=The Land of Warriors=

23
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from
Tangjia Sanshao's novel "Soul Land")

24
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,820
=Episode 9=

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,760
I did feel the pressure

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,480
from the Grand Soul Master.

27
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,680
However, it wasn't Tai Tan.

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,470
It was someone else.

29
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,430
I was inept.

30
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,430
Your Holiness, please give me
another chance.

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,590
I'll surely bring more men.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,150
I'll destroy the Blacksmiths Guild
and the Tribe of Strength.

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,120
I'll force them to submit to us.

34
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,270
You fool.

35
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,430
They're of no importance.

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,990
What I want are the blacksmiths.

37
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,120
I want people who can forge weapons

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,270
for the Martial Soul Hall.

39
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,560
Do you understand?

40
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,350
I do.

41
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,440
I understand.

42
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,480
I'll get to it immediately.

43
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,950
I surely won't disappoint you.

44
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,280
Guys, place your bets.

45
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,390
Come, place your bets.

46
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,550
Place your bets.

47
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,140
I placed my bet on them, and they lost.

48
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,350
Place your bets.

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,510
This time, we only have one bet.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,550
Will King Asura be able
to win the next 100 Match?

51
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,160
You don't say? Of course he will.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,050
All the Soul Masters
who participated in this match

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,630
are selected by the Netherworld King.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,110
All of them are Great Soul Master
and law enforcers.

55
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,880
The law enforcers?

56
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,110
So, they can use soul skills?

57
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,040
That's right.

58
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,110
Wait.

59
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,880
What are you doing?

60
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,110
I changed my mind.

61
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,660
Don't do that.

62
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,950
Place. No. You already placed.

63
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,990
You can't change your bet.

64
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,320
That dagger has been with me
for a long time.

65
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,280
You mustn't disappoint me now.

66
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,720
San,

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,790
I'll stop waiting for you

68
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,070
if you don't look for me now.

69
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,070
Wu?

70
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,350
San,

71
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,920
just give up.

72
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,110
I want you to stay alive.
I don't want you to die.

73
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,480
Wu!

74
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,190
San, just give up.

75
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,350
I don't want you to die.
I want you to stay alive.

76
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,520
I don't want you to die.

77
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,600
San,

78
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,400
I want you to stay alive.
I don't want you to die.

79
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,280
San,

80
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,960
just give up.

81
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,960
(An illusion soul skill, huh?)

82
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,160
(I appreciate your effort, Netherworld King.)

83
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,700
Have you seen through the illusion?

84
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,840
- King Asura!
- King Asura!

85
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:09,310
- King Asura!
- King Asura!

86
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:16,080
- King Asura!
- King Asura!

87
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Congratulations, young King Asura.

88
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,600
Thank you for your
meticulous arrangement.

89
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,400
But I'm not the only person
you should congratulate.

90
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:29,640
There's the

91
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,190
Emissary of Hell as well.

92
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,670
This is my answer.

93
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,660
Since you're not willing to join us,
I shall not bother you any longer.

94
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,520
A secret

95
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,750
requires another secret in exchange.

96
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,790
The air in Netherworld City is
filled with a slow-acting toxin.

97
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,990
It can agitate individuals.

98
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,960
If one keeps consuming
the toxic Netherworld Shot,

99
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,290
it's the same as drinking poison
to quench one's thirst.

100
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,230
Could it be...

101
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,480
This toxin is a slow-acting toxin hidden
within one's bloodstream.

102
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,230
It should be related to Hell's Road.

103
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,430
By using soul power to lure individuals,
it makes them addicted to it.

104
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,990
It's not too late for you.

105
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,310
You can seek treatment in time
if you stop consuming it.

106
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,840
However, if you keep this up,

107
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,890
I'm afraid that you might
no longer be my companion

108
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,430
when we're at Hell's Road.

109
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,190
You might cause trouble for me instead.

110
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,670
This item can suppress the toxicity of
the Netherland Shot to a certain extent.

111
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,040
Take this if you trust me.

112
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,600
I trust you.

113
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,750
Therefore, you should trust me too.

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,890
It's because both of us
intend to get out alive.

115
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,480
I'm sincere with you.

116
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,520
However, I don't even know
what you look like or your name.

117
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,400
Expressions can be disguised,

118
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,230
but not masks.

119
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,990
The current version of me
you're seeing right now

120
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,840
is actually more truthful
and dependable.

121
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,080
My name is Tang Yin.

122
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,040
Tang Yin, huh?

123
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,280
I'll remember that.

124
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,840
Remember to stay alive
after tomorrow's 100 Match.

125
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,230
Of course.

126
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,400
I've already completed
the 100 Matches of Hell.

127
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,960
Please unlock the Hell's Road for us.

128
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,480
The Emissary of Hell and I
will take on the challenge together.

129
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,880
It's no wonder the Emissary of Hell
wasn't willing to open

130
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,760
the Hell's Road after
winning 100 matches.

131
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,830
So, he was waiting for you two.

132
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,520
Asura King, Emissary of Hell,

133
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,640
I'm making an exception
by granting you two the title "Demon".

134
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,830
You two are also
the guests of Netherworld City.

135
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,640
You two may enter and exit
Netherworld City at will.

136
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,070
You two are only one rank below me.

137
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,310
No need for that.

138
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,710
I'll definitely check out Hell's Road.

139
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,710
What about you?

140
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,790
Are you willing to become
an esteemed guest of Netherworld City?

141
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,370
Thank you for your kind intention.

142
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,790
However, I still wish to pass this trial

143
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,520
together with the Emissary of Hell.

144
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,160
Once Hell's Road is unlocked,

145
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,950
I won't be able to ensure your survival.

146
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,760
And, thanks to your background,

147
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,670
it's impossible for you two
to become friends.

148
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,400
You two can only become enemies.

149
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,880
In this world,

150
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,190
there are no enemies forever.

151
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,360
Only benefits.

152
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,240
You're actually worried about our lives.

153
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,160
If I'm not mistaken,

154
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,950
Hell's Road

155
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,360
should be the core of Netherworld City.

156
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,160
It provides energy to the place.

157
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,710
You're worried that we might damage
Netherworld City

158
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,880
while we explore Hell's Road, right?

159
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,880
You think you're smart.

160
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,640
Do you think Hell's Road
can be conquered that easily?

161
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,880
There are challenges
for joint trials as such.

162
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,040
It might be even more terrifying.

163
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,880
You don't need to worry about that.

164
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,240
If that's the case,

165
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,400
you two may give it a try.

166
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,280
It's good to have a companion

167
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,590
on Hell's Road.

168
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,040
The killing intent is too strong.

169
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,160
Try to stay sober.

170
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,590
Thank you.

171
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,280
I never expected your soul power
to be good enough

172
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,550
to ward off the corrosion
of Hell's Road.

173
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,070
What's down there?

174
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,470
Can you see it clearly?

175
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,950
It's a giant blood pool.

176
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,590
Judging from the smell,

177
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,880
I think it's Netherland Shot.

178
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,830
Netherland Shot?

179
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,470
That's right.

180
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,590
Based on my prediction,

181
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,880
the soul power of all the people who failed
to conquer the Netherworld City

182
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,710
should be in the blood pool.

183
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,160
Netherworld City

184
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,520
isn't a place where the fallen reside.

185
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,120
It exists to strip power off of them.

186
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,040
This place should've been
eradicated long ago.

187
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,710
This should be
the so-called Hell's Road.

188
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,280
Let's go.

189
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,790
Wait.

190
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,610
Why are you taking off your clothes?

191
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,950
For safety's sake, I think it's safer
if I tie you and me together.

192
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,000
Come.

193
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,640
You can use mine.

194
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,280
I'll lead the way. You can follow me.

195
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,520
Okay.

196
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,520
I hear something.

197
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,590
It's bats.

198
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,120
These bats aren't
attacking us immediately.

199
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,460
It's as if they're up to something.

200
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,950
Such shocking speed and accuracy.

201
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,550
(It's a Domain.)

202
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,550
(How did it appear on him?)

203
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,280
They don't dare to attack us again.

204
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,040
Move forward. Gather them.

205
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:36,920
Follow me.

206
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,790
(He could adjust his tactics
on the fly.)

207
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,520
(He also has the Talent Domain on him.)

208
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:03,670
(Tang Yin,)

209
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,830
(what other capabilities
are you hiding from me?)

210
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,550
Let's go.

211
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,000
Asura King is different indeed.

212
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,790
This is merely the beginning.

213
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,590
We're in trouble.

214
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,830
I never expected them to have a leader.

215
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,070
I'll give it a try.

216
00:16:59,190 --> 00:16:59,670
Watch out!

217
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,790
It wants to destroy Hell's Road!

218
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,560
Run!

219
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,230
Tang Yin!

220
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,190
Thank you.

221
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,800
It's capable of regeneration?

222
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,270
Run!

223
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,670
Run!

224
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,030
Darn you!

225
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,270
A Controlling Soul Master like you
is actually this swift?

226
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,670
Seems like you have a soul bone
that enhances your speed.

227
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,510
Bingo.

228
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,270
Let's go.

229
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,940
It's charging its power.

230
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,400
It's going
to unleash a strong move.

231
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,500
We mustn't allow it to finish.
Aim at its weak point.

232
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,660
It should be the three heads.

233
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,990
We have to destroy them
at the same time. Give me a rope.

234
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,750
Take it off. Tie it on your tail.
After that, use it to swing me.

235
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,730
- Try to get as close to it as possible.
- Okay.

236
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,270
Do it!

237
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,430
Purple Divine Light!

238
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,880
Should we take a break?

239
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,660
Both of us have expended
a lot of energy.

240
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,270
According to what I know,
there are three levels to Hell's Road.

241
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,960
And, each level is tougher
than the last.

242
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,750
I suppose

243
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,750
we've conquered the first level.

244
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,190
I suppose your tail

245
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,750
is a result of
an attached soul bone, right?

246
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,690
You come from the golden era
of Martial Soul Hall.

247
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,390
You do live up
to your reputation indeed.

248
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,600
The Haotian Sect
is also filled with talents.

249
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,640
And, although you guys
live in a retreat,

250
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,190
you guys do know quite a lot
about Douluo Continent.

251
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,990
My king, what's wrong?

252
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,190
I don't believe that he can
conquer the next level.

253
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,950
After all, even the mighty Tang Hao

254
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,840
was almost killed by it back then.

255
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,400
The temperature
is getting higher and higher.

256
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,320
It seems like we're getting closer
and closer to the blood pool.

257
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,640
The Talent Domain,

258
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,430
which helps you to maintain maximum

259
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,160
combat strength,

260
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,030
what exactly is it?

261
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,120
(Talent Domain?)

262
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,090
(So, the power I gained after)

263
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,910
(my martial soul
was awakened for the second time,)

264
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,160
(it was actually a Domain?)

265
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,080
Listen.

266
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,880
What was that?

267
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,400
It's a giant snake.

268
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,400
Run!

269
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,510
This is?

270
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,190
The Ten-headed Burning Sun Serpent.

271
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,990
The Ten-headed Burning Sun Serpent
is extremely powerful.

272
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,700
Using it as the soul ring
for my Blue Silver Plant's martial soul

273
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,290
will receive a tremendous boost in power.

274
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,360
Did you read that clearly?

275
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,030
This isn't a soul beast.

276
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,080
Rumor has it that such serpents
are highly venomous.

277
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,560
They have the most potent
fire toxin out of all serpents.

278
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,420
An inner core will form if it goes through
10,000 years of cultivation.

279
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,360
(Ten-Headed Serpent Inner Core)
It's located behind the nine heads.

280
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,710
When the inner core emerges, even
Heaven and Earth lose their brilliance.

281
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,600
If one acquires its inner core,
all serpents will retreat in fear.

282
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,840
Rumor has it that one requires more than
martial strength to obtain it.

283
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,163
They have to be determined

284
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,430
and stay composed

285
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,560
before they can achieve their goal.

286
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,400
It's an amazing serpent.

287
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,320
Why was it only recorded as a myth?

288
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,670
If only I could encounter it.

289
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,610
You don't know
what's good for you at all.

290
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,460
This is a beast of ruin.

291
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,740
If you're lucky enough to encounter it,

292
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,770
I have one piece of advice for you.

293
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,450
Just run.

294
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,980
Its scales are tougher than steel!

295
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:24,610
Don't move.

296
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,290
Tang Yin!

297
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,130
The Ten-headed Burning Sun Serpent
has a singular head.

298
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,650
I've already destroyed one of them.

299
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,570
Eight heads
are hiding beneath its giant gill.

300
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,860
They'll only surface
when it breathes fire or is enraged.

301
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,700
- We need to launch a joint attack.
- Okay.

302
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,130
Four more left.

303
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,290
Look!

304
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,130
It's going to self-destruct!

305
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,530
Haotian Hammer!

306
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,460
Random Air Hammer Skill!

307
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,810
All

308
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,980
to one!

309
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,330
Tang Yin?

310
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,660
Have we passed the level?

311
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,370
Something's off.

312
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,800
(Proof, Name, Tang San,
Martial Soul, Blue Silver Plant)

313
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,600
(Soul Power, Innate Full Soul Power)

314
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,090
I'm the new part-timer.

315
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,590
Trash Martial Soul, Blue Silver Plant?

316
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,810
Innate Full Soul Power?

317
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,220
Who are you trying to kid here?

318
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,900
How dare you forge your proof?

319
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,370
You're pretty daring, aren't you?

320
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,020
Go away. Stop creating trouble for me.

321
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:57,940
I didn't forge it.

322
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:01,180
Nuoding Academy doesn't accept people
with Trash Martial Soul.

323
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,200
Leave immediately!

324
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,220
You brat!

325
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:26,900
Scram!

326
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,810
Let's do it together!

327
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,090
You have no friends, only enemies.

328
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,260
Don't blame me for this.

329
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,570
Only one of us can remain here.

330
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:15,940
Trust

331
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,610
will become the weapon that kills you.

332
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,900
You arrogant fool.

333
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,360
Trash Martial Souls
will always be trash.

334
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,760
How dare you come to the academy
with a Trash Martial Soul?

335
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,390
You're not even fit
to run our errands.

336
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,230
- Precisely!
- Trash Martial Soul!

337
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,900
You're someone with
a Trash Martial Soul.

338
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,530
What are you unsatisfied with?

339
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,260
How dare you fall for your enemy?

340
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:49,760
Such foolishness!

341
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,790
How dare you ally yourself with me
when you have a Trash Martial Soul?

342
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,770
Stop!

343
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,220
So, you possess Twin Martial Souls?

344
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,050
(Father said my life would be in danger)

345
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,520
(if other people found out
that I possess Twin Martial Souls.)

346
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,530
(What should I do?)

347
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,260
(Should I silence him?)

348
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,590
I don't know what you're talking about.

349
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,460
I once investigated 647 individuals

350
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,320
with Blue Silver Plant
as their Martial Soul.

351
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,090
Only less than 3% of them

352
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,420
have soul power.

353
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,020
And, all 3% of them

354
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,020
have a Level One soul power.

355
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,460
But you? You have
a Level Ten Innate Full Soul Power.

356
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,500
The size of one's innate soul power

357
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,380
corresponds to the quality
of one's soul power.

358
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,090
Therefore, I'm sure

359
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,660
that you possess
another powerful martial soul

360
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,330
besides the Blue Silver Plant.

361
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,460
There's an exception for everything.

362
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,530
Why can't I be an exception?

363
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,890
For the past century,

364
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:18,810
there were only three individuals
with Twin Martial Souls.

365
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,610
There were 19 individuals
with Innate Full Soul Power.

366
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,810
All of them possess
immense Martial Souls.

367
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,810
14 of them inherited their Martial Soul
from their families.

368
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,020
Five of them had Mutated Martial Soul.

369
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,610
However, your Blue Silver Plant
isn't one of them.

370
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,420
Therefore, I'm sure

371
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,220
that my judgment is correct.

372
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,500
Mutated Martial Soul?

373
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,740
What is that?

374
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,850
You still have a lot to learn.

375
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,850
I can't explain it to you
in a short period.

376
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,370
However, I need to tell you this.

377
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,090
Blue Silver Plant isn't
a useless Martial Soul.

378
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,130
People with Twin Martial Souls are rare.

379
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,740
You have to keep this secret well.

380
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,330
If not, your life
will be in danger in the future.

381
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,420
You can report for duty now.

382
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,570
You're the first person

383
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,950
who said that Blue Silver Plant
wasn't a Trash Martial Soul.

384
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,280
Please take me as your disciple.

385
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,020
However, this is the second time

386
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,390
you wish to harm someone
who bears no ill will toward you.

387
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,220
You're too defensive.

388
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,260
Shouldn't I take the preemptive strike

389
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,500
when there's potential danger?

390
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,900
If you see everyone

391
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,850
as your enemy,

392
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,020
you will be lonely
for the rest of your life.

393
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,090
Remember,

394
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,020
never succumb to your evil thoughts.

395
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,810
If not, it shall hold you hostage.

396
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,050
Hu Liena! Wake up!

397
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,500
Hu Liena!

398
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,370
Here you go.

399
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,570
Why should I trust you?

400
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,810
What if it's poisoned?

401
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,810
As friends, we need
to be honest with each other.

402
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,330
As foes, we should
show each other no mercy.

403
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,740
Look.

404
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,180
Why did you come here?

405
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,020
Because my family needs money urgently.

406
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:04,420
I need to repay my family's debt
and help my sister to seek treatment.

407
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,530
If only she could run around healthily

408
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,730
like you.

409
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,690
If so, you have
to try your best to stay here

410
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,940
for her sake.

411
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,420
Watch your back!

412
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,780
No!

413
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,730
No!

414
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,420
Hu Liena, we're affected
by the serpent's toxin.

415
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,610
Sober up.

416
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,420
Mi!

417
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,500
Sober up!

418
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Mi!

419
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,730
As friends, we need
to be honest with each other.

420
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,090
As foes, we should
show each other no mercy.

421
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,780
Trust will become
the weapon that kills you.

422
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,130
I can't hang in there anymore.

423
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,690
Tang Yin,

424
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,500
I'll entrust my life to you.

425
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,900
You may choose my fate.

426
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,210
I owe you my life

427
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,860
if you can help me to escape!

428
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,420
Hurry! Do it!

429
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,500
(You still can't bear to kill me, huh?)

430
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,460
(What are you hesitating about?)

431
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,530
(She's your enemy. Kill her!)

432
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,750
(She's the beloved disciple
of Bi Bi Dong.)

433
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,570
(Kill her now, and you'll have
one less opponent in the future!)

434
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,090
(Remember,)

435
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,860
(never succumb to your evil thoughts.)

436
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,690

Asura King actually

Without its inner core,

460

the Ten-headed Burning Sun Serpent
cannot be revived.

461
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,250
It's one of the keys in maintaining

go to hell.

00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,940
Take a look.

497
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:58,690
Waiter,

498
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,780
regarding that incident,

499
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,860
are there still no clues about it?

500
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,730
All the soul masters who vanished

501
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,980
were experts too.

502
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,600
It's quite sinister, don't you think?

503
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,990
How can they investigate the case?

504
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,820
If so, can we still come out
for a drink at night?

505
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:12,610
Yeah.

506
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,050
About that, I'm not sure about that either.

507
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:19,460
Waiter.

508
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,730
What should we do in the future?

509
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,780
Sir.

510
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,940
Let me ask you something.

511
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,250
How do I reach this place?

512
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,210
Dream-Building Romance Camp?

513
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,610
This training camp

514
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:35,020
only serves to dupe young girls.

515
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,080
People thought
that they've found true love.

516
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,380
In reality, it's a scam.

517
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,020
A scam?

518
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,460
Love is precious, you know?

519
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,090
How could they do this?

520
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,170
All the scammers are soul masters
that are hard to deal with.

521
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,130
People call them
The Three Wandering Swordsmen.

522
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,500
I heard that they're related
to the Martial Soul Hall.

523
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,380

of the worst crook again?

524
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,530
His name is Bu Le.

00:42:58,730 --> 00:42:59,980
What a bad egg.

526
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,300
Bu Le?

00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,300
