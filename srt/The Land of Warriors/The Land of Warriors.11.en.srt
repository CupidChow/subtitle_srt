=The Land of Warriors=

23
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from
Tangjia Sanshao's novel "Soul Land")

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,140
=Episode 11=

25
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,060
What do you think?

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,420
Do you still like it?

27
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:45,860
It's delicious.

28
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,970
It still tastes like it used to.

29
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,860
In the past, Father liked this as well.

30
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,940
When you and Xiao caused trouble,

31
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,700
I remember I always had to
make this snack to make Father happy

32
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,890
so he would scold both of you less.

33
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,650
How is Xiao?

34
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,450
I went to visit him.

35
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,020
He looked a lot paler than before.

36
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,300
Haotian Sect might be retired

37
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,020
but

38
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,580
he still needs to manage
many major and minor issues of the sect.

39
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,490
Since you've returned,
let me go back to the sect with you.

40
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,610
I've let the sect

41
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,100
and him down.

42
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,610
He might not say it

43
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,650
but he has always missed you.

44
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,930
My name has been removed
by Haotian Sect.

45
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,210
I can no longer go back.

46
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,700
I'll go back with you.

47
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,380
Xiao and the Elder
will surely forgive you.

48
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,820
It's not time yet.

49
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,260
In the future, I will return to the sect
and apologize in my own way.

50
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,450
He is similar to you
when you were young.

51
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,210
These are the ores you want.

52
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,730
I only found these at Gengxin City.

53
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,140
They might be useful to you
in the future.

54
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,420
Father,

55
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,020
you purposely found these for me.

56
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,790
When you've completed your training,
come and find me at the valley.

57
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,650
Don't worry, Hao.

58
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,650
I will take good care of him.

59
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,210
Tell Xiao

60
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,380
that San is my explanation to the sect.

61
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,300
He is my son with Yin.

62
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,100
He is our only son.

63
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,580
San,

64
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,330
since your father left you in my hands,

65
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,940
I will surely educate you well.

66
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,850
As long as I can become strong,

67
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,940
I'm not afraid no matter

68
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,290
how torturing, tiring, or dangerous it is.

69
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,700
I will always remember your teaching.

70
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,260
I'm ready.

71
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,770
I can begin training at any time.

72
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,940
It's torturing and tiring indeed.

73
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:02,970
However,

74
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,210
it's the other kind.

75
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,820
(San,)

76
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,650
(I hope you can learn
how to control your own emotions.)

77
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,140
(Become a truly strong person.)

78
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,450
(Don't repeat my mistakes.)

79
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,580
This is the garden of Moon Pavilion.

80
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,290
Many people pass by this place.

81
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,740
You must hide your identity
to prevent any future troubles.

82
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,450
Come with me.

83
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,450
Every music instrument
in Moon Pavilion is a Guqin.

84
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,140
Every one of them is unique.

85
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,770
Before you touch the musical instrument,
you must make sure that your hand

86
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,500
has no water, dirt,

87
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,820
and sharp objects
to prevent hurting the Guqin.

88
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,850
While cleaning your hand,

89
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:15,028
the most important thing
is to calm your heart.

90
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,020
This is

91
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,620
the rule of Moon Pavilion.

92
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,740
Don't worry, Aunt.

93
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,820
I won't touch them.

94
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,800
These lines are made from Ice Silk
from the Extreme North.

95
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,380
Every string is very valuable.

96
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,740
Wiping the strings

97
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,580
is to make sure that every string

98
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,410
is sleek,

99
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,380
even,

100
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,210
pure,

101
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:37,970
smooth,

102
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:38,700
and clean.

103
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,060
So, your technique

104
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,620
must be light and gentle.

105
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,260
(Guqin Knowledge)

106
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,940
Guqin is known
as the seven-string instrument.

107
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,110
The first string
represents Earth and the Palace.

108
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,490
It's in sync with the four seasons.

109
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,620
It is made with 81 threads.

110
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,970
The sound is deep and noble.

111
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,530
It is called the emperor.

112
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,820
The second string represents
Metal and Merchants.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,970
It's in sync with Autumn.

114
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,290
It is made with 72 threads.

115
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,490
It is called the officials.

116
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,530
The third string represents Wood.

117
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,580
It's in sync with Spring.

118
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,280
It is made with 63 threads.

119
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,410
It is called the citizens.

120
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,820
The fourth string represents Fire.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,990
It's in sync with Summer.

122
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,560
It is made with 54 threads.

123
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,700
It is called Matters.

124
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,530
The fifth string represents Water.

125
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,520
It's in sync with Winter.

126
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,970
It is made with 45 threads.

127
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:40,970
It is called Objects.

128
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,630
The sixth string
represents the Young Palace.

129
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,060
It's in sync with the Literary Star.

130
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,510
It resists toughness with gentleness.

131
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,700
The seventh
represents the Young Merchant.

132
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,250
It's in sync with the Martial Arts Star.

133
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,690
It resists gentleness with toughness.

134
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,530
So, don't underestimate
this musical instrument.

135
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,550
Our ancestors used the philosophy

136
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,280
of Heaven and Earth, the Five Elements,
and Four Seasons to create it

137
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,290
so the people who play the instrument
can remember the principle of balance

138
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:04,197
where movement and stillness
complement each other

139
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,260
and toughness
and gentleness are combined.

140
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,890
San.

141
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,770
Do you remember what I said just now?

142
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,940
Sorry, Aunt.

143
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,330
I was preoccupied with your music

144
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,890
and only remember a part of it.

145
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,330
It's all right.

146
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,140
(Guqin Knowledge)

147
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,220
(Guqin Knowledge)

148
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,100
Read it once
every time you wipe the Guqin.

149
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,500
When you wipe all the Guqin,

150
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,890
you will remember everything.

151
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:40,770
Wipe the Guqin?

152
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,500
Yes.

153
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,380
Today,

154
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,100
you must wipe all of them clean.

155
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,790
This is your first lesson
at Moon Pavilion.

156
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,650
What?

157
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,930
Can't you do it?

158
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,050
Of course, I can wipe them.

159
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,340
However,

160
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,930
what am I learning by doing that?

161
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,770
Wiping the Guqin
is to train your state of mind.

162
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,020
Moon Pavilion is Tiandou royal family's
school of etiquette.

163
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,140
Noble etiquette and music
are taught here.

164
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,170
Since you are here at Moon Pavilion,

165
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,690
you must obey my arrangements.

166
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,980
I understand.

167
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,650
You may begin.

168
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,860
The Guqin is spiritual.

169
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,460
It can feel
the restlessness of your aura.

170
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,380
I told you cleaning your hands
equaled calming your mind.

171
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,740
If your mind isn't calm,
you can't touch the Guqin.

172
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:15,980
San,

173
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,020
today, you must wipe all the Guqin here

174
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,220
until they are spotless.

175
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,100
If you fail to control your strength
and break the strings,

176
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,770
I think you will be in no rush

177
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,810
to find your father.

178
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,930
Just compensate them

179
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,140
with work.

180
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,890
Don't worry, Aunt.

181
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,890
I know what to do.

182
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,460
It's not enough for a person
to only have strong abilities.

183
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,020
Just like your father.

184
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,890
He might be strong

185
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,650
but his mental state
is bruised and battered.

186
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,500
So, he hid himself in a corner

187
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,890
and wouldn't face reality.

188
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,260
Did you say the man was wearing a mask?

189
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,930
Our recruitment
at Moon Pavilion was going well

190
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,810
then the masked man

191
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:12,930
appeared out of nowhere.

192
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,500
He even had a scary aura on him.

193
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,100
That's right.

194
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,570
He came and caused trouble.

195
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,930
He is obviously
disrespecting Martial Soul Hall.

196
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,530
Where is he now?

197
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,740
I think he knows
the owner of Moon Pavilion.

198
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,140
He has probably gone to Moon Pavilion.

199
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,690
I understand.

200
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,140
You may leave.

201
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,290
Yes.

202
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,530
Who is it?

203
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,530
Aunt, I didn't know it was you.

204
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,460
I brought some snacks for you.

205
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,890
Thank you, Aunt.

206
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,810
You cleaned them well.

207
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,740
The control of your mind
is better than I expected,

208
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,930
but it is still far from enough.

209
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,260
Don't worry. I don't blame you for this.

210
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,500
I scared you.

211
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,980
I will compensate for this string.

212
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,290
However, I have a question.

213
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,690
How could you easily
remove my Demon Domain every time?

214
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:53,890
Moreover,

215
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
I couldn't feel

216
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,140
any movement of soul power on you.

217
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,220
This is my Talent Domain,

218
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,570
Noble Ring.

219
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,410
Do you know?

220
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,220
My soul power is only level 9.

221
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,810
Level 9?

222
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,460
Yes.

223
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,530
You should know that it means
I can't even have a soul ring

224
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,570
among the soul masters.

225
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,810
However, I can remove your Demon Domain.

226
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,650
Do you know why?

227
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,220
I don't.

228
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,840
Although I don't have a soul ring,

229
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,810
I can control my domain well.

230
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,050
Not even your father
can do this better than me.

231
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,570
If your father
could understand this sooner,

232
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,740
perhaps the tragedy back then
wouldn't happen.

233
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,530
What happened back then?

234
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,620
Your father
will tell you about the past.

235
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,500
If you want to become stronger,

236
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,860
you need to control
everything about yourself.

237
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,690
Especially your emotions and aura.

238
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,340
So, I came to Moon Pavilion
to study music

239
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,690
and etiquette

240
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,290
to control my domain?

241
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,650
That's right.

242
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,740
Soon, you will understand

243
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,460
that everything you learn
isn't what it seems on the surface.

244
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,890
What Moon Pavilion wants to teach you

245
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,620
is complete control
of your own emotions.

246
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,740
This domain

247
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,380
has given me a feeling
that I've never felt in the past.

248
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,410
If I control it,

249
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,290
won't I weaken myself instead?

250
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,860
Do your best to control it
so you can release it whenever you want.

251
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,380
That is how you truly
master the domain skills.

252
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,340
I think your aura matches it better.

253
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,500
From tomorrow onward,
you will learn this.

254
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,050
Who is disturbing my rest?

255
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,570
Stop it immediately.

256
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,280
All of you, get lost!

257
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,810
What is it?

258
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,420
(Xue Beng, Fourth Prince of Tiandou)
Yesterday, I heard from other students

259
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,980
about a new student in Moon Pavilion.

260
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,770
I'm sure it's you.

261
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,660
Which royal family do you come from?

262
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,490
Why do you hide your face
by wearing a mask?

263
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,090
I'm not royalty.

264
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,850
Moreover, whether I wear a mask or not

265
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,330
is none of your business.

266
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,050
How dare you talk back to me.

267
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,050
You asked for this.

268
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,420
How dare you hurt me.

269
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:37,700
You...

270
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,090
You must have a death wish!

271
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
It's really him.

272
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,180
(Moon Pavilion)

273
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,370
If you can't understand magnanimity

274
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,260
from music,

275
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,330
you will never graduate from my place

276
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,220
no matter how good you are.

277
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,530
I understand.

278
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,980
Fourth Prince, you've skipped lessons
and slacked for many days.

279
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,090
Today, you argued with a fellow student.

280
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,980
I will

281
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,500
report everything you did
to His Majesty honestly.

282
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,940
I understand, Ms. Yue.

283
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,220
You can't trespass on Moon Pavilion.

284
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,610
I must search Moon Pavilion today.

285
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,050
Ms. Yue, someone
from Martial Soul Hall is here.

286
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,220
They say they are looking for Tang Yin.

287
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,980
There's no one called Tang Yin here.

288
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:51,940
Ask them to leave.

289
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,370
I told them but they wouldn't listen.

290
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,350
How dare the people from
Martial Soul Hall come

291
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,410
and cause trouble
when the Fourth Prince is here.

292
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,610
They are so lawless.

293
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,810
I'll go and take a look. Don't worry.

294
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,700
With me around, I don't think
they'll dare cause any trouble.

295
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,980
Aunt, you should let me go.

296
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,020
They came here for me.

297
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,610
I promised your father

298
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,770
to take good care of you.

299
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,330
You should hide for now.

300
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,130
Control yourself.

301
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,460
I'll deal with it.

302
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,050
But...

303
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,630
If you act recklessly,
you'll get more people involved in this.

304
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,980
Who is making noise here?

305
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,520
Martial Soul Hall
has been ordered to find someone here.

306
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,090
I am the Fourth Prince of Tiandou.

307
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,900
If you have anything, you can tell me.

308
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,810
I'm not looking for you.
Ask Tang Yin to come out.

309
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,940
I'm afraid you are in the wrong place.

310
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,420
The person you are searching for
isn't here.

311
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,610
(Talent Domain?)

312
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,890
(The owner of Moon Pavilion
is extraordinary indeed.)

313
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,050
Whether she's here or not,

314
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,590
I'll know once I search this place.

315
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,900
Ms. Yue, I didn't expect
your place to be so lively.

316
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,130
Your Highness.

317
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,460
Brother? Why are you here?

318
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,090
As your older brother,
what's wrong with me

319
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,330
visiting my fourth brother?

320
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,290
Your Highness.

321
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,220
Why is someone
from Martial Soul Hall here?

322
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,460
I am Hu Liena.

323
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,050
I came here

324
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,500
to find a Haotian Sect disciple
on Her Holiness' order.

325
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,600
Moon Pavilion is an academy
of etiquette for the royal families.

326
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,130
Everyone who is studying here
is a noble.

327
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,230
The person you're looking for
won't be here.

328
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,900
Besides, Haotian Sect has been
hiding in seclusion for years.

329
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,810
Their disciples will never appear here.

330
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,370
Have you made a mistake?

331
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,460
Your Highness is right.

332
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,290
I'm sure the person is here.

333
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,610
This person is crucial
to Martial Soul Hall.

334
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,360
Haotian Sect has had a deep grudge
against Martial Soul Hall for long.

335
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,330
I believe Tiandou won't
get involved in this, right?

336
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,020
Fourth Brother,

337
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
have you seen the person she mentioned?

338
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,180
I haven't.

339
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,570
See?

340
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,700
The person you are looking for
isn't here.

341
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,130
With two princes as a guarantee,

342
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,700
do you still not believe it?

343
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,050
I must search this place with my men.

344
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,130
Please cooperate, Your Highness.

345
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,740
If I find this person,

346
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,260
Martial Soul Hall
will owe Tiandou a favour.

347
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,090
Ms. Yue,

348
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,940
since the person isn't here,

349
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,390
why not let her search the place?

350
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,530
I dare not disobey Your Highness' order.

351
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,740
However, Moon Pavilion
isn't a place in the countryside.

352
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,020
You can only search the place alone.

353
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,770
Please come with me.

354
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,660
What is behind this door?

355
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,850
You searched every other place.

356
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,220
However, this is my private residence.

357
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,900
Is the Martial Soul Hall
going to trespass on this place too?

358
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:17,850
Aunt.

359
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:22,980
Please move.

360
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,990
I allowed you to search this place
because His Highness asked for a favour.

361
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,980
Don't go overboard.

362
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,940
I'm here on Her Holiness' orders.

363
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,770
If you are going to stop me,

364
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,700
I have no choice but to offend you.

365
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,420
Your domain might be powerful

366
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,250
but I'm afraid
you have reached your limits.

367
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,740
Are you sure
you're going to keep resisting me

368
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,850
and force me to fight you?

369
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,870
Moon Pavilion is the royal family's
academy of etiquette.

370
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,900
I'm the person hired by His Majesty.

371
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,260
No matter what, I must protect
Moon Pavilion's dignity.

372
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,500
Someone, chase her away!

373
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,990
How dare you cause trouble at a place
under Tiandou's royal jurisdiction.

374
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,220
Stop!

375
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,230
Ms. Yue, are you all right?

376
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,050
I'm fine.

377
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,770
You're acting so arrogantly.

378
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,020
Are you trying
to make Tiandou into your enemy?

379
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,660
This is impossible.

380
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,570
I felt his Demon Domain

381
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,610
just now.

382
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,180
You're so presumptuous!

383
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:37,940
My brother was talking to you!

384
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,610
Are you deaf?

385
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,260
Moreover, the plants in
Moon Pavilion are rare.

386
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,160
Can you pay for the plants
if you destroy them?

387
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,610
I told you the person you are looking for
isn't here.

388
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,660
I will forget about what happened today.

389
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,050
You should leave now.

390
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,500
You can leave now.

391
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,660
If you don't,

392
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:58,460
I will ask Her Holiness
to give me an explanation in person.

393
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,220
Hold it!

394
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,700
Are you trying to leave

395
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:31,576
after causing trouble at Moon Pavilion?

396
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,260
I was just acting according to orders.

397
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,980
If Ms. Yue worked with me,

398
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,420
it wouldn't end like this.

399
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,100
If Moon Pavilion is not satisfied,

400
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,990
you can come and find me
at Martial Soul Hall.

401
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:40,770
No need.

402
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,330
From now on,

403
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,330
no one from Martial Soul Hall
can step foot in Moon Pavilion anymore.

404
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:47,660
Farewell.

405
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,740
I shouldn't have let her enter.

406
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,130
Ms. Yue,

407
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,570
do you know the Haotian Sect disciple

408
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,610
she spoke of?

409
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,050
Or do you have
any trouble you can't speak of?

410
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:05,980
You can tell me.

411
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,050
I can help you.

412
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,840
Your Highness...

413
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,900
She doesn't know.

414
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,620
It's obvious that Martial Soul Hall

415
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,560
was purposely trying
to provoke the royal family.

416
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,040
I'll tell Father to send troops
and destroy Martial Soul Hall.

417
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,350
See if she is still so arrogant.

418
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,770
What nonsense are you speaking?

419
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,090
Father sent you to Moon Pavilion

420
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,330
to cultivate yourself.

421
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,220
Why are you still so stubborn?

422
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,940
You and Father were the ones

423
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,870
who asked me
to learn these boring things here.

424
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,020
The nerds are quite fun to play with.

425
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,130
Otherwise, I would've left.

426
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,850
If you are still so stubborn,

427
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,090
I'll request Father for an edict

428
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,460
to send you to the borders
and train your personality.

429
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,900
Brother, did you come here

430
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,530
just to scold me?

431
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,020
Father is ill

432
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:52,810
and misses you.

433
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,290
He wants me to bring you back.

434
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,460
Great. I'm getting sick of this place.

435
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,370
I want to
find the Grand Venom Master

436
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,770
to play with his venomous insects.

437
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,290
Fourth Prince is a forthright person.
There's no need to control him.

438
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,990
This is really embarrassing, Ms. Yue.

439
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,460
Father asked me to greet you.

440
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,980
Please tell His Majesty
to take care of his health.

441
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,020
I still need to manage things here.

442
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,800
Forgive me for not sending you off.

443
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:24,740
Someone,

444
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,770
send His Highness off.

445
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,850
Guard this place
and don't let outsiders come in.

446
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,610
Yes.

447
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:43,980
San.

448
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:44,980
Aunt.

449
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,130
You are smart.

450
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,370
Show me.

451
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,130
You are hurt.

452
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,330
Don't worry, Aunt.

453
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,850
I was slashed by Hu Liena's soul power.

454
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,040
I have the Blue Silver Domain.

455
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,290
It will heal soon.

456
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:57,940
All right.

457
00:30:59,290 --> 00:30:59,770
Aunt!

458
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,500
Sit down.

459
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,700
Aunt,

460
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,090
how do you feel?

461
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,090
Your Majesty,
it's time to take your medicine.

462
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,530
You may leave.

463
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,410
Your Majesty,
you must take care of your health.

464
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:50,940
It's fine.

465
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,370
Last night,

466
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,020
I played a game with Crown Prince
and caught a cold.

467
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,500
Crown Prince was easily shocked

468
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,700
and asked me to take care.

469
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,370
The Crown Prince is filial.
He is an example for the people.

470
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,290
The Crown Prince

471
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,500
is worthy of your praise.

472
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,700
If Xue Beng
can be as good as his brother,

473
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,180
I would be so relieved.

474
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,080
Fourth Prince has been protected
by Your Majesty and the Crown Prince

475
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,090
so it is natural for him to be willful.

476
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,170
Moreover, he will surely achieve great things
after studying at Moon Pavilion.

477
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,220
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

478
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,420
It's exactly because
we have been protecting him

479
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,700
so we spoiled him.

480
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,660
He is coming back today.

481
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,740
I want to see what he has learned.

482
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,130
Martial Soul Hall

483
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,090
has made a mess

484
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:42,940
of the Xingdou Forest.

485
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,856
We must place a strict order
for soul masters within the border

486
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,660
to stay away from that place.

487
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,740
One. It's for their safety.

488
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,420
Two.

489
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,500
It's best not to offend
the soul beasts there for now.

490
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,940
If these soul beasts
run out of the forest,

491
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,260
the people will suffer.

492
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,610
Your Majesty is thoughtful.

493
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,770
However, there's some movement
at the Martial Soul Hall again.

494
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,900
Regarding Bi Bi Dong
using disciple recruitment as a ruse

495
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,180
to gather high-level soul masters,

496
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,610
I've read the reports.

497
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,330
On the surface, Martial Soul Hall
is recruiting tutors for their disciples

498
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,330
but in truth,

499
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,940
it is trying
to expand its soul master units.

500
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:23,980
We need

501
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,770
to plan for this.

502
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,530
I think Martial Soul Hall isn't the only
party we need to be cautious against.

503
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:32,810
Father,

504
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,050
we have returned.

505
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:40,900
Father,

506
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,810
someone called Hu Liena from Martial Soul Hall
came to provoke us.

507
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,090
She totally disregarded Tiandou.

508
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,500
Father, you must never forgive this.

509
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,260
Crown Prince,

510
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,530
explain.

511
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,150
It's like this.

512
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,740
Today at Moon Pavilion,

513
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,570
Martial Soul Hall's Hu Liena
was ordered by Bi Bi Dong

514
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,420
to find a disciple of Haotian Sect.

515
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,360
According to my investigation,

516
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,940
Both of them
entered the Netherworld City together

517
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,500
and obtained the Demon Domain.

518
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,420
A disciple of Haotian Sect

519
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,090
obtained Demon Domain at the same time?

520
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,170
After Tang Hao,

521
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,850
there's another Haotian Sect disciple
who obtained the Demon Domain.

522
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,980
That means Haotian Sect
is still improving its strength

523
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,940
even if they are living in seclusion.

524
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,170
Haotian Sect has lived
in seclusion for many years

525
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,250
but a disciple suddenly appears.

526
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,900
Are they trying to open the gates?

527
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:31,530
Master,

528
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,570
your disciple Tang San.

529
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,690
Where is he now?

530
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,650
Do you think this person is him?

531
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,130
Your Highness,

532
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,500
I've never contacted him
for a long time.

533
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,570
I don't know where he is now.

534
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,420
However,

535
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,250
if it's really him,

536
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,610
I'm proud as his master.

537
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,210
Haotian Sect has many talents.

538
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,340
There are geniuses
who are better than him as well.

539
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,250
So,

540
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,500
I can't conclude about this.

541
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,300
You are right.

542
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,380
However, everyone knows

543
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,050
about the grudge between Haotian Sect

544
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,980
and Martial Soul Hall.

545
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,690
I just hope nothing goes wrong.

546
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,980
Disciples of Haotian Sect
and Martial Soul Hall

547
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,980
obtained Demon Domain at the same time.

548
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,650
It is a form of restriction
against Martial Soul Hall.

549
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,050
If Bi Bi Dong finds him,

550
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,380
she probably wants to get rid of him.

551
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,530
If Tiandou

552
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,650
can find this disciple
from Haotian Sect,

553
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,820
It would be great.

554
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,650
Father.

555
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,450
Are you going to
punish Martial Soul Hall

556
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,020
after discussing it for so long?

557
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,420
Father,

558
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,110
the end result isn't that bad.

559
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,780
Ms. Yue handled the situation well.

560
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,250
Hu Liena did not get any advantage.

561
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,460
So, there's no need to worry.

562
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:44,940
That's good to hear.

563
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:45,780
Brother,

564
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,300
what do you mean?

565
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,680
Do you only think it's bad
if Ms. Yue is hurt

566
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,890
or if Moon Pavilion is ruined?

567
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,300
Keep your mouth shut.

568
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,900
Whether it's Xingdou or Tianluo,

569
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,452
both empires have a weird relationship
with Martial Soul Hall.

570
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,940
How can you start causing trouble

571
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,610
because of your temper?

572
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,090
Why haven't you improved

573
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,170
after staying in Moon Pavilion
for so long?

574
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,500
I want you to get out.

575
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,090
I...

576
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,210
Get out!

577
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,300
Fine. Calm down.

578
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,780
I'm leaving.

579
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,050
You are suffering from
an internal injury and need to rest.

580
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,530
My soul power is too low

581
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,020
and I was taken advantage of
when I fought her.

582
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,050
It's all right.

583
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,460
It's all my fault.

584
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,650
I didn't control my domain

585
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,780
and caused you harm.

586
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,170
We are a family.

587
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,980
Your father handed you over to me.

588
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:57,990
If I can't protect you, what if he comes
and asks me to give him an explanation?

589
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,420
I will listen to you in the future

590
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,500
and cultivate my personality.

591
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,500
What happened today
will not happen again.

592
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,340
There's no need to blame yourself.

593
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,210
You were much more obedient than
my second brother when he was young.

594
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,780
I remember
your grandfather and your uncle

595
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,860
spent so much effort

596
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,460
to keep him in line.

597
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,500
Moreover, you know how to hide today.

598
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,340
That means

599
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,350
you know what's more important
and know when to back down.

600
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,780
A man must be adaptable.

601
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:37,980
This is a good thing.

602
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,940
There's no need to comfort me.

603
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,020
I'm not comforting you.

604
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
I appreciate you.

605
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,380
San,

606
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,170
the Netherworld City
is a very dangerous place.

607
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,500
It is incredible
that you can escape alive.

608
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,420
So, you must train yourself well

609
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,650
so your suffering doesn't go to waste.

610
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,210
Killing intent is a sharp weapon.

611
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,090
You can only become its true master

612
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,420
if you can fully control it.

613
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:09,780
I understand.

614
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,820
You understand,
but it doesn't mean you can do well.

615
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,380
From now on, I won't be lenient to you.

616
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,860
We must still show respect
to the Tiandou royal family.

617
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,380
Since you've searched Moon Pavilion,

618
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,690
you shouldn't go there again.

619
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,530
News about Martial Soul Hall
looking for him has spread.

620
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,250
He won't come out so easily.

621
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,990
If you keep investigating,
your efforts will still go to waste.

622
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,820
Master, but...

623
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,860
Are you working so hard

624
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,210
for Martial Soul Hall's sake

625
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,300
or for your own sake?

626
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,090
I'm doing this with
Martial Soul Hall's best interest in my heart.

627
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,210
In that case, do what I tell you.

628
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,650
Yes.

629
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,340
Na,

630
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,610
I have high hopes for you.

631
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,250
Don't disappoint me.

632
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,210
I will do my best to share your burden.

633
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,530
Senior Dugu?

634
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,500
Do you have news of the Little Devil?

635
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,380
He left for so long

636
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,460
without even leaving me a message.

637
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,650
It's outrageous.

638
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,650
San didn't contact me either.

639
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,730
Not even you know where he is?

640
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,690
Is he dead out there?

641
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,940
Senior, you are overthinking.

642
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,900
San is blessed.

643
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:47,940
I'm sure he will be fine.

644
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,530
Since you don't know where he is,

645
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:52,820
forget it.

646
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:53,780
Senior,

647
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,780
why do you come here on purpose to find him?

648
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,130
You can tell me.

649
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,780
I will let him know when he comes back.

650
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,530
I will say

651
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,980
what I want to say to him in person.

652
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,050
(Dugu Bo came to find San at this time.)

653
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,730
(Did he hear something?)

654
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,730
Ms. Yue, your medicine has cooled down.

655
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,050
Why are you so tired?

656
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,730
Do you not sleep well last night?

657
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,770
You took medicine and slept soundly
last night so you don't know.

658
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,230
He has been playing the whole night.

659
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,980
He only rested for four hours

660
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,860
and even disturbed your rest.

661
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,980
I will go and reprimand him.

662
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:42,780
Wait.

663
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,170
He might have an average talent,

664
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,610
but his passion deserves to be praised.

665
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,170
We shouldn't discourage him
and let him play instead.

666
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,380
Yes.

667
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:57,650
Ms. Yue.

668
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:01,940
You are wise.

669
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,300
Ms. Yue, someone is
looking for you outside.

670
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,170
Someone called Yu Xiaogang
is looking for you.

671
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,690
Yu Xiaogang?

672
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,530
Isn't that the Soul Master Chief
His Majesty appointed himself?

673
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,380
Send him inside.

674
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,340
Yes.

675
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,210
I want to see San.

676
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,980
I don't know what you mean.

677
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,380
He is my direct disciple.

678
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,980
Soul Master Chief,
if you're here to find someone,

679
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,780
I think you've come to the wrong place.

680
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,000
Everyone knows

681
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,340
Ms. Yue from Moon Pavilion
is called Yuehua.

682
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,020
However, no one knows
that your surname is Tang

683
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,580
and you come from Haotian Sect.

684
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,420
You are San's aunt.

685
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,020
I'm sure you recognise this.

686
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,860
The Elder Token?

687
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,980
Father gave this
to my second brother back then.

688
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,780
It seems like I was overthinking.

689
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,170
Master, please come with me.

690
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,530
This is...

691
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,940
This is embarrassing.

692
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,460
I must say

693
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,250
that his current level
can't represent the Moon Pavilion yet.

694
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:35,940
I understand.

695
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,900
He is not talented.

696
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,410
You must have had a difficult time.

697
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:39,940
Not at all.

698
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,620
It's what I should do for one of my own.

699
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,210
Then,

700
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,170
I won't disturb

701
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,690
your gathering with your disciple.

702
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:46,900
Thank you.

703
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:47,650
Please.

704
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:22,940
Other people play music for fun

705
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,020
but you play music

706
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,690
to kill.

707
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,300
Master?

708
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,250
Master!

709
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,980
Thankfully, I avoided it in time.

710
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,950
Otherwise, you would have
committed a grave sin.

711
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,780
You've grown stronger

712
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,090
and you look in good spirits.

713
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,610
I'm sure your skills have improved now.

714
00:43:59,777 --> 00:44:01,900
However, your music is bad.

715
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,380
I've always been clueless about music.

716
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:06,940
I'd rather be tortured

717
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,300
by the experts at Soul Arena

718
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,780
than play music.

719
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:10,940
Master,

720
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,690
why do you know I'm here?
