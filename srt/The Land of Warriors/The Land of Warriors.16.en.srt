=The Land of Warriors=

24
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from
Tangjia Sanshao's novel "Soul Land")

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,220
=Episode 16=

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,890
I'm so pitiful!

27
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,890
Stop right there!

28
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,090
How could an ordinary woman
possess such extreme strength?

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,780
Who exactly are you?

30
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,890
How dare you?

31
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,384
Fatty said plenty of soul masters
were undergoing their training here.

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,600
Why didn't we see a single one

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,448
on our way here?

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,730
Look.

35
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,500
Look at the tracks.

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,424
These should be tracks left behind
by the armor-transporting carriage.

37
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,930
Is this a trap?

38
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:14,688
I speculate that this Martial Soul Hall

39
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:16,020
is an empty shell by now.

40
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,650
Let's see what we can find.

41
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,890
This must be Fatty's doing.

42
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,656
Someone cleaned up the place before.

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,256
Judging from the remnants,

44
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,860
the fire didn't burn everything down.

45
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,980
Could it be that they left cautiously

46
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,232
upon detecting Fatty's presence?

47
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,056
They didn't search
for Fatty in the city.

48
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:42,816
However, they emptied
the Martial Soul Hall.

49
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,050
This makes no sense.

50
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:46,260
I suppose they had no time
to care about Fatty.

51
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:53,712
Let's rendezvous with Fatty.

52
00:02:53,728 --> 00:02:55,550
Let's report this to Father
tomorrow morning.

53
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,210
That hurts.

54
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,020
Fatty?

55
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:04,700
That hurts!

56
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,860
Hurry and get up.

57
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,050
Fatty,

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,450
did someone take advantage of you?

59
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,100
I was buying time
for you guys, you know?

60
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,700
The scums at the entrance
are so annoying.

61
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,330
Why are you standing here?

62
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,050
Time to run.

63
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,650
They're coming.

64
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,056
Let's go.

65
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,700
Let's go.

66
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,580
Fatty, you look pretty good
in a woman's attire.

67
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,380
Shut up!

68
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,300
Tang Long,

69
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,980
invite the two elders here again.

70
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,610
Yes, sir.

71
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,890
No need for that.

72
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,420
We're here.

73
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,020
Tang San,

74
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,700
greet the two elders.

75
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,490
I...

76
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,020
Chief.

77
00:03:58,496 --> 00:03:59,860
(Seventh Elder of Haotian Sect)

78
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,050
Why did you allow an outsider
to enter Haotian Sect?

79
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,380
Is Haotian Sect

80
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,140
available for all kinds of people now?

81
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,540
(Second Elder of Haotian Sect)

82
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,450
San inherited the bloodline
and martial soul of Haotian Sect.

83
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,610
He's not an outsider.

84
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:14,540
(Tang Hu, Disciple of Haotian Sect)

85
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,140
Chief,

86
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,850
the son of a sinner

87
00:04:16,912 --> 00:04:18,500
isn't worthy enough to stay beside you.

88
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,970
You're not welcome here.

89
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,530
Hurry and scram!

90
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,450
The chief and elders are speaking.

91
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,890
How dare you interfere?

92
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,140
Has Haotian Sect abandoned its rules?

93
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,890
As the sect's top disciple, Tang Hu

94
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,330
was expressing our intentions
on our behalf.

95
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,770
How is he wrong?

96
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,060
Chief,

97
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,330
hurry and kick him out

98
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,992
so that Haotian Sect
wouldn't be tainted by the likes of him.

99
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,140
Elders, I understand your frustrations.

100
00:04:44,448 --> 00:04:46,180
I'm willing to atone
for my father's sin.

101
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,450
Chief, elders, I only hope
that you guys can give me

102
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,700
a chance to return to my roots.

103
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,770
I think

104
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,970
this is enough to express
Tang Hao's sincerity, right?

105
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,650
A soul bone?

106
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,700
This belongs to Tang Hao.

107
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,330
Is he dead?

108
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,090
No.

109
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,650
He forcibly stripped this

110
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,740
from himself alive.

111
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,330
He's the son of the old chief after all.

112
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,060
Seems like he always regretted

113
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,890
what he did to the sect.

114
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,090
These two soul bones
are the treasures of the sect.

115
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,770
Now, the two elders can keep them.

116
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,140
When you find the next sect successor

117
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,850
or disciples who contribute
greatly to the sect,

118
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,970
you may give them the soul bones.

119
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,424
Why would the old chief

120
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,410
passed away suddenly

121
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,344
if Tang Hao didn't insist on
being together with a soul beast?

122
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,890
Why would my sole son and
the young disciples of Haotian Sect

123
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,410
die fighting against Martial Soul Hall
had he not done so?

124
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,500
Why would the mighty Haotian Sect

125
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,464
become a reclusive sect had it
not because of his foolish actions?

126
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,530
Everything went downhill
because of what Tang Hao did.

127
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,770
I'll never forgive him!

128
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,450
Due to your father's actions,

129
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,700
I won't let you return to the sect

130
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:27,552
even if you've retrieved the soul bones.

131
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,820
Moreover,

132
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,580
he and that cursed soul beast

133
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,580
gave birth to you!

134
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,090
San,

135
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,376
stop what you're doing right now!

136
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,450
The Demon Domain, huh?

137
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,410
You can criticize me all you like,

138
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,940
but don't ever insult my mother.

139
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,410
Seventh Elder,

140
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,850
I challenge you to a duel.

141
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:05,008
I might die, but I have no regrets.

142
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,580
You wish to challenge me to a duel?

143
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,290
That's right.

144
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,650
If you lose,

145
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,700
you have to apologize to my mother.

146
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,970
This is preposterous.

147
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,890
You think you have the right
to challenge me?

148
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,700
Youngsters can be proud,

149
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,890
but they shouldn't be arrogant.

150
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,800
You're young,

151
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,320
yet you intend to challenge
the elder of Haotian Sect to a duel?

152
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:29,280
Are you belittling Haotian Sect now?

153
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,744
Elders, there's no need
to waste your breath on him.

154
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,850
You can leave arrogant fools
like him to me.

155
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,580
I'll teach him a lesson.

156
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,380
Do I have the right to challenge you

157
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,450
after defeating the top disciple,

158
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,090
Seventh Elder?

159
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,890
If you survive the duel,

160
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,290
I'll accept your challenge.

161
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,740
Okay.

162
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,530
Tang Hu,

163
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,850
Level 64 Storm Attack Branch
War Soul Emperor.

164
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:08,970
Please.

165
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,290
Tang San,

166
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,770
Level 59 Controlling Branch
War Soul King.

167
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:22,960
How could the martial soul
of Haotian Hammer

168
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,650
belong to a Controlling Soul Master?

169
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,770
You'll find out later.

170
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,410
Twin Martial Souls?

171
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,650
That's right.

172
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,340
It's the one-in-a-hundred
Twin Martial Souls.

173
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,500
Twin Martial Souls
and the Demon Domain, huh?

174
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,570
I suppose he has the right
to be arrogant.

175
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,980
Innate Domain?

176
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,140
His mother, Yin,
left that behind for him.

177
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,740
You're powerful indeed.

178
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,380
But I won't lose to you forever.

179
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:39,776
We shall duel again in the future.

180
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,184
I shall wait for you.

181
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,410
Seventh Elder,

182
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,530
do I have the right
to challenge you now?

183
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Help me put it on.

184
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,170
Seventh Elder,

185
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,024
this is...

186
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,048
This is the only thing Senior
had left behind after his passing.

187
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,810
Help me put it on.

188
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,890
My son died with this equipped

189
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,770
while fighting against
the Martial Soul Hall.

190
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,410
Today, I want him to see

191
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,890
how I'm going to teach
Tang Hao's son a lesson.

192
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,620
Since your father isn't back
to face his punishment,

193
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,810
you shall face it on his behalf.

194
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,340
If you lose,

195
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,220
I hope you can take back

196
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,460
your insults.

197
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,740
And, I hope the elders can agree

198
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,770
to give me a chance
to return to my roots.

199
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,050
Father,

200
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,140
this is my friend, Ma Hongjun.

201
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,770
Hello.

202
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:04,592
We infiltrated Xingluo City's
Martial Soul Hall

203
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:06,960
in secret according to the leads
he provided us.

204
00:12:07,056 --> 00:12:09,200
However, it was already empty
when we reached there.

205
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,690
The armors,

206
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,570
soul masters,

207
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,460
even the Grand Chrysanthemum Master
was missing.

208
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,620
I'm sure something's off.

209
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,690
I'm worried that they might be
targeting Xingluo.

210
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:19,296
Your Majesty, please investigate
the case thoroughly.

211
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,690
Duke Lingmao investigated
the case long ago.

212
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,220
I said this before.

213
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
You guys should only
focus on your cultivation.

214
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,170
You guys shouldn't
meddle with state affairs.

215
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,050
Father,

216
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,170
I'm worried that this incident
might be related

217
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,260
to the disappearance
of the soul masters.

218
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:36,740
I wish...

219
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,410
Just mind your own business!

220
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,020
Even if they're up to no good,

221
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,530
they're not targeting Xingluo.

222
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,930
Now, all of the
Martial Soul Halls in Xingluo

223
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,500
are empty.

224
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,410
All of the soul masters
have left the city in secret.

225
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,530
They left?

226
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:57,890
Where did they go?

227
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,770
Your Majesty,

228
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,650
where did they go?

229
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,770
Tiandou.

230
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:10,240
Don't tell me
Martial Soul Hall is trying to...

231
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,980
Their intention doesn't matter

232
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,290
as long as they don't harm Xingluo.

233
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,460
Father,

234
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,360
we can't just stay out of this.

235
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,590
The survival of the two empires

236
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:19,616
depends on each other.

237
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:21,792
If Martial Soul Hall intends
to invade Tiandou,

238
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:24,064
I'm afraid Xingluo won't be
able to escape unscathed.

239
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,860
Depend on each other?

240
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,050
We could profit from their conflict.

241
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
You're still as dense as always.

242
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,170
Although Martial Soul Hall is powerful,

243
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,770
Tiandou isn't that weak.

244
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,952
We should reap the profit
after the conflict

245
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:41,930
instead of joining it.

246
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,890
Your Majesty, aren't you worried...

247
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,500
Enough!

248
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,410
Zhuqing, although
you're a Six-Ring Soul Emperor now,

249
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,020
don't forget

250
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,220
that you two were the ones
who came up with the bet!

251
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,190
Both parties must uphold
their end of the bargain!

252
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,770
Do your part

253
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,050
before you worry about other people.

254
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:03,980
I understand.

255
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:06,500
I'll improve my cultivation
as soon as possible.

256
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,290
Remember,

257
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:11,408
you don't even have the right
to negotiate a deal with me

258
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,460
until you reach the required level,

259
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,290
not to mention saving
Dai Weisi and Zhu Zhuyun.

260
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,050
Leave.

261
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,890
I shall take my leave.

262
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,980
I shall take my leave.

263
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,570
I shall take my leave.

264
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,952
Make sure our men keep an eye
on Mubai and Zhuqing.

265
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,664
Do not let them leave the palace again.

266
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:39,312
Yes, Your Majesty.

267
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,980
Now, I finally understand.

268
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,530
Crown Prince? Crown Princess?

269
00:14:43,552 --> 00:14:46,080
None of you can lead a life
as carefree as a commoner like me.

270
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,380
I hate this palace.

271
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,512
I'm going to leave now.

272
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,050
And,

273
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,410
you...

274
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:49,860
Fatty.

275
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:52,410
You must mind your words here.

276
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,050
Is it illegal for me to talk?

277
00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:56,139
All of the personnel here
are His Majesty's men.

278
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,460
They already had their eyes on you

279
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,072
ever since you entered the palace.

280
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,570
Stall them.

281
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,032
I need to write a letter to them.

282
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,290
What?

283
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,290
Don't tell me Emperor Xingluo
will restrict my freedom?

284
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,570
Am I right?

285
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,290
He won't go that far.

286
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,570
As long as you stay obedient,

287
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,770
you'll be well-fed.

288
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,140
What is she saying?

289
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,930
I'm a citizen of Tiandou.

290
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:31,120
My nation is in trouble now.

291
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:33,360
I can't just sponge off you guys
in the palace, right?

292
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,930
And, I've never been
in a relationship before.

293
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,380
I haven't realized my dream yet.

294
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,810
I haven't brought honor
to Shrek Academy yet.

295
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,930
You should

296
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,340
stay grounded and train
with me and Mubai.

297
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:49,140
You have a point.

298
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,380
I'll only use 40% of my soul power.

299
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,460
If you lose,

300
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,050
I will destroy your
Haotian Hammer martial soul.

301
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,140
Seventh Elder,

302
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,410
it's my win if I manage to
force you to use your full strength.

303
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:21,408
What do you think?

304
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:23,632
You think you can force me
to use my full strength?

305
00:16:23,696 --> 00:16:25,120
You're really arrogant, aren't you?

306
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,260
My rank is seven.

307
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,860
They call me Lie Yang.

308
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:32,864
I'm very honored
to cross blades with you,

309
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:34,650
the Grand Lie Yang Master!

310
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,050
Well, you're something else.

311
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,050
Attached soul bone?

312
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,570
Chief, did you know Tang San

313
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,980
had attached soul bones long ago?

314
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,700
This is one of his three soul bones.

315
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,420
He has three?

316
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,420
He's truly a freak.

317
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,810
Out of the three soul bones he has,

318
00:17:57,824 --> 00:17:59,420
his mother only left one behind for him.

319
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:00,736
He obtained the others

320
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,290
through his own effort.

321
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,660
He has

322
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,740
surpassed Second Brother

323
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,290
in every aspect when he was his age.

324
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,460
So, a Grand Soul Master

325
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:24,848
actually used his sixth soul skill,
Martial Soul Clone,

326
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,220
against a soul master under Level 60?

327
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,290
Seventh Elder didn't break the rules.

328
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,260
He can use all the soul skills he wants

329
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,900
as long as it's within 40%
of his full power.

330
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,220
Kid,

331
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,570
I'll get serious now.

332
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,050
It's not too late

333
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,330
for you to surrender!

334
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:02,770
Please.

335
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,660
This child has sparked
his competitive spirit.

336
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,700
By only using 40% of his power,

337
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,940
the strongest soul skill he can use

338
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,370
is the seventh soul skill,

339
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,130

Combining his martial soul
and the Haotian Hammer,

it seems like he's almost using

355
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,420
over 40% of his power.

356
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,330
Seems like Seventh Elder
intends to break the rules.

357
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,330

don't worry.

00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,260

389
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,940
Aunt, you don't need to worry.

390
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:18,850
I'm fine.

391
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,940
Where's Seventh Uncle?

392
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,180
Where's that kid?

393
00:21:35,264 --> 00:21:37,376
Don't tell me he was
shattered to pieces?

394
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:39,700
This...

395
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:42,570
How did this kid manage to get up?

396
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,460
Chief,

397
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,740
did you save him?

398
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,180
He got up by himself.

399
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,460
This is impossible.

400
00:21:48,032 --> 00:21:50,912
He received the full blow of
my Tool Soul's true form.

401
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,220
Even if he survives,

402
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,900
he will be seriously wounded!

403
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,940
This is impossible!

404
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,770
Seven,

405
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,370
just accept reality.

406
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,940
If I'm not mistaken,

407
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,850
he has a skill that can make him fly.

408
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,530
He didn't use it during the duel.

409
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,460
Wait, but he...

410
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,700
Seven,

411
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:11,328
in the end, you used all of your power.

412
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,980
You lost the duel.

413
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,290
And, the kid gave up on attacking you
because he wanted

414
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,810
to protect the shoulder guard.

415
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,500
He had no choice but to take on
the full blow.

416
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,090
I've lost.

417
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,700
Seven,

418
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,810
head back and rest.

419
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,570
No.

420
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,220
I can't just leave.

421
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,090
I'm not a sore loser.

422
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,330
Since I've lost,

423
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,290
I have to fulfill my promise.

424
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,570
I'll wait here until
he regains consciousness.

425
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,020
Yuehua,

426
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,530
you can start preparing for
the ancestral recognition ceremony.

427
00:22:57,328 --> 00:22:59,296
Elders, thank you for
fulfilling his wish.

428
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,330
He fulfilled his own wish.

429
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,500
I've never seen

430
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,330
a young man as outstanding as him.

431
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,130
Maybe he's the person

432
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,940
that Haotian Sect
has been waiting for all along.

433
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,090
I just hope that he won't
take the wrong path

434
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,940
and repeat his father's mistake.

435
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,460
The situation is worse than I thought.

436
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,370
The peripheral area of Xingdou Forest

437
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,064
has too many high-level soul beasts
from the mixed zone.

438
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,260
The soul beasts are killing each other.

439
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,460
Xingdou Forest is in complete chaos now.

440
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,810
Xingdou Forest

441
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,770
was greatly affected this time.

442
00:23:56,128 --> 00:23:58,576
I assume it'll take a long time
before the forest can recover.

443
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,530
If only Tang San

444
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,260
were around.

445
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,740
This concerns Xingdou Forest.

446
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,560
What has this got to do with him?

447
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,660
Previously, he always supported
Wu with his power from a distance.

448
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,290
This time, maybe he can come up

449
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,460
with a method to heal the forest.

450
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,090
Method to heal the forest?

451
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:17,850
I got it!

452
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,610
Erming,

453
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,220
thank you!

454
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,740
You're thanking me?

455
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,608
It's about the method
to heal the forest.

456
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,530
We have to align with the natural order.

457
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,740
We have to use the forest's power
to heal the forest.

458
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,220
Wu,

459
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,810
what does that mean?

460
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,050
Are you saying that we can
stay out of this?

461
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,040
That's not it.

462
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:38,660
You guys have to help the forest out.

463
00:24:38,704 --> 00:24:40,576
It's because you guys
are the forest's power.

464
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,740
Us?

465
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,530
Erming,

466
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:45,220
come with me.

467
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:46,704
Let's head to the peripheral area.

468
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,900
(Wu,)

469
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,180
(what should we do?)

470
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,792
(The law of nature teaches the
soul beasts to avoid natural predators.)

471
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,550
(They need to seek benefits
and avoid harm.)

472
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,499
(To the soul beasts in Xingdou Forest,)

473
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,250
(you guys, who have
lived for 10,000 years)

474
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,784
(are the leaders of the forest.)

475
00:25:08,816 --> 00:25:10,256
(None of them can disobey you two.)

476
00:25:10,448 --> 00:25:11,980
(Therefore, you guys are the only ones)

477
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,830
(that can herd the soul beasts that have
gathered in the peripheral area)

478
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,010
(back to where they belong.)

479
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,570
(All of us are part of
the forest's power.)

480
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,050
(When nature loses its balance,)

481
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,130
(we should do what we're supposed to do)

482
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,500
(and use our power)

483
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,304
(to help everything get back on track.)

484
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,020
I heard that there's an animal

485
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,980
called a shepherd dog
in the human world.

486
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,220
Does it resemble us?

487
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:40,016
If so, should I call myself
a shepherd ape?

488
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:49,180
Haotian Sect has gone
into hiding for 20 years.

489
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,570
Isn't it time for us

490
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,700
to return

491
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,180
to the Soul Master's world?

492
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,090
Our sect has mentioned this many times.

493
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:00,050
I suppose the time is ripe.

494
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:00,700
No.

495
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,940
I don't agree with it.

496
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,940
Second Uncle,

497
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,500
isn't this what you wished for?

498
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,980
Now, it seems like

499
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,940
we have to lay low for a little longer.

500
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,090
Is it because

501
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,020
of San?

502
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,810
Haotian Sect needs

503
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,180
a leader capable of guiding the sect

504
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,330
towards innovation and progress.

505
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,770
All of us are old now.

506
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,260
You're getting older too.

507
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,420
But the kid is different.

508
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,700
He's exceptionally talented.

509
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,740
We can't afford to neglect him.

510
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,570
What he needs are
experience and cultivation.

511
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,130
Second Uncle,

512
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,370
have you agreed to forgive Hao?

513
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,330
The past cannot be changed.

514
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,660
For the future of our sect,

515
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,980
I still require Tang San to prove

516
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,940
that he's determined enough
to carry this responsibility.

517
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,530
You forced me to use my full power,

518
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,168
yet you weren't injured internally.

519
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,180
Kid,

520
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,330
you're pretty capable.

521
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,816
Seventh Elder,
thank you for your praise.

522
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,980
I was lucky to win the match.

523
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,290
I was wrong about you.

524
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,940
You're a good kid.

525
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,050
This shoulder guard

526
00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:56,016
is the only namesake I have of my son.

527
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,020
I won't

528
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,130
express my thanks.

529
00:29:01,728 --> 00:29:02,980
I will fulfill my promise.

530
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,290
Kid,

531
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,700
I hereby apologize
to your mother officially.

532
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,220
Although she's a soul beast,

533
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,770
the Haotian Sect isn't
a narrow-minded organization.

534
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,980
We aren't inherently biased.

535
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:17,460
It's just that we lost control
of the situation

536
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,570
gradually.

537
00:29:20,016 --> 00:29:21,940
That's why an old
and stubborn man like me

538
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:23,504
is venting my frustrations on her.

539
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:25,900
Tang San,

540
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,850
I agree to let you return to your roots.

541
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,180
Now, you're an official member
of Haotian Sect.

542
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:35,680
You may go inside.

543
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,130
Chief and Second Elder
are waiting for you inside.

544
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,130
Thank you, Chief

545
00:30:19,328 --> 00:30:20,288
and fellow elders.

546
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:22,224
Thank you for allowing me
to return to my roots

547
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,600
and fulfill my father's wish.

548
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,370
May I pay respect to Grandfather now?

549
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,020
The sect was in huge trouble
because of your father.

550
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,700
The old chief couldn't forgive him

551
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,312
even before he took his last breath.

552
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,740
Although we allowed you
to return to your roots,

553
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,850
the old chief always hoped

554
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,660
that Haotian Sect could produce

555
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,090
an exceptionally talented young disciple

556
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,980
that could help the sect
regain its former glory.

557
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,570
If you can complete three tasks for us,

558
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,980
not only will you be able
to return to your roots,

559
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,020
but we can also allow your father

560
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,180
to return to the sect

561
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,810
so that you two could pay respect
to the old chief together.

562
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,610
All right.

563
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,740
I promise you.

564
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,024
These three tasks are
extraordinarily difficult.

565
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,330
According to what I know,

566
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,740
no one in the history

567
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,632
of Douluo Continent
had ever completed them.

568
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,740
Even so, are you sure
you want to take up the tasks?

569
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,768
No matter what kind of tasks they are,

570
00:31:17,152 --> 00:31:18,090
I will complete them.

571
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:20,130
It's because this is a promise
I made to Father.

572
00:31:20,608 --> 00:31:22,416
It's also a promise I made to the sect.

573
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,850
For the first task,

574
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,570
your soul power needs to exceed Level 80

575
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,050
within ten years.

576
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,260
I believe I can achieve that.

577
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,570
For the second task,

578
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,130
defeat a Grand Soul Master

579
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,940
of Martial Soul Hall within ten years.

580
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,500
For the third task,

581
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,260
when your soul power reaches Level 80,

582
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,220
you need to obtain
a Hectomillennium Soul Ring.

583
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:54,900
Second Elder,

584
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,180
even most

585
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,460
of the Grand Soul Masters
couldn't complete that task.

586
00:31:58,496 --> 00:32:01,152
Ordinary soul masters will never
be able to complete the task.

587
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:03,290
However, the future leader
of Haotian Sect

588
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,570
has to complete it.

589
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,500
Although these
three tasks are difficult,

590
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,370
they represent our expectations of you.

591
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,660
If you can complete them in time,

592
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,180
you shall be the next sect leader.

593
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,180
By then, no one will stop you

594
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,420
no matter what you want to do.

595
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:25,980
I

596
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,020
will complete them.

597
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,500
(Father,)

598
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,020
(although these three tasks)

599
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,420
(are extremely difficult,)

600
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,700
(I'll fulfill my promise.)

601
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,290
(I won't let you or the sect down.)

602
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,130
(Given enough time,)

603
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,740
(I'll surely return here)

604
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,260
(and restore Haotian Sect
to its former glory.)

605
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,740
(San,)

606
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,810
(I'll leave Haotian Sect to you.)

607
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,500
(I believe)

608
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,570
(that you can surely achieve
what I couldn't back then.)

609
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,290
Judging from His Majesty's pulse,

610
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,610
I think someone
has swapped his medicine.

611
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,420
Father's meals and prescriptions

612
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,660
have to undergo a strict inspection.

613
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,170
There's no way an outsider
can tamper with them.

614
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,460
Unless it's...

615
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:10,780
Reporting in!

616
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,730
Your Highness,

617
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:14,440
you told us to set up
an ambush in the dark

618
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,609
and subdue suspicious persons.

619
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,570
Someone fell for our trap!

620
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:17,136
Who is it?

621
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:17,940
Where is he?

622
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,500
Such audacity!

623
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,200
How dare you guys do this to me?

624
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,090
Brother,

625
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,460
tell them to release me!

626
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,224
Put down your spears.

627
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,552
So, you swapped out
Father's medicine, huh?

628
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,250
Are you trying to harm Father here?

629
00:34:31,312 --> 00:34:32,560
What are you talking about?

630
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,700
Who's trying to harm Father?

631
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,248
I should be asking you that question.

632
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,170
Why did you sneak to Father's chamber?

633
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,728
You didn't allow anyone to visit Father.

634
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:41,170
I had no choice but to sneak in.

635
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,980
Brother, do you think

636
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,480
only you're concerned about Father?

637
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,312
Search his body.

638
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,420
How dare you?

639
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,690
I'm one of the princes!

640
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,680
I won't let you guys
disrespect me like this!

641
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,340
Xue Qinghe,

642
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,170
once Father has recovered,

643
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,050
I'll surely ask him
to uphold justice for me!

644
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:57,690
Fourth Brother,

645
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,380
someone swapped Father's medicine.

646
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,020
This concerns his safety.

647
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,416
I can't afford to take the risk.

648
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:05,650
Search his body.

649
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,280
This has nothing to do with me!

650
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,650
I'm the fourth prince!

651
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,820
By doing this to me,

652
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,530
you guys are insulting the royal family!

653
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,610
You'll regret this.

654
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:32,650
Continue the search.

655
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,380
You may choose to doubt me.

656
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,860
However, you have to show evidence.

657
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:40,980
On the contrary,

658
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,020
if something happens to Father,

659
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,090
shouldn't you be
the main suspect instead?

660
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,530
Your Highness,

661
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,848
someone wishes to see His Majesty.

662
00:35:52,896 --> 00:35:54,016
He's waiting at the entrance.

663
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,650
Xue Qinghe.

664
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,610
I'll remember

665
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,050
what you did to me today.

666
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,780
I know that was a tough pill to swallow.

667
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,360
But I hope that you can understand this.

668
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,210
I can't afford to let anything
happen to Father.

669
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,860
I have no choice.

670
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,020
Grandmaster.

671
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,130
Master.

672
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,460
Your Highness,

673
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,984
please tell the guards to leave.

674
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,840
We have something
to report to His Majesty.

675
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,980
Someone secretly swapped
Father's medicine a few days ago.

676
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,020
We're still investigating the case.

677
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,610
This concerns his safety.

678
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,090
Therefore, I'm afraid
I cannot let you two see His Majesty

679
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,210
before we reach a conclusion.

680
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,250
Please forgive me.

681
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,860
That actually happened?

682
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,130
If so, how's His Majesty doing now?

683
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,250
He's currently fine.

684
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,768
He just needs to rest and recuperate.

685
00:37:35,232 --> 00:37:38,128
Could it be that members of Martial
Soul Hall have infiltrated the palace?

686
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,980
We cannot determine

687
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,250
the culprit as of yet.

688
00:37:42,688 --> 00:37:45,090
What urgent matter do you guys
have to report to His Majesty?

689
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,232
Why don't you guys
discuss it with me first?

690
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:48,656
We can make a decision together.

691
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,650
Martial Soul Hall has recruited an army
of soul masters in Xingluo.

692
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,864
They're heading to Tiandou?

693
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,420
Grandmaster,

694
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:03,940
where did you receive this news from?

695
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,120
Is the news source reliable?

696
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,610
It was discovered by one of my students,
who was traveling abroad.

697
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,250
It's reliable.

698
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,250
Your Highness,

699
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,179
Martial Soul Hall had been
recruiting soul masters before this.

700
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,810
Now, the number
of soul masters they have

701
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:15,940
is almost equal to Tiandou.

702
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:17,610
And now, they're gathering in secret.

703
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,672
Their motives are unknown.

704
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,896
I'm afraid they're trying
to stage a rebellion.

705
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,380
Martial Soul Hall's behavior
is questionable indeed.

706
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,530
However, we don't have
concrete evidence.

707
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,050
We cannot question them in public.

708
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,224
I'll send my men to investigate the case
and gather evidence now.

709
00:38:30,256 --> 00:38:32,900
This time, Tiandou
can't afford to spare them again.

710
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,820
I'm afraid we have to form
a defense plan.

711
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,072
I'll station my troops here

712
00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:38,249
to guard the palace entrance

713
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,056
and the city pass.

714
00:38:39,072 --> 00:38:39,792
Grandmaster.

715
00:38:39,808 --> 00:38:42,200
You're the Chief of Soul Master
appointed by Father himself.

716
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,130
I need you to deploy
the soul masters under you

717
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,300
to defend the palace.

718
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,300
I will not let you down.

719
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,530
I'll also deploy the elite soul masters
of the Qibao Amber Sect

720
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,272
to assist Grandmaster
with his arrangement

721
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,112
so that His Majesty may remain safe.

722
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:55,300
Master, thank you.

723
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,170
Your Highness,

724
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,344
we have no time to waste.

725
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,408
Chief Ning and I will make
arrangements for it now.

726
00:39:16,048 --> 00:39:17,380
(Grand Porcupinefish Master)

727
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,570
Tell Martial Soul Hall

728
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,980
to act quickly

729
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,020
to avoid unnecessary trouble.

730
00:39:22,816 --> 00:39:23,600
Yes, Your Highness.

731
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:31,980
Your Highness!

732
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,780
What happened?

733
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,570
Did you take His Majesty's medicine?

734
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,690
He was suspicious of me.

735
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,570
Luckily, he didn't find the medicine.

736
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,500
This isn't the time
to go against him in public.

737
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:51,040
However, judging from his reaction,

738
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,020
I'm sure that he's behind everything.

739
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,210
He's afraid that we might foil his plan.

740
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:56,380
You...

741
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:56,820
No...

742
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,500
We've already alerted him
to our presence.

743
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,940
It won't be as simple
if we try to help His Majesty

744
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,050
suppress the toxin in his body again.

745
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:41,780
How's the research on the antidote?

746
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,460
The toxin in His Majesty's body
is extremely complex.

747
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,420
It's much harder to create the antidote
than I imagine.

748
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,820
I'm worried that he can't last
until the antidote is completed.

749
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,380
Since that's the case,

750
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,610
taking a risk is our only option.

751
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,300
Now that both of you
have reached Level 60,

752
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,020
I'll fulfill my promise.

753
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,530
I'll spare them from death.

754
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,320
Strip them of their martial souls.

755
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:24,860
Father!

756
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,300
Your Majesty,

757
00:41:26,336 --> 00:41:29,136
please allow Zhu Zhuyun and Dai Weisi
to retain their martial souls.

758
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,500
Why can't you guys understand?

759
00:41:32,816 --> 00:41:35,820
Killing them or stripping them of
their martial souls was never the goal.

760
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,900
Consolidating royal power
is the core of the ancestral system.

761
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,120
This is what the royal family of Xingluo
had done since thousands of years ago.

762
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,940
You guys are still young.

763
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,170
You guys underestimate
the human desire for power.

764
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,420
Compared to power,

765
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,860
we desire to choose
our own path in life.

766
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,460
Father,

767
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,250
I know that Xingluo
established such a system

768
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,820
due to the internal
power struggle in the past.

769
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:01,980
But in reality,

770
00:42:02,384 --> 00:42:04,976
brothers might not turn against
each other because of power.

771
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:07,008
It's more likely
that they'll help each other out.

772
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,050
Enough!

773
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,610
I've already made repeated concessions

774
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,900
because of your persistence.

775
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,300
But the bottom line of Xingluo Empire
cannot be compromised.

776
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,088
You guys are powerful candidates
selected by our ancestral system.

777
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,880
You guys have to accept your fate!

778
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:29,780
Such audacity!

779
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,300
Fatty!

780
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:31,820
Don't move.

781
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:36,650
Your Majesty,

782
00:42:36,768 --> 00:42:38,860
won't the royal family of Xingluo
worry about this?

783
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,130
If the prince dies now,

784
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,650
who will inherit Xingluo Empire?

785
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,820
Release him.

786
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,152
Your Majesty, I just wish
to give you a reminder.

787
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,699
Your ancestral system only serves to

788
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,008
keep him alive because your
ancestors think other princes

789
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,530
will harm him.

790
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,690
If so, can your ancestral system
guarantee

791
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,872
that other people will not harm
the crown prince?

792
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,280
If they do get their way,

793
00:42:59,488 --> 00:43:02,064
don't you think the royal family
of Xingluo is in huge trouble?

794
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,210
You're overthinking it.

795
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,340
Fatty!

796
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:08,690
