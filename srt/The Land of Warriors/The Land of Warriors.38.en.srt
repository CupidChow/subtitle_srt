1
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,186
=The Land of Warriors=

2
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

3
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,220
=Episode 38=

4
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,060
Right ahead

5
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,530
is the Seahorse Sacred Pillar.

6
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,370
The Seahorse Pillar is one of
Haishen Island's seven sacred pillars.

7
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,700
Ocean God disseminates his will
using the pillars.

8
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,500
You lot will receive the test question

9
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,780
and Ocean God's guidance

10
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,420
from the pillar.

11
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,210
I sense a grand soul master.

12
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,300
Lord Seahorse.

13
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,860
Foreign land soul masters
have come to take the test.

14
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,050
(Traverse the sea among the ocean)

15
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,860
(to reach the Seahorse Sacred Pillar.)

16
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,770
(Only then are you qualified
to take the test.)

17
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,420
Let us move across the ocean.

18
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,420
Wu.

19
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,020
Let's go.

20
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,580
(Can't wait.)

21
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,300
This aura...

22
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,700
What was that just now?

23
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,090
It's a treasure of mine.

24
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,330
It has a familiar aura

25
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,850
that is beyond powerful.

26
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,820
Similar to that of the sacred pillar.

27
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,500
Everyone,

28
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,060
since you're able to get here,

29
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,700
it means you can take Ocean God's test.

30
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:32,820
However,

31
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,940
I first have to tell you

32
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,390
about the rules for determining
the levels before the test.

33
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,290
Ocean God's test
is given based on levels.

34
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,580
The difficulty of the test
differs according to your level.

35
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,330
Just like the color of the soul ring.

36
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,870
From the lowest to the highest,

37
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,090
there are White Test,

38
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,020
Yellow Test,

39
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,740
Purple Test,

40
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,380
Black Test,

41
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,970
and the topmost Red Test.

42
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,450
The test subject will appear

43
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,140
on the light screen within the Pillar.

44
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,740
Only the test participants
and examiner get to see it.

45
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:04,700
I

46
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,940
am the examiner.

47
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,970
You will approach the Pillar

48
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,650
and place one hand on it.

49
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,260
It will then lead you all
into the Ruins.

50
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,820
(San,)

51
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,330
(Grand Seahorse Master is right.)

52
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,650
(I sense that the blue light aura)

53
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,820
(is similar to your
Vast Sea and Universe Shield.)

54
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,580
(I got the feeling too.)

55
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,500
In the name of the Ocean God,

56
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,090
I wish to reaffirm this.

57
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,410
Are you ready to take Ocean God's test?

58
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,820
The rating of levels

59
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,580
will begin now.

60
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,410
Where are we?

61
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,650
The inside of the Seahorse Pillar?

62
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,410
Are we being tested together?

63
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,140
The Ruins was created in this world

64
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,650
using a ray of divine light
from the god.

65
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,770
Nothing in this world gets past the god.

66
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,180
You will find out about your true selves
within the Ruins

67
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,940
and receive the god's critique

68
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,290
and your test rank.

69
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,220
I'll go first.

70
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,740
(Dai Mubai.)

71
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,020
(As the prince of Xingluo Kingdom,)

72
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,960
(you find yourself in a brutal struggle)

73
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,050
(yet was never blinded by power.)

74
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,790
(You value friendship and loyalty,)

75
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,020
(brave and intelligent.)

76
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,030
The Seven Devils are one.

77
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,460
We live and die together.

78
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,930
No one can take Wu away from us!

79
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:01,810
(Zhuqing,)

80
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,380
(I will take care)

81
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,100
(of everything.)

82
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,500
My brother and your sister will not die.

83
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,860
(With your beloved,)

84
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,170
(you are willing to respect her wishes,)

85
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,440
(while working together.)

86
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,530
(My hope is that
we could respect our inner desire)

87
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,980
(and do what we want.)

88
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,410
(But everything I wish to do
is related to you.)

89
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:19,890
Zhuqing,

90
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,320
I'll do as you wish if you win.

91
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,240
But if you want to separate,

92
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,810
I won't agree.

93
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,100
(When face with
a life-and-death situation,)

94
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,770
(you bravely maintained your stance.)

95
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,020
(Father,)

96
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,140
(I've never regretted my decision.)

97
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,890
Even if I were to choose again,

98
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,460
I will not fight with my kin.

99
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,650
White Tiger Destruction, attack!

100
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,170
(You work tirelessly)

101
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,020
(for the same of your dream.)

102
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,100
(But the road ahead is long,)

103
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,500
(filled with obstacles.)

104
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,840
(May you never lose
your original intention.)

105
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,220
(Dai Mubai.)

106
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,340
(Black Test, six trials.)

107
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,290
He got two more trials than me before?

108
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,650
Senior, what does Black Test,
six trials mean?

109
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,500
Could you explain it to us?

110
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,050
The more trials there is,

111
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,930
the harder the difficulty.

112
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,570
Black Test six trials
is the hardest one.

113
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,740
You will need to pass six trials

114
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,170
in the Black Test rating.

115
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,620
In the last century,

116
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,770
the Black Test

117
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,140
has only appeared a total of 31 times.

118
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,620
Only seven passed.

119
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,260
And those seven

120
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,170
are the current protectors
of the seven Sacred Pillars.

121
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,530
I

122
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,290
am one of them.

123
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,490
Does that mean passing
the Black Test six trials

124
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,970
equates to having the same power
as a sacred pillar protector?

125
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,140
When will the test begin?

126
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,140
The time period for land soul masters

127
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,050
taking the Black Test

128
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,810
is one completion every year.

129
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,690
If you cannot accomplish it,

130
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,290
the next trial will not appear.

131
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,980
If you miss the deadline,

132
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,260
of neglect it,

133
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,260
the Ocean God's mark imprinted

134
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,380
in your forehead will explode,

135
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,140
causing the participant
to immediately perish.

136
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,930
Hence, there has never been
any failed Black Test participants.

137
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,260
There are only successful participants
or dead ones.

138
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,460
A level 60 wanting to pass
a Black Test six trials

139
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,770
is nigh impossible.

140
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,020
Thus, it's not too late
for you to turn back now.

141
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,980
Otherwise, if another Black Test
is given,

142
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,620
the rest of you will end up like him,

143
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,930
dead.

144
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,460
Senior,

145
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,570
from what I know,

146
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,860
the people of Haishen Island

147
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,810
have to take the test when they turn 18.

148
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,860
Does that mean you were stronger
than Mubai now

149
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,500
when you were only 18 years old?

150
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,260
I wasn't as strong as him at 18.

151
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,530
I wasn't even a level 40.

152
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,740
But Ocean God

153
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,530
gave the island's soul masters

154
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,980
a 10-year limit to accomplish
one Black Test trial.

155
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,980
Even so,

156
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,980
I barely made it through my
Black Test four trials.

157
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,000
At the time, my last assessment

158
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,460
was to survive for two hours in a school
of demon soul sharks

159
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,460
that exist outside of
the island's guardian beasts.

160
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,100
School of demon soul sharks?

161
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,860
I see why it is a brush with death.

162
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,570
Why don't you give it some more thought?

163
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,530
No need.

164
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,740
It's so thrilling,

165
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,020
exactly what we need.

166
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,340
The reason we came is to take the test.

167
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,140
If the test was too easy,
the trip would've been futile.

168
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,810
We've accomplished
many an impossible task.

169
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,530
There's no reason why
we can't create another miracle.

170
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,860
Please assign me a test, Ocean God.

171
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,980
(Zhu Zhuqing.)

172
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,140
(Born into Xingluo nobility.)

173
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,100
(Has cold appearance)

174
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,810
(yet the heart burns like the sun.)

175
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,970
Your soul bone wasn't destroyed in vain.

176
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
We will avenge you.

177
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,140
Did we become stronger

178
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,860
just to survive

179
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,650
by killing our kin?

180
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,650
Your Majesty,

181
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,500
please spare Zhu Zhuyun and Dai Weisi.

182
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,690
(When faced with a crisis,)

183
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,460
(you did not surrender to fate)

184
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,500
(but remained tenacious.)

185
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,020
I will never impose the things I hate

186
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,100
onto other people.

187
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,380
Real strength

188
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,050
is not eliminating all threats.

189
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,980
It's by becoming
indestructible ourselves.

190
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,790
So that we can not only
protect ourselves,

191
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,930
but also safeguard others.

192
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,770
(However, your desire
to becoming stronger is too great.)

193
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,020
Is wanting to protect myself wrong?

194
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,140
(Why do you)

195
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,140
(wish to become stronger?)

196
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,500
To be free.

197
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,220
The moment I was born,
I was made your fiance.

198
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,410
Is the point of my life
just being Dai Mubai's spouse?

199
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,380
Then who is Zhu Zhuqing supposed to be?

200
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,740
Has anyone asked me what I wanted?

201
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,220
I don't want you to sacrifice yourself
for my sake.

202
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,740
Likewise,

203
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,290
I don't want to sacrifice myself
for your sake.

204
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,460
Perhaps it's a selfish act on my part.

205
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,500
But this is the only life I have.

206
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,390
I don't care what
other people might think.

207
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,290
(You will understand one day.)

208
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,340
(That becoming stronger
doesn't necessarily mean)

209
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,620
(you are free.)

210
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,740
(Being too fixated on power
becomes a perverse.)

211
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,690
(Zhu Zhuqing.)

212
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,690
(Black Test, five trials.)

213
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,260
Another Black Test assessment.

214
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
(Zhu Zhuqing.)

215
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,460
(Oscar's sense of normalcy)

216
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,530
(is precisely what you need.)

217
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,220
Was that

218
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,930
a compliment for me?

219
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,340
Ocean God,

220
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,690
I am ready.

221
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,690
(Oscar.)

222
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,050
(As a Food Branch soul master
without attacking power,)

223
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,980
(you did not let that stop you.)

224
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,860
I know your feelings
for Rongrong are sincere.

225
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,810
(But right now, you're not the one
who can protect her.)

226
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,570
(If I don't become stronger,)

227
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,740
(I have no right to stay
by Rongrong's side.)

228
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,050
I must become

229
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,890
a victor who can stand up
to war soul masters.

230
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,960
Only then will I be able to protect you.

231
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,770
(To be able to protect your loved one,)

232
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,170
(you ventured into world,
braving challenges alone.)

233
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,260
(At last, you came out of it alive)

234
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,140
(and broke through your limitations.)

235
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,410
Goodbye, Tempest Wolf.

236
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,930
(Rongrong,)

237
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,860
(I made it.)

238
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
(When faced with a difficult decision,)

239
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,140
(you were resolute.)

240
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,810
(You did not forsake your ideals
for your own selfish desire.)

241
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,560
San wants to establish Tang Clan.

242
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,690
So he really needs your help.

243
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,650
Qibao Amber Sect needs you too.

244
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,050
I choose Tang Clan.

245
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,280
(You do not become complacent
during the good times,)

246
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,830
(nor give up easily despite adversity.)

247
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,980
(Being calm and collected.)

248
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,930
(That's the key to success.)

249
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,050
(Oscar.)

250
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,460
(Black Test, six trials.)

251
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,570
That's great!

252
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,850
I am rated the same as Boss Dai.

253
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,450
We're both taking
the Black Test six trials.

254
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,570
Are you that excited
about the Black Test six trials?

255
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,170
Of course.

256
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,600
Ocean God assigns the test

257
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,190
based on the comprehensive quality
of the person being assessed.

258
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,820
I'm merely a Food Branch soul master
and I was given the Black Test six trials.

259
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,480
That must mean
I have a lot of potential.

260
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,340
Ocean God!

261
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,380
From now on, I am a devout follower
of Ocean God.

262
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,740
Please assign me my test.

263
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,530
(Ma Hongjun.)

264
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,020
(Is it uncomfortable
being in the light?)

265
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,220
What?

266
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,410
This is the Shrek Academy.

267
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,090
Who said you could be so audacious?

268
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,730
(You regard evil as the greatest enemy.)

269
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,900
(A straightforward person.)

270
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,700
(When you come across injustice,)

271
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,660
(you always step forward)

272
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,810
(to help the weak.)

273
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,020
(Wretched Trio)
It's not to be missed, people!

274
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,570
Experience the Wretched Trio's appeal!

275
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,770
Go on home.

276
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,290
Myles is dead.

277
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,330
No one will enslave you guys again.

278
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,460
I don't get it.

279
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,020
My martial soul is evil fire,

280
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,130
and a top-notch
phoenix martial soul at that.

281
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,050
But why couldn't I beat Boss Dai and San?

282
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,080
(You are envious
of your friends' innate talent.)

283
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,260
(You want all eyes to be on you,)

284
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,570
(yet you do not realize
the weight of the crown.)

285
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,290
Boss Dai,

286
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,500
your emperor father
seems to be out for blood.

287
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,850
I wasn't mistaken.

288
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,700
Your smile is just as I remembered.

289
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,130
Birds of a feather!

290
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,900
(You are jealous of other people
finding love.)

291
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,570
(You brood over being alone,)

292
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,700
(but you don't realize
that love begets love.)

293
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,370
(Treat others with sincerity
to get a sincere response.)

294
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,610
Are you okay?

295
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,940
(Ma Hongjun.)

296
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,660
(Black Test, six trials.)

297
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,330
Ocean God,

298
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,700
please give me a chance.

299
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,020
(Tribe of Agility's Bai Chenxiang.)

300
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,460
(You are not like the rest.)

301
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,050
That's right.

302
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,330
I am much weaker compared to them.

303
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,130
(The Ocean God's test
is not child's play.)

304
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,180
(It's not too late
for you to turn back.)

305
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,740
(I will deliver you safely
from the island.)

306
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,090
I know I am not qualified to be here.

307
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,220
But I wish to live up
to my companions' trust in me

308
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,100
and not waste the effort
it took to get this far.

309
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,050
Even if I'm incomparable in strength,

310
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,980
I still wish to overcome my own limits.

311
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,570
(Everything becomes clear in the heart.)

312
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,900
(Only by accepting yourself,)

313
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,330
(not self-abased and self-conscious,)

314
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,290
(will you be qualified
to take the test.)

315
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,260
(Are you confident in yourself?)

316
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,940
(Be it luck or true ability,)

317
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,330
(since you made it here,)

318
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,460
(it means you are qualified.)

319
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,570
(As you wish.)

320
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,980
(Bai Chenxiang.)

321
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,740
(Though arrogant,)

322
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,530
(you were not afraid to self-reflect.)

323
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,530
(You do not leave a person in need.)

324
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,260
Why are you still here?

325
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,570
The Tribe of Agility
will not leave a comrade behind.

326
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,940
Get him out of here.

327
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,940
I will lure them away.

328
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,530
You be careful.

329
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,940
(May your will be unyielding,)

330
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,700
(strengthened through tribulations.)

331
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,220
(Bai Chenxiang.)

332
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,500
(Yellow Test, one trial.)

333
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,940
That's more like
the usual Haishen Island standard.

334
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,850
So this is a god's assessment
of my strength.

335
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,220
Xiang,

336
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,570
not even a god

337
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,180
can judge you.

338
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,420
Only you yourself can.

339
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,660
With your ability,

340
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,770
it won't be any easier

341
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,810
taking on a Yellow Test.

342
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,610
I understand.

343
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,900
I'm prepared.

344
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,610
I can take the test any time.

345
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,350
Xiang, why are you looking
at me like that?

346
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,610
When I lost to you,

347
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,050
I kept thinking of how to get better.

348
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,660
Nevertheless, I was unwilling to accept
my true strength.

349
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,500
Today is the perfect chance.

350
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,500
Let's go again.

351
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,740
I'd like to see how much I've improved.

352
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,700
No, no, no.

353
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,770
I'm not fighting you.

354
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,770
Her trial for the Yellow Test

355
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,940
is to withstand your attacks

356
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,770
for an hour.

357
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,900
I'm ready.

358
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,020
If you really want what's best for me,
then make sure you don't hold back.

359
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,130
Xiang,

360
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,290
brace yourself.

361
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,050
This is my first soul skill,

362
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,260
Phoenix Fire Line.

363
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,090
First soul skill, Delusion.

364
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,570
Phoenix Meteor Shower!

365
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,460
Again!

366
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,610
That's good.

367
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,260
The one hour is up.

368
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,500
Xiang!

369
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,770
Xiang,

370
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,900
you made it.

371
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:50,810
Also,

372
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,460
don't ever doubt yourself again.

373
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,810
Thank you for treating me as an equal.

374
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,530
An equal?

375
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,980
Fatty,

376
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,850
step aside and figure it out.

377
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,700
It's my time now.

378
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,590
Waiting around
is only making me more nervous.

379
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,420
All the best.

380
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,610
Almighty Ocean God,

381
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,880
please assign me
the Black Test, six trials.

382
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,370
Black Test six trials.

383
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,090
Young Lady,

384
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,900
although you come from
the Qibao Amber Sect,

385
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,260
you are only
a support branch soul master.

386
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,260
Let's not be too greedy.

387
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,850
(Ning Rongrong.)

388
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,500
(Through training,
you got rid of your arrogance.)

389
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,260
(You remained calm
in the face of adversity,)

390
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,700
(stepping up to the plate.)

391
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,680
(Right now, the most important task
is to get the wounded settled.)

392
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,740
(Those who are seriously wounded)

393
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,080
(will be treated first
with the resources we have.)

394
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,020
(Do your best.)

395
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,700
(We must keep them alive.)

396
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,610
(Put the less-injured in Zone C.)

397
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,020
They can take what they need
and look after one another.

398
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,370
Our Rongrong

399
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,700
is looking more like the successor.

400
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,770
(You respect your loved one's decision,)

401
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,420
(and your commitment to love
is unwavering.)

402
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,050
What you've decided upon,

403
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,050
I won't stop you from doing it.

404
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,220
Make sure you come back safely.

405
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,810
I'm not going to be protected forever.

406
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,810
Like you, I am working hard too.

407
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,020
(At last, you got rid of the limitations
of the support branch)

408
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,810
(and created your own way
of advancements.)

409
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,420
Again!

410
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,090
(Use defense as offense.)

411
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,850
(Remain calm and cautious.)

412
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,500
(Retreat to advance,)

413
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,740
(and you'll suddenly see the light.)

414
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,220
(Grand Ocean God Master,
Grand Priest of Haishen Island)

415
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,610
So,

416
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,740
that person is you.

417
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,570
(Ning Rongrong.)

418
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,220
(Ultimate Test, seven trials.)

419
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,460
Senior,

420
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,870
does that mean the pressure on me
is bigger than that of the Black Test?

421
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,660
Young Lady,

422
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,700
it is an honor for me

423
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,420
to be your examiner.

424
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,420
Whatever you may need on the island,

425
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,770
feel free to let me know.

426
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,460
I will do my best to get it done.

427
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,220
I don't understand.

428
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,810
What do you mean by that?

429
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,330
Once you pass all the trials,

430
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,810
you will know.

431
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,050
I'm looking forward to your performance.

432
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,370
Master Seahorse.

433
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,610
She and I are only one rank apart.

434
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,930
How come the difference is so big?

435
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,050
Unlike the Black Test,

436
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,180
the last time someone was given
the Ultimate Test,

437
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,700
it was for the island's Grand Priest.

438
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,980
So young lady,

439
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,530
if you pass
this ultimate ranking assessment,

440
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,290
you will become
the Grand Priest's successor,

441
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,330
which is to say,
the future handler of Haishen Island.

442
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,500
Rongrong,

443
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,700
this is the first time

444
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,990
I'm thinking your identity
as Qibao Amber Sect's successor

445
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,810
pales in comparison.

446
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,090
Sounds like
the Ultimate Test seven trials

447
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,290
is a lot harder than
the Black Test six trials.

448
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,290
Not necessarily.

449
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,560
Although the difficulty
of the Ultimate Test seven trials

450
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,650
is a few ranks higher
than the Black Test six trials,

451
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,850
each time the Ultimate Test appears,

452
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,420
it heralds the appearance
of a great soul master

453
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,420
who can complete it as well as succeed

454
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,050
the position of the Grand Priest.

455
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,770
So, no matter how hard it is,

456
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,330
they will definitely succeed.

457
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,290
Did you hear that?

458
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,050
You'll be doing my bidding next time.

459
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,500
Not fair.

460
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,610
That's just not fair.

461
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,660
I'd like to take
the Ultimate Test seven trials too.

462
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,940
The light of Ocean God

463
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,900
will only give you one chance.

464
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,500
Senior,

465
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,220
let us continue.

466
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,130
Why did we suddenly get out here?

467
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,850
Where are San and Wu?

468
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,050
Looks like they'll be coming out

469
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,530
after a while longer.

470
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,050
Will there be any danger inside?

471
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,140
We should go back and check.

472
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,330
Don't do anything rash.

473
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,700
I need you to get us back inside.

474
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,090
Entry is granted by the Ocean God.

475
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,610
It's also her wish to remove you.

476
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,220
Other people don't get to decide.

477
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,610
We don't care about the Ocean God.

478
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,220
All we know is that San and Wu are in there
waiting for our help.

479
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,180
It's my first time

480
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,220
coming across this situation too.

481
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,130
Please stay calm and wait here.

482
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,160
Sorry, Senior.

483
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,420
Our friends are still in there.

484
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,660
We can't just sit and wait.

485
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,850
San!

486
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,500
Wu.

487
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:09,740
- San.
- San.

488
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,130
Could it be the Ultimate Test again?

489
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,530
(Wu.)

490
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,330
(Ultimate Test, one trial.)

491
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,610
(Your trial)

492
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,460
(is to accompany Tang San)

493
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,090
(in completing his assessment.)

494
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:55,810
That's great.

495
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,530
We can fight side by side again.

496
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,260
(Yes,)

497
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,990
(we're going to fight
side by side again.)

498
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,090
Senior,

499
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,260
the red light is for the Rest Test.

500
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,460
So what is this golden light for?

501
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,180
Also, about Wu.

502
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,390
How come she is assigned
the Ultimate Test one trial?

503
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,700
(There's no need to ask him.)

504
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,220
(Since the formation of Haishen Island,)

505
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,770
(this is the first time
such a condition happened.)

506
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,980
(What you need to go through)

507
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,980
(is not the Ultimate Test, nine trials.)

508
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,980
(It's the Ocean God nine trials.)

509
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,460
I failed to carry out your will.

510
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,290
I deserve to be punished.

511
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,810
It's not your fault.

512
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,460
Just like you,

513
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,570
it's my first time coming across
such a situation.

514
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,660
Young man,

515
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,050
I've waited more than 100 years.

516
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,020
Finally, you've come.

517
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,420
You are from Haotian Sect.

518
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,810
Who is Tang Chen to you?

519
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,130
He was my great-grandfather.

520
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,090
How fast time flies.

521
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,020
His great-grandson

522
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,370
has grown so big.

523
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,660
Who would've thought?

524
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:51,180
The person I've been waiting for
is actually his great-grandson.

525
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,260
I am Tang San.

526
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,350
Happy to meet you, Senior.

527
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,220
Tang San,

528
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,980
remember this.

529
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,900
From now on,

530
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,460
you will not bow in courtesy

531
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,180
to anyone on Haishen Island.

532
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,530
Me included.

533
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,660
Relay my orders.

534
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,130
Before these eight individuals
complete the Ocean God's assessments,

535
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,700
they are esteemed guests of the island.

536
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,020
No one shall be offended or neglected.

537
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,500
Aside from directly assisting
in the trials,

538
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,660
they must do all their can
to satisfy their requests.

539
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,420
Later,

540
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,570
get them settled

541
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,230
in the mayor
of Seahorse City's residence.

542
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:45,810
Will do.

543
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,740
I trust

544
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,090
you will pass
the Ocean God's assessment.

545
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,290
What if I fail?

546
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,290
After all, this is a test
that has never appeared before.

547
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,570
You can't fail.

548
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,330
Your test

549
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,660
is tied to Haishen Island's existence.

550
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,700
If you fail,

551
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,610
the outcome

552
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,530
will be more terrifying
than your own death.

553
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,960
The Grand Priest showed up in person.

554
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,250
Your assessment must be
more incredible than Rongrong's.

555
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,770
Didn't you hear the Grand Priest?

556
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,850
Thanks to San,

557
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,610
we are now important guests
of the island.

558
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,740
Esteemed guests,

559
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,180
please come with me.

560
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:41,610
Okay.

561
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:42,610
Let's go.

562
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,940
Child,

563
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,380
get up.

564
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,210
It's okay not to receive the Angel Test.

565
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,300
I will help you
accomplish what you want.

566
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,610
You are right.

567
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,650
Xue!

568
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,610
Since I did not receive the Angel Test,

569
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,050
then there's no reason
to worship you like a god.

570
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,130
(Very good.)

571
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,170
(Only in this state)

572
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,820
(do you deserve to receive my test.)

573
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,530
(Has your heart calmed down?)

574
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,570
Mother, Mother!

575
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,780
My martial soul has awakened!

576
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,300
Guards!

577
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,530
Take her away.

578
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,570
Mother, what did I do wrong?

579
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,170
Why are you treating me like this?

580
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,900
(Mother, don't take Xue away.)

581
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,210
(Xue will be good.)

582
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,300
(I promise I will train hard.)

583
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,090
(Don't forget)

584
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,980
(why I sent you to the Tiandou royals.)

585
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,820
(Next time, without my summon,)

586
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,140
(you aren't allowed to come here.)

587
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,170
(Yes, I am a monster.)

588
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,530
(Because inside my body)

589
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,300
(flows the blood
of a cold-blooded beast.)

590
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,530
Although I despise her...

591
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,340
(The poison in His Majesty
has reached the bone marrow.)

592
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,420
(His days are numbered.)

593
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,420
(It seems like I'm becoming
more and more like her.)

594
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,650
(So Tang Yin is Tang San?)

595
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,570
(I am sincerely inviting you)

596
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,500
to join my camp.

597
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,780
(I will give you a proper burial.)

598
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,300
As well as forever remember you.

599
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,500
(From the moment you treated me
like a pawn,)

600
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,440
(I've decided to serve only myself.)

601
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,780
(From this moment on,)

602
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,290
(I, Qian Renxue, don't have a mother!)

603
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,650
(Your Majesty.)

604
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:56,650
(Your inner self
has much unfulfilled affection)

605
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,730
(and hatred that could not be realized.)

606
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,460
(You need to learn to let all these go.)

607
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:04,940
Let it go?

608
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,300
No.

609
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,650
The hatred is what's going
to make me stronger.

610
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,170
(Because they don't deserve
to be loved,)

611
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,860
(nor despised.)

612
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,050
(The power you possess)

613
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,820
(can help you overcome all fears.)

614
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,610
(They will ultimately bow down
to the miracle you created.)

615
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,730
How do you feel?

616
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,730
The Angel nine trials.

617
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,650
It's the nine trials.

618
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,090
The nine trials countless chiefs
of the Elder Hall had waited for

619
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,130
has finally appeared.

620
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,250
So what if you chose Xue?

621
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,300
Qian Dao Liu,

622
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,610
it's your son
who brought upon my downfall.

623
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,610
Sooner or later,

624
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,980
I will destroy the Angel foundation.

625
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,900
Once I complete the last step,

626
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,610
let's see who else can stop me.

627
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,730
I never thought the person
who generations of Douluo Hall masters

628
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,250
had waited for is actually you.

629
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,050
Grandpa,

630
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
what does this mean?

631
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,300
If eight trials appear
in the light screen before you,

632
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:01,690
then

633
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,610
you will be the next chief
of Martial Soul Hall.

634
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,210
However,

635
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,690
there are actually nine trials

636
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,690
that appeared before you.

637
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,500
Xue,

638
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,530
from this moment on,

639
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,590
you will be working on completing
the Angel nine trials assessment

640
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,130
in the foreseeable future.

641
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,900
I will be right here with you.

642
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,340
Once you complete the nine trials,

643
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,340
no one in the whole Douluo Continent

644
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,020
would be your match.

645
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,210
There will come a day

646
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,530
when I reclaim

647
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,730
what belongs to me.

648
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,170
This Haishen Island is huge.

649
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,690
There are little cities like this
dotted across the island.

650
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,570
San.

651
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,530
That wasn't very nice of you.

652
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,790
How did you not tell us
about this important information?

653
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,530
Perhaps that disciple of mine
never expected

654
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,420
we'd be able to live here either.

655
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,340
Esteemed guests.

656
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,650
As per the Grand
Seahorse Master's orders,

657
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,600
I'm here to take you all
to the forbidden zone.

658
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,250
Why are we going there?

659
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,420
That is the venue for your first trial.

660
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,840
Grand Seahorse Master suggested
you all check it out first.

661
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,780
Does that mean

662
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,980
our first trials are the same?

663
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,090
Cut across

664
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,530
the light of Ocean God.

665
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,380
Such a beautiful place
is the forbidden zone?

666
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,090
Yes.

667
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,530
The hill on the island
is the Haishen Hill.

668
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,460
The Haishen Temple
that worships the Ocean God

669
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,720
is the only structure found
on the top of Haishen Hill.

670
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,570
This little island is
the actual Haishen Island.

671
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,500
It's also known as the island
within the island.

672
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,610
Take a look.

673
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,730
Those are the stairs
leading up to the island.

674
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,650
And that

675
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,340
is where you have to pass the trial.

676
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,340
There is a total of 1,001 steps.

677
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,780
Only through the Ocean God,

678
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,210
island protectors who received a test
above Purple rank

679
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,690
has the right to go up the stairs

680
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,510
and enter the Haishen Temple
to pay respect.

681
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,250
Otherwise,

682
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,170
the light of Ocean God
will block the way.

683
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,460
Above Purple rank?

684
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,820
Then Xiang...

Not even a god

689
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,170
can simply judge me.

690
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,570
I'd like to give it a go
with the rest of you.

691
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,860
Until I can go no further.

692
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,420
Okay.

693
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,570
We'll give it a go then.

694
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,380
(Tang San.)

695
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,300
(Why did you come to Haishen Island?)

696
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,530
Because

697
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,460
the person I love is beside me.

698
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,210
Because behind me,

699
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,980
there are my friends who trust in me.

700
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,780
(Because too many innocent people)

701
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,730
(fell to the evil
that is the Martial Soul Hall.)

702
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,900
(To fight against
the Martial Soul Hall,)

703
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,340
(I tried every possible way
to become stronger.)

704
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,820
(I want to have the ability
to disperse the fumes)

705
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,050
(and give peace and harmony back
to the people,)

706

humans and soul beasts.

has its place.

709
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,610
The Ocean God's test will not be easy.

710
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,130
Is everyone ready?

711
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,090
Needless to say.

712
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,170
When have we ever taken the easy path?

713
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,500
If the ocean lies ahead,

714
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,500
we'll cross it.

715
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:56,500
If a mountain lies ahead,

716
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,570
we'll climb over it!

717
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,460
That's right.

718
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:59,730
We are already here.
