00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from
Tangjia Sanshao's novel "Soul Land")

24
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,260
=Episode 10=

25
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,140
Did you bring the money?

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,610
Do you mean the fees?

27
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,220
How dare you take my money?

28
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:45,890
I...

29
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,610
I'm going to...

30
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,090
What's up with your face?

31
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,260
Don't mention it.

32
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,370
Lately,

33
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,300
I've caught a strange disease

34
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,220
that gives me rashes all over my face.

35
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,940
They say

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,970
it may be contagious.

37
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,210
That's why I cover my face.

38
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,990
You don't believe me?

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,240
I can take it off and show you.

40
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,980
It's okay. Keep it on.

41
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,540
You look good with it.

42
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,980
If you're disgusted by me,

43
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,020
I won't attend the class.

44
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,770
Oh, come on.

45
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,450
We are...

46
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,820
You're one of our members now.

47
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,150
Please introduce yourself.

48
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,770
You can call me Ma.

49
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,610
I'm from Tiandou City.

50
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,930
Oh, I'm a soul master.

51
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,000
You're even a soul master?

52
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,540
That's great.

53
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,380
We have many young soul masters here.

54
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,420
As long as you're diligent and obedient,

55
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,540
you will surely make

56
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,580
your own mark.

57
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,100
Make my own mark?

58
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,420
That's wonderful.

59
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,210
I came here to fall in love.

60
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,730
Then you've come to the right place.

61
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,100
Here,

62
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,890
we have endless romances.

63
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,580
Endless romances?

64
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,820
Come with me.

65
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,020
(A True Gentleman)

66
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,770
Fellow student,

67
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,490
how can you have love?

68
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,930
Success is the key to love.

69
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,980
So how do you succeed?

70
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,050
Follow us, The Three Swordsmen,

71
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,730
and you'll succeed!

72
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,770
You must memorize the materials

73
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,700
I'm giving you.

74
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,650
When you approach your target…

75
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,610
(Bu Le? So it really is him.)

76
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,170
Mister,

77
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,020
it's a little dark here.

78
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,820
I'm scared.

79
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:53,980
Don't be scared.

80
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,650
The dark places

81
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,580
are where I will take you

82
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,980
to do fun things.

83
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,450
Mister,

84
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,930
I'll take you and do something fun too.

85
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,980
Sure.

86
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:07,820
Come on.

87
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,970
Wu, did you kill him?

88
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,090
Nonsense.

89
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,020
San won't let me do this to someone.

90
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,700
I was only teaching him a lesson.

91
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,530
He would probably lie in bed
for about three months.

92
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,620
If you try to do something improper
to a girl again,

93
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,890
I will cut you.

94
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,210
Consider yourself unlucky
for running into Wu.

95
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,060
(Good thing I changed my look.)

96
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,330
(Just my luck to run into him.)

97
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,700
(Something sure is suspicious here.)

98
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,620
Dear students,

99
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,890
let's welcome our new student, Ma.

100
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,210
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

101
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,890
Nice to meet you.

102
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,530
Are you too ashamed of your looks?

103
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,620
Sir,

104
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,850
I have rashes on my face

105
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,210
so I'm covering them up.

106
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,210
I hope you don't mind.

107
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,380
I heard it's contagious so let him be.

108
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,970
Just look

109
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,650
how unlucky he is.

110
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,210
How could he find love?

111
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,020
But

112
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,820
you've met us.

113
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,620
Don't worry.

114
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,380
As long as you do as I say,

115
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,890
love will certainly come your way.

116
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,620
Sir,

117
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,820
my future depends on you!

118
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,820
Give him applause!

119
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:50,700
Well said.

120
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,020
- Good.
- Great.

121
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:54,850
Mr. Bu Le,

122
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,700
Ma is also a soul master.

123
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,940
We must nurture him with more attention

124
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,260
since he has a special status.

125
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,620
Ma, you're a soul master?

126
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,140
Sir,

127
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,090
is a soul master's status really
that influential?

128
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,850
See that guy?

129
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,650
His name is Jia,

130
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,180
a Soul King.

131
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,580
After he went through our training,

132
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,020
the girls who chased after him

133
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,530
had lined up in the street.

134
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:22,970
Hello, Senior.

135
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,700
Nice to meet you.

136
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,570
Nice to meet you too.

137
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,240
Watch your steps.

138
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,410
Be careful, mister.

139
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:31,850
Be careful.

140
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,020
I will come again.

141
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,210
Goodbye, mister.

142
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,290
A Soul King?

143
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,290
Your Holiness, the Upper Two Clans.

144
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,580
Your Holiness,
Ghost can't be blamed for this.

145
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,180
The missing soul masters

146
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,060
have already attracted
Tiandou's attention.

147
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,290
The Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan

148
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,050
and the Qibao Amber Sect
have joined forces

149
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,440
with various sects to guard against it.

150
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,850
Ghost is worried they might find
something to use against us,

151
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,450
which might affect your grand plan.

152
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,850
So he could only capture

153
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,950
some wandering
and independent soul masters for now.

154
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,820
Even without the Haotian Sect,

155
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,530
the Upper Three Clans still influence
soul masters across the world.

156
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,800
Though Martial Soul Hall holds
an unparalleled position,

157
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,820
the majority of soul masters still
follow the Upper Two Clans.

158
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,940
Their influence is too great.

159
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,380
Rearranging the forces of the continent

160
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,060
was always my first step in the plan.

161
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,580
Let them deal with it
for a few more days.

162
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,060
Any news
of the Hectomillennium Soul Beast?

163
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,210
Yan and Xieyue have followed
your instructions

164
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,210
and are heading directly
from Death Valley to Xingdou Forest

165
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,840
to find the Hectomillennium Soul Beast.

166
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,180
After their training in Death Valley,

167
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,050
their soul power
has increased significantly.

168
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,850
They will definitely complete
their tasks.

169
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,090
Well done.

170
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,930
It's almost time for Hu Liena
to leave the Netherworld City, right?

171
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,220
Go and bring her back.

172
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,500
- Yes, Your Holiness.
- Yes, Your Holiness.

173
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,460
Once Na returns to my side,

174
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,460
everything will be ready.

175
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,460
It's time to begin.

176
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,450
Just like
what Grand Chrysanthemum Master said.

177
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,990
The soul beasts have started
to form groups and actively attack.

178
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Don't make any noise.

179
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,240
If we reveal our position,

180
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,450
it could attract even more attacks
from the soul beasts.

181
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,630
If it leads to a beast horde,

182
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,390
how are we going
to explain to Her Holiness?

183
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,050
Are you all right?

184
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,500
We've brought the most elite team
from the Martial Soul Hall.

185
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,860
Do we need to be scared of them?

186
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,500
We're here to find traces
of the Hectomillennium Soul Beast.

187
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,360
Be careful not to provoke
other soul beasts and affect our mission.

188
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,500
Stop fussing.

189
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,990
I know what I'm doing.

190
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,700
Let's hurry up and execute the mission.

191
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,410
Beast horde! It's the beast horde!

192
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,740
Retreat!

193
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,860
Erming,

194
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,020
protecting Wu comes first

195
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,570
All right.

196
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,930
(Never say I didn't warn you.)

197
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,620
(This school is insane.)

198
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,620
(You can still leave if you want.)

199
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,100
(Mr. Zhao, show some mercy.)

200
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,410
(I'm not good at taking hits.)

201
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,770
(San,)

202
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,460
(what did you make again this time?)

203
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,930
(Show us.)

204
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,980
(San, the Cockscomb Phoenix Sunflower
you gave me)

205
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,220
(really removes the Evil Fire.)

206
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,500
(Your soul bone won't be destroyed
for nothing.)

207
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,570
(We will avenge you.)

208
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,050
(San!)

209
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,810
Boss Dai.

210
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:08,980
Rongrong.

211
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:09,930
Ao.

212
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,620
Wu.

213
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,410
Don't worry.

214
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,860
Without your permission,

215
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,410
I won't sneak a peek at your face.

216
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:25,980
Can you feel it?

217
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,170
We have obtained the Demon Domain.

218
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,980
You had the chance to kill me.

219
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,690
I entrusted my life to you once.

220
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,500
You did once with your life to me too.

221
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,930
So we're even now.

222
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,810
That works.

223
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,980
We don't owe each other.

224
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,260
Why am I from the Martial Soul Hall,

225
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,020
and you had to be from the Haotian Sect?

226
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,530
If the Martial Soul Hall continues
to commit evil,

227
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,380
we'll be enemies when we meet again.

228
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:09,930
Wait.

229
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,050
I only want to remember
what you look like.

230
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,690
It's not necessary.

231
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,260
Grandpa Chrysanthemum. Grandpa Ghost.

232
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,220
Congratulations.

233
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,140
Her Holiness sent us to take you back.

234
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,340
She knew you would pass.

235
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,530
Let's go.
Her Holiness is waiting for you.

236
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,860
Hu Liena, this is my last warning.

237
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,620
If you keep bothering me,

238
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,460
don't blame me for being rude.

239
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,500
You're not Hu Liena.

240
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,050
Who are you?

241
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,620
You did it. Well done.

242
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,980
Father?

243
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,220
Father.

244
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,620
Congratulations on obtaining
the power of a Domain.

245
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,530
Your strength will increase

246
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,050
and decrease your opponents' strength
within the range.

247
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,500
Soul masters of the same level

248
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,620
will not be able to rival you.

249
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,340
Not only do I possess the Demon Domain,

250
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,090
but also the Innate Domain
from the Blue Silver Emperor's awakening.

251
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,220
Father, can I go and find Wu now?

252
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,740
Also, can you tell me

253
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:17,980
the things I want to know now?

254
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,930
No, you're not there yet.

255
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,930
Then what should I do

256
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,650
to reach your expectations?

257
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,340
With your killing intent spilling out
like this,

258
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,570
you won't be able

259
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,460
to hide yourself
in the world of soul masters.

260
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,220
Do you think possessing
a Domain makes you strong?

261
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,100
You're far from it.

262
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Wu's aura is getting weaker.

263
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,290
What should we do now, Daming?

264
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,570
What's wrong?

265
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,170
Wu is in danger.

266
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,020
(Wu.)

267
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,740
Look.

268
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,420
(Mom.)

269
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,530
(Wu's Mother)
The Martial Soul Hall is here. Run.

270
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,420
Go this way.

271
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,610
Stop right there!

272
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,660
Stop!

273
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:36,770
Hurry!

274
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,290
Don't let her get away!

275
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,330
Stop!

276
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,260
This way!

277
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,330
Hurry! Move it!

278
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,460
Stay where you are!

279
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:46,940
Hurry!

280
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,610
Wu,

281
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,370
stay here and don't go anywhere.

282
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,660
I'll go and lure them elsewhere.

283
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,700
Don't go.

284
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,570
Don't go anywhere.

285
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,460
Be good. Stay here

286
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,530
and wait for me.

287
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,180
No matter what you hear or see,

288
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,180
don't come out, okay?

289
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,180
No.

290
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,020
Take this.

291
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:23,850
Wait for me.

292
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,180
She's over here!

293
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,420
Mom.

294
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:06,900
Mom!

295
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,940
Don't come out.

296
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,740
(Mom.)

297
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,980
(Don't go that way.)

298
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,180
Come this way.

299
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,900
No, come this way.

300
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,430
Wait, why is it the same place?

301
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,170
Stop right there!

302
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,460
Hurry, hide inside quickly.

303
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,130
Don't move!

304
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,610
Hurry.

305
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,370
Quickly now.

306
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:56,850
Don't her escape!

307
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:57,850
Stop!

308
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:58,810
Over there!

309
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,810
Hurry! Come on!

310
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,700
Stop right there!

311
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,220
Hurry!

312
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,610
Wu, stay here and don't go anywhere.

313
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,890
I'll go and lure them elsewhere.

314
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,570
Can you not go?

315
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,570
Be good.

316
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,130
Hold this.

317
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,420
Wait for me.

318
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,090
She's over here!

319
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,370
Don't come out.

320
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,330
Mom.

321
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,020
Mom.

322
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,370
Mom.

323
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,460
(Mom.)

324
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,940
(Mom.)

325
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,980
(Wu, don't sleep.)

326
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,320
Look at that Blue Silver Emperor.

327
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,850
It's Tang San.

328
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,660
I hope he can help Wu

329
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,420
overcome this crisis.

330
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,420
(Wu, don't sleep.)

331
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,980
The beast horde has caused
heavy losses this time.

332
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,800
It was my fault
for not handling things well.

333
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,180
Please punish me, Your Holiness.

334
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,570
Yu Xiaogang was right.

335
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,900
Get up.

336
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,530
The lack of efficiency
justifies punishment.

337
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,290
Na, are you all right?

338
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,260
Greetings, Your Holiness.

339
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,180
Demon Domain.

340
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,020
Well done.

341
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:45,940
Na,

342
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,020
I knew you would make it
through Hell's Road.

343
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,370
I'm willing to share your burden.

344
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:57,020
Station yourselves discreetly
around Xingdou Forest.

345
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,980
Enter after the beast horde disperses.

346
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,700
- Yes, Your Holiness.
- Yes, Your Holiness.

347
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,370
Wu!

348
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,460
Stop right there.

349
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,600
Where do you think you're going?

350
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,050
Wu must have run into danger.

351
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,330
I must go and find her.

352
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,050
You have to believe

353
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,090
that if you can overcome Hell's Road,

354
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,980
she can also overcome the dangers

355
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,900
and difficulties
she needs to face herself.

356
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,370
No one can help her.

357
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,020
When I ran into danger in the past,

358
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,660
Wu helped me too.

359
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,330
You've done all you can.

360
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:53,940
Father.

361
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,330
Father.

362
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,940
Are you all right?

363
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,050
I'm all right.

364
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,220
If I'm not mistaken,

365
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,050
Wu is trying to improve herself quickly

366
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,290
by starting the soul ring conversion.

367
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:18,700
Father,

368
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,940
you know so much
about soul beasts' human transformation.

369
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,790
Is it because you've witnessed
one yourself?

370
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,700
How am I supposed to train

371
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,660
if you keep looking at me?

372
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,090
Then will it be distracting

373
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,460
if I move and stand over there?

374
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,460
Then I'll stand there.

375
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,500
Don't leave.

376
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,330
Let me train my self-control.

377
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,020
Father.

378
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,420
Father.

379
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,850
I once witnessed it

380
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,570
when I traveled across the continent.

381
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:09,770
Come.

382
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,330
Sit down.

383
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,370
Obtaining a Domain
is nothing extraordinary.

384
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,420
The most important thing
is learning to control it.

385
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,290
If you can't control it

386
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,900
and end up being manipulated by it,

387
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,660
not only will you fail
to help those you care about,

388
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,850
but you might even harm them.

389
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,330
I understand.

390
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,980
No, you don't understand.

391
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,770
Control is something you need to learn.

392
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,370
Senior,

393
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,700
where is our famous student,

394
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,500
Jia?

395
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,630
I heard that after he went out drinking
during a date

396
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,890
last night, he didn't come back.

397
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,260
People have been disappearing
in the middle of the night lately.

398
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,740
Most of them are soul masters.

399
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,570
What? It happens often?

400
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,900
Jia's sudden departure

401
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,220
has wasted all my hard work
in nurturing him.

402
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,980
You must study well.

403
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,020
I'm determined to make you

404
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,090
the next Jia.

405
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,180
No, I mean Ma.

406
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,260
That's great.

407
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,460
I must transform.

408
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,020
But what if I fail?

409
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,900
I'll give you a chance

410
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,700
to observe it firsthand right now.

411
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,020
Your Highness,
are you worried about the nation again?

412
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:12,980
You...

413
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,050
What's the matter?

414
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,370
Don't tell me

415
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,220
your brother sent someone
to assassinate you again.

416
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,700
My identity

417
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,850
cannot be exposed.

418
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,770
Shameless.

419
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,740
Your Highness.

420
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,740
Your Highness,
the First Prince's men are on our tail.

421
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,530
You've sold off your property

422
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,180
to help the poor.

423
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,330
Now,

424
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,420
we don't even have money
for a carriage to escape.

425
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,090
What should we do now?

426
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,090
Leave now. I cannot implicate you.

427
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,220
No, I won't abandon you.

428
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,610
This necklace is a family heirloom.

429
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,810
A dowry from my parents.

430
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,660
No.

431
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,810
How can I take your dowry?

432
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,180
Yours and mine are the same.

433
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,180
Sooner or later,
we'll all be one family,

434
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,990
working together for the greater good.

435
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,980
I was right about you.

436
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,700
You are someone

437
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,850
who cares for the greater good like me.

438
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,810
Smirking, huh?

439
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,700
Just watch, I'll knock your teeth out.

440
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,290
Don't believe his nonsense.

441
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,460
He's clearly here to swindle your money.

442
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,980
Look how worn and thin the soles
of his shoes are.

443
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,900
His clothes are just plain cotton.

444
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,050
What prince would not even

445
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,500
have proper clothes or shoes?

446
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,080
What nonsense are you talking about?

447
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,290
His Highness is concerned
about the people,

448
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,090
values simplicity,

449
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,770
and is praised by all.

450
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,660
What do you even know?

451
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,420
Miss, come to your senses.

452
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,130
Even his injuries are fake.

453
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,180
She's not talking nonsense.

454
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,490
You can read this
if you don't believe her.

455
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,770
Ma, why are you... Don't read it.

456
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,330
A self-imposed bachelorette.

457
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,050
Cold on the outside,
foolish on the inside.

458
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,900
Single for years
with a small social circle.

459
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,130
Yet fantasizes about love every day.

460
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,020
Difficulty level: Easy?

461
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,020
You're the difficult one.

462
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,570
Liar! Scum! Good-for-nothing!

463
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,530
Miss!

464
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,700
I...

465
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,740
Do you still want to bother her?

466
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,420
I...

467
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,090
Bu Le, what happened?

468
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,180
Why did she leave?

469
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,740
You're here in time. Capture her!

470
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,220
Ma!

471
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,370
You can leave first.

472
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,090
Capture me? In your dreams!

473
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,090
She's an airborne soul master.

474
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,260
Patience.

475
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,050
There's
another airborne soul master here.

476
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,460
Bu Le, we meet again.

477
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,460
You brat?

478
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,180
Have you forgotten Wu's warning?

479
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,180
If you do something improper to a girl,
she'll cut you.

480
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,850
Cut... Let's get out of here.

481
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,810
Waiter! Bring a tray
of steamed buns and a jar of wine.

482
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,220
Before the buns are served,

483
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,570
I must catch them.

484
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,870
Your steamed buns are here.

485
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,220
Don't miss this as you walk by!

486
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,460
Look at the charm
of the Three Lecherous Swordsmen!

487
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,770
People of all ages in the city!

488
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,660
Don't miss this as you stroll by!

489
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,770
Appreciate the charm
of the Three Lecherous Swordsmen!

490
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,810
People of all ages in the city!

491
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,460
Don't miss this as you walk by!

492
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,380
(The Three Lecherous Swordsmen)

493
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,500
Buddy, can I not cry it out?

494
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,420
What do you think?

495
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,740
Boss, I only want to make some money.

496
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,740
The situation is hard right now.

497
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,720
Some students have run off
and some are missing.

498
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,020
It's difficult for us too.

499
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,530
That's right.

500
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,130
It's the truth.

501
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,990
We haven't even collected all the money
from those missing soul masters.

502
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,420
Just shout it.

503
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,460
Fine, I'll do it.

504
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,810
I am a big liar.

505
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,330
I trick young women.

506
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,370
Don't ever believe me.

507
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,420
Louder!

508
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,610
Let the whole city hear you

509
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,220
and the crime you commit!

510
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,770
I'm a big liar.

511
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,500
I trick young women.

512
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,370
Don't ever believe me.

513
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,410
I'm a big liar!

514
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,460
Keep going and don't stop.

515
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,370
I trick young women!

516
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,660
I'm not human!

517
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,570
That should be enough, right?
I know my mistakes.

518
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,330
I'm sorry.

519
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:38,770
Boss,

520
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,220
our business is ruined,

521
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:45,050
we were paraded through the streets,
and our reputation is ruined.

522
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,740
This should be over now, right?

523
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,020
Of course not.

524
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,890
We haven't dealt
with the main issue yet.

525
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,180
What main issue do you mean?

526
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,050
Tell me about the missing soul masters.

527
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,770
Where is Jia?

528
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,660
What's your relationship
with the Martial Soul Hall?

529
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,980
I'll be honest with you.

530
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,670
I was only using the Martial Soul Hall
to gain a bit of face.

531
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,020
I don't have any connection with them.

532
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,460
Think about it.

533
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,860
If I really had any ties
with the Martial Soul Hall,

534
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,860
could I be bullied by you like this?

535
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,460
That's right.

536
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,130
What?

537
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,050
I'll take that back.

538
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,900
I mean if I had anything to do
with the Martial Soul Hall,

539
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,130
they'd have wiped us
out already if they found out?

540
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:24,990
- That's right.
- That's right.

541
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,380
Would you even need to step in?

542
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:30,250
But I really don't know anything
about the missing soul masters.

543
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,860
Jia did disappear suddenly.

544
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,750
But you must not spread rumors
about this.

545
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,380
Everyone is investigating
the missing soul masters now.

546
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,610
I can't afford to take this fall.

547
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,860
That means

548
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,300
you really don't know about this.

549
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,860
No, we don't.

550
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:49,730
I swear.

551
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:57,860
Boss,

552
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,690
you've traveled far and wide

553
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,250
so you must be careful when you act.

554
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,050
You see.

555
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,570
You're handsome, elegant,

556
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,130
and kind-hearted.

557
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,580
Be sure not to attract
any unwanted attention.

558
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,820
A good man

559
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,730
must take care of himself.

560
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,290
You don't need to tell me that.

561
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:18,860
On your knees.

562
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,380
I know you hate me.

563
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,460
But I don't care.

564
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,820
The one you love hates you.

565
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,020
Our daughter hates you too.

566
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,690
You're the one who's truly pitiful.

567
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,860
You ruined me!

568
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,690
You alone possess the Twin Martial Souls
in the Martial Soul Hall,

569
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,420
and you are also
my most outstanding disciple.

570
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,250
You cannot belong to another man,

571
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,380
and you cannot leave
the Martial Soul Hall.

572
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,050
Right now,

573
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,690
you have nothing except hatred.

574
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:16,860
Your Holiness.

575
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:20,860
Come in.

576
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,250
What's the matter?

577
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,250
Your Holiness.

578
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,900
To be honest,

579
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,500
there is someone else

580
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,050
who has also obtained the Demon Domain.

581
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,420
He is from the Haotian Sect.

582
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,250
Other than the Demon Domain,

583
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,130
he also has another Innate Domain.

584
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,190
Haotian Sect has been reclusive
for a long time.

585
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,500
Why would one of their disciples leave
at this time?

586
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,860
Was it Tang San?

587
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,980
I've observed for a long time,
and it is not him.

588
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,530
This person's name is Tang Yin.

589
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,860
Did you not find
an opportunity to kill him

590
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,650
while you both undergo Hell's Road?

591
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,980
He was very cautious.

592
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,570
I also didn't find the right timing.

593
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,820
Moreover, he is from the Haotian Sect.

594
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,730
I dare not act recklessly

595
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,500
and affect your grand ambition.

596
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,460
This person is a hidden danger for us.

597
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,090
Find him.

598
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,340
Find out what he wants.

599
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,420
If he's not useful to us,

600
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,380
kill him.

601
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,570
Yes, Your Holiness.

602
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,730
You had to recruit
and train soul masters lately.

603
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,050
Let Yan take over this matter.

604
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,150
I still have the energy
to help relieve your worries.

605
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,130
According to what you've said,

606
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,250
this person already possesses
two Domains.

607
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,420
Therefore, he is a threat

608
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,730
to both you

609
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,460
and the Martial Soul Hall.

610
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,420
Your Holiness,

611
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,460
others may not be able
to recognize him.

612
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,020
After all, I spent a long time
with him in the Netherworld City.

613
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,020
All right.

614
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:09,380
I'll leave this matter to you.

615
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,530
I trust you can handle it well.

616
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,980
Yes, Your Holiness.

617
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,130
We will form three teams
for the soul masters recruitment.

618
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,690
The first and second teams
will head to Xingluo,

619
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,100
with each team responsible
for Xingluo City and Gengxin City.

620
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,020
The rest will go to Tiandou with me.

621
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,350
- Understood!
- Understood!

622
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,820
What exactly is the background

623
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,450
of that Tang Yin you're looking for?

624
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,900
First team, move out.

625
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:34,730
Yes.

626
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,870
Did you cross paths with him
in the Netherworld City?

627
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,020
It's none of your concern.

628
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,090
The second team, move out.

629
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:40,730
Yes.

630
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,860
You don't have to handle people
from the Haotian Sect.

631
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,900
You can just send me alone.

632
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,380
The third team, move out.

633
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:45,940
Yes.

634
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,820
You're not his match.

635
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,420
How will we know if we don't try?

636
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,090
Then you have to defeat me first.

637
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,260
Are you fond of him?

638
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,280
If you thought less about useless things,
maybe you could improve faster...

639
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:21,690
Na.

640
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,500
Fine, I won't dwell on it.

641
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,730
But let me go with you.

642
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,220
Having one more person increases
our chances of success.

643
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,380
Her Holiness told you to recuperate.

644
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,500
Are you planning to defy her orders?

645
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,610
Don't forget that Tang Yin
is from the Haotian Sect!

646
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,610
He's destined to be our enemy!

647
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,690
Wear this.

648
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,020
You'll study here from now on.

649
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,580
(Moon Pavilion, Tiandou City)

650
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,780
What can I learn from this place?

651
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,940
Self-restraint and inner peace.

652
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,367
(The Martial Soul Hall Academy seeks
top soul masters.)

653
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,690
(Join us to achieve greatness!)

654
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,020
There are still students in class.
Do not make noises.

655
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,650
Please go elsewhere to recruit talent.

656
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,990
How dare you obstruct
the Martial Soul Hall's work?

657
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,990
Tell the Head of the Moon Pavilion
to come out!

658
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,020
If you continue to cause trouble,

659
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,850
don't blame us
for putting aside our manners.

660
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,900
My beauty, what kind of manners
do you mean?

661
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:06,650
That hurts!

662
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,090
Get lost.

663
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,380
Thank you for coming to my aid.

664
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,500
Please inform Ms. Yue that
an old acquaintance has come to visit.

665
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,300
May I know you are...

666
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,020
Just tell her,
"When the moon is full and waning,

667
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,460
an old acquaintance comes.

668
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,090
She'll know I am.

669
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,820
Please wait for a moment.

670
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,820
A lowly brute with ragged clothes!

671
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,730
How dare you meddle in our matters?

672
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,130
Don't cause trouble.

673
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,830
You dare to go
against the Martial Soul Hall?

674
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,210
You're asking for death!

675
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,050
Who is making a ruckus outside?

676
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,820
Come in and speak.

677
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,780
(Moon Pavilion)

678
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,300
(Tang Yuehua, Head of Moon Pavilion)

679
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,130
Father, be careful.

680
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,500
This person

681
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,460
can wash away my Demon Domain
without any trace of soul power fluctuation.

682
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,050
Stop messing around.

683
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,340
Take off your mask.

684
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,860
Have I grown old?

685
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,020
San, come here.

686
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,130
He is the son born

687
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,820
to you and her?

688
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,530
San,

689
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,900
I'm your aunt.

690
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:34,210
Aunt?

691
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,940
I'll leave San to you.

692
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,250
He has just returned
from the Netherworld City.

693
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,390
You're the only one who can help him.

694
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,130
Change into Moon Pavilion attire

695
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,900
and follow me.

696
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:20,420
Hao.

697
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,860
Look at you.

698
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,380
