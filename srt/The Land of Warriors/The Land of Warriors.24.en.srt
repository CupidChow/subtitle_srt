=The Land of Warriors=

19
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

20
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,540
=Episode 24=

21
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,020
Is it good?

22
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:45,330
I'll write this down.

23
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,220
Fermented rice with brown sugar.

24
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,060
Tastes a bit like wine.

25
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,140
You've eaten so much.

26
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,330
Are you full?

27
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:56,810
No.

28
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,730
Far from it.

29
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,250
I'm still hungry.

30
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,300
Tell me everything you want to eat.

31
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,608
I'll try them all for you.

32
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,780
I want to try this.

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,580
Sure.

34
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,260
Orange peels and red beans.

35
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,860
I think you will like the peels.

36
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,300
You're here.

37
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,420
Join us?

38
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,300
Sure.

39
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,420
We can form a Wu Food Tasting Team.

40
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,170
Let's check it out.

41
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,210
Let me make it clear.

42
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,050
The chief is long gone.

43
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,770
Whether the chief is dead or missing,

44
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:50,000
it's not the Elephant
Armored Tribe's business.

45
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:50,890
Stop pestering us

46
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,490
or tarnish our reputation,

47
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,210
or die!

48
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,480
What are you looking at?

49
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:58,720
Move along!

50
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,490
Don't cause any trouble.

51
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,380
Come on.

52
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,100
Get up.

53
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,650
What happened?

54
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,330
Why is your missing chief

55
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:16,160
connected to the Elephant Armored Tribe?

56
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,210
The tribe is now

57
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,920
the most powerful tribe
in Longxing Town.

58
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:19,820
The soul masters

59
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,300
are having a tough time here.

60
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,930
If you're just passing by,

61
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,640
you should leave now.

62
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,700
Stay out of trouble.

63
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,930
Let's go.

64
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,020
The trouble runs deeper than we think.

65
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,140
(Tribe of Defense's Mansion)

66
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,450
The Tribe of Defense's mansion

67
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,610
was built with the help
of the Tribe of Strength.

68
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,980
As for the detailing,

69
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,140
their tribe chief,

70
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,020
Niu Gao,

71
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,300
designed it all.

72
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,580
Don't they

73
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,050
have a security guard?

74
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,450
Why you...

75
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,170
The gate alone is powerful enough.

76
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,020
The overall architecture

77
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,260
may look rough and unrefined,

78
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,700
but it's full of contraptions.

79
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,450
It seems

80
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,540
you did your homework
before coming here.

81
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,020
A guest

82
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,300
should show goodwill.

83
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,610
Glad to hear that.

84
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,650
However, the Old Rhino

85
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,770
is very straightforward.

86
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,650
He hates beating around the bush.

87
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,850
Once he learns how sincere you are,

88
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,260
I bet you two will get along just fine.

89
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,620
I'll go first.

90
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,020
Sure.

91
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,530
Great.

92
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,380
See you later.

93
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:39,728
The heavens link silver peaks
of five ranges.

94
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,740
Iron arms shake
the rivers with strength!

95
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,020
Shake!

96
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,210
Come in.

97
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:08,816
Let's go, Young Master.

98
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,290
Come.

99
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,970
Ma Hongjun and the gang

100
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,330
must be here for a grand plan.

101
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,890
One of them has the Haotian Hammer.

102
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,260
Does it mean

103
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,020
the Tribe of Defense
is connected to the Haotian Sect?

104
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,060
(Niu Gao, Chief of Tribe of Defense)

105
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,180
That is the Chief of Tribe of Defense,

106
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,020
Niu Gao.

107
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,740
Not bad, Old Gorilla.

108
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,740
Your strength grew.

109
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:41,650
However,

110
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,530
I may not be as strong as you,

111
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,620
there is no way you can break
my old bones.

112
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,530
We know the Old Rhino has thick skin.

113
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,700
Tai Nuo.

114
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,890
Come and meet Uncle Niu Gao.

115
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,060
Uncle Niu.

116
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,940
This kid grew taller again.

117
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,820
But he's a bit too skinny.

118
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,020
We'll go sparring sometimes.

119
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:06,544
Much appreciated.

120
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,380
Tai Nuo is skinny?

121
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,210
We might as well be twigs.

122
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,450
I prepare the liquor you like.

123
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,260
No one leaves until we get drunk.

124
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,210
Only the cowards won't drink!

125
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,770
Let's go!

126
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,290
Come.

127
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,740
Didn't he see the bunch of us

128
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,940
standing right here?

129
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,940
Uncle Niu

130
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:24,770
only cares about

131
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,260
things

132
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,650
and people

133
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,090
that are large

134
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,140
and strong.

135
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,210
I think

136
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,450
he didn't even notice you.

137
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,210
Young Master,

138
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:33,820
this way.

139
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:34,650
Sure.

140
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,576
Are we big and strong?

141
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:48,260
This is a lot of liquor.

142
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,850
We'll drink our worries away!

143
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,410
I didn't expect you to come so soon.

144
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:52,530
And you brought friends.

145
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,620
I didn't prepare much.

146
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,580
That will do for now.

147
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,992
These are not considered "much"?

148
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:00,820
Who are these people?

149
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,330
Judging by their sizes,

150
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,850
they aren't from the Tribe of Strength.

151
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,020
Five years ago,

152
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,210
there was the Continental Advanced
Soul Master Academy Elite Tournament.

153
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,650
Do you know about that?

154
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,820
Of course.

155
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,410
Some from my tribe participated.

156
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,020
But the results were mediocre.

157
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,740
The Martial Soul Hall sent
their "Golden Generation",

158
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,770
which were three young lads.

159
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,770
They were defeated by a black horse.

160
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,770
That black horse was these youngsters.

161
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,650
Young heroes.

162
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,450
Not bad.

163
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,820
Eat up.

164
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:31,280
Make yourselves at home.

165
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,220
But why are they here too?

166
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,740
Mr. Niu Gao.

167
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,290
I am Tang San.

168
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,380
My father

169
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,170
is Tang Hao.

170
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,740
Tang San?

171
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:49,770
Get lost!

172
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,100
The Haotian Sect is not welcome here.

173
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,740
Old Rhino, calm down.

174
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,170
What do you mean?

175
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,140
We suffered,

176
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,650
thanks to Tang Hao.

177
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,260
The Haotian Sect is secluded.

178
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,136
The Martial Soul Hall
always undermines me.

179
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:05,952
Don't you know that?

180
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:07,170
Please calm down.

181
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,570
It was the Haotian Sect
that discarded the affiliated tribes

182
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,650
like used pawns.

183
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,860
It was not Tang Hao.

184
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,810
I want him gone.

185
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,570
Don't make me use violence!

186
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,380
Then, the Tribe of Strength

187
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,170
will not join this gathering!

188
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,170
Cursed you, Old Gorilla.

189
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:24,889
Our friendship means nothing to you?

190
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,784
Anyone who is a friend
of the Haotian Sect

191
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,410
is not welcome here!

192
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,410
Fine.

193
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:31,890
Wait.

194
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,530
Mr. Niu Gao,

195
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:41,040
I apologize for damage
the four affiliated tribes

196
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,570
suffered because of the sect

197
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,860
and my father.

198
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,140
I know my apology means nothing to you,

199
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,380
but I came

200
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,530
to find a way

201
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,032
to make amends for the tribes.

202
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,410
Everything is well.

203
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,220
We don't need your help.

204
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,260
Besides,

205
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,930
you are but a powerless kid.

206
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,410
What can you possibly do?

207
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,740
I understand your doubts.

208
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:05,380
But the Martial Soul Hall
caused everything.

209
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,140
We should go after them instead.

210
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,100
Everyone wants them to pay.

211
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,260
They inflicted much damage to our tribe

212
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,460
and caused the death of my people.

213
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,620
However,

214
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,170
I have a tribe to protect.

215
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,620
I must know my place.

216
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,890
Unlike you,

217
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,570
I don't bluff!

218
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,100
Your tribe stands no chance

219
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,530
if you fight alone.

220
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,290
But if we join hands,

221
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,410
we can stand against them.

222
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,810
You can't even defeat me,

223
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,152
how can you defeat
the Martial Soul Hall?

224
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,770
I need but a chance to prove myself.

225
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,140
Let me prove that the Tang Clan
can unite

226
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:38,832
and protect

227
00:10:38,864 --> 00:10:39,696
the four tribes.

228
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,460
You can set the contest rules.

229
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,770
If I manage to win,

230
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,530
please allow me to stay

231
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,488
for the gathering.

232
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:48,100
I want to convince the others
to join the Tang Clan.

233
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,980
Why should I give you the chance

234
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:51,872
when you seek to use this chance

235
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,650
to win over my people?

236
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,930
You are out of your mind.

237
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,570
Leave.

238
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,220
Get out!

239
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,260
Leave before I take you down.

240
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,220
The Tang Clan will stand against
the Martial Soul Hall.

241
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,650
The Tang Clan?

242
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,890
I've never heard of such a clan.

243
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,500
You withstood my aura.

244
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:42,992
How old are you?

245
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,620
Almost 21.

246
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,740
Very well.

247
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,980
Show me your strength.

248
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,570
If you earn my recognition,

249
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,264
you will be allowed at the gathering.

250
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,020
Really?

251
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,340
I am a chief.

252
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,460
You have my word.

253
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,650
(Elephant Armored Tribe)

254
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,100
Move!

255
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,500
The Ink Scholar Sect will follow
the Martial Soul Hall.

256
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:13,220
(Huyan Zhen)

257
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,050
(Chief of Elephant Armored Tribe)
We will follow

258
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:16,240
the Elephant Armored Tribe.

259
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,170
Holy Lady.

260
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,290
This is the chief of
the Ink Scholar Sect.

261
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,620
He came to pledge his loyalty

262
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,570
to you

263
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,336
and follow the Elephant Armored Tribe.

264
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,570
People are driven by interests.

265
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,860
Our tribe

266
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,050
has the might to rule over all tribes.

267
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,290
Everyone is eager
to pledge their loyalty.

268
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:42,620
Is that so?

269
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,650
It seems the Tribe of Defense
is the only exception.

270
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,650
Holy Lady.

271
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,500
That tribe is indeed
too stubborn for their own good.

272
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,340
However,

273
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,340
now that you have

274
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,890
pressured them personally,

275
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,530
they will surrender sooner or later.

276
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,690
The Martial Soul Hall
has plans to promote you

277
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,220
to lead the Seven Clans.

278
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,100
But we'd like to see

279
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,140
that you are capable of leading.

280
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,500
Take care of the Tribe of Defense

281
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,100
to prove your worth.

282
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,260
Yes.

283
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,810
Rest assured.

284
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,860
The Elephant Armored Tribe
will give it our best.

285
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,170
We won't fail Her Holiness.

286
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,930
Master Huyan!

287
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,140
Bad news!

288
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,136
What's the fuss about?

289
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,432
Didn't you see the Holy Lady?

290
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,810
Greetings, Holy Lady.

291
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:29,770
Master Huyan,

292
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,570
this is urgent.

293
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:33,120
The Tribe of Defense got reinforcement.

294
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:34,340
One of them is actually

295
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,620
from the Haotian Sect.

296
00:13:36,336 --> 00:13:37,380
Did you get a good look?

297
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,930
Yes.

298
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:40,704
The Haotian Sect went into seclusion.

299
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,336
Why would they intervene in our plan

300
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:43,456
with the Tribe of Defense?

301
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:44,528
I saw it myself.

302
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,530
Someone used the Haotian Hammer.

303
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,740
The Haotian Sect?

304
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,500
Could it be Tang San?

305
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,810
I'll accept

306
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,050
any rules

307
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,050
you set.

308
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,810
In this place,

309
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,340
my stature is the normal standard.

310
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,220
I must eat more to stay in good shape.

311
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,690
Aren't you going to watch?

312
00:14:16,912 --> 00:14:17,460
We'll watch

313
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,410
when he wins.

314
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,620
You are out of your mind.

315
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,410
Young Master Tang San is strong,

316
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,460
but Uncle Niu is a Great Soul Master.

317
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,740
Is he even a match?

318
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,260
No head-on.

319
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,340
But San is an expert

320
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,220
at using loopholes.

321
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,170
Indeed.

322
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:32,890
We can

323
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,290
have a bet.

324
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,340
You're the young one.

325
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,530
I won't give you a hard time.

326
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,020
This circle is our arena.

327
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,464
If you're out, you lose.

328
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,290
Well?

329
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,260
Sir,

330
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,460
watch out.

331
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:23,740
Not bad.

332
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,140
I shan't go easy on you.

333
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,340
Stop!

334
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,380
That should be enough.

335
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,410
Further fighting will only do more harm.

336
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,050
I don't want any of you to get hurt.

337
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,690
As if he could hurt me.

338
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,690
Old Gorilla,

339
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,020
don't look down on me.

340
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,410
Kid,

341
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,410
it's not too late to quit.

342
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,220
When I use my full strength,

343
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,980
you could lose your head.

344
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,980
Feel free to throw everything at me.

345
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,220
Young Master!

346
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:10,930
Very well.

347
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:12,512
I applaud your courage.

348
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,860
Random Air Hammer Skill!

349
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,740
Attached soul bone!

350
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:17,740
Mr. Niu,

351
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,290
well fought.

352
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,020
San!

353
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:25,610
San!

354
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,370
Nicely done.

355
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,940
You didn't disappoint.

356
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,130
San is the best!

357
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,500
Tai Nuo,

358
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,460
you lost the bet.

359
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,570
You put up a good fight.

360
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,740
Thanks for going easy on me.

361
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,832
I didn't pull my punches.

362
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,740
I lost.

363
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,660
I am a man of my word.

364
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:02,770
You can stay,

365
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:03,900
but as yourself.

366
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,530
My feud with the Haotian Sect

367
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,330
is not over.

368
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,810
Old Rhino.

369
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,980
Does that mean

370
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,264
you finally recognize
the Young Master's strength?

371
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,500
So what?

372
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,460
He can never

373
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,020
take on the Martial Soul Hall

374
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,530
all by himself.

375
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,260
Mr. Niu,

376
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,770
I am not eager to throw my life away.

377
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,370
I want to muster visionaries.

378
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,090
You've swindled me enough.

379
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:29,500
I am aware of your concerns.

380
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,330
The Haotian Sect abandoned
the Four Affiliated Tribes

381
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,112
because of the Martial Soul Hall.

382
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,770
But I assure you

383
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:37,632
the Tang Clan won't do the same.

384
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,290
Why should I trust you?

385
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,290
(Niu Gao)

386
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,610
(is extremely stubborn.)

387
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,020
His defense is formidable.

388
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,740
He doesn't trust anyone easily.

389
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,810
It won't be easy

390
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,420
to find a weakness.

391
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,290
But even the strongest

392
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,330
has a weakness.

393
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,020
The Tribe of Defense

394
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,420
has been pestered
by the Martial Soul Hall.

395
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,050
They hate the Martial Soul Hall.

396
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,500
If Niu Gao actually sees
someone standing up

397
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,952
against the Martial Soul Hall,

398
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,610
he can be convinced.

399
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,260
However,

400
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,050
it will be challenging to make him

401
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,260
believe that.

402
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,810
I am still young.

403
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:14,176
I just founded my clan.

404
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,530
I don't deserve your trust.

405
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,700
But I dare take the lead.

406
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,420
Someone must step up

407
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,472
to assemble a force
against the Martial Soul Hall.

408
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,900
My clan will be the first.

409
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,460
By gathering people

410
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,290
with the same cause,

411
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,744
we don't have to fear
the Martial Soul Hall.

412
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,980
Fancy talks.

413
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,570
In the end,

414
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,370
you want us to risk our lives.

415
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,260
You will cast us aside

416
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,500
just to save your own neck!

417
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,090
Old Rhino.

418
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,090
They are not the Haotian Sect.

419
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,940
I believe in my choice.

420
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,740
I expect your tribe

421
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,810
to join hands with us

422
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,370
after so many years.

423
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,464
We'll fight the same enemy

424
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:51,460
and redeem ourselves!

425
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,810
A newly founded clan

426
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,448
will be crushed
by the Martial Soul Hall.

427
00:19:56,464 --> 00:19:56,980
Old Gorilla,

428
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,792
do you trust them?

429
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,740
Of course I do!

430
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,980
Mr. Niu,

431
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:01,770
my clan is far from being strong.

432
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,700
So we need your strength

433
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,660
to deliver a heavy blow.

434
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,660
Running away means relying solely

435
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,700
on luck.

436
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,980
It's a matter of time

437
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,090
before we are eliminated.

438
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,850
Niu Gao.

439
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,330
Huyan Zhen is here for a visit!

440
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,050
It's a contraption built
with soul power.

441
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,700
Only the Tribe of Defense
has this technology.

442
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,370
Why is he here again?

443
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,900
I had just chased him away.

444
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,610
The Holy Lady is here.

445
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,460
Open your gate now!

446
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:30,624
The Martial Soul Hall!

447
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,700
Battle station!

448
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,180
Calm down, Mr. Niu.

449
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,980
Let us handle this.

450
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,370
Perfect timing.

451
00:20:42,736 --> 00:20:43,940
We've been waiting for you.

452
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:45,330
You walked right into our turf.

453
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,740
You are relentless.

454
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,770
Bring it on.

455
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,900
Holy Lady.

456
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,700
This is the lair
of the Tribe of Defense.

457
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,090
The gate has a contraption.

458
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:56,672
Unless it's open from the inside,

459
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,810
any attempt to break in will be risky.

460
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,850
I'd like to see
how much damage it can deal.

461
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:03,530
Stop.

462
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,130
It's you again.

463
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,330
We meet again.

464
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,330
You should be hiding

465
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,992
instead of stirring up trouble here.

466
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,660
Did the Hectomillennium Soul Ring

467
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,020
make you forget your defeat?

468
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,980
Did Wu die because of you?

469
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,570
Stop.

470
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,500
Now is not the time for that.

471
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:17,850
Huyan Zhen.

472
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,290
Yes.

473
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,330
They opened the gate for us.

474
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,050
Well,

475
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,330
we should greet them properly.

476
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,220
Yes.

477
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,900
Forget it.

478
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,740
It's not your first time here.

479
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
Didn't I make myself clear last time?

480
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,260
I heard you the last time.

481
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,370
But perhaps you didn't understand
what I said.

482
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,900
The Upper Three Clans
have fallen from their grace.

483
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,290
The new Seven Clans will be selected.

484
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,290
I am aware of your might.

485
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,740
You are no match for the Seven Clans.

486
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,980
But if you join our forces,

487
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,980
once the Elephant Armored Tribe

488
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,980
becomes the head of the Seven Clans,

489
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,740
the Tribe of Defense's influence

490
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,570
will increase!

491
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,220
I assure you

492
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,260
I will not forsake you

493
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,740
like the Haotian Sect.

494
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,770
We are but a small clan.

495
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,050
We will stay out of conflicts

496
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,570
and have no interest in fighting.

497
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:08,176
As for the Haotian Sect,

498
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,940
we have nothing to do with them.

499
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,260
Mr. Niu.

500
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,220
Please reconsider it.

501
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,090
I came here and asked nicely

502
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,220
for you to follow
the Elephant Armored Tribe.

503
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:20,624
By the way,

504
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,216
the Holy Lady
of the Martial Soul Hall is here.

505
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,420
Feel free to tell her your terms.

506
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,020
She will do her best
to meet your requests.

507
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:29,392
She means nothing to me!

508
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,020
Huyan Zhen,

509
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,810
join them if you are so eager.

510
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,130
I am not interested at all.

511
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:34,700
You dare disrespect the Holy Lady?

512
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,260
Enough!

513
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,610
The politics changed drastically.

514
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,420
The Haotian Sect went into hiding.

515
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,130
If the Tribe of Defense
refuses to join our cause,

516
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,020
you'll make yourself
enemies of the Martial Soul Hall.

517
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:47,856
You are wrong.

518
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,090
You've made the world your enemy.

519
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,700
I thought the Haotian Sect

520
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,130
sent an elder here.

521
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,900
It turned out to be a witless boy!

522
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,700
Old fool.

523
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,980
Do you know the Holy Lady next to you

524
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,570
was defeated by this witless boy?

525
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,130
The Tribe of Defense wants to
stay out of conflicts.

526
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,260
They are not your puppets.

527
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,090
Hu Liena.

528
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,740
Let's fight.

529
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,570
If you lose,

530
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,290
do not bother them again.

531
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,940
If you want to stand up for this tribe,

532
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,850
that's fine by me.

533
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,810
I won't lose a second time.

534
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,570
He has two martial souls!

535
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,050
If you lose, you do as you promised.

536
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,370
Promise?

537
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,850
Be a man of your word
before you ask the same of me!

538
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,220
Do it!

539
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,660
No one is going out!

540
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,610
I shouldn't have trusted you

541
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,570
in Netherworld City.

542
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,090
We needed each other's help

543
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,370
to leave the place.

544
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,570
I also made it clear...

545
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,968
If the Martial Soul Hall
continues on this path of evil,

546
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:56,400
we will be enemies when we meet again.

547
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,020
Only I thought it was real.

548
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:28,064
Why didn't you dodge it?

549
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,530
Na!

550
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:39,900
You lost.

551
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,530
As promised,

552
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,980
we won't bother this tribe again.

553
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,570
From now on,

554
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,090
we are even.

555
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,740
You mean nothing to me.

556
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,570
I still have a grudge
to settle with you.

557
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,570
You killed Wu.

558
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,980
This is a debt

559
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,370
I will

560
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,090
collect from you.

561
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,500
Don't think you can defeat
the Martial Soul Hall.

562
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,740
You cannot challenge the might
of the Martial Soul Hall.

563
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,980
And you can never challenge

564
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,420
the justice the people deserve.

565
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,050
The people?

566
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,808
Only the powerful can rule the people.

567
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:29,552
The weak are nothing but morsels!

568
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,900
The strong have their way.

569
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,050
The weak find their way to survive.

570
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,660
That makes a normal world.

571
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:41,770
Tang San.

572
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,370
The world won't change because of you.

573
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,050
You should learn your place.

574
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,180
San?

575
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,420
You defeat the Martial Soul Hall's
Golden Generation with ease.

576
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,530
You are a prodigy indeed.

577
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,500
How is your injury?

578
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,740
Thanks for the concern.

579
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:30,770
I'm all right.

580
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,260
Blue Silver Emperor Right Thighbone

581
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,090
can heal itself.

582
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,208
The Elephant Armored Tribe

583
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,940
has become
the Martial Soul Hall's lapdog.

584
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,940
They are here to make
the Tribe of Defense surrender.

585
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,370
If they wage a war,

586
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,180
no one is safe.

587
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,610
We must prepare for the worst,

588
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,290
given the current circumstances.

589
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,090
Unlike you and Mr. Niu,

590
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,660
many fear the powerful evildoers.

591
00:28:57,104 --> 00:28:59,088
Once the battle
of the Seven Clans concludes,

592
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:01,888
the Martial Soul Hall will declare war
on Tiandou and Xingluo.

593
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,570
When there is war,

594
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,180
the common folks suffer.

595
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:15,330
Mr. Niu,

596
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,050
please reconsider

597
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,260
my offer.

598
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,130
No.

599
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,980
Stubborn Old Rhino!

600
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,660
Now is not the time
for your stubbornness!

601
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,810
What are your other concerns?

602
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,740
Please tell us.

603
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,130
I will do my best

604
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,500
to deal with them.

605
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,700
I can't believe a young man like you

606
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,700
would go out of his way to take on

607
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,810
the Martial Soul Hall.

608
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,500
It seems what you told me

609
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,530
wasn't a bluff.

610
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,770
I'm a man of my word.

611
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:50,740
The Martial Soul Hall grows stronger.

612
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,420
Fewer would dare

613
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,020
defy them.

614
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,330
I am not here

615
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:55,900
because of the feud between your tribe

616
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,090
and the Haotian Sect.

617
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,940
I came because we have a common enemy.

618
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:01,504
The Tang Clan needs someone
who doesn't fear

619
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,700
the Martial Soul Hall.

620
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,290
We must stand together and fight them

621
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,536
to restore peace
to the Douluo Continent.

622
00:30:08,928 --> 00:30:10,610
Why can't I give
a fancy speech like that?

623
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,460
Cut it out.

624
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,220
I have one question.

625
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,050
What about the grudge between

626
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,980
the Haotian Sect and Tang Clan?

627
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,048
The Haotian Sect went into seclusion.

628
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,570
That dealt too much damage
to the four tribes.

629
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,090
My father regretted it.

630
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,770
So I promise you

631
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,260
that the Tang Clan
will stand on its own.

632
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,700
We will never follow the Haotian Sect.

633
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,370
Tang San.

634
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,900
Do not forget what you said.

635
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,900
She didn't use her full strength.

636
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,090
Are we talking about

637
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,090
Hu Liena?

638
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:28,980
Who else could it be?

639
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,050
The look in her eyes

640
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,180
was too unusual.

641
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,220
You said I was being paranoid.

642
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,968
It seems you're keeping secrets from me!

643
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,420
But I...

644
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,570
Be honest with me.

645
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,900
What happened between you two

646
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,220
back in Netherworld City?

647
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,610
Nothing at all.

648
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,420
But she said it was wrong to trust you

649
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,336
when you were there!

650
00:31:46,336 --> 00:31:47,632
And you let her hurt you.

651
00:31:49,488 --> 00:31:50,810
You told me I was slow-witted.

652
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,610
But after what she said today,

653
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,740
I realized

654
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:55,370
that perhaps Hu Liena really...

655
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:56,700
Anyway,

656
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,900
I kept secrets from her,

657
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,850
but I never broke her heart.

658
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,020
Wu,

659
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,704
don't you believe me?

660
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,740
Are you messing with me?

661
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,940
Yes,

662
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,220
but I am still mad at you.

663
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,260
I said you were slow-witted

664
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,660
so you'd stay away from her

665
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,020
because her love for you
might turn into hatred.

666
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,700
She could do anything to hurt you.

667
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:26,980
But you?

668
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,090
You let her stab you today.

669
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,700
Your plan to make her give up

670
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,500
might make her fall for you even more.

671
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:36,500
Wu,

672
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,220
I swear

673
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:38,500
that was never my intention.

674
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,740
I get it.

675
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,660
Had you known,

676
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,130
you wouldn't have done it.

677
00:32:43,536 --> 00:32:44,336
But thankfully,

678
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,530
Hu Liena has agreed

679
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,792
to move on from your dispute
in Netherworld City.

680
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:48,660
San,

681
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:50,544
since you can't be on the same side,

682
00:32:50,672 --> 00:32:51,850
let's treat her as our rival.

683
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:52,660
No.

684
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,660
Not a rival,

685
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,090
but an enemy.

still hurt here?

689
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,260
I can feel your touch.

690
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,050

What is this about?

706
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,460
Let me be clear.

707
00:34:22,736 --> 00:34:24,300
I'll be mad if this isn't important.

708
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,940
I need my beauty sleep.

709
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,650
This is very important.

710
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,940
Is it the Martial Soul Hall?

711
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,020
Could you...

712
00:34:39,184 --> 00:34:40,720
Could you give Wu a shower?

(Elephant Armored Tribe)

00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,690
Safe travel, Holy Lady.

715
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,690
However...

716
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:09,900
What is it?

717
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,780
Speak away.

718
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,570
Now that you promised Tang San
not to pressure the tribe,

719
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,340
there is nothing more
I can do to win them over.

720
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,460
Master Huyan.

721
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,500
It's my personal promise to Tang San.

722
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,730
How is the Elephant Armored
Tribe concerned?

723
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,570
Do whatever you want.

724
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,340
Don't you get it?

725
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,210
Yes.

726
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,170
I understand.

727
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,300
I thank you for the guidance.

728
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,530
Go now.

729
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,380
Holy Lady.

730
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,980
Should we inform Her Holiness

731
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,610
about the Haotian Sect member's
descent from the mountain?

732
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,090
Just focus on doing your job.

733
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,020
This isn't a matter of your concern.

734
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,392
To become the head
of all clans and tribes,

735
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:49,210
there is much you must prepare.

736
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,980
I won't let you down.

737
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,620
(Elephant Armored Tribe)

738
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,300
Tang San humiliated you.

739
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,820
I swear

740
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,020
I will tear him into pieces

741
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,940
and avenge you!

742
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,050
Too bad,

743
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,900
you are no match for him.

744
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,960
You can't kill him.

745
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,210
Your Haotian Hammer martial Soul

746
00:36:28,528 --> 00:36:30,112
doesn't have a soul ring. Why?

747
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:30,980
Correct.

748
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,650
My Haotian Hammer doesn't
have a soul ring.

749
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,170
Be patient.

750
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,050
Look.

751
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,152
Hectomillennium Soul Ring!

752
00:36:53,408 --> 00:36:55,210
It's over a hundred thousand years old!

753
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:57,250
It's no wonder your defense
is impregnable.

754
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,570
But how did you absorb

755
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,730
a Hectomillennium Soul Ring

756
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,050
with your level?

757
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,300
It's a long story.

758
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,780
You are right.

759
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,570
Tang San is more talented
than his father.

760
00:37:14,752 --> 00:37:15,420
He might even

761
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,730
surpass his father.

762
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,300
Indeed.

763
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,020
Chief,

764
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,730
now that our tribe has joined
the Tang Clan,

765
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,130
your wish

766
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,130
is our command!

767
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,210
I do have a favor
to ask of you, Elder Niu.

768
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,730
The Tribe of Strength's mansion

769
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,860
is the Tang Clan's base now.

770
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,940
But I think it's not big enough
for all members

771
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,860
of the four tribes.

772
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:40,672
I heard that your tribe
has remarkable building skills.

773
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,980
I need you to tend to this matter.

774
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,020
It's simple.

775
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,050
My men will start rebuilding right away.

776
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,170
The four tribes will be reunited
under the Tang Clan!

777
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:51,090
By the way,

778
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,690
I have another question.

779
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,690
We met many who went to
the Elephant Armored Tribe

780
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,020
to ask for their chiefs.

781
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,170
Do you know anything about this?

782
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,380
After the Martial Soul Hall
announced to select the new Seven Clans,

783
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,500
more than a dozen chiefs
from small clans in Longxing Town

784
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,900
have disappeared.

785
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,130
Elder Niu,

786
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:14,210
are all missing persons clan chiefs?

787
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,500
It could be linked to
the disappearances of

788
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,500
soul masters.

789
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,780
I doubt it.

790
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,980
It could be the Elephant Armored Tribe.

791
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,500
The missing chiefs didn't see
eye to eye with them.

792
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,650
Besides,

793
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,170
some of them have returned
to their clans.

794
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,420
However,

795
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,130
all those who have returned

796
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,730
have pledged their loyalty

797
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,340
to the Elephant Armored Tribe.

798
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
I bet they resorted
to underhanded methods

799
00:38:37,808 --> 00:38:39,090
like threats and blackmail.

800
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,570
The Elephant Armored Tribe

801
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,460
would resort to kidnapping

802
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,090
to gain power to become
the new head of the Seven Clans.

803
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,090
If Huyan Zhen gets what he wishes,

804
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,210
the tribe

805
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,744
will become the Martial Soul Hall's
instrument for evils.

806
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,610
Correct.

807
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,530
If they weren't weary

808
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,170
of our tribe's defense strength,

809
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,170
you wouldn't have met me alive.

810
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,340
The Elephant Armored Tribe
must be stopped.

811
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,300
Maybe we should scout them out.

812
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,130
Count me in.

813
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:08,320
I should pull my weight
as the deputy chief.

814
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,380
No one has to go.

815
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,860
Leave it to me and Zhuqing.

816
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:13,610
Don't forget,

817
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,170
we are in Xingluo.

818
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,340
You are indeed perfect for this task.

819
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,530
But in any case,

820
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:21,820
please be safe.

821
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,980
I can't even contribute to my own clan.

822
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,250
San,

823
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,300
don't you have a mission for me?

824
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,500
Don't worry, Fatty.

825
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,300
I have a task for you.

826
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,460
You know the place well.

827
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,650
Rongrong and I don't go out a lot.

828
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,500
We want to bring Uncle Ning souvenirs.

829
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:42,730
Show us around.

830
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,090
You'll pay for food?

831
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,170
Of course.

832
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,730
Souvenir shopping in East Street,

833
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,500
Fatty will get

834
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,420
the best price you need.

835
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:54,690
Wait.

836
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,940
You asked me to be your guide,

837
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,730
but not your servant.

838
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,940
We paid for your food and drinks.

839
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,472
It's some exercise to keep you fit.

840
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:03,888
But...

841
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,050
Sir,

842
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:07,648
I want this,

843
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:08,650
this,

844
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,300
and that.

845
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,130
They look nice.

846
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,064
Let's try them out.

847
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,420
Sir,

848
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:14,730
pack them all up for me.

849
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,856
I want them all.

850
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,090
Sure!

851
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:19,530
You only let Rongrong
to do the heavy lifting.

852
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,300
You're an able-body man.

853
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,380
Why don't you pay for them?

854
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,650
I have the strength,

855
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,570
but not the money.

856
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,780
You're feeding off the lady?

857
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,090
Rongrong!

858
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,500
You can't spoil him.

859
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,420
You are

860
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,690
too young to understand this.

861
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,380
I belong to Rongrong.

862
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,780
My belongings

863
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,250
are already hers.

864
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,380
Rongrong is my boss now.

865
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,050
Sir,

866
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:46,690
is it done?

867
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,500
Yes, gentleman.

868
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,250
Here you go.

869
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,170
Rongrong.

870
00:40:53,168 --> 00:40:53,872
Give me one.

871
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,860
Greasy.

872
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,088
I'm out of here!

873
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:07,650
Wait!

874
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:11,940
Let's go.

875
00:41:12,112 --> 00:41:12,570
Let's go.

876
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,300
I should've

877
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,650
stayed in Longxing Town a bit longer.

878
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,460
I could've run
into the girl in white again.

879
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:41,140
(Bai Chenxiang, Tribe of Agility)

880
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,170
Did you lose something, my lady?

881
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,300
What did I lose?

882
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,980
You lost my heart.

883
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,820
That means I lost some junk.

884
00:42:19,024 --> 00:42:19,610
It's all right.

885
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,340
You are rather unusual.

886
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,780
Of all the people,

887
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,090
only you caught my eyes.

888
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,090
My heart flutters with your every move.

889
00:42:29,456 --> 00:42:31,968
Perhaps we had known each other
from another lifetime.

890
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,130
One,

891
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,250
I don't know you.

892
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,460
Two,

893
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,250
stop pestering me again.

894
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,610
You don't know me,

895
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:42,730
but I know you.

896
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,530
You are the love in my dream.

897
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,340
Ouch!

898
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,650
You met her in your dream?

899
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,570
I can make sure you never wake up
from your sleep.

900
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,570
Ouch!

901
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:57,980
Thank you.

902
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,050
I knew I recognized you.

903
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,650
Your smile is just as I remember.

904
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,500
