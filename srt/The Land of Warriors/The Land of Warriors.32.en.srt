San.

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,810
Wu.

10
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,970
You two can die together!

11
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,159
Wu, let go!

12
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,690
You won't survive her Light Slash!

♪For you, I renounce my dreams♪

14
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,250
Wu,

15
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,580
are you alright?

16
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,599
Don't worry.

17
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,220
I'm wearing the Peerless Flexible Armor.

18
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,300
Good.

19
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,970
You survived a hit from my Sacred Blade?

20
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,740
You want to kill him?

21
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,970
You'll have to get through me first.

22
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,900
No, Wu!

23
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,930
Come back!

24
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,930
The realm is broken.

25
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,650
That means you're weakened.

26
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,530
San.

27
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,740
Wu.

28
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,020
Young Master!

29
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,850
Chief,

30
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,090
sorry we're late.

31
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,610
It's all good.

32
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,900
Retreat.

33
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,580
Old Rhino.

34
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,940
Wu.

35
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,460
This time, it's not a soul skill.

36
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,900
Wu,

37
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,970
are you really back?

38
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,650
(I'm alright.)

39
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,170
(I'm just exhausted)

40
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,820
(and need to sleep.)

41
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,940
Wu...

42
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,479
Did Wu's consciousness and body

43
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,970
manifested into one?

44
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,460
How is she now?

45
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,380
She told me

46
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,090
she needed to sleep.

47
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,410
She said not to worry.

48
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,290
Did you all receive

49
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,109
the clan's signal I sent?

50
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,970
Yes.

51
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,380
(Tang Clan)

52
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,789
We bumped into Oscar and Prince Xue Beng

53
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,290
on the way here.

54
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,639
We learned of your predicament

55
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,170
and proceeded to enter by force.

56
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,989
Old White Bird led the disciples

57
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,140
in blocking the Imperial Guards.

58
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,850
That allowed us to get to you.

59
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,020
Go on the offensive immediately.

60
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,610
Back to the academy!

61
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,730
I never thought you'd hunt me down.

62
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,429
But as the commander,

63
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,850
infiltrating the back-line

64
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,959
isn't the wisest decision.

65
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,140
If I could get through your defenses,

66
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,650
I'd be able to capture you alive.

67
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,780
A battle between two armies

68
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,730
to kill the commander
and capture its flag.

69
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,260
Without its leader,
the Tiandou Soul Master Legion

70
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,090
will crumble without a fight.

71
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,650
My brother and I
are pleased to entertain you.

72
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,630
To be able to capture Tiandou's
Imperial Chaplain and Chief Ning alive,

73
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,970
I suppose the outcome
of this fight is set.

74
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,850
Don't get ahead of yourself.

75
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,580
Xiaogang!

76
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,250
Farting like thunder.

77
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,490
Blasting Luo Sanpao!

78
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,890
Xieyue!

79
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,660
Oh no.

80
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,820
Their Martial Soul Fusion Skill
is much stronger than before.

81
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,610
Is this your martial soul?

82
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,300
It's no wonder

83
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,250
why you are the Blue Lightning
Tyrant Dragon Clan's disgrace.

84
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,340
What a joke indeed.

85
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,610
Chief Ning,

86
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,700
assist me!

87
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,660
Qibao, reinforced with Amber!

88
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,180
Grandmaster!

89
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,130
Grandmaster.

90
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,180
Such a weakling.

91
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,180
Alright.

92
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,940
I guess I'll give you a swift ending.

93
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,250
Why bother with
this meaningless struggle?

94
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,340
You could surrender.

95
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,359
Take the Tiandou Soul Master Legion

96
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,130
and abdicate to the Martial Soul Hall.

97
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,220
I'd be willing to spare your lives.

98
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,460
On the battlefield, you die fighting.

99
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,840
There's no pleading for mercy.

100
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,490
The Tiandou Soul Master Legion

101
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,460
will never surrender even if

102
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,890
only one person remains.

103
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,540
Then go ahead and perish.

104
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,130
Xiaogang!

105
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,919
Xiaogang, are you okay?

106
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,730
I'm okay.

107
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,940
Chief Ning.

108
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,180
Full Moon.

109
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,940
Sun and Moon shine golden!

110
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,250
Xue Qinghe.

111
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,589
No, I should call him Qian Renxue.

112
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,130
He's been defeated.

113
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,789
Also, the Martial Soul Hall army

114
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,130
is surrounded by
the Tang Clan's five schools.

115
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,090
If you wish to continue,

116
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,890
I'll be obliged.

117
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,180
No.

118
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,700
There's no way!

119
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,039
Grandpa Chrysanthemum!

120
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,060
Grandpa Ghost!

121
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,090
Grandpa Ghost.

122
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,589
My Holiness,

123
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,399
we're cornered.

124
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,220
We should retreat.

125
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,130
Retreat.

126
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,039
Mr. Yu!

127
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,789
Father.

128
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,309
Mr. Yu.

129
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,399
Mr. Yu.

130
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,130
Xiaogang.

131
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,279
Are you okay?

132
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,119
Are you alright?

133
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,940
I'm fine.

134
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,730
His Majesty has been brought
to Flander's study.

135
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,090
Xiaogang.

136
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,220
We won.

137
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,250
We failed.

138
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,879
The Tiandou Soul Master Legion,

139
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,540
under the Yu Xiaogang's leadership,

140
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,829
is much stronger than anticipated.

141
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,069
Plus, they have support
from Qibao Amber Sect and Tang Clan.

142
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,850
Our attempt to suppress them failed.

143
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,890
Tang Clan.

144
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,879
Tang San recruited

145
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,370
the four single attribute tribes
of Haotian Sect

146
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,180
have merged into Tang Clan.

147
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,180
A single blunder.

148
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,300
We didn't expect

149
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,490
a variable like Tang San.

150
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,340
At last, it led to failure.

151
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,660
Young Master,

152
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,180
we still have control over the palace.

153
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,970
Although they managed
to rescue Emperor Xue Ye,

154
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,239
he is gravely poisoned.

155
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,309
His death is imminent.

156
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,669
We only need to announce

157
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,420
that Xue Beng assassinated the emperor.

158
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,970
Once we take over the throne,

159
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,730
we can then deal with those people.

160
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,490
We failed to eliminate
the Tiandou Soul Master Legion.

161
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,669
I could've reassured the officials

162
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,879
as the Crown Prince

163
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,180
and stabilize the situation.

164
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,860
But now that I've lost Xue Ye
and Xue Beng,

165
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,290
I no longer have an edge.

166
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,050
Xue Ye may be at the brink of death,

167
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,100
but so long as they find a way

168
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,639
to awaken him briefly,

169
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,810
he'd be able to leave a will.

170
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,399
Then I won't be able
to gain the throne by force.

171
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,420
Young Master,

172
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,330
does that mean we're giving up?

173
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,250
Not stopping when you have to

174
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,700
will only cause more trouble.

175
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,900
Tang San,

176
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,940
we shall meet again.

177
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,730
How is it?

178
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,420
This poison is known
as the Seven-colored Poison.

179
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,989
Based on the pellet the chief gave me,

180
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,050
I've been able to decipher
six of the poisons.

181
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,770
This needle has absorbed the poison
in His Majesty's blood.

182
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,140
With this,

183
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,620
I'll be able

184
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,010
to ascertain the last remaining poison.

185
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,900
However,

186
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,220
His Majesty is barely
clinging on to life.

187
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,709
I think someone must have used a drug

188
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,290
to keep His Majesty alive

189
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,380
to lure Xue Beng out.

190
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,639
If I'm unable to come up an antidote

191
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,330
in the next 24 hours,

192
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,839
I'm afraid not even God
could save His Majesty.

193
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,940
Senior Yang...

194
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,620
I will do my best.

195
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,229
Your Highness.

196
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,970
Your Highness?

197
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,620
Your Highness.

198
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,250
Your Highness.

199
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,420
Bone Erosion Poison.

200
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,380
Who gave you this poison?

201
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,010
The culprit

202
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,530
is Qian Renxue's
trusted imperial physician, Yang.

203
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,989
Father's poison is his creation.

204
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,290
Physician Yang?

205
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,460
Where is he?

206
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,669
When I rescued Father,

207
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,970
I took him too.

208
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,940
He's being held
in the academy's firewood room.

209
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,940
No matter how much I press him,

210
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,700
he refused to hand over the antidote.

211
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,189
Don't worry, Your Highness.

212
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,810
I can get rid of the poison for you.

213
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,660
So it is you.

214
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,100
Big brother.

215
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,660
Long time no see.

216
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,700
Yang Wushuang.

217
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,669
You traitorous rat working
for the Martial Soul Hall!

218
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,900
How could you use Tribe of Destruction's
banned drug on the Emperor?

219
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,530
Because I want

220
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,940
the Tribe of Destruction

221
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,570
to be buried alongside me.

222
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,180
Once Xue Qinghe succeeds,

223
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,770
they'd think I was with Xue Beng

224
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,530
and sentenced to death together.

225
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,940
Is poisoning the Emperor to death

226
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,429
good enough a reason?

227
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,100
You...

228
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,420
You want to kill me?

229
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,380
Go ahead.

230
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,330
Did you forget, brother?

231
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,530
Back then, when Tribe of Destruction

232
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,730
was attacked by the Martial Soul Hall,

233
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,460
you left me behind

234
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,220
to protect the tribespeople.

235
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,220
As a result,

236
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,460
I was taken by the Martial Soul Hall.

237
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,900
I should've died then.

238
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,970
But I somehow managed to survive.

239
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,140
Take a guess.

240
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,420
Guess what I've had to endure.

241
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,189
You were abandoned by your people.

242
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,490
You're about to die.

243
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,460
Will you still not tell us
where Haotian Sect is?

244
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,620
Only big brother knows
where the sect is located.

245
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,570
I've never been there.

246
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,010
Quite the stubborn guy.

247
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,010
Guess you're asking to try

248
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,620
my collection of trinkets.

249
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,290
Spit it out!

250
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,660
Clean him up and tend to his wounds.

251
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,700
I have use for him.

252
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,570
(Since then,)

253
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,940
I made a vow to myself.

254
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,290
I will live again.

255
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,250
And I'll do whatever it takes

256
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,420
to destroy the Tribe of Destruction.

257
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,250
The day Emperor Xue Ye dies

258
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,420
is the day I reveal

259
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,730
my identity as a member of the Tribe.

260
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,700
What made you become like this?

261
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,770
The men of my tribe
are people with heart.

262
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,490
If I had been the one taken that day,

263
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,860
I would've felt relieved.

264
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,700
You didn't abandon the tribespeople
in order to save me.

265
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,730
That's how you and I differ.

266
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,940
If it were me,

267
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,250
I would never leave you behind.

268
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,050
Because...

269
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,250
you are my most cherished big brother.

270
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,559
Wushuang.

271
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,220
Enough.

272
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,250
You're here

273
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,229
because you want

274
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,660
the antidote
for the Seven-colored Poison.

275
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,180
You can forget about it.

276
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,940
I live in humiliation,

277
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,100
all for the sake

278
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,420
of this one day.

279
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,220
Xue Qinghe may have failed,

280
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,700
but with Xue Beng's smarts,

281
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,460
he would've likely guessed

282
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,900
our relationship.

283
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,730
Once the Emperor is dead,

284
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,620
the Tribe of Destruction
will go down with him.

285
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,010
My days are numbered.

286
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,940
But to be able to see your face again

287
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,140
before I die

288
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,490
is well worth it.

289
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,220
Everything is worthwhile.

290
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,100
You are my younger brother.

291
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,330
No one knows you better than I do.

292
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,700
You cultivate poison with your own body.

293
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,399
Your blood must be the seventh poison used
to make the Seven-colored Poison.

294
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,159
And thus it has to be the antidote.

295
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,119
He can't save him.

296
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,839
He... He has to die.

297
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,220
I will not only save him,

298
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,220
I will save you too.

299
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,490
I'm beyond saving.

300
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,140
And there's no need to.

301
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,700
Even if the poison
has reached your bone marrow,

302
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,010
I will still try my best to save you.

303
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,380
All these years...

304
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,290
you must have suffered.

305
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,220
If the Emperor wants accountability,

306
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,180
I will bear it for you.

307
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,050
This time,

308
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,250
big brother

309
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,050
isn't going to give you up again.

310
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,420
Brother.

311
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,730
This time...

312
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,330
can you...

313
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,050
can you

314
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,860
take me back home?

315
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,860
Brother,

316
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,140
go on

317
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,460
and take my blood.

318
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,100
Wushuang!

319
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,100
Sorry I let you down.

320
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,570
(Wu.)

321
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,700
(You've been asleep for a long time.)

322
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,870
(Are you not going to wake up?)

323
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,700
(You said you're alright.)

324
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,570
(You weren't lying to me, were you?)

325
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,399
(Please,)

326
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,010
(can you quiet down?)

327
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,490
(I just want to sleep in peace.)

328
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,940
Wu.

329
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:54,989
You're up?

330
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,940
Where are you?

331
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,159
You're too noisy,

332
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,940
how could I not wake up?

333
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,900
But I wasn't talking.

334
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,269
You were calling out
for me in your mind.

335
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,029
Did you forget?

336
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,940
This is your Spiritual Sea.

337
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,100
I'm sorry.

338
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,860
No, stop.

339
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,919
My body is really weak right now.

340
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,669
If you touch me,

341
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,570
it will disintegrate.

342
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,140
Did Qian Renxue's attack

343
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,810
damage your consciousness?

344
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,189
Yes.

345
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,399
But don't worry.

346
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,770
I just need to have a good sleep
and I'll recover.

347
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,770
Wu...

348
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,460
Stop.

349
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,970
I know what you're going to say.

350
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,970
Remember what I told you?

351
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,100
Your life is my life now.

352
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,029
I would never allow

353
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,229
Qian Renxue to harm you

354
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,429
and not do anything.

355
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,700
It's because I'm too weak.

356
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,620
Sorry I made you worry.

357
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,660
You're too humble.

358
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,189
This is our tacit understanding.

359
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,919
If you hadn't gone all out and destroyed
Qian Renxue's Angel Domain,

360
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,189
causing him to stumble,

361
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,050
I couldn't have had
the chance to strike.

362
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,380
Qian Renxue, as strong as she is,

363
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,319
wouldn't have guessed

364
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,730
that she'd be fighting
two persons instead of one.

365
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,599
However,

366
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,050
forcing my body and mind to coalesce

367
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,140
was indeed a little hard.

368
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,860
The fight was underwhelming.

369
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,970
Don't worry.

370
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,949
One day,

371
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,850
I'll let you have fight
to your heart's content.

372
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,229
Okay.

373
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,189
We can leave it

374
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,330
for next time.

375
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,469
Now I need to recuperate.

376
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,159
I need to sleep undisturbed.

377
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,290
Would you mind making sure it's quiet

378
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,290
in the Spiritual Sea?

379
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,050
You have my word.

380
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,879
What's the matter?

381
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,989
Let me remind you.

382
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,860
You better stay away
from that Qian Renxue.

383
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,799
I saw the way she looked at you.

384
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,460
There's something there.

385
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,749
Don't act surprised.

386
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,079
My intuition is always right.

387
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,810
Go and self-reflect.

388
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,860
I...

389
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,900
How is it?

390
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,700
Father.

391
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

392
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,940
Please rise.

393
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,290
Stand up.

394
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,180
You've done your best.

395
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,180
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for your pardon.

396
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,429
Senior Yang,

397
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,700
how is the treatment
of my father's poison?

398
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,330
I managed

399
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,100
to get rid of the poison.

400
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,490
But His Majesty
had been poisoned for too long.

401
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,970
His body

402
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,940
suffered greatly.

403
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,669
Despite using herbs

404
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,879
coupled with Grand Venom Master's
soul power

405
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,460
to strengthen his foundation,

406
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,620
it is still...

407
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,140
Still, I will only have
three years to live.

408
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,700
Plus, I'll be bed-ridden
for the remaining days.

409
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,050
Is there no other way?

410
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,700
Help me up.

411
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,460
Dugu Bo has told me

412
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,460
about everything.

413
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,620
Chaplain,

414
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,189
what's the legion's casualties?

415
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,490
More than half are dead.

416
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,490
But we managed to cause a huge loss
to the enemy too.

417
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,100
What about Qian Renxue?

418
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,839
Your Majesty, after Qian Renxue led the Martial
Soul Hall's remaining forces

419
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,860
to slaughter Tiandou's palace guards,

420
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,570
she's gone into hiding.

421
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:29,940
Qian Renxue!

422
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,420
Father.

423
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,490
Your Majesty.

424
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,970
You just recovered.

425
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,700
You need to recuperate.

426
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,620
Tiandou is awaiting your command.

427
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,660
In my current state,

428
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,970
I am not fit to command.

429
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,100
You may all go.

430
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

431
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,530
Chief Ning.

432
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,810
You stay.

433
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,140
Go on.

434
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,940
Where is Father?

435
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,140
Rongrong,

436
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,570
His Majesty said

437
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,189
no one should go inside

438
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,220
without his permission.

439
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,050
Why did His Majesty want Father
to stay behind?

440
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,850
Could it be that...

441
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,620
Sorry, I cannot oblige.

442
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,199
Qibao Amber Sect's secret technique

443
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,149
may be able

444
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,980
to temporarily restore your past vigor,

445
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,549
but if you over-exert yourself,

446
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,730
you could very well be...

447
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,410
It will shorten my life further, huh?

448
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,370
So be it.

449
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,100
But before I pass,

450
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,890
I must clear up the mess first.

451
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,549
I can't leave the dilapidation

452
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,500
to Xue Beng.

453
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,100
Right now, my body

454
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,290
cannot bear this huge responsibility.

455
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,660
There is no point in staying alive

456
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,540
for three more years.

457
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,620
So I'm asking you for this favor.

458
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,730
Your Majesty...

459
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,730
As the ruler of the nation,

460
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,770
I was too blind to notice
the enemy in my midst.

461
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,810
The fault lies with me.

462
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,069
Help me quickly recover my strength

463
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,060
by using my remaining life force.

464
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:25,020
It's the consequence I have to bear.

465
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,410
You...

466
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,220
are the chief of a clan,

467
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,140
as well as a father.

468
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,450
You should understand.

469
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,060
But this method is high risk.

470
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,980
And the process will be painful.

471
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,730
With your current condition,

472
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,770
your body might not make it.

473
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,580
I just want to know,

474
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,100
if I go through with it,

475
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,770
will I

476
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,180
have two years to live?

477
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,250
One year?

478
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,370
Your Majesty.

479
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,370
Once you use the secret technique,

480
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,730
if Your Majesty

481
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,540
could hang on for half a year,

482
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,180
it would already be considered
a miracle.

483
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,770
I suppose this is what it means
to bargain with God.

484
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,580
That's enough.

485
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,330
Do it then.

486
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

487
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,140
I'm ready.

488
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,490
Congratulations on getting healthy,
Your Majesty.

489
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,180
Congratulations on getting healthy.

490
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:12,220
I'm glad you're alright, Father.

491
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,250
You may rise.

492
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,589
You are all Tiandou's
accomplished subjects.

493
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,540
Once the matter is settled,

494
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,620
you will surely be rewarded.

495
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,220
Chaplain.

496
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,029
Present.

497
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,770
Gather the other subjects

498
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,980
and the Tiandou Soul Master Legion.

499
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,500
We are returning to the palace.

500
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,660
The Martial Soul Hall
tried to unseat us Tiandou.

501
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,580
First, Qian Renxue was ordered
to annihilate my royal kin.

502
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,660
Then, they sent their soul master legion

503
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,250
to exhaust Tiandou's strength.

504
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,220
Their actions deserve to be punished.

505
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:19,839
Today, as the ruler of the nation,
I, Xue Ye,

506
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,279
declare war on the Martial Soul Hall

507
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,220
as Tiandou's emperor.

508
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,770
Their wicked plans will not succeed.

509
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,930
Their greed

510
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,930
will be shattered by the iron cavalry
of Tiandou.

511
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,850
Xue Beng,

512
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,810
if I do not survive this,

513
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,020
I hope you'll be able to fulfill
my promise to the people

514
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,410
on my behalf.

515
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,770
I will, Father.

516
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:07,890
To battle!

517
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,580
To battle! To battle!

518
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,100
You made the wise choice, Young Master.

519
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,060
But,

520
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,220
they managed to get Emperor Xue Ye

521
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,500
back to his old self so soon.

522
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,500
How did they do it?

523
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,359
This only proves

524
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,730
that our enemy is much stronger
than we thought.

525
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,620
So be it.

526
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,370
It's more interesting
when they put up a fight.

527
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,450
The battle has only just begun.

528
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,330
There's one more mystery.

529
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,810
Why do you treat Tang San differently?

530
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,279
He managed to get away this time
due only to luck.

531
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,919
He isn't worthy to be your match.

532
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,620
He...

533
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,450
I have my own reasoning.

534
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,250
Tang San and his friends

535
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,719
could very well become
the Martial Soul Hall's

536
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,660
biggest threats in the future.

537
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,180
Back to Martial Soul City.

538
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,660
Yes, Young Master.

539
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,060
(Tang Clan)

540
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,359
How many were killed?

541
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,450
Thirty.

542
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,100
All disciples that stayed
to protect the clan.

543
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,989
The rest went to support
Tiandou's soul master legion.

544
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,180
They weren't here.

545
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,580
Otherwise...

546
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,260
(Tang San, you win this time.
We shall meet again. Qian Renxue)

547
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,620
Qian Renxue.

548
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:52,890
I will make you pay with blood.

549
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,250
To ensure the security of the palace,

550
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,980
I have reorganized

551
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,980
the palace inner guards
from a selection

552
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,450
of the legion's elites.

553
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,890
Prince Xue Beng personally picked

554
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,100
the people who will be assisting you.

555
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,450
Everything is in order.

556
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,850
Tang Clan has sent Hall of Agility
members to scout the situation.

557
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,220
They haven't found any signs
of Qian Renxue's subordinates.

558
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:16,140
I'm guessing they've returned
to Martial Soul City.

559
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,700
After the recent battle,

560
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,580
half of our forces were lost.

561
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,700
But the greater danger lies ahead.

562
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,700
We have to hasten and replenish

563
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,620
the soul master legion's numbers.

564
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,770
Chaplain,

565
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,020
Chief Ning.

566
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,410
I'm assigning this task to you two.

567
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,919
To capture the king,

568
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,660
Tang Clan was ambushed
and suffered casualties.

569
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:44,770
Tiandou will not forget your sacrifices.

570
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,580
This time, you played a big part

571
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,140
in the battle against Martial Soul Hall.

572
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,450
You showcased your capabilities.

573
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,620
You are certainly a pillar of strength

574
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,700
that Tiandou can rely on.

575
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,580
I fully support your wish
to expand Tang Clan.

576
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,180
Whatever you need,

577
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,850
you can let me know.

578
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,660
Thank you, Your Majesty.

579
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,500
I do have a favor to ask.

580
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,730
Speak.

581
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,680
Tang Clan's Hall of Medicine's elder,
Yang Wudi's younger brother,

582
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,279
is Qian Renxue's trusted confidant,

583
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,290
Imperial Physician Yang.

584
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,770
He was working for the Martial Soul Hall

585
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,469
as a result of the grudge

586
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,589
with Haotian Sect

587
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:19,730
back in the day.

588
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,620
Now, he had died for his sins.

589
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,029
Yang Wudi is willing to pay the price

590
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,370
with his own life.

591
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,549
I'm pleading for Your Majesty's mercy,
to spare his tribespeople.

592
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,770
I don't see that as asking for a favor.

593
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,370
Yang Wushuang carried out the order
to harm me,

594
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,500
whereas Yang Wudi
did his best to save me.

595
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,500
The two brothers' actions
offset any merits.

596
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,770
Now, Yang Wudi is an elder
of Tang Clan.

597
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,700
He still has more to contribute
to the nation.

598
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,810
Consider the matter settled.

599
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,930
Thank you, Your Majesty.

600
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,700
After the recent attack,

601
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,279
things are in chaos.

602
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,330
Everyone,

603
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:59,220
I ask for your help
in stabilizing the situation.

604
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,450
Especially Tang San.

605
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,469
The challenge from Qian Renxue

606
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,810
means an impending battle for you.

607
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:10,850
