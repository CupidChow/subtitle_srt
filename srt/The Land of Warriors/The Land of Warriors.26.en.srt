=The Land of Warriors=

19
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

20
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,380
=Episode 26=

21
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,610
Xiang.

22
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,810
What's wrong?

23
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,090
Why aren't you moving?

24
00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:40,672
Don't be so full of yourself.

25
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:42,320
Phoenix Martial Soul? So what?

26
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,940
I, Bai Chenxiang, will beat you.

27
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,610
Her soul skill is able to split.

28
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,860
Four out of the five should be phantoms.

29
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,370
Fatty is in danger.

30
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,170
My apologies.

31
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,260
Xiang!

32
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,380
Xiang.

33
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,210
Shut up.

34
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,170
Hurry up!

35
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:45,890
Xiang!

36
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,980
Are you okay?

37
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:15,930
You...

38
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:16,700
You...

39
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,860
Are you okay?

40
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,980
Just some scratches.

41
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,650
I'm a tough guy.

42
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,330
Don't worry.

43
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:27,392
What are you talking about?

44
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,580
I'm not worried.

45
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,650
Senior.

46
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:37,152
That was a great battle.

47
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,260
Grandpa.

48
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,170
Xiang.

49
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,650
That's cheating.

50
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,020
That was less than 15 minutes.

51
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,210
If you are dissatisfied,

52
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,330
we can battle again.

53
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,260
No need.

54
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,540
The incense burns faster

55
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,730
because of the Phoenix Flame.

56
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,650
It is not intentional.

57
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,860
I don't agree.

58
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,450
Our clan is known

59
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,930
for its speed.

60
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:01,260
However, the Phoenix Martial Soul

61
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,560
is suppressing and pressuring me,

62
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,820
and I couldn't exert my full strength.

63
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:06,770
I will not accept this result.

64
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,050
I request to battle.

65
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,380
I agree.

66
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,980
Fatty's martial soul
was indeed advantaging.

67
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,380
Also,

68
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,100
I would like to see for myself,

69
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,656
the speed of the Tribe of Agility.

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,392
If you allow,

71
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,150
I'd like to request you
to go into battle.

72
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:21,820
Just a match.

73
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,400
No matter what,

74
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:24,544
I hope you'll accept
the Godly Zhu Ge Crossbow

75
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:26,768
and don't refuse
our token of appreciation.

76
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,650
Okay.

77
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,450
I'll take up the fight.

78
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,820
Senior.

79
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:53,450
The rules remain unchanged.

80
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,410
Let's fight.

81
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,380
Teleport?

82
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,330
No wonder you dare to compete with me.

83
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,140
This skill is nothing.

84
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:12,940
Kid,

85
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,940
watch out.

86
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,260
This is the strength of an

87
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,580
Agility Branch Great Soul Master.

88
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,210
But he hasn't won yet.

89
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,210
(Martial soul form?)

90
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:17,072
He is able to force Grandpa
to summon his martial soul form?

Nothingness.

116
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,860
I've been reluctant to use
my Hectomillennium Soul Ring.

117
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,890
The fact that you appear to protect me

118
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,570

Senior.

00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,410
I've lost.

134
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,740
Why do you surrender?

135
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,890
I haven't attacked yet.

136
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,810
My sixth soul skill is Nothingness.

137
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,770
It's immune to all physical damage.

138
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,570
You can't attack me.

139
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,980
This isn't about speed anymore.

140
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,380
Moreover,

141
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,140
using the sixth soul ring to battle

142
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,740
is not my intention.

143
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,170
I surrender.

144
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,500
No.

145
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,340
You didn't lose.

146
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,500
My eighth soul skill

147
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,290
is not purely about
increasing the speed.

148
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,050
This will be a fair fight.

149
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,930
If we continue,

150
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,860
I'll be the one who loses the battle.

151
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,890
I lost. Fair and square.

152
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,290
Fine.

153
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,890
Don't be so modest.

154
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,930
How about this?

155
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,140
Old White Bird,

156
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,930
you didn't lose.

157
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,260
Tang San,

158
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,460
you didn't win.

159
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,020
This friendly match

160
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,620
is for everyone to make friends.

161
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,570
It's a draw.

162
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,050
Everyone is happy.

163
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,170
Let's go.

164
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
Let's go drink.

165
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,860
Old Goat may not arrive until tomorrow.

166
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,650
Let's get drunk today.

167
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,100
Alright, let's go.

168
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,380
I've been waiting for this.

169
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,890
Let's drink.

170
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:08,460
San.

171
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,020
- San.
- San.

172
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,570
San.

173
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:11,620
Let's go.

174
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,050
Please.

175
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:12,810
Let's go.

176
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,620
She released the martial soul herself.

177
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,340
Wu is alive.

178
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,380
I can feel it.

179
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,100
Right now,

180
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,690
she's right next to me.

181
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,410
I knew it.

182
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,340
She won't leave us like this.

183
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:33,810
San.

184
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,530
Train harder

185
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:37,168
and resurrect Wu as soon as possible.

186
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,260
I won't let her down.

187
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:03,980
Senior.

188
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,460
As promised,

189
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,930
please accept this.

190
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,980
This is...

191
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:11,216
The strength of the Tribe of Agility

192
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,192
is speed, undoubtedly.

193
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:12,912
And the weakness

194
00:12:12,928 --> 00:12:14,784
is that you're weak at
attacking and defending.

195
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:15,890
I can imagine,

196
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,380
it must be very difficult for you

197
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,640
to lead everyone in the clan

198
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,544
and gain a foothold
in the soul master world.

199
00:12:21,712 --> 00:12:23,500
Although you refused to join
the Tang Clan,

200
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,340
I sincerely respect you.

201
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,220
I made this secret weapon myself.

202
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,050
Please accept it as a token of respect.

203
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,410
Chief Tang has been intended
to gift it to me.

204
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,410
Today, I'll accept it with honor.

205
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,620
Jackpot.

206
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,890
If I get a chance,

207
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,290
I'll for sure customize a few
from the Tang Clan.

208
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,140
No problem.

209
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,980
We will sell it to the Tribe of Agility

210
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,352
with the lowest price possible.

211
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,410
Well, then,

212
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,980
thank you in advance.

213
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,860
However, I have a question.

214
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,770
You are from the Haotian Sect,

215
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,980
but why did you start a new clan?

216
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:09,312
Because of my father,
the Grand Haotian Master, Tang Hao,

217
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:10,500
was expelled from

218
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:11,424
the Haotian Sect.

219
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,810
What?

220
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,340
You're Tang Hao's son?

221
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,570
Why didn't you two old guys
tell me earlier?

222
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,340
We didn't mean to keep you in the dark.

223
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,650
You walked away

224
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,740
before we could finish.

225
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,100
Exactly.

226
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,020
You walked away.

227
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,770
Come here.

228
00:13:28,816 --> 00:13:29,890
Let me take a closer look.

229
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,024
Let me take a closer look.

230
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,530
So similar.

231
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:37,344
Exactly the same as when he was young.

232
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:38,128
But,

233
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,530
he is so much more composed

234
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,100
as compared to his father.

235
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:41,890
Yeah.

236
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,930
Young Master and his friends
have a big heart.

237
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:47,184
They always wanted to wipe out
the Martial Soul Hall.

238
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:48,980
We can only assist him wholeheartedly.

239
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:50,464
In the future, the Tang Clan

240
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,100
will make a name for themselves
in the soul master world.

241
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,460
Old White Bird,

242
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,620
didn't you always want to make

243
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,100
the Tribe of Agility
stronger and bigger?

244
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,220
Now with the secret weapon
from the Tang Clan,

245
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,380
what are you afraid of?

246
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,570
What are you afraid of?

247
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,620
Great!

248
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,170
I will join

249
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,460
the Tang Clan.

250
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,260
However,

251
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,050
under one condition.

252
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,740
You are worried about Old Goat?

253
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,740
Senior Yang isn't here yet.

254
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,460
When he arrives,

255
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,810
I'll be sure to try my best.

256
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,290
The purpose of my trip

257
00:14:28,352 --> 00:14:30,220
is to gather the four tribes
under Tang Clan.

258
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,460
I'm indebted to Old Goat.

259
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,020
Often,

260
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:39,410
the Tribe of Strength and
Tribe of Defense couldn't help me.

261
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,690
Tribe of Destruction is always
the one supporting me.

262
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,380
So we can retain our dignity.

263
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,690
If Old Goat and the Tribe of Destruction
refused to join,

264
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,500
then I'll never walk away from them.

265
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,690
You mean,

266
00:14:57,776 --> 00:15:00,144
if the Tribe of Destruction
agrees to join the Tang Clan,

267
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,260
you'll bring
the Tribe of Agility with you.

268
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,460
As long as you can convince
the Tribe of Destruction,

269
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,650
I'll have no objection.

270
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,890
However,

271
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,770
that old man is not
as easily convinced as us.

272
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,890
If you want to convince him,

273
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,890
it won't be easy.

274
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,860
Don't worry.

275
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,020
I'll do my best

276
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,290
to bring four tribes together.

277
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,690
Xiang.

278
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,050
Medicine for you.

279
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:52,690
I didn't realize you cared so much
about me.

280
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,530
You even brought me medicine.

281
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,770
Don't overthink.

282
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,696
You were injured because of me.

283
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,100
I don't want to owe you anything.

284
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,770
Thank you.

285
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:04,980
Come inside.

286
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,890
No need.

287
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,890
Rest well.

288
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,860
Bye.

289
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,500
Ma Hongjun.

290
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,050
Yes.

291
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,620
If

292
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,260
we compete again,

293
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:25,008
do you think I'll lose to you again?

294
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,930
Honest answer?

295
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,500
Of course.

296
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,020
You will.

297
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,570
You told me to be honest.

298
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,340
The master talked about this.

299
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,100
There is no solution to
bloodline suppression of martial soul.

300
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,460
You are a swallow

301
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:35,280
and I'm a phoenix.

302
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,690
Swallow?

303
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,220
I'm a Sharp-tailed Swift.

304
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,220
My apologies.

305
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,460
I'll be more specific next time.

306
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,570
Then...

307
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,460
Besides you and Tang San,

308
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,930
is everyone else so powerful too?

309
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:47,570
Let me put it this way.

310
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,100
Shrek Seven Devils.

311
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,620
Except for Wu and me,

312
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:52,320
everyone else is
a Six-Ring Soul Emperor.

313
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:58,080
Take Rongrong as an example.

314
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,690
She might look delicate,

315
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,890
but she is the heir
to the Qibao Amber Sect.

316
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,500
Also, she is the only one in their clan

317
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,770
who holds Jiubao Amber Pagoda.

318
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:09,072
She'll be more powerful than her father
in the future.

319
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,050
As for Zhuqing,

320
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,900
she's just like you.

321
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,260
She is an Agility Soul Master
with incredible speed.

322
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,120
But she belongs to
the Agility Attack Branch.

323
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,980
In terms of attacking,

324
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,500
you are no match for her.

325
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,770
And Ao.

326
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,090
Ao...

327
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:22,700
Enough!

328
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,900
Xiang.

329
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,290
Xiang.

330
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,900
Did I say something wrong again?

331
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,130
Tang San is with the Tribe of Defense?

332
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:37,940
Yes.

333
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,130
Although Tang Hao
cut ties with the Haotian Sect,

334
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,290
Tang San is
a member of the clan after all.

335
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,700
Perhaps,

336
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,448
he has been called back to the clan.

337
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,660
Now,

338
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,420
he walks around the continent
as a member of the Haotian Sect.

339
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,500
I think

340
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:52,832
we shouldn't keep him alive.

341
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,050
You want to kill him.

342
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,940
Tiandou soul master army
is practicing day and night,

343
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,260
and they will be our strongest rival
in the future.

344
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,460
In my opinion,

345
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,900
we should stop this kind of
soul master group from emerging.

346
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,770
Especially a soul master like Tang San

347
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,736
who is aiming to fight against
Martial Soul Hall.

348
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:08,048
We should get rid of them.

349
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,180
Good.

350
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,900
You're mature now.

351
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,530
However, Operation Clan Hunt

352
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,770
brings too much damage
to the Martial Soul Hall.

353
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,610
Compared to Tang San,

354
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,770
we should first deal with

355
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,940
the Tiandou soul master army.

356
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,570
Understood.

357
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,460
Master,

358
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,700
I have another request.

359
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,500
What is it?

360
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,290
When the time comes,

361
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,980
I want to deal with Tang San.

362
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:33,810
No problem.

363
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,850
Na,

364
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,220
the more you focus on someone,

365
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:42,050
the more obvious
that you can't let him go.

366
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,740
Understood.

367
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,850
That's all.

368
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,740
This is...

369
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,180
Open it.

370
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,900
Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng.

371
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,700
Good stuff.

372
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,220
The finest of herbs.

373
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,420
You're right.

374
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,660
I'm surprised.

375
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,660
You are not only strong
but also knowledgeable

376
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,610
at such a young age.

377
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,130
This stuff

378
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,530
has just been gathering dust.

379
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,260
You can keep it.

380
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,330
This

381
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,130
will come in handy later.

382
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,530
Senior,

383
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:48,940
this is too much.

384
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,700
I can't take it.

385
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
You gifted me the Godly Zhu Ge Crossbow,

386
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:53,740
and I'm giving you this.

387
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,260
Consider it as a token of appreciation.

388
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:58,220
Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng
is so precious.

389
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,224
Godly Zhu Ge Crossbow
is nothing compared to it.

390
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:00,700
Senior,

391
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,584
please take it back.

392
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,330
Kid.

393
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,260
You're as modest as your father.

394
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,330
You must accept this.

395
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,130
Consider this as a gift
from your granduncle.

396
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,370
Kid.

397
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,370
I'm your father's blood uncle,

398
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,940
naturally, I'm your granduncle.

399
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,770
What is it?

400
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,660
You knew that already?

401
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:33,850
Yes.

402
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,500
Because before I came,

403
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,980
my aunt told me everything.

404
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,770
But she was worried

405
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,288
that you wouldn't recognize me.

406
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
So she reminded me

407
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,370
to not mention it.

408
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,810
That girl.

409
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,020
She's always been smart.

410
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,500
I've never blamed

411
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,180
your father.

412
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,980
He has his reasons.

413
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,770
Seeing that he raised
a good boy like you,

414
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,500
is a great relief

415
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,180
for me.

416
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,370
What's wrong, kid?

417
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,530
Is it something I said

418
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,220
that hurt you?

419
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,740
Granduncle,

420
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,020
this is the first time I've heard

421
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,940
an elder feels sorry for my father.

422
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,220
All the elders in the clan,

423
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,180
only care if my father repents,

424
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,770
and if I'm good enough.

425
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,660
Elder Titan followed me

426
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,220
because of his loyalty to my father.

427
00:21:36,848 --> 00:21:37,760
Mr. Niu Gao

428
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:40,240
values my determination
to fight against the Martial Soul Hall.

429
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,290
And granduncle,

430
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,770
you are my family.

431
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:47,984
If you are willing to call me
your granduncle,

432
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,180
then listen to me.

433
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,180
Keep this.

434
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,020
When Old Goat is here,

435
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,610
use this against him.

436
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,850
Old Goat?

437
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,980
The chief of the Tribe of Destruction,
Yang Wudi.

438
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,660
He'll be here tomorrow.

439
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:03,344
Aunt told me,

440
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,900
that Senior Yang loves all kinds of
strange medicines and drugs.

441
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,660
That's right.

442
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,900
He is obsessed,

443
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,130
almost fanatical interest,
with developing medicine.

444
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,530
He would stay up for days
just to develop medicine.

445
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,850
So,

446
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,700
medicine will be

447
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,180
the only weakness of him.

448
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:21,570
If you want to convince him,

449
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,610
emotional and logical ways
wouldn't work.

450
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,740
You can only give it a try
with medicine.

451
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,700
That's the most possible way.

452
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,460
But granduncle...

453
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,740
Don't.

454
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:35,900
Kid,

455
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,370
I'm counting on you

456
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,660
for the future

457
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,940
of the Tribe of Agility.

458
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,370
I believe

459
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,050
you are better

460
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,090
than your father.

461
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,180
San.

462
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:03,980
We are in trouble.

463
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,260
Wu.

464
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:11,424
You ate
the Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng!

465
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,090
You planned to gift it to Senior Yang.

466
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,330
There are so many things
I could've eaten...

467
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,090
It's okay.

468
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,090
I'll explain to granduncle

469
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,290
and Elder Yang.

470
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,770
The Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng

471
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,660
is not as good as

472
00:23:30,672 --> 00:23:33,488
Decade Millennium Grade Nine
Ginseng King that can rebuild your body,

473
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,460
but still, it's a rare immortal herb.

474
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,660
Your body is so weak.

475
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,980
Can you take it?

476
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,290
I can sense

477
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,500
something strong

478
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,370
and lively in my body.

479
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,660
It means

480
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,080
the Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng

481
00:23:50,144 --> 00:23:51,460
is beneficial to my body.

482
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,330
I see.

483
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,500
You should be fine.

484
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,810
Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng
is nourishing your body,

485
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,180
making you more alive than ever.

486
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,370
San.

487
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,750
Elder Titan asked you to come and wait
for the arrival of Tribe of Destruction.

488
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:09,180
Coming.

489
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,130
I remember correctly.

490
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,940
It has been more than two hours.

491
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,740
Old Goat is not here yet.

492
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,330
Are you sure you're right?

493
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,420
I'm sure.

494
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:29,536
He told me to let you know

495
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:30,770
that he'll collect some herbs

496
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,064
and will be here in two hours.

497
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:33,700
Young Master,

498
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,130
you may get some rest.

499
00:24:35,264 --> 00:24:36,224
When they are here,

500
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,440
I'll send someone to get you.

501
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,500
It's okay.

502
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,810
I'll wait as long as I have to.

503
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,260
Old Goat is always on time.

504
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,660
Did something happen

505
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,260
on the way?

506
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,460
Where did he go to collect herbs?

507
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,770
When we were having a break

508
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,320
at the cliff outside of Longxing Town,

509
00:24:54,352 --> 00:24:55,370
he saw a piece of herb.

510
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,390
He asked me to make a move

511
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,050
and he'll come
after collecting the herb.

512
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,850
How far is the cliff from here?

513
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,260
Around...

514
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,500
Around an hour.

515
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,740
It's around the city gate.

516
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,260
Boss Dai,

517
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,610
I think it's better

518
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,810
if we look for him.

519
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,660
Let's go.

520
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,180
If anything happens,

521
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,700
we can

522
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,740
handle it too.

523
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,050
You're right.

524
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,130
Let's go.

525
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:16,700
This way.

526
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,980
Chief!

527
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,290
- Senior Yang!
- Chief!

528
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,020
We've gone far east.

529
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:28,570
Chief.

530
00:25:28,608 --> 00:25:30,048
It seems like Elder Yang is not here.

531
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,940
I wonder how's the others.

532
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,770
If Fatty is here,

533
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,330
together with Ao and San,

534
00:25:35,392 --> 00:25:37,600
they can fly and observe
from different directions.

535
00:25:37,648 --> 00:25:38,900
Maybe we'll locate him sooner.

536
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,370
Counting on him?

537
00:25:40,816 --> 00:25:42,960
I'm sure he'll be distracted
even if he's here.

538
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:44,500
He finally managed to spend some time

539
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,810
alone with his goddess.

540
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:46,530
Right?

541
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,050
He and Chenxiang

542
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,940
are buying Senior Yang's favorite food.

543
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,180
It is a good chance
to spend time together.

544
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,090
Well, I hope he can be less reckless.

545
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,530
And be more...

546
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,900
Intelligent emotionally.

547
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:00,570
Let's go.

548
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:01,770
Let's go.

549
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,500
Ao, look.

550
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,290
It's Senior Yang.

551
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:25,260
Are you the chief of
the Tribe of Destruction,

552
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,090
Yang Wudi?

553
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:29,728
(Yang Wudi, Chief
of Tribe of Destruction)

554
00:26:29,744 --> 00:26:31,056
Who are you?

555
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,020
Mr. Niu Gao is worried
about your safety,

556
00:26:34,064 --> 00:26:35,330
so he asked us to look for you.

557
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,940
Don't come closer.

558
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,260
Don't disturb my herbs.

559
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,420
Is he waiting for the flower to bloom?

560
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,220
Stay here and wait.

561
00:26:50,272 --> 00:26:50,980
Don't come over.

562
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,660
White Moon Lotus

563
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,680
can only be used as medicine
after it blooms.

564
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,570
But the soul power here is weak.

565
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,370
Senior, look.

566
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,260
The buds are still firm.

567
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:12,370
You might need to wait for a long time.

568
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,180
Senior, why don't you let me try?

569
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,420
Leave now.

570
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,220
Don't mess around!

571
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,460
Even if you're with Old Rhino,

572
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,460
I'll not let you go.

573
00:27:24,784 --> 00:27:26,016
What are you trying to do?

574
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,770
San!

575
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,090
Don't touch my herbs!

576
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:33,696
I've told you not to disturb my herbs!

577
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,900
Are you deaf?

578
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,610
It blooms.

579
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,770
You did that intentionally.

580
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,220
It takes six to ten hours

581
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,220
to bloom.

582
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,700
The weird domain of yours

583
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,330
could nourish it to grow quickly.

584
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,850
Incredible.

585
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,740
I didn't explain it to you.

586
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,810
My apologies, senior.

587
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,980
Fortunately, my Blue Silver Domain

588
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,130
is rich in vitality,

589
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,220
which happens to help it grow quickly.

590
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,570
How did Niu Gao

591
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,570
get a great disciple like you?

592
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,260
Good one.

593
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,700
Good one.

594
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,610
I don't like owing someone a favor.

595
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,700
You can ask me for a favor.

596
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:34,610
I'll try my best to fulfill it.

597
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,420
Great.

598
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,740
Then I'll just shoot.

599
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,260
I want to let you know

600
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,610
about a clan.

601
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,180
What clan?

602
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,330
Tang Clan.

603
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,220
A small clan

604
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,050
founded with the vision

605
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:48,528
to overthrow the Martial Soul Hall.

606
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,260
A young guy

607
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,460
with a big vision.

608
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,248
Overthrow the Martial Soul Hall.

609
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,850
How dare you say such big words?

610
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,500
Senior!

611
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,370
Tang San is the chief of the Tang Clan.

612
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,810
So you're not with Old Rhino.

613
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:03,810
Senior,

614
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,810
Elder Niu is now with the Tang Clan too.

615
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,290
That's right.

616
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,940
The reason I come to you

617
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,370
is to invite you to join the Tang Clan.

618
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,260
Arrogant.

619
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,850
This is getting out of line.

620
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,090
If you dare enough to lie
in front of me,

621
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,290
then show me

622
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,050
your strength.

623
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,050
Sure.

624
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,460
If you recognize that I'm strong enough,

625
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,050
I hope you will consider

626
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:29,980
my suggestion

627
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,420
to join the Tang Clan

628
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:33,090
and fight against Martial Soul Hall.

629
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,220
It's good to be ambitious.

630
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,976
But it's a shame to die
at the hands of the Martial Soul Hall

631
00:29:45,008 --> 00:29:46,896
just because of
overestimating your strength.

632
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,290
I'll do good today

633
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,260
and try to save
the lives of the young aspirants.

634
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,460
Senior.

635
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,740
Let's start.

636
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,500
(Hectomillennium Soul Ring?)

637
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:46,528
There are waves of
soul power over there.

638
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,130
Are they fighting?

639
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:48,990
Let's go check it out.

640
00:30:48,992 --> 00:30:49,552
Hurry up.

641
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,420
San!

642
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,260
Old Goat!

643
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,330
Stop!

644
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,770
Wu.

645
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,020
Wu!

San!

669

San!

670
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:29,570
San.

671
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,740
How's the Chief?

672
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,810
San, how do you feel?

673
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,330
Kid.

674
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,740
To save me,

675
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,610
Wu used the sixth soul skill again.

676
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,610
But appearing like that

677
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:48,416
will not only consume her consciousness

678
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,020
but also harm her physical.

679
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:52,980
If it's serious,

680
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,940
it'll affect her body

681
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,660
and the resurrection.

682
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,220
Indeed,

683
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,940
heroes

684
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,530
come from the youth.

685
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,130
Old Goat!

686
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,130
Old Goat!

687
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,780
Old Goat!

688
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:12,900
Old Goat!

689
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:13,920
How do you feel?

690
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,300
Old Goat!

691
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:18,980
San.

692
00:34:19,728 --> 00:34:20,820
Let me check your wound.

693
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,210
It...

694
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,020
It's completely healed.

695
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,650
This is the second skill of

696
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,100
Blue Silver Emperor Right Thighbone.

697
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,840
Even a prairie fire
can't destroy the grass,

698
00:34:30,848 --> 00:34:32,304
it grows again when the breeze blows.

699
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,420
Give the Dragon Leaf

700
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,860
to Senior Yang.

701
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,460
It'll help him regain his energy.

702
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:43,408
Alright, Young Master.

703
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,250
Wake up. Wake up.

704
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,690
Wake up.

705
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,570
Old Goat.

706
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,900
Eat the Dragon Leaf.

707
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:52,980
Eat.

708
00:34:58,592 --> 00:34:59,050
Hurry up.

709
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,820
He's better now.

710
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,020
Bring him back
and get rest.

711
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,352
- Yes, exactly.
- Hurry up.

712
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:02,940
Quick.

713
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,312
Hurry up.

714
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:03,940
Quickly.

715
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,900
Hurry up.

716
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,900
That's bad.

717
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,460
The fight

718
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,610
ruined our plan

719
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,900
to get Old Goat to join the Clan.

720
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,460
Everything's gone now.

721
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,210
No doubt.

722
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,500
Old Goat is quick-tempered,

723
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,780
and much violent compared to me.

724
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,170
Have some water.

725
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,170
I'm fine.

726
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,940
Tasty chestnut!

727
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,020
Girl, buy some.

728
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,380
Sure.

729
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:42,980
Xiang.

730
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:44,780
Candied fruit.

731
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,210
Candied fruit.

732
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,250
Water bottle.

733
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,130
Scarf.

734
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:50,020
Peach Blossom fan.

735
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,300
You've got a lot of things in this bag.

736
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,820
Of course.

737
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,610
I'll think like you and worry about

738
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,128
whatever you're worrying about.

739
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,940
Why do you even have wound medicine?

740
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,530
You gave it to me

741
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,690
so I carry it with me.

742
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,610
I don't need to be taken care of

743
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,570
so there's no need to cater to me.

744
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,300
Don't be shy.

745
00:36:18,336 --> 00:36:20,704
Caring for each other
is the principle of the Tang Clan.

746
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,210
I'll take care of you now.

747
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,730
When you're strong enough,

748
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,976
you can take care of me too.

749
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:25,500
That's it.

750
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,500
I've got everything I need.

751
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,610
I'll go first.

752
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,900
What's the rush?

753
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:36,130
There are so many foods
we haven't tried out.

754
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,050
You can enjoy it.

755
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:37,940
I'll go first.

756
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:39,730
Xiang.

757
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,610
Stop following me.

758
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,380
Fatty.

759
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,780
We have been following him

760
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:52,860
but he made no progress.

761
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,090
He's always clinging to that girl,

762
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,690
so I can't do anything.

763
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,050
We have to.

764
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,020
Ma Hongjun.

765
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,500
Stop following me.

766
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,610
I can't do that.

767
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,780
I have a mission.

768
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,460
Longxing Town is not safe.

769
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,420
I have to protect you.

770
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:13,980
No need.

771
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,090
Let me carry.

772
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,780
The Tribe of Agility
is weak at attacking,

773
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,250
but it doesn't mean we can't fight.

774
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,530
That's not what I meant, Xiang.

775
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,380
I'm trying to say...

776
00:37:26,688 --> 00:37:27,980
Look what you did to my clothes!

777
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:28,690
Stop!

778
00:37:28,864 --> 00:37:29,420
Stand there!

779
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,130
You!

780
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:31,488
Running?

781
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,650
Elephant Armored Tribe again.

782
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:33,660
Look what you've done!

783
00:37:33,696 --> 00:37:34,800
Why don't you run away now?

784
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,250
I'm not running.

785
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,460
Cut the crap!

786
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,780
Let me.

787
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,250
Are you okay?

788
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:42,820
Stand up.

789
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,340
I'm fine.

790
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,420
Thank you.

791
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,650
In broad daylight,

792
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:51,920
you're too much of a bully!

793
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,250
Listen here,

794
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,610
mind your own business.

795
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,340
That beggar got my clothes dirty.

796
00:37:57,616 --> 00:37:58,940
I just beat him up a few times.

797
00:37:59,056 --> 00:38:00,624
That's considered a light punishment.

798
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,690
How much money do you want

799
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,928
for making your clothes dirty?

800
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,300
This is new clothes.

801
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,820
If you want to pay in silver soul coins,

802
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,250
at least five!

803
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,780
Five?

804
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,096
You'd better be a robber for that!

805
00:38:12,144 --> 00:38:13,552
The clothes aren't worth that much.

806
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,340
Xiang.

807
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,420
(Gentleman)
Both of you are peace lovers indeed.

808
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,500
Too bad,

809
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,570
you misunderstood.

810
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,730
We're not saying five silver soul coins.

811
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,380
We're saying fifty.

812
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,250
Well, it's been a while,

813
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,690
losers.

814
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,690
Why?

815
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,860
Need a spanking?

816
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,820
Do you want to have a taste of
your ass burning again?

817
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:41,900
That's too much.

818
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,380
Are you okay?

819
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,130
What happened?

820
00:38:59,568 --> 00:39:00,784
He's not going to make it.

821
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,650
Enough?

822
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,250
You...

823
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,420
This is specially prepared for you.

824
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,940
Once you use your soul power,

825
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:07,860
you'll be poisoned.

826
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:08,860
Nice one.

827
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,250
You...

828
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,460
Are you shocked?

829
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,300
I knew you were a bad guy.

830
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,940
Poisoning?

831
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,820
I bet you didn't know

832
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,460
that I have the antidote.

833
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,210
I'm just messing with you.

834
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,050
Antidote?

835
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,020
Antidote?

836
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,120
Who gave him the antidote?

837
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:34,112
That's not possible.

838
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,210
Go!

839
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:42,730
Let's go.

840
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,460
That guy.

841
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:00,820
He tricked us.

842
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:01,980
We've been tricked.

843
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,300
This guy.

844
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,420
He can't get far.

845
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,690
Chase after him!

846
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,090
Ma Hongjun.

847
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:14,130
Where is the antidote?

848
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,530
Give me the antidote!

849
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,900
You are poisoned.

850
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:18,940
Just now...

851
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,170
There's no antidote.

852
00:40:22,352 --> 00:40:24,210
I used my soul power
to suppress the poison

853
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,250
and fool them.

854
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,020
To buy us time to escape.

855
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:30,820
Run.

856
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,020
If you hadn't

857
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,250
stopped the beggar,

858
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,780
I'd be the one who got poisoned.

859
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:43,940
It's okay.

860
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,170
I'm quite comfortable now.

861
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,530
At least we don't have to
keep a distance now.

862
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,250
You...

863
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,250
Stand right there!

864
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,300
Stop!

865
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,210
Where is he?

866
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,020
They are gone.

867
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:55,530
No idea.

868
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,380
Split up!

869
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,380
Go after them!

870
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,130
They are gone.

871
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,340
That's quick.

872
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,570
Come back.

873
00:41:30,944 --> 00:41:31,980
Is everyone tired?

874
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,380
Let's see

875
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,050
if there's any fruit around.

876
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,050
Stay here.

877
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:41,650
Ma...

878
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,530
Ma Hongjun.

879
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,690
Ma Hongjun.

880
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,130
I knew you were faking.

881
00:42:05,136 --> 00:42:06,416
It's good that you are poisoned.

882
00:42:06,432 --> 00:42:07,824
I like to take advantage of people.

883
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,900
Have a taste of our power!

884
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:10,980
Let's do it.

885
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,730
You fatty!

886
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,690
You're doomed.

887
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,250
Ouch!

888
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:46,780
Ma Hongjun.

889
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,570
Ma Hongjun.

890
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,500
Are you okay?

891
00:42:48,656 --> 00:42:49,730
Why are you still here?

892
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,048
The Tribe of Agility will not leave
our companion behind.

893
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,460
Isn't he got poisoned?

894
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,250
He is.

895
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,080
What's happening?

896
00:42:56,144 --> 00:42:56,500
Brother.

897
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:57,860
Xiang.

898
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,170
Don't worry about me.

899
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,820
Get out of here.

900
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,072
You should lose some weight.

901
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,130
Also,

902
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,380
my name is Bai Chenxiang,

903
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,210
not Xiang.

904
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:04,730
Brother.

905
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:05,860
Tian Ya.

906
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,420
Tian Ya, stop them.

907
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:20,860
