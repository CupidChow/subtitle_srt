=The Land of Warriors=

24
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from
Tangjia Sanshao's novel "Soul Land")

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,940
=Episode 15=

26
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,020
It's a 10,000-year soul ring.

27
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,420
Wu, your transformation is successful.

28
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,300
But it was too risky this time.

29
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,224
Sorry for making both of you worried.

30
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,700
We were not the only ones.

31
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,050
Tang San was pretty worried too.

32
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,696
The Blue Silver Plants
around us were so frantic

33
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,760
that they were about
to spring out of the ground.

34
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,330
But Tang San seems to be quite capable.

35
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:58,384
He could actually help you
through the Blue Silver Bracelet.

36
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,980
I

37
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,860
can admire him a little for a while.

38
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,260
It's all thanks to him.

39
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,260
Otherwise,

40
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,100
I would remain trapped in the nightmare,

41
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,020
unable to break free.

42
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,890
You clearly underwent the trial yourself

43
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,580
for the soul ring conversion.

44
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,450
You can't succeed by relying on others.

45
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,890
Daming appears to be stubborn

46
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:27,170
but he's soft on the inside.

47
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,610
What a miserable scream.

48
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,930
What happened?

49
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,610
Those scums from the Martial Soul Hall

50
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:52,192
actually triggered a beast horde.

51
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:53,580
I'm sure Xingdou Forest is now

52
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,860
in complete chaos.

53
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,610
But

54
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,210
the beast horde made
the Martial Soul Hall hesitate.

55
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,260
They never appeared again after that.

56
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,380
No, they were here for me.

57
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:04,930
They will find a chance to return.

58
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,300
Xingdou Forest cannot afford

59
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,688
to experience another beast horde.

60
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:09,890
I need to find a way.

61
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,450
Your Highnesses.

62
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:18,112
That's all for today's training.

63
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,136
Get some proper rest.

64
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,580
Zhuqing.

65
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,180
If San and the rest are here,

66
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:52,832
San would be in charge of controlling,

67
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,210
Fatty and I on attack,

68
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,650
Ao and Rongrong as support.

69
00:04:55,888 --> 00:04:57,328
Two Soul Saints would mean nothing.

70
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,330
I'd be fine even

71
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:00,144
if two more showed up.

72
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,620
Your Highness, you're sure impressive.

73
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,260
You're even looking for help
with your training?

74
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:13,330
I'm serious about bringing them here.

75
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,180
If the Seven Devils gather,

76
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,580
it will be of great help

77
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,740
to Xingluo's future.

78
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,232
I have it all planned.

79
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,650
When we meet again,

80
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,384
I'll use my position as the Crown Prince

81
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,970
to invite them officially.

82
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:25,210
I will give them the best...

83
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,210
Let's not think

84
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,330
about something too far in the future.

85
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,970
We can think about the future

86
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:33,088
after we honor our promise
to His Majesty.

87
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:34,890
Zhuqing,

88
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:36,272
is there anything wrong?

89
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,330
Report!

90
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:42,330
Your Highness.

91
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:44,770
This is our training ground.

92
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,620
Who says you can barge in?

93
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,380
Your Highness,

94
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:48,720
someone intrude into the palace.

95
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:49,820
I really have no other way.

96
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,020
You can report this

97
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,672
to the Commander of the Imperial Guard.

98
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:53,580
Why did you come here?

99
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,650
But that person insisted

100
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,608
that he is a close friend
of Your Highnesses.

101
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:57,890
So we dare not act recklessly.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,768
So we could only...

103
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,940
Let me go!

104
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,820
Release me!

105
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,180
Boss Dai!

106
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,060
Zhuqing!

107
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,180
Help me!

108
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:18,380
- Fatty?
- Fatty?

109
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,700
Satisfying.

110
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,330
Absolutely satisfying.

111
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,740
This is the best meal I've had

112
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,380
since leaving the academy.

113
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:34,208
It looks like Mr. Flander can't afford
to feed you

114
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,380
and throw you out.

115
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,450
The dean may be stingy.

116
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:39,648
But not to the point
where he won't let you eat.

117
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,968
I bet it's mostly
because Fatty was sloppy in his training

118
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,360
and a bad influence on the juniors.

119
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:44,090
So Ms. Erlong

120
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,620
just tossed him out, right?

121
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,210
Am I, Ma Hongjun,
the mighty Evil Phoenix,

122
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,060
not allowed to travel the continent,

123
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,140
do some good deeds,

124
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,290
and care for the world?

125
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,216
Of course, you can.

126
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,060
But how come a chivalrous hero

127
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,090
like you arrived here all tied up?

128
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,020
Covered in dirt.

129
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,740
Looking completely helpless.

130
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,330
Stop completing each other's sentences.

131
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,260
If I weren't afraid of ruining

132
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,820
the Xingluo royal family's reputation,

133
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,290
I would have beaten those guards

134
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,330
into a pulp.

135
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,940
We have laws in Xingluo.

136
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:12,700
If you were imprisoned
because of a fight,

137
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,770
Mubai and I can't help you.

138
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,140
I see.

139
00:07:17,424 --> 00:07:19,620
Returning to the royal family
sure has changed you.

140
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,330
I am left to fend for myself.

141
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:22,740
Fine.

142
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:23,890
I'll leave.

143
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,380
I can just leave now.

144
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,860
After taking advantage
of Xingluo's free meal,

145
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:30,240
you can't just leave as you wish.

146
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:31,090
You have to stay here

147
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,500
and be my attendant for a month

148
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,530
to cover this meal.

149
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,740
To be honest,

150
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,940
I do have some important news

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,820
that could be at least worth
a hundred meals.

152
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,020
Have San and Wu returned?

153
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,140
Well, no.

154
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,140
When I left,

155
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,696
there was still no news about them.

156
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:51,250
Then what kind of important information

157
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,840
do you have?

158
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,530
I risked my life to obtain it.

159
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,530
Can you guess

160
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,330
who has come to Xingluo City?

161
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,410
Who?

162
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,180
Grand Chrysanthemum Master.

163
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,180
Bi Bi Dong's subordinate,
Grand Chrysanthemum Master?

164
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,330
Yes.

165
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,450
How did you find out?

166
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,330
Where is he now?

167
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,410
Well, this is what happened.

168
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,100
During my travels,

169
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,650
I suddenly realized that people from

170
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,250
from Martial Soul Hall
in various cities

171
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:38,096
were recruiting high-level soul masters.

172
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,180
I felt something was off

173
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,020
so I pretended to respond
to the recruitment

174
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,140
and followed all the way

175
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,140
to Xingluo City.

176
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:48,560
What are you looking around for?

177
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,220
Your full name?

178
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:50,740
Ma...

179
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,770
Yingjun.

180
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,380
Ma Yingjun.

181
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,500
Ma'am,

182
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,050
didn't the recruitment state

183
00:08:58,064 --> 00:09:00,560
we're here to be a teacher
at Xingluo City's Martial Soul Hall?

184
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
Why are there so many soul masters here?

185
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,380
Is there another round of elimination?

186
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:07,040
Don't pry into matters
that don't concern you.

187
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,500
Write down your name,

188
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:09,140
martial soul,

189
00:09:09,168 --> 00:09:10,480
and the level of your soul power.

190
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,980
(Ma Yingjun)

191
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:22,512
(Ma Yingjun with Earth Dragon. 69 Soul Emperor)
Miss,

192
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,340
I have three generations

193
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,380
who are depending on me.

194
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,020
I came all the way here.

195
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:28,620
I won't be eliminated, right?

196
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,770
Since you're here,

197
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:31,824
there's naturally something
for you to do.

198
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,050
Enough talking.

199
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,530
Or else

200
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:36,208
you wouldn't know when you're dead.

201
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,570
Turn this way.

202
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,930
From now on,

203
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,530
you're a part of the Martial Soul Hall
in Xingluo City.

204
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:52,384
Next, you all need to prepare
for the intensive training.

205
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,620
I don't care where you're from

206
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,740
or why you're here.

207
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,890
All you need to remember is

208
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,930
to serve Her Holiness to the death.

209
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:05,312
This way, please.

210
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:08,220
(Grand Chrysanthemum Master?)

211
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,500
(Why is he here?)

212
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:14,000
I ate something bad
that upset my stomach.

213
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:15,184
I need to go to the toilet.

214
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,290
Thanks.

215
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,740
Why the sudden turn of events?

216
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,740
It's not sudden.

217
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:40,384
Her Holiness has waited many years

218
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,824
for this day to come.

219
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,890
Distribute the armors I brought.

220
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Act according
to Her Holiness' instructions.

221
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,170
Yes.

222
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,020
Then we...

223
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:49,810
Sir.

224
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,460
I... I'm here to serve tea.

225
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,980
You're very skilled.

226
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,410
I have learned some manners

227
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,770
from the pig... Pig-headed...

228
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,170
I mean the esteemed masters.

229
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,340
Yes.

230
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,530
He's considered
an appropriately trained servant.

231
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,380
Raise your head.

232
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:29,530
You...

233
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,890
Forgive me, sir.

234
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,170
I was bullied as a child

235
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,220
and got hurt in my face.

236
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,930
Thankfully the Martial Soul Hall
didn't mind my humble background

237
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,770
and took me in.

238
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,530
Get out.

239
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,890
Yes, of course.

240
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,410
Grand Chrysanthemum Master
sent so much armors.

241
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,020
They must be up to no good.

242
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,570
You burned all those armors?

243
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,810
What do you say?

244
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,890
Is this information worth 100 meals?

245
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,500
Yes.

246
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:39,840
It's more than worth it.

247
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,530
Fatty,

248
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,140
this information is very important.

249
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,930
I didn't expect after so long,

250
00:12:43,984 --> 00:12:45,264
you've made such great progress.

251
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,328
You even know
how to analyze problems yourself now.

252
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:48,260
Well, of course.

253
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:50,592
Do you think
I've been traveling around aimlessly

254
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:51,570
these past few months?

255
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,320
There were soul masters disappearing
for no reason before.

256
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:56,368
Now, the Martial Soul Hall
is recruiting soldiers.

257
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,410
Could these two things

258
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,740
be related?

259
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,410
It's still uncertain for now.

260
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,380
But the Martial Soul Hall

261
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,936
is secretly training soul masters here.

262
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,088
So there's something wrong.

263
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,170
No, that's not right.

264
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,260
They're not training
ordinary soul masters,

265
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,770
but an army of soul masters.

266
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,460
Fatty,

267
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,380
you have to come with me.

268
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,050
Why?

269
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,740
This matter is still up in the air.

270
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,240
So we need to investigate further.

271
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:21,232
After it gets dark,

272
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,530
take us to the Martial Soul Hall.

273
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:23,770
Once everything is clear,

274
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,100
we'll report it to Father.

275
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,340
I knew it.

276
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,860
There's no free lunch
at the Xingluo royal family.

277
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,890
Here, enjoy your food.

278
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,340
Have some more.

279
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,020
Enjoy it.

280
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,860
I want chicken.

281
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,340
Here you go.

282
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,810
This too.

283
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,740
You can all leave now.

284
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,460
Why did you suddenly summon

285
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,280
the heads of the Martial Soul Hall
from all cities to Martial Soul City?

286
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,530
You sure are well-informed.

287
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,770
Answer me.

288
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,020
Don't forget your place.

289
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,260
It is not your place to meddle

290
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,340
in what I want to do.

291
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,272
You're gathering soul masters all over

292
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:06,416
and urgently summoning
the leaders of each hall.

293
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,920
This will definitely attract attention.

294
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:10,288
You cannot underestimate
Tiandou and Xingluo's strength.

295
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,650
I need to know your plan.

296
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,340
What you need to do is stay

297
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,020
within the Tiandou royal family,

298
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,890
and cooperate when I require it.

299
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,770
The rest is not for you to question.

300
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,170
The Emperor of Tiandou
won't last much longer.

301
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,536
Whatever it is you plan to do,

302
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,410
you can wait.

303
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,460
Not bad.

304
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,100
Your soul power has increased.

305
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,980
But that doesn't mean

306
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,770
you can challenge me.

307
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,530
Don't forget why

308
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,690
I sent you to infiltrate
the Tiandou royal family.

309
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,170
Without my summon,

310
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:48,260
do not show up here.

311
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,530
(Could this small village used to be)

312
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,260
(the greatest sect in the world?)

313
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,380
Old fella, why are you here

314
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,740
and why are you wearing a mask?

315
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:28,930
Old fella?

316
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:32,810
Are you talking to me?

317
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:36,170
All right, then.

318
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:37,616
You can call me whatever you want.

319
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,340
Kid,

320
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,570
can you tell me

321
00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:40,890
the way to the Haotian Sect?

322
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,020
I've never heard of it.

323
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,890
This can't be.

324
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,890
This map is accurate.

325
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,890
Where did you get this map?

326
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,570
Do you recognize this map?

327
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,410
Run for it! Quick, run!

328
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,220
Hurry up, run!

329
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,860
Kid,

330
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,020
return the map to me.

331
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,860
I'll return it to you if you come here.

332
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,020
If you don't return it to me,

333
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,500
this old fella is going to spank you.

334
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,196
- Come on.
- We're waiting.

335
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,570
- Come up here.
- Come and hit me.

336
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,930
Come and spank me.

337
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:25,650
- Come up here.
- Come and spank me.

338
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,810
Come on!

339
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,020
I see. You dare to make fun of me.

340
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:31,890
Come on, let's go.

341
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,570
Get someone here.

342
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,220
With them keeping watch

343
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,170
across Xingdou Forest,

344
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,590
you will receive a warning from them

345
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:53,990
when a large number of soul masters

346
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:55,664
from the Martial Soul Hall come again.

347
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,570
When that happens,
evacuate the soul beasts

348
00:16:57,728 --> 00:16:59,472
to avoid triggering
a larger beast horde.

349
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,530
After arranging this plan,

350
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,020
are you going to leave again?

351
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,090
I...

352
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,530
Wu...

353
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,810
She should leave anyway.

354
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,370
She's always talking about Tang San,

355
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,136
thinking about him day and night.

356
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:15,370
Leaving here means
she can reunite with him.

357
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:16,810
Besides, Wu hasn't reached

358
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,260
the six-ring Mature Phase yet.

359
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,810
Leaving this chaotic Xingdou Forest

360
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,984
and staying out of trouble

361
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,980
might not be a bad idea.

362
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,570
Erming,

363
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,330
you've just said

364
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,740
that Xingdou Forest is in chaos now.

365
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,180
How can I leave?

366
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,460
Really?

367
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,792
You're not leaving anymore?

368
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,700
The Martial Soul Hall is here
because of me.

369
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,536
I'm also responsible
for the beast horde.

370
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:38,660
I would never leave

371
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,500
when Xingdou Forest

372
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,940
is in such chaos.

373
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,700
Then what do you plan to do?

374
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,370
I need to visit the peripheral area
and mixed zone first

375
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:49,104
before figuring out what to do next.

376
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:49,850
Wu,

377
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,050
I'll go with you.

378
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,220
You cannot.

379
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,980
Don't forget
you're a Hectomillennium Fierce Beast.

380
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,050
One roar from you,

381
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,872
the soul beasts
will be trembling with fear.

382
00:17:58,016 --> 00:17:59,872
Then I won't be able
to get any information.

383
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,700
My throat is so completely hoarse

384
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,770
that I can't even roar.

385
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,180
Just bring me with you.

386
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,370
Erming,

387
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,940
you cannot cough

388
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,020
if your throat is hoarse.

389
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,980
Both of you can rest assured.

390
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,330
I've advanced to Soul King.

391
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,328
I'm quite strong now.

392
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,330
Wu,

393
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:24,672
remember to have the skylark
to deliver a message

394
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,500
if you're in danger.

395
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,700
Please be extremely careful.

396
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,180
This way. Come this way.

397
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,220
Tang Long,

398
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,770
over here.

399
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,740
He's right here.

400
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,180
All right.

401
00:18:51,216 --> 00:18:51,936
You can go now.

402
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,370
(Tang Long, Haotian Sect Disciple)

403
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,220
Where did you get

404
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:01,850
this thing?

405
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,770
You took my map.

406
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,224
Shouldn't you introduce yourself

407
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,680
before asking me anything?

408
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,944
I don't want to hurt you.

409
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,090
I'll be keeping this map.

410
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,020
You can leave.

411
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,740
We don't welcome outsiders here.

412
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,050
I'm not an outsider.

413
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,810
I only want to go home.

414
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,850
Choosing the hard way, huh?

415
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,660
Then don't blame me for being rude.

416
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,770
Does this help

417
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:29,980
to prove it?

418
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,900
(Tang Tian, Haotian Sect Disciple)

419
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:33,850
Which family are you from?

420
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,330
Take off your mask

421
00:19:35,392 --> 00:19:36,608
and let me see you clearly.

422
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,420
My Aunt is Tang Yuehua.

423
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,290
She asks me to come home.

424
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:42,480
(Tang Yu, Disciple)
You're...

425
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:43,488
You're Tang San?

426
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,770
After all this, it turns out to be you.

427
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:54,000
Second Aunt couldn't stop praising you

428
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,130
when she came back.

429
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,610
She said you're even stronger than Long.

430
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,900
Enough chattering.

431
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,016
You can return to the sect.

432
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,090
But if you're truly the son of Tang Hao,

433
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,460
the sinner,

434
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,660
you must be shackled.

435
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,460
Follow me.

436
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:28,850
Keep up!

437
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,660
Long doesn't seem

438
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,130
to like Tang San.

439
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,020
Of course.

440
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:40,980
Think about it.

441
00:20:40,992 --> 00:20:43,230
Second Aunt has been praising Long
since he was a kid.

442
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,220
Now, here comes Tang San,

443
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,420
who excels in everything.

444
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,120
If I were him,
I wouldn't be happy either.

445
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,640
Can we still catch up with them?

446
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,032
We have to catch up either way.

447
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,968
If we don't,
Long will surely lecture us.

448
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,810
We better hurry.

449
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,740
(This Haotian Sect disciple's footwork)

450
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:40,704
(is indeed the same as Father's.)

451
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,580
(Haotian Sect)

452
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,420
Tang Yu!

453
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,180
Tang Tian!

454
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,020
Are you all right, Tang Yu?

455
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,500
What about you, Tang Tian?

456
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:27,460
I'm all right, Long.

457
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:28,330
Where's Tang San?

458
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,090
Good lad.

459
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,370
I will remember

460
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,848
this debt of gratitude.

461
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,180
Big Brother,

462
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,850
can you be gentler

463
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,272
with your punch next time?

464
00:24:48,544 --> 00:24:49,460
It's pretty painful.

465
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,020
You're not wrong for addressing me that.

466
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,568
My name is Tang Long.

467
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,330
I'm the oldest in our generation.

468
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,570
They are Tang Tian and Tang Yu.

469
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,940
You have saved their lives this time.

470
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,104
I'm really grateful for your help.

471
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,420
We're family.

472
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,610
There's no need to thank me.

473
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:07,376
Aunt said you have Twin Martial Souls.

474
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,740
Was that your main martial soul,

475
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,770
the Blue Silver Plant?

476
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,610
Second Aunt spoke so highly of you.

477
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,420
I had my doubts at first.

478
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:16,420
Now,

479
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,568
I'm really convinced.

480
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,220
Let's go.

481
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:20,928
The sect is right up there.

482
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:32,770
Come on.

483
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:49,740
(Father,)

484
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,460
(I'm home.)

485
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:53,088
This must be your first home.

486
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,090
Hurry,

487
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:55,440
take out our sect's token,

488
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:56,320
and open the door.

489
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:56,810
Token?

490
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:57,980
What token?

491
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,180
Only direct disciples of our sect

492
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,760
are allowed to enter with the token.

493
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:02,810
The outer disciples

494
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,830
are all in the village
at the foot of the mountain.

495
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,220
(The token of a direct disciple?)

496
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,130
(Could it be...)

497
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:29,900
Let's go.

498
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:01,728
This is the front courtyard.

499
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:03,570
It's only used
when the sect master calls

500
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,260
for an assembly.

501
00:27:04,512 --> 00:27:05,984
The back courtyard is even bigger.

502
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,980
That's where we train.

503
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:10,850
Our sect values practical combat.

504
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,848
Under the supervision of the Elders,

505
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,304
the disciples undergo combat training

506
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,248
to determine rankings

507
00:27:15,312 --> 00:27:16,112
based on strength.

508
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:18,096
Since you're very skilled,

509
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,570
how about a spar

510
00:27:19,616 --> 00:27:20,624
with the top disciple?

511
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,050
I will spar with Big Brother
another day.

512
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,530
The top disciple

513
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,330
is Tang Hu.

514
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,570
I've lost to him several times

515
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:30,770
for the top rank.

516
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,832
You must be careful of him.

517
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,740
In the sect,

518
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,330
you cannot hold back.

519
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,744
Thank you for the advice, Big Brother.

520
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,050
Let's go report to the Chief.

521
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,980
He'll be very surprised to see you.

522
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,420
Tang Tian.

523
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,090
Tang Yu.

524
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,500
Tell Fourth Uncle

525
00:27:44,544 --> 00:27:46,912
about the Iron Cable Bridge.
Don't delay this matter.

526
00:27:46,944 --> 00:27:48,080
- All right.
- All right.

527
00:27:49,616 --> 00:27:50,544
This way, please.

528
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,130
Let's go.

529
00:27:57,296 --> 00:27:58,336
Please head inside.

530
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,968
Thank you very much.

531
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,420
Aunt.

532
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,570
San.

533
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,100
(Tang Xiao, Head of Haotian Sect)

534
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,180
You're Tang San?

535
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,370
I, Tang San,

536
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,500
greet the Chief.

537
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:10,900
Brother!

538
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,290
Under such immense soul power pressure
from me,

539
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,530
you remain completely unharmed.

540
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,810
San, what are you doing?

541
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:41,900
It's my obligation as a son

542
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:43,460
to repay my father's debt.

543
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,232
I'm willing to bear the responsibility
on my father's behalf.

544
00:29:47,776 --> 00:29:49,050
Are you capable of bearing it?

545
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,500
I don't know if I can bear it.

546
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,370
But I'm willing to do my best

547
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,900
to shoulder the responsibilities
my father owed to the sect,

548
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:13,090
hoping to make amends
for the harm he caused.

549
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,700
Get up.

550
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,850
How could you

551
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,370
let a child carry your responsibilities?

552
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,776
How long are you going
to keep running away,

553
00:30:33,824 --> 00:30:35,050
at fifty years old?

554
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,500
Chief,

555
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
Father isn't running.

556
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,020
He just felt
he could no longer face the sect,

557
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,260
which is why he sent me back
to return to our roots

558
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:44,992
and submit to the sect's decisions.

559
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,850
Return to the roots.

560
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,130
That's easier said than done.

561
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,370
The elders of the clan

562
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,940
can't forgive your father,

563
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,610
nor will they accept you.

564
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,850
Your aunt and I will do our best
to make it happen.

565
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,370
But the outcome

566
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:05,900
may not be as we wish.

567
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,850
Father asked me to bring these back.

568
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,770
He said

569
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,940
this is the only thing
he can do for the sect.

570
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,020
Tang Hao...

571
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,330
Tang Hao, he...

572
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:36,940
Brother,

573
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,530
Second Brother forcibly removed
his soul bones

574
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,330
from his body.

575
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,900
(I owe the sect these two soul bones.)

576
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,610
(I have failed the Haotian Sect.)

577
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,256
(Please return them on my behalf.)

578
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,020
Father,

579
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,940
why don't you go see Uncle yourself?

580
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,460
I want to spend my remaining years

581
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,660
with your mother.

582
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,460
Father returned the soul bones
to the sect,

583
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,260
hoping that it would calm

584
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,290
some anger toward him.

585
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,336
It's also a closure for him
after fulfilling the responsibilities

586
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,180
he left undone.

587
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,220
So Chief...

588
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,050
After this,

589
00:33:04,928 --> 00:33:06,370
you can address me as your Uncle.

590
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,810
Uncle.

591
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,770
How is

592
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,500
your father now?

593
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,568
When Father severed his limbs,

594
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,850
he forced the stagnated blood
into the limbs,

595
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,728
temporarily freeing himself
from the torment of his old injuries.

596
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,980
Now, he and my mother

597
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,420
are recovering slowly
at the Ice Fire Mouth Spring.

598
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,260
Uncle, don't worry.

599
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,500
Your mother?

600
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,570
(After Mother passed away,)

601
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:44,576
(she transformed
into the Blue Silver Plant.)

602
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,900
(Father stays by her side every day,)

603
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,496
(planning to live out
the rest of his life with her.)

604
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,770
Perhaps,

605
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,900
this is the best end for him.

606
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,650
San?

607
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,460
Is that what your father calls you?

608
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,690
Actually, your father only did

609
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,610
what any father or husband

610
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,730
would do.

611
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:32,940
So

612
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,170
no matter what others say in the future,

613
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,170
I don't want this

614
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,170
to become your burden.

615
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,050
Doing your best for the sect

616
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,210
is what you must do.

617
00:34:44,528 --> 00:34:46,170
It's not to repay what your father owes.

618
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,650
It's

619
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,090
because you are a part of the sect.

620
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:53,730
Uncle.

621
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,500
Yuehua,

622
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,420
tomorrow we'll hold the ceremony
for San to formally rejoin the sect.

623
00:35:01,712 --> 00:35:03,120
You will handle the arrangement.

624
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,820
Do we need

625
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,380
to inform the elders about this?

626
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,530
After all...

627
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:09,820
Why not

628
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,210
just be upfront about it?

629
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:16,980
San, remember this.

630
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,250
In the Haotian Sect,

631
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,344
only power gives you the right to speak.

632
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,500
If you want to earn their approval,

633
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,300
you must prove it to them

634
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,900
with your power.

635
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,210
I have two words for you.

636
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,860
Be firm.

637
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:45,440
Aunt, you wanted to see me at this hour.

638
00:35:45,472 --> 00:35:47,360
Is it because you have
something to tell me?

639
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,530
San,

640
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,090
do you see that?

641
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,730
What are those?

642
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,020
The Haotian Sect disciples
who died at the hands

643
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,300
of the Martial Soul Hall.

644
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,940
The Haotian Sect,
once the leader of the Upper Three Sects

645
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,610
is now in such a dire state

646
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,780
after facing the Martial Soul Hall.

647
00:36:17,904 --> 00:36:19,530
It's even worse for the smaller sects

648
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,500
on the continent now.

649
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,820
At that time,

650
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,688
the Martial Soul Hall pressured
the Haotian Sect,

651
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,420
threatening the sect's survival.

652
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,210
That's why we had no choice

653
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,650
but to cut ties with your father.

654
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,610
The decline of the Haotian Sect

655
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,090
also began at that very moment.

656
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,170
San,

657
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,730
do you know
about the Four Single Attribute Tribes?

658
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,250
Father told me

659
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,610
they are divided into Strength,
Defense, Agility, and Destruction.

660
00:37:05,584 --> 00:37:07,952
When the Martial Soul Hall
couldn't find the Haotian Sect,

661
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,940
they began to harass the four tribes.

662
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,610
In the beginning,

663
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,250
the disciples of the Haotian Sect
went to provide support.

664
00:37:14,736 --> 00:37:16,940
But after the former Supreme Pontiff,
Qian Xun Ji died

665
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,096
and Bi Bi Dong took over,

666
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,872
their methods became even more ruthless.

667
00:37:20,176 --> 00:37:21,940
We were forced
to withdraw from the world

668
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,460
and preserve our strength.

669
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,090
After that,

670
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,860
the Four Single Attribute Tribes
gradually dispersed

671
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,256
without the protection
of the Haotian Sect.

672
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,020
For all these years,

673
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,500
Father has felt deeply guilty

674
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:37,280
toward the Four Single Attribute Tribes.

675
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,730
If there's a chance,

676
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:41,376
I'd like to reunite the four tribes.

677
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,570
But this time,

678
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,530
I won't abandon them.

679
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,570
Also...

680
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,690
Other than returning to the clan,

681
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,940
did Second Brother ask you
to do something else?

682
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,210
Father hopes that I can...

683
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:57,888
Pay respect to your grandfather
on my behalf

684
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,460
and also send my regards to your uncle.

685
00:38:02,336 --> 00:38:04,320
I also want
to give the Haotian Sect an answer

686
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:05,610
on behalf of Father,

687
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,528
to fulfill those responsibilities
he couldn't complete.

688
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:19,472
Back then,
your grandfather was seriously ill.

689
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,690
After being overwhelmed by the shock,

690
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,650
he passed away.

691
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,650
Apart from that,

692
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,980
we've lost many disciples.

693
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,130
The elders blame

694
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,570
every of this incident

695
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,650
on your father.

696
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:34,912
So if you want to pay respects
to your grandfather on his behalf,

697
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,610
it won't be an easy task.

698
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,820
My mother may be a soul beast.

699
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,900
But Father cherishes us.

700
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,420
The fault is not his.

701
00:38:46,352 --> 00:38:48,048
It's all the Martial Soul Hall's fault.

702
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,940
But it doesn't matter what you think.

703
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,020
What matters is what the elders think.

704
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,820
The Haotian Sect has split
into two factions.

705
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,900
The faction led by your uncle believes

706
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,530
that the past mistake

707
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,860
was not your father's fault.

708
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,690
Everything was because
of the Martial Soul Hall's tyranny.

709
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,130
They've lost Qian Xun Ji.

710
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,500
You've lost your mother.

711
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,860
But the other faction

712
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,690
is led by several elders.

713
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,650
They believe

714
00:39:16,144 --> 00:39:17,730
your father abandoned the sect,

715
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,900
which led to the sect's crisis.

716
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,900
The son of the Seventh Elder

717
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,820
is buried in this graveyard.

718
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,464
Aunt, don't worry.

719
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,500
I know my return to the clan
will face a lot of opposition.

720
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:36,860
But

721
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,650
I will do my best tomorrow.

722
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,020
San,

723
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,940
no matter what your uncle says,

724
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,530
I hope you will act
within your abilities.

725
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,050
Put yourself first

726
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,900
and don't force anything.

727
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,610
No matter what I face tomorrow,

728
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,730
I will prove to them

729
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:54,032
that I will become a strong person.

730
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,050
I will have the power to avenge

731
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,576
my mother, my loved ones, and my sect.

732
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,730
I will help the sect regain
its former glory.

733
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,420
(Xiao Wu,)

734
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,820
(today I finally realized
the responsibility I bear.)

735
00:40:08,528 --> 00:40:09,900
(Mother didn't have the chance)

736
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,340
(to return to the sect with Father.)

737
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,690
(I hope that one day,)

738
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,050
(you can accompany me back.)

739
00:40:20,516 --> 00:40:24,180
(Martial Soul Hall, Xingluo City)

740
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:47,730
I set fire to the warehouse

741
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,760
in the back courtyard
where they store the armors.

742
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,032
There's the front courtyard
where they train soul masters.

743
00:40:52,064 --> 00:40:53,600
Something is definitely off there too.

744
00:40:55,216 --> 00:40:56,480
We should go in and investigate.

745
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,808
Go to the entrance and act as bait

746
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,328
to draw away the guards' attention.

747
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,496
That's a great idea.

748
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:01,530
Boss Dai,

749
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,688
you can go and lure them.

750
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,530
Zhuqing,

751
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,340
let's go.

752
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,250
- You go.
- You go.

753
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,170
Me?

754
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,420
What are you doing here?

755
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,250
Good evening, sirs.

756
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,820
I came to find my man.

757
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,170
Are you blind?

758
00:41:30,272 --> 00:41:31,664
This is the Martial Soul Hall.

759
00:41:31,712 --> 00:41:32,608
Your man is not here.

760
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,250
My man is also a soul master.

761
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,096
He was recruited
by the Martial Soul Hall.

762
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,210
I asked a lot of people on my way here.

763
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,360
They all said it's here.

764
00:41:41,952 --> 00:41:43,728
If you don't believe me,
I show it to you.

765
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:01,872
(Recruitment Notice:Gathering Heroes
to a Prosperous Future)

766
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,250
It's a flyer.

767
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,690
The Martial Soul Hall's flyer.

768
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,860
See this flyer?

769
00:42:07,952 --> 00:42:09,520
The one you're looking for isn't here.

770
00:42:09,552 --> 00:42:10,090
Leave now!

771
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,570
You pushed me!

772
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:13,980
You're too much!

773
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,610
I'm my man's

774
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,250
darling little princess.

775
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,380
At home, he treats me like

776
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,340
I'm the most precious thing.

777
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,650
He won't even lift a finger

778
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,380
against me.

779
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,650
You actually dare to push me.

780
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,690
This is unforgivable!

781
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,820
Get your hands off me!

782
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,170
My life is too miserable.

783
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,440
