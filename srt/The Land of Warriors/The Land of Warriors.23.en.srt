=The Land of Warriors=

19
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:29,980
(Adapted from Tangjia Sanshao's novel
"Soul Land")

20
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,300
=Episode 23=

21
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,330
I have a few words to say.

22
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,660
Five years have passed.

23
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,940
You little devils

24
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,300
have all grown up.

25
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,890
Five years ago,

26
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,370
you parted ways in chaos.

27
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,890
Now, five years later,

28
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,330
you reunite amid the turmoil.

29
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,100
The seven of you

30
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,210
are destined to face

31
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,020
extraordinary challenges
and responsibilities.

32
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,860
As the dean,

33
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,260
I have only one thing to say,

34
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,650
Shrek Academy

35
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,770
will always be your strongest support.

36
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,420
To the Shrek Seven Devils!

37
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,450
Thank you, Dean!

38
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,100
Cheers!

39
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,770
Thank you, Dean!

40
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,930
Cheers!

41
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,540
Since Ao is back,

42
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,260
the dean has spent
a fortune on this meal.

43
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,820
So, you guys must eat and drink
to your heart's content.

44
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,050
Don't try to save him money!

45
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:49,930
No problem!

46
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,980
How naughty you are!

47
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,330
Alright.

48
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:52,980
Let's dig in!

49
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,380
Let's eat!

50
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:53,730
Here.

51
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,540
Boss Dai.

52
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:57,980
Come on!

53
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:58,730
Cheers!

54
00:02:59,490 --> 00:02:59,820
Cheers!

55
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,260
Rongrong, Zhuqing.

56
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,260
Don't hold back with the dean.

57
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,100
Try this.

58
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:09,980
It's delicious.

59
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,050
This is hot. Let me blow it for you.

60
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,980
I wish I could eat
and drink with everyone.

61
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,260
Here, have some more food.

62
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,300
You guys enjoy the meal.

63
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,540
I leave here for a while.

64
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:40,820
San.

65
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:44,580
Mubai!

66
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,540
If you want to drink,

67
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,450
I'll drink with you.

68
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,930
When you come back,

69
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,380
we'll drink together with everyone else.

70
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,580
But, if you come out alone,

71
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,930
they'll worry about you.

72
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,770
I can't feel genuinely happy.

73
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,060
But I don't want
to ruin their mood either.

74
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,140
It's better to stay here.

75
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,090
At least I can drink with you.

76
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,700
You were advising Ao earlier.

77
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,020
But, now you're the one
overthinking things.

78
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,260
A doctor struggles to treat themselves.

79
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,770
All I'm thinking about now

80
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,410
is how to grow the Tang Clan quickly,

81
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,060
strengthen myself,

82
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,580
revive you,

83
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,700
and overthrow Martial Soul Hall.

84
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,180
San,

85
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,380
achieving those goals

86
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,210
doesn't conflict with being happy.

87
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,700
The journey ahead is long,

88
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,890
so you must travel light.

89
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,180
Don't let your body and mind suffer.

90
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,820
Sometimes, I feel like you're not just
a figment of my imagination.

91
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,620
You

92
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,060
and your words

93
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,330
feel so real to me.

99
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:42,650
Sir.

100
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,330
You received a huge hidden weapon order

101
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,140
from Chief Ning today.

102
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,020
But, the Tang Clan
only has Ao and Fatty.

103
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,410
How are you planning to fulfill it?

104
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,410
I've already thought about it.

105
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,180
Recruiting new members
is our top priority now.

106
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,530
I've already set my sights on a target,

107
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,530
which is the four affiliated tribes
of the Haotian Sect.

108
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,700
Back then, because of the grudges
between Martial Soul Hall

109
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,890
and the Haotian Sect,

110
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,940
they were implicated

111
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,580
and severed ties with the clan.

112
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,530
I want to gather them back together,

113
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,090
partly as an explanation to my father.

114
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,140
But, their resentment
toward the clan runs deep,

115
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,770
so this won't be easy.

116
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,260
That's fine.

117
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,450
Even if you can't persuade them,

118
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,180
Shrek Academy is here for you.

119
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,260
Don't forget,

120
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,060
you have many outstanding juniors

121
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,700
without any affiliation to the clans.

122
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,890
You don't have to stand
on ceremony with me.

123
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,530
Thank you for your support, Dean.

124
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,090
San,

125
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,530
you still have us.

126
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,770
Regarding the four tribes you mentioned,

127
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,180
does that include the Tribe of Strength?

128
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,770
Hmm,

129
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,180
what's their leader's name again?

130
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,530
Titan!

131
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:06,850
Oh, I remember.

132
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,180
You even sparred
with him at the academy.

133
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,580
You guys have good memories.

134
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,740
But, the Tribe of Strength led by Titan

135
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,380
is only one of the
four single attribute tribes.

136
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,330
As for the other three tribes,

137
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,850
I'm not as familiar.

138
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,940
We'll definitely overcome all obstacles

139
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,620
and stop at nothing to achieve the goal.

140
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:24,970
San,

141
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,210
just let us know

142
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:26,970
what you need.

143
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:27,970
Yeah!

144
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,020
We'll help grow the Tang Clan
into something powerful!

145
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,210
Martial Soul Hall didn't get enough
to harm my second brother,

146
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,970
now they even forced you and Wu

147
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,260
to suffer the same fate.

148
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,650
Their cruelty knows no bounds.

149
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,940
They’ll get their just deserts someday.

150
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,210
I don't expect the divine punishment.

151
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,580
Together with the
righteous people of the world,

152
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,290
I'll make sure Martial Soul Hall pays!

153
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,260
Since your last parting
with the Haotian Sect,

154
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,890
you've become even more composed,

155
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,380
San.

156
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,090
You establish the Tang Clan

157
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,290
and fight against the Martial Soul Hall.

158
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,940
I'll fully support you.

159
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,330
As for the Haotian Sect,
you don't have to worry too much.

160
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,330
The elders are looking for

161
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,620
someone capable of leading
the Haotian Sect.

162
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,410
Strengthening the Tang Clan

163
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,700
will only prove to them
that they chose the right person.

164
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,530
But,

165
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,650
apart from the Tribe of Strength,

166
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,450
your intention to ally

167
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,060
with the other
three single attribute tribes

168
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,260
is nearly impossible.

169
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,740
So I suggest you

170
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,170
recruit other capable individuals

171
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,290
to expand the sect.

172
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,050
I can help you with that.

173
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,690
I know

174
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,220
it's difficult to convince them,

175
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,410
which is why I came to you for help.

176
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,290
I'm a disciple of the Haotian Sect,

177
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,650
and also Tang Hao's younger sister.

178
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,260
I'm afraid I'd be chased away

179
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,690
the moment I showed up at their doors.

180
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,140
The four tribes' resentment
toward the Haotian Sect

181
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,380
runs deeper than you imagine.

182
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,140
I don't want you to visit them directly.

183
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,890
I need your help understanding them.

184
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,050
As the saying goes, "Know your enemy
and know yourself,

185
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,050
and you'll never lose."

186
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,860
The four single attribute tribes

187
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,860
include the Tribe of Strength,

188
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,140
the Tribe of Defense,

189
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,690
the Tribe of Agility,

190
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,980
and the Tribe of Destruction.

191
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,220
Individually, their strength

192
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,220
isn't top-tier,

193
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,690
but each tribe

194
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,620
has its own unique skills.

195
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,340
The Tribe of Strength

196
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,980
is known for its immense power

197
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,810
and mastery of forging,

198
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,220
which brought

199
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,140
great wealth to the tribe.

200
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,690
Their martial soul
is the Supreme Orangutan.

201
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,290
The tribe leader, Titan,

202
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,810
is a vice president
of the Blacksmiths Guild,

203
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,220
a Divine Craftsman,

204
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,570
and a Great Soul Master
of the Storm Attack Branch.

205
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,740
Blacksmiths aren't highly regarded
across the continent,

206
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,930
but your father deeply admired

207
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,460
Elder Titan's forging skills.

208
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:42,770
In return,

209
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,380
Titan greatly respects your father.

210
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,980
If you're determined
to convince the four tribes,

211
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,500
the Tribe of Strength
should be your first choice.

212
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,650
The Tribe of Defense

213
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,980
is renowned for its
incredible defensive capabilities

214
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,930
and expertise in construction.

215
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,260
Many of the

216
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,890
defensive structures in the sect

217
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,810
were built by the Tribe of Defense.

218
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,050
In terms of defense,

219
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,020
they are definitely

220
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,740
not worse than the Elephant
Armored Tribe among the Seven Clans.

221
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,460
Their martial soul
is the Plate Armor Rhino.

222
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,100
Their leader, Niu Gao is a Great
Soul Master of the Defense Branch.

223
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,170
Elder Niu

224
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,930
is a warm-hearted,

225
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,770
and outspoken person,

226
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,810
a very lovely old man.

227
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,410
But,

228
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,140
he's very clear about
his likes and dislikes.

229
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,500
Because of past events
involving the Haotian Sect,

230
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,690
he holds a grudge against your father.

231
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,340
You must be careful.

232
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,770
The Tribe of Agility

233
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,770
is famous for its incredible speed

234
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,690
and reconnaissance skills.

235
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,770
Their martial soul is the
Sharp-tailed Swallow.

236
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,170
The pure speed-type soul masters

237
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,410
are the best scouts.

238
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,410
Their tribe leader, Bai He,

239
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,770
is a Great Soul Master
of the Agility Branch.

240
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,220
Apart from that,

241
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,460
he's also your father's and my uncle.

242
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,770
You should address him as a grand uncle.

243
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,810
(Grand uncle?)

244
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,620
However, regarding this relationship,

245
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,740
you'd best not mention it

246
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,650
when you meet him.

247
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,980
Ever since the
Haotian Sect secluded itself,

248
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,380
we've had no contact with them.

249
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,220
I've heard that in recent years,

250
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,020
their tribe hasn't
been doing well either.

251
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:08,460
Lastly,

252
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,380
the Tribe of Destruction.

253
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,770
Their martial soul
is Soul Breaking Spear,

254
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,980
focused on attack.

255
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,260
The Tribe of Destruction specializes
in secret medicinal techniques,

256
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,460
so they are skilled in making medicine.

257
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,770
Whether life-saving remedies

258
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,340
or deadly poisons,

259
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,740
they are very good at it.

260
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,740
Their tribe leader, Yang Wudi is a Great
Soul Master of Storm Attack Branch.

261
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,930
It can be said that he has
tried all kinds of herbs

262
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,100
and is obsessed with it.

263
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,050
Specializing in making medicine...

264
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,570
Actually, the Tribe of Destruction

265
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,650
suffered the most under the
suppression of the Martial Soul Hall.

266
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,930
Back then, the Martial Soul Hall

267
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,410
wanted to locate the
Haotian Sect's whereabouts,

268
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,460
and besieged the Tribe of Destruction.

269
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,050
During that,

270
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,140
Elder Yang's brother

271
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,620
was taken hostage.

272
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,290
He's most likely

273
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,340
killed.

274
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,770
I didn't expect them
to have endured so much.

275
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,100
No wonder my father feels so guilty.

276
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,930
If I truly manage to bring the
four single attribute tribes together,

277
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,050
I will do everything
to make it up to them

278
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,650
and ensure they are

279
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,020
never oppressed by the
Martial Soul Hall again.

280
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,170
San,

281
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,100
that's all I know

282
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,220
about the four single attribute tribes.

283
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,260
I hope it's helpful to you.

284
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,980
Of course, it is.

285
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,650
But,

286
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,410
I have one last question.

287
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,580
(The Mansion of the Tribe of Strength)

288
00:12:15,621 --> 00:12:17,180
(Strength)

289
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,700
(Apprentice Fee: 2000 silver soul coins,
debited from Divine Hornet Clan)

290
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,690
(Ledger)

291
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,290
As per routine,

292
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,860
today is the day to distribute funds
to each household in the tribe.

293
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,530
However, the current situation is chaos.

294
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,860
We've long lost contact

295
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,260
with all the clans

296
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,650
we've had dealings with.

297
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,620
Only a few balances remain unsettled.

298
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,020
So,

299
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,220
please, everyone

300
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,740
bear with us a little longer.

301
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,530
Senior Brother,

302
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,410
don't worry.

303
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,810
We'll get through

304
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,050
this tough time together.

305
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:49,740
Senior Brother.

306
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,570
How is it going?

307
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,690
The Seven Clans reorganized.

308
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,890
The Divine Hornet Clan was attacked
and annexed by other clans.

309
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,100
Their leader was killed.

310
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,980
The clan no longer exists,

311
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,260
and the debt is unrecoverable.

312
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,530
The leader of the Divine Hornet Clan
was always righteous,

313
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,140
but he meets such a cruel end.

314
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,930
We shall pay our respects
to him another day.

315
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,650
Did someone bully you?

316
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:16,890
Senior Brother,

317
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:17,890
I...

318
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,860
I was driven out of the Gale Clan.

319
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,260
What happened?

320
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,890
The Gale Clan has surrendered
to the Martial Soul Hall.

321
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,220
They claimed the clan
has changed its leader,

322
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,530
and they won't
acknowledge the past debts.

323
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:28,890
They even said,

324
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:29,740
if you're dissatisfied,

325
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,980
go ahead and settle it in person.

326
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,740
They are waiting for you.

327
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,460
All useless men!

328
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,220
Senior Brother,

329
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,100
don't act rashly!

330
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,770
Let go of me!

331
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,650
Senior Brother!

332
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,690
Senior Brother.

333
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,810
What are you doing?

334
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,740
I know the tribe is
short on funds right now

335
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,340
and this may not be the best
time for me to say this.

336
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,260
But, my child is falling ill,

337
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,500
and I need to get a doctor
urgently for some herbs.

338
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,290
Could you spare me a little,

339
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,810
just enough to cover
the medical expenses?

340
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,140
Come on.

341
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:55,890
Get up.

342
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:01,690
Hurry up.

343
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,980
Take your child to see the doctor.

344
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,140
It's not much.

345
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,810
If it's not enough,
I'll figure something out.

346
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:06,740
No, no, Senior Brother.

347
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,050
I can't take your money.

348
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,410
Just let me withdraw a bit
from the tribe's funds.

349
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,570
There's no fund
in the tribe's account now.

350
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,500
Take it.

351
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,460
Don't delay the treatment.

352
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,650
Thank you, Senior Brother.

353
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,690
I'll figure out the money issue later.

354
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,810
Don't tell the tribe leader.

355
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,740
He's getting older,

356
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,770
don't let him worry.

357
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,380
Understood.

358
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,620
Nonsense!

359
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,260
Do you think I'm blind?

360
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:41,530
Father!

361
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,260
Leader!

362
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,020
I, Titan,

363
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,890
am ashamed to face all of you.

364
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,530
Back when we,

365
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,980
the Tribe of Strength
left the Haotian Sect,

366
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,740
although we lived in poverty,

367
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,220
we could still sustain ourselves.

368
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,410
But now, given the current chaos,

369
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,690
the tribe

370
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,220
is struggling just to make ends meet.

371
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,650
Here are all my personal savings
from over the years.

372
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,930
A portion is left for the elderly
to spend their old age at ease.

373
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,050
The rest can be equally
distributed among all of you.

374
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,500
For those who want to seek a new path,

375
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,340
take the money

376
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,860
and leave the Tribe of Strength.

377
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,770
Don't trap yourselves here.

378
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,930
No, leader!

379
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,020
We won't leave.

380
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:30,980
Leader,

381
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,380
whatever challenges arise,
we will face them together.

382
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,770
We're young and strong.

383
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,690
We have our hands and feet.

384
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,930
We won't be starve to death.

385
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,650
This is

386
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,460
all my fault.

387
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,620
If it weren't for the rule I set

388
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,100
forbidding certain businesses,

389
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,020
the Tribe of Strength

390
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,770
wouldn't be in this dire state today.

391
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,380
Father,

392
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,530
how can this be your fault?

393
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,530
Back then, the entire tribe

394
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,860
agreed to the rule you set.

395
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,980
Senior Brother is right.

396
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,050
We all supported
the rule you established.

397
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,570
Even if we must beg on the streets,

398
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,860
the Tribe of Strength
will never earn that kind of money.

399
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,380
Father,

400
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,620
our tribe must not fall apart like this.

401
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,290
If we can't find suitable work,

402
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,890
I'll take everyone

403
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,460
outside to look for jobs

404
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,890
or participate in the Martial
Soul Competition to earn prize money.

405
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,890
No matter what, we'll find
a way to support the clan.

406
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,980
Good men of the tribe!

407
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,170
Since you are all so resolute today,

408
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,620
we will surely get through this.

409
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,460
The Tribe of Strength
is quite impressive.

410
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,530
I'm satisfied.

411
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,500
As the Deputy Head of the Tang Clan,

412
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,290
I propose

413
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,930
we make this the Tang Clan's mansion.

414
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,020
You truly are
a good student of Mr. Flander.

415
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,260
Is your martial soul an abacus?

416
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,260
San,

417
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,930
regarding the matters
you asked me about,

418
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,380
I've already sent disciples
from the Qibao Amber Sect

419
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,020
to investigate it.

420
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,100
The Tribe of Strength's business

421
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,100
has been struggling ever since
they left the Haotian Sect.

422
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,770
With the recent chaos caused
by the Martial Soul Hall,

423
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,130
things have gotten even worse for them.

424
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,770
I have one last question.

425
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,700
What are the weaknesses

426
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,220
of these four tribe leaders?

427
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
This is what you truly wanted
to know from me, isn't it?

428
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,020
Elder Titan

429
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,610
is loyal

430
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,420
and values promises.

431
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,500
He holds deep affection for your father.

432
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,850
Among the four tribes, he's the only one

433
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,770
who voluntarily left the sect

434
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,940
out of the resentment

435
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,530
for how your father was treated.

436
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,220
So, I believe

437
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,700
Elder Titan's weakness

438
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,610
must be your father.

439
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,570
San,

440
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,420
will we get kicked out later?

441
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,810
The other three tribes, maybe.

442
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,460
But, the Tribe of Strength won't.

443
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,900
If we're kicked out this time,

444
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,770
we'll just come back next time.

445
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,420
Either way, we'll be with you.

446
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,020
Please inform Elder Titan

447
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,900
that an old acquaintance
has come to visit.

448
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,530
Thank you.

449
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:32,980
Elder Titan,

450
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,290
it's been so long,

451
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,740
and you're still as robust as ever.

452
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,460
Brother Tai Nuo,

453
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,370
I hope you've been well.

454
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,810
Young Master,

455
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,940
is it really you?

456
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,980
The old servant, Titan

457
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,130
pays respects to the Young Master!

458
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,530
Senior,

459
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,260
please get up.

460
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,980
I never expected that after such
a brief meeting at Shrek back then,

461
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,740
you would still recognize me.

462
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,050
You've grown.

463
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,900
You look more and more
like a master now.

464
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,050
You are our Young Master.

465
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,530
You should sit in the master's seat.

466
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:12,610
Hmm...

467
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,610
Serve the tea!

468
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,050
Thank you.

469
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,050
Young Master,

470
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,610
I heard that after the
final match of the

471
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,180
Continental Advanced Soul Master
Academy Elite Tournament,

472
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,460
you were taken away by the master.

473
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,050
How is

474
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,420
the master now?

475
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,220
My father...

476
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,370
has decided to retire.

477
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,290
Retire?

478
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,370
Why is the leader
of the Tribe of Strength

479
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,810
meeting San alone?

480
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,370
Could something have happened?

481
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,370
Fatty, stop walking around.

482
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,260
You're making us dizzy.

483
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,130
Are we just going to wait for him here?

484
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,180
We should set a time limit.

485
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,020
For instance, if we don't
meet up within half an hour,

486
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,260
we'll charge in.

487
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:07,980
Agreed.

488
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,740
San has his own plans.

489
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,370
I trust him to be able
to handle things smoothly.

490
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:15,900
I've waited all these years

491
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,610
for the master's return.

492
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,260
Honestly, for those two soul bones,

493
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,180
what if they were never returned?

494
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,460
It wasn't his fault.

495
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,500
It was all the Martial Soul Hall.

496
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,500
Yet the Haotian Sect
blamed him for it all.

497
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,020
You don't have to worry about this.

498
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,700
My father is now staying
by my mother's side,

499
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,420
and is unaffected

500
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,460
by those outside rumors.

501
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,700
As for the unfinished matters
my father left behind,

502
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,900
I will take care of them for him.

503
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,570
Senior Titan,

504
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,980
I've come

505
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,460
to discuss something with you.

506
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:50,940
Young Master,

507
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,050
feel free to say anything.

508
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,020
As long as it's within my power,

509
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,050
I will not refuse.

510
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,290
I plan

511
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,660
to establish a clan

512
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,900
called the Tang Clan.

513
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,460
I'd like to invite the
Tribe of Strength to join us.

514
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:03,980
Establishing a clan?

515
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,220
The elders of the Haotian Sect allowed
you to reclaim your heritage.

516
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,220
Why do you establish a new clan?

517
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,050
I have a ten-year agreement
with the elders.

518
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,420
Within ten years,

519
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,500
if I can obtain
a Hectomillennium Soul Ring,

520
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,740
reach level 80 in cultivation,

521
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,980
and defeat a Grand Soul Master
from the Martial Soul Hall,

522
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,770
my father will be allowed
to return to the sect

523
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,940
and pay respects to my late grandfather.

524
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,220
Those stubborn old fools!

525
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,610
What kind of conditions are these?

526
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,090
There are all impossible conditions.

527
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,940
Clearly, they just don't want
the master to return.

528
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,530
Father,

529
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,570
others may not be able to do it,

530
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,810
but the Young Master
has extraordinary talent,

531
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,130
that he might succeed in it.

532
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,260
For the sake of my father's wish,

533
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,370
I will achieve it.

534
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,940
Not only will
I fulfill these conditions,

535
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,220
but I will also establish a new clan

536
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,900
to gain strength
over the next ten years.

537
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,260
This way, we'll be in a better position

538
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,570
to fight against Martial Soul Hall
in the future.

539
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,610
I believe

540
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,260
this is what my father
would want to see.

541
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,290
I see.

542
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,370
Young Master,

543
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,700
you truly have great foresight.

544
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,090
Our Tribe of Strength once
swore loyalty to your father,

545
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,980
taking his will as our mission.

546
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,370
Whatever you need,

547
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,940
I will fully support you.

548
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,290
But,

549
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,610
I only have one request.

550
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,530
Senior, please go ahead.

551
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,420
If the Haotian Sect re-emerges one day

552
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,900
and you decide to merge with it,

553
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,050
please allow the Tribe of Strength
to withdraw from the Tang Clan.

554
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,460
That will never happen.

555
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,130
The Tang Clan is the Tang Clan.

556
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,940
It will not belong to any other clan,

557
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,020
nor will it merge with the Haotian Sect.

558
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,370
From today onward,

559
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,290
the Tribe of Strength
will join the Tang Clan

560
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,330
and follow the Young Master's commands.

561
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,570
Elder Titan,

562
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,420
please get up.

563
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,290
From today onward,

564
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
you are the chief elder
of the Tang Clan.

565
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,660
Master,

566
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,180
the clan has just been established,

567
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,180
and you must haven't
chosen a location yet.

568
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,740
What about establishing it
at my mansion?

569
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,610
After all, what's mine
is the Young Master's.

570
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:21,460
Alright.

571
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,770
However, I heard

572
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,220
that the Tribe of Strength
is in the midst of hardship.

573
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,370
If there are any funding issues,

574
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,370
you must tell me.

575
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,460
Our Tang Clan

576
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,610
recently accepted an order
from the Qibao Amber Sect,

577
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,090
and we'll need the full support
of the Tribe of Strength.

578
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,940
Qibao Amber Sect?

579
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,460
What kind of items do they want?

580
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,850
Tang Clan's exclusive secret weapon.

581
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,260
This is the Soundless Arrow,

582
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,090
one of the Tang Clan's secret weapons

583
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,660
and one of the many custom orders

584
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,220
from the Qibao Amber Sect.

585
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,090
Ingenious!

586
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,980
Absolutely ingenious!

587
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,330
Master,

588
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,290
we, the Tribe of Strength

589
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,130
cannot craft such items.

590
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,660
Why is he taking so long
with no progress?

591
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,700
Elder Titan,

592
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,260
let me introduce them.

593
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:37,610
Alright.

594
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,530
This is Ma Hongjun,

595
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:40,740
Dai Mubai,

596
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,700
Zhu Zhuqing,

597
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,740
Ning Rongrong,

598
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,530
and Ao,

599
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,180
they are my close friends.

600
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,370
I've long heard
of the Shrek Seven Devils.

601
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,660
I apologize for the earlier neglect.

602
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,460
Please forgive me.

603
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,290
Tai Nuo,

604
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,050
quickly prepare guest rooms for everyone

605
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,220
so they can rest well.

606
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,740
Alright.

607
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,570
Elder Titan,

608
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,420
there's no need
to go through all that trouble.

609
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,810
Please, if you have
matters to attend to,

610
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,810
don't worry about us.

611
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,370
Alright,

612
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,180
then I'll excuse myself.

613
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,500
Thank you, Elder Titan.

614
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,260
Thank you.

615
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,850
Did you secretly learn
communication skills from the dean?

616
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,130
You settled this so quickly.

617
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,980
Elder Titan has agreed
to join the Tang Clan,

618
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,530
but he refused to craft weapons.

619
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,260
No crafting weapons?

620
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,260
After the Tribe of Strength
separated from the Haotian Sect,

621
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,220
we suffered repeated oppression
from the Martial Soul Hall.

622
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,220
Not only did they interrogate me
about the Haotian Sect's whereabouts,

623
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,020
but they also tried to force
the Tribe of Strength to serve them

624
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,500
by crafting weapons.

625
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,530
They used both coercion

626
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,900
and deception.

627
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,570
At one point,
for the survival of my clan,

628
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,700
I was compelled to create
some experimental weapons.

629
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,460
They used those weapons

630
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,050
to annihilate countless minor sects,

631
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,020
just to test the power of the weapons.

632
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,130
Those sects had a legacy
of over a hundred years,

633
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,020
yet they were easily
destroyed in an instant.

634
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,460
I became an accomplice.

635
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,850
I was the knife of the
Martial Soul Hall used to kill.

636
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,090
Since then, I established a rule

637
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,610
of not crafting weapons anymore,

638
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,180
to atone for our sins.

639
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,850
Who would have thought

640
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,740
that the renowned Tribe of Strength
in the blacksmithing world

641
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,850
would refuse to craft weapons?

642
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,700
No wonder they're struggling so much.

643
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,940
Please allow me to speak frankly,

644
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,290
this tribe was taken in,

645
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,940
but not entirely.

646
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,020
How could Elder Titan
abandon his crafting skills?

647
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,370
As a Divine Craftsman,

648
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,090
how could he not want

649
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,850
to create masterpieces on the forge?

650
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,020
But, because he carries
a compassionate heart,

651
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,900
he's willing to let go of his pursuits.

652
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:46,900
This is righteousness.

653
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,530
I originally thought

654
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,090
convincing the Tribe of Strength

655
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,050
would help me unite the other tribes.

656
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,180
But, I didn't expect the first hurdle
to be so challenging.

657
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,370
The rules mentioned by Elder Titan

658
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,980
seem to have been made out of necessity.

659
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,020
Now, things have changed with time.

660
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,530
Maybe we can figure out a way

661
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,130
to change his mind.

662
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,770
We'd like to train with Elder Titan.

663
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,130
Great!

664
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,660
You're welcome to join.

665
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,180
Amazing!

666
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,740
This is incredible!

667
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,130
These arrowheads are so sharp!

668
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,180
Fatty,

669
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,900
look at all these
broken stones on the ground.

670
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,050
The floor is covered in pieces.

671
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,660
Maybe we should find something

672
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,370
to clean this up.

673
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,770
This is made of refined iron essence.

674
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,020
It's evenly textured

675
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,220
and highly durable.

676
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,090
It seems to have been tempered
using the Haotian Sect's

677
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,610
Random Air Hammer Skill.

678
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,610
This is truly impressive!

679
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,050
But, what is it called?

680
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,700
It's called the Godly Zhuge Crossbow.

681
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,660
Don't underestimate its small size.

682
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,020
It can hold up to

683
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,460
48 bolts at a time.

684
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,900
You just need to simply adjust
the trigger mechanism before use

685
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,020
and it can release 16 bolts in one go.

686
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,260
16 bolts!

687
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,530
Moreover, it can easily pierce through

688
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,130
the defenses of a
soul master below level 40.

689
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,850
Its firing speed is extremely fast.

690
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,940
Elder, please consider

691
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,570
to own this for the Tribe of Strength.

692
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,770
This Godly Zhuge Crossbow
is indeed divine.

693
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,610
Keep it safe

694
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,740
and don't leave it
lying around carelessly.

695
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,900
Why is this old man so stubborn?

696
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:05,770
No rush.

697
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,530
(Strength)

698
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,260
Elder Titan,

699
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,570
please come along with us
to the Qibao Amber Sect.

700
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:13,940
I've taken on another order.

701
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,260
Master,

702
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,940
please don't trouble me with this.

703
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:17,770
Don't worry.

704
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,740
It's not weapons.

705
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,130
Rongrong's carriage
is already waiting outside.

706
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,500
Let's head out now.

707
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,850
These are the disciples severely injured

708
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,180
during our last battle
with the Martial Soul Hall.

709
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,020
This time, we invited the Tang Clan here

710
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,260
because San thought

711
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,290
we might be able to use prosthetics

712
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,610
to help restore their broken bodies.

713
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,850
What are prosthetics?

714
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:51,570
Elder,

715
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:52,850
take a look at this.

716
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,810
This is the drawing I drafted.

717
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,810
We're here

718
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,330
to measure the body of the disciples

719
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,290
and make sure the exact sizes,

720
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,260
so that the prosthetic limbs we made

721
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,460
can fit them perfectly.

722
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:03,740
Rongrong.

723
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:17,700
Come on.

724
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,180
Thank you, Elder.

725
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,180
The Soundless Arrow.

726
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,420
You recognize it, Elder?

727
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,770
If not for it protecting me,

728
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,570
I might have lost more than just a leg.

729
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,980
I heard the master has ordered
another batch of hidden weapons.

730
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,570
I hope I can use them
to continue protecting the sect.

731
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,500
I'll take the measurements for you.

732
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,700
Thank you.

733
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,530
Master,

734
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:56,980
for this order,

735
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,050
the Tribe of Strength
won't accept payment.

736
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,370
I'm willing to craft prosthetic limbs

737
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,900
for the Qibao Amber Sect for free.

738
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:04,500
Elder,

739
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,660
I appreciate your generosity,

740
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,810
but I understand the
Tribe of Strength's current situation.

741
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,220
How could I let you work for free?

742
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,500
No,

743
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,460
prosthetic limbs will be free.

744
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,810
But, we'll charge
for the hidden weapons.

745
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:16,940
You've changed your mind.

746
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,530
I am an old man
with one foot in the grave,

747
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,420
and I thought I have
made clear of everything.

748
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,290
But today, you've taught me
an important lesson.

749
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,980
I understand your intentions.

750
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,810
Weapons are inanimate,

751
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,020
and are neither good nor evil.

752
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,570
It all depends on
whose hands wield them.

753
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,420
Such a simple truth,

754
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,180
yet I was blinded by my stubbornness.

755
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,290
Abandoning the craft due to fear

756
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,420
is indeed an unwise option.

757
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,460
Your reluctance to sacrifice more lives

758
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,770
stems from your compassion.

759
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,900
That is no fault of yours.

760
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,460
But, the Martial Soul Hall
is now being so rampant,

761
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,180
and no one dares to oppose them.

762
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,370
My initial intention
of establishing the Tang Clan

763
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,770
is to fight against
the Martial Soul Hall.

764
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,290
If one day

765
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,180
the armies of Tiandou and Xingluo

766
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,810
are equipped with the
Tang Clan's secret weapons,

767
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,530
what advantage would

768
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,500
the Martial Soul Hall have left?

769
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,900
The number of soul masters
in the Martial Soul Hall

770
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,260
is enough to crush both Tiandou

771
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,220
and Xingluo empires.

772
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,260
If we can use the equipment

773
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,700
to close the gap between
ordinary people and soul masters,

774
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,260
then soul masters won't have
an absolute advantage anymore.

775
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,740
Especially for the
low-level soul masters,

776
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,020
while facing armies
with highly destructive weapons,

777
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,660
they will inevitably suffer losses.

778
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,660
The Qibao Amber Sect placed an order

779
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,610
because they witnessed
how Tang Clan's secret weapons

780
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,770
can help for the lack of combat strength

781
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,570
among the support branch soul masters.

782
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:38,290
But, to produce such
a large quantity of secret weapons,

783
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,260
we'll need not only
the Tribe of Strength,

784
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,130
but also more blacksmiths
to join the Tang Clan.

785
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,900
Master,

786
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,500
I'll lead my tribes and give it our all.

787
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,530
With our own strength,

788
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,810
we will severely strike
the Martial Soul Hall in the future.

789
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,130
Master,

790
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,050
the tribe has limited metal supplies.

791
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,810
We can manage the prosthetics,

792
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,370
but for the secret weapons,

793
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,090
we'll need to go to the
Capital of Metal, Gengxin City,

794
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,290
to buy materials.

795
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,770
The secret weapons are not urgent.

796
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,500
Our primary goal right now

797
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,650
is to convince the other
three single attribute tribes.

798
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,250
I'll leave the other three tribe leaders

799
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,780
to your efforts, Elder.

800
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,500
Regarding the antidote
Xue Beng asked you to create,

801
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,820
are you confident about it?

802
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,900
This complex poison is indeed tricky.

803
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,210
Without knowing how it was made,

804
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,170
it's hard to formulate an antidote.

805
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,650
But, since I've promised Xue Beng,

806
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,530
I'll do my best.

807
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,610
Moreover, the fate of Emperor Xue Ye

808
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,090
is tied to the well-being of the people.

809
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,780
If even you and the
Grand Venom Master are stumped,

810
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,020
who else could solve this poison?

811
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,610
If we can convince the
other three single attribute tribes,

812
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,020
there might be one person
who can do this.

813
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:56,380
It seems

814
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,460
that convincing the
remaining three tribes

815
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,500
will be incredibly difficult.

816
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,130
Why do you say so?

817
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,500
If someone in the four tribes
can create an antidote,

818
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,050
but you haven't given up yet

819
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,500
and are still trying,

820
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,210
there's only one possibility.

821
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:13,690
You're not completely confident

822
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,130
about persuading the other tribes.

823
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,210
What's your next plan?

824
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,420
Take them down one by one.

825
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,820
There's an opportunity soon.

826
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,940
The four tribes meet every two years.

827
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:29,210
This time, the gathering is in Longxing
Town, at the Tribe of Defense's place.

828
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,900
The date is drawing near,

829
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,500
and I plan to take everyone there.

830
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,690
This rare item was acquired by the
master of the Elephant Armored Tribe

831
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,090
through an auction.

832
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,570
Its attacking power is incredible,

833
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,780
and I presented it as a gift
for Your Holiness's enjoyment.

834
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,250
Interesting.

835
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,570
But against the absolute power,

836
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,730
this thing is worthless.

837
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,820
What does Hu Yanzhen want in return?

838
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,250
The Elephant Armored Tribe hit a wall
with the Tribe of Defense,

839
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,130
so they're asking for our help.

840
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,130
Na,

841
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,420
what do you think
the Martial Soul Hall currently lacks?

842
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:13,650
Soul masters.

843
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,730
We've lost too many
people to the Operation Clan Hunt.

844
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,570
For our future ambitions,

845
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,500
we need more soul masters to join us.

846
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,570
Great!

847
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,940
What about the Elephant Armored Tribe?

848
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,530
The Elephant Armored Tribe was
the first of the original Four Clans

849
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,130
to pledge allegiance to us.

850
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,610
They've always sought to claim

851
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,500
the top spot among the new Seven Clans.

852
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,340
Obviously, they want
to expand their power

853
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,250
and gain new support.

854
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,210
Their strength represents
the Martial Soul Hall's

855
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,530
new force in the
reformation of the Seven Clans.

856
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,610
See?

857
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,300
No matter how strong the weapons are,

858
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,170
it's incomparable to
the powerful soul masters.

859
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,250
So, only soul masters

860
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,210
are our most valuable assets.

861
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,050
Which do you think is stronger,

862
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,420
the Elephant Armored Tribe
or the Tribe of Defense?

863
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,730
Of course, it's the
Elephant Armored Tribe.

864
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,020
Does that mean the
Elephant Armored Tribe

865
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,020
doesn't want to
sacrifice their disciples

866
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,940
and is borrowing our strength instead?

867
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,610
I may have

868
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,340
underestimated Hu Yanzhen.

869
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,300
That means

870
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,530
the internal affairs
of the Martial Soul Hall

871
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,860
are as complex as a nation's.

872
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,380
Everyone has their own agenda.

873
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,610
Na,

874
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,420
you need to learn how
to control people's hearts.

875
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,250
Taking advantage of people's
hearts is the best way.

876
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,050
Understood, Your Holiness.

877
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,500
I'll extend the grace of the Holy Lady

878
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,860
and first investigate the situation
of the Elephant Armored Tribe

879
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,610
before making any decisions.

880
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,300
This way, we won't appear indifferent
and hurt their loyalty,

881
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
nor will we deplete
the Martial Soul Hall's resources.

882
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,900
At the same time, this will show them

883
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,980
the fierce competition
among the new Seven Clans,

884
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,250
prompting the Elephant Armored Tribe
to give their all

885
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,300
to expand our influence.
It's a triple win.

886
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,900
Take Yan with you.

887
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,500
There are some things
you don't need to say it yourself.

888
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,210
You need to learn this as well.

889
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,210
Thank you for your guidance,
Your Holiness.

890
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,210
Stop!

891
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,610
If you want to pass through here,

892
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,530
pay 100 gold soul coins.

893
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,210
I've never heard of such
a rule in Longxing Town.

894
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,610
The Elephant Armored Tribe.

895
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,380
Who gave you the authority
to set up a toll here?

896
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,860
If you don't pay, then scram!

897
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,130
Who dares

898
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,780
speak to me like that?

899
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,900
If you have the guts,

900
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,210
step forward and let me see who you are!

901
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,460
How dare you

902
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,650
challenge the Elephant Armored Tribe?

903
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,380
You're leaving your life here today.

904
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,170
Elder,

905
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,340
let me handle this.

906
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,570
I have some old scores
to settle with these guys.

907
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,250
Bu Le,

908
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,210
do you still remember me?

909
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:08,900
You brat!

910
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,020
I'll take your life today!

911
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,900
Inescapable Double Shield!

912
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,210
Don't worry.

913
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,210
Fatty can handle this.

914
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,170
Let him have some workouts.

915
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,420

Longxing Town,

939
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,610
I know this place.

940
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,170
This town

941
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,650
is very small,

942
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,170
but since it is located on the border,

943
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,780
there are many merchants
who travel back and forth here.

944
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,210
There are lots of good food, too.

945
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,170
It's just that the security is not good.

946
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,170
Those guys at the gate
were just too arrogant.

947
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:01,980
Yeah, that's right.

948
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,170
Mubai.

949
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:03,820
Zhuqing.

950
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,460
Who governs the Longxing Town now?

951
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,460
The Elephant Armored Tribe
is the strongest force here.

952
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,210
They've been managing the town,

953
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,130
but the report of Longxing Town
about the Elephant Armored Tribe

954
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,780
doesn't match what we saw today.

955
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:16,610
That's right.

956
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,780
The prosperity here is just a facade.

957
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,730
The Tribe of Defense
moved here two years ago.

958
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,780
They told me

959
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,340
that the business here is hard to do.

960
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,250
Plus, they've been

961
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,570
subjected to bullying
by the Martial Soul Hall.

962
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,210
The four tribes hold
a gathering every two years

963
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,090
to support one another, right?

964
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:31,860
Yes.

965
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,170
Without the protection of a clan,

966
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,130
we can only band together for warmth.

967
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,420
We're all oppressed
by the Martial Soul Hall.

968
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,780
Only by uniting can we resist them.

969
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,900
The scope of the Martial Soul Hall's
persecution is growing wider.

970
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,090
It has even expanded to
the Xingluo's border now.

971
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,250
This shows how Bi Bi Dong
has been laying her plans for years.

972
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,820
That's why her influence is so vast.

973
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,050
Master.

974
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,300
Elder.

975
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,020
San might be talking to Wu.

976
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:05,610
Hmm,

977
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:06,980
this is a long story.

978
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,210
How about we head to a bun shop
and talk while we eat?

979
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,020
Sure.

980
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:10,690
Let's go.

981
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,170
On the way, I'll tell you

982
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,340
about my romantic encounter
in Longxin Town.

983
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:15,980
No need.

984
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,340
We still need to look around

985
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,570
and see if there’s anything unusual.

986
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:19,780
Let’s go.

987
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,900
That story about your girl in white,

988
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,500
I’ve heard it so many times
my ears are growing calluses!

989
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,570
We’ll also go take a look around.

990
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,130
They don't have the chance to taste it.

991
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,380
Let's go.

992
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,380
Let's enjoy some meat.

993
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,340
Let's go.

994
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,900
What's that sound?

995
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,210
San.

996
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,300
Hurry!

997
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,050
Let’s go take a look!

998
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:52,900
Good! Good! Good!

999
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,570
Good! Good! Good!

1000
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,460
Excuse me.

1001
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:59,130
Excuse me.

1002
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,130
Good! Good!

1003
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,650
We can actually make
money performing here.

1004
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,610
We could do performances
in the future too.

1005
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,340
I'll play this part,

1006
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,210
and you can your Blue Silver Emperor

1007
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,900
to do a "thousand-hand
plate spinning" act!

1008
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,340
You are indeed a business genius.

1009
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:21,570
Great!

1010
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,380
Thank you.

1011
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,730
Thank you.

1012
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:27,690
San,

1013
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,300
ordinary people have it tough
trying to make a living.

1014
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,940
You should give them some support too.

1015
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,610
Thank you.

1016
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,300
