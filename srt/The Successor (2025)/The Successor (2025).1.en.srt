00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,526
Siamraphe.

3
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:30,151
It all started from a small grocery store
owned by the Raphethada family.

4
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:35,000
Every heir in every generation has held fast
to the family's three creeds.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,929
The first is honesty.

6
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:40,738
The second is courage.

7
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:45,236
And the last is faith in the family.

8
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:49,969
From the first day I entered
as the family's eldest daughter‑in‑law,

9
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:53,151
I believed in those three creeds.

10
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:59,375
If the Raphethada family stands hand in hand,
we can get through any problem.

11
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:30,320
Oh!

12
00:01:31,502 --> 00:01:33,800
I lose again!

13
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,462
I told you not to be impatient.

14
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,916
Another easy miss?

15
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,582
Chon, you play and still lose.

16
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:41,495
Of course, you always pull the middle piece,

17
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:42,631
always playing it safe.

18
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:44,680
Hey, I survived, didn't I?

19
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,840
Stop playing, Mut.

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,701
Playing with someone who loses
but can't accept it is annoying.

21
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:53,804
I think someone's more impatient
than Thaleh, dear.

22
00:01:53,804 --> 00:01:55,751
What are you saying, Weerin?

23
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:57,013
Lek.

24
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:58,759
The kids are just playing among themselves.

25
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,570
Don't spoil the mood.

26
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:03,782
Playing is just a waste of time.

27
00:02:03,782 --> 00:02:06,018
We're going to win anyway, Mut.

28
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,427
Kids, Auntie Yai is here.

29
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,347
I'll go check on Auntie Yai.

30
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:40,333
Taking better care of your godmother
than your own mother like this?

31
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,556
I'm starting to get jealous.

32
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:46,289
Huh, jealous of someone sick like me?

33
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:47,991
Sick?

34
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:51,560
You just have a cough, really. What illness?

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,600
I went to see the doctor.

36
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:01,880
Stage 2 lung cancer.

37
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,693

38
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:06,502
P'Yai!

39
00:03:12,822 --> 00:03:15,569
It'll be okay.

40
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:18,711
But anyway, I'll need treatment.

41
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:22,253
So I've decided to retire.

42
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:24,822
You're going to step down from the position?

43
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:28,036
For the past two or three years,
I've hardly been doing anything anyway.

44
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:31,280

When Mut finishes his Masters,

50
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:53,000
he should be able to help with Siamraphe.

be involved, right?

built thousands of houses,

77

You've only recently started assisting Natee.
You don't have much experience.

The Raphethada surname doesn't mean
you can do whatever you want.

I did this as the student council president.

for Teacher Nueng.

Mukdao sprayed something
on the teacher's car at school.

00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:15,074
The school must punish her,
deduct behavioral points,

131
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,450
and place her on probation.

You said you were going to provide evidence
to show the foreman Mhee,

140
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:57,250
so why did you go smash the building?

141
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,194
Because I'm annoyed.
Tricky people need this kind of method.

when the meeting finished.

I'm worried about you. Go home now, Thaleh.

148
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,059
Okay, fine, I'll go.

149
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:21,451
Did you order the teacher
to punish me so severely, Mom?

150
00:13:21,451 --> 00:13:23,349
Go talk to me inside.

If someone insulted our store,
would they insult us back like this?

159

If it was my car,
they'd get it back for sure.

162
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:17,171

But I'm not wrong, Mom.

164
00:14:18,706 --> 00:14:22,459
I want the teacher to know that
it's not just writing on a friend's body.

stay permanently.

168
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:32,705

that makes people
remember what you did forever.

170
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:37,503
And you had the teacher
put us both on probation

171
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,125
and removed me from the student council.

172
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,506

173
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:43,345
Remember as an example of wrongdoing.

00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:45,336
You should remember too.

00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:49,971
The higher the position,
the more responsibility one must bear.

176

In the end, you never side with me.

00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,271

who does the right thing.

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,143
one person destroyed someone's property,
another behaved like a criminal.

181
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,400
How could I side with either?

182
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm sorry, Mom. I won't do it again.

183
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:29,263
School is a microcosm of the real world.

184
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,618
Being a student is practice for life.

185
00:15:32,618 --> 00:15:39,532
You must learn so when you grow up,
you can handle the real world's problems.

186
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:42,558
And another thing...

187
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:46,420
There are many ways to respond to injustice.

188
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,972
We don't have to answer violence
with more violence.

189
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:53,211
Because if we use the wrong method,

190
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:57,171
the right person becomes
the wrongdoer immediately.

191
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:10,774
I'm sorry. I love you, Mom.

192
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,200
What the hell did you do?

193
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,113
Hey, you think you're something, huh?

194
00:16:45,113 --> 00:16:46,525
You went to chase my dad out?

195
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:48,917
Because he did cheat. There's evidence.

196
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:54,768
Hey, I already told you I'd fix it,
but you're still trying to kick me out.

197
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:58,102
You probably think you're so rich, huh?

198
00:16:58,102 --> 00:17:00,269
You damn Siamraphe!

199
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,780
Don't mess with my family.

200
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,873
Your dad's a bastard!

201
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:05,486
Damn it!

202
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:07,356
Hit him, damn it!

203
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:09,880
Hit him!

204
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,867
Hey!

205
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,320
Ms. Weerin, may I have a word?

206
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,110
Not convenient.
Ms. Weerin isn't available, please wait.

207
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,882
Still not convenient, still not convenient.

208
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,808
- I'd like to interview first.
- We'll come back, okay?

209
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:07,131
Ms. Weerin...

210
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:09,160
He accused us of cheating,

211
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,241
and when my son went to confront him,

212
00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:15,722
before he could even say anything,
he grabbed metal and wood and stabbed my son!

213
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:17,428
Oh dear,

214
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:20,707
do you want to say anything
to the person who hurt your father?

215
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:22,818
Why hurt my dad?

216
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:25,960
He worked so hard to send me to school.

217
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,433
If something happens to him,
what will happen to me?

218
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:36,840
Dad...

219
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,739
I don't believe
Thaleh would do something like that.

220
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:42,600
Even though Thaleh is hot-headed,
he wouldn't hurt someone first.

221
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,397
I didn't believe it either,

222
00:18:44,397 --> 00:18:48,107
but there were no security cameras
at the scene.

223
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:50,836
By the time someone got to the site,
it had already happened.

224
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:52,726
So all the witnesses are
on Foreman Mhee's side.

225
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:56,160
Does that mean that side
can say whatever they want?

226
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,944
And people will believe it too.

227
00:18:57,944 --> 00:19:01,567
Right now, there's a flood of posts
on Siamraphe's page and Thaleh's IG.

228
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,583
Twitter is pressuring to deny bail.

229
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:07,374
The rider group for Foreman Mhee
doesn't seem willing to back down either.

230
00:19:07,374 --> 00:19:09,541
And what did the police say?

231
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,055
They're still in a meeting.

232
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:14,294
If the meeting takes too long,
bail might be denied.

233
00:19:14,294 --> 00:19:18,010
Another concern is the victim's condition.

234
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:23,021
If he dies,
Thaleh could face a charge of murder.

235
00:19:23,021 --> 00:19:25,680
That would make the case even more difficult.

236
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,840
[Chontharn]

237
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,520
What's up, Chon?

238
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,280
Hello, Dad.
The person who was stabbed has died.

239
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:44,640
That's all for now, Dad.

240
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:50,466
What will happen to me?

241
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,640
[Pasin]

242
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:13,200
Sin, you've seen the news
about Thaleh, right?

243
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,741
I want to bother you
about getting Thaleh bail.

244
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,080
Thaleh.

245
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,792
Let's go home.

246
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:30,800
- Mr. Thaleh.
- Ms. Weerin...

247
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,043
Mr. Thaleh, may I interview you?

248
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:33,648
- Can you share your feelings?
- Mr. Thaleh...

249
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:36,051
Why was bail granted if the victim died?

250
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:39,135
- Why did this happen?
- Why was bail granted if the victim died?

251
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:39,939
Mr. Thaleh.

252
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:41,831
- Why was bail granted if the victim died?
- What responsibility does Siamraphe have?

253
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:43,800
- Why was bail granted if the victim died?
- Answer, please.

254
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,632
- Mr. Thaleh.
- Is there any personal grudge?

255
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:49,021
What everyone knows is one-sided.

256
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:50,442
The truth might be different.

257
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,045
Does this mean you don't admit fault?

258
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:54,042
Do you feel any remorse
for what your child did?

259
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:56,503
- I'm sorry, please don't ask like that.
- Exactly.

260
00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:59,320
Do you think the surname
affects how the case is handled?

261
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,335
Ms. Yai is waiting for everyone.

262
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:10,400
Once it's concluded,
I'll call you immediately.

263
00:22:15,843 --> 00:22:19,432
My dad said Thaleh
might face a serious charge.

264
00:22:19,432 --> 00:22:23,280
Good thing my dad stepped in,
or he'd be in jail tonight.

265
00:22:33,363 --> 00:22:35,390
Look at this, Dao. It's intense in here.

266
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,644
Stop reading, Tawan.

267
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:01,562
Go, go.

268
00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:10,435
Hurry inside, Ms. Yai is waiting.

269
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:12,440
- Come on.
- Let's go.

270
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,085
So, what's the case status, Klang?

271
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:33,584
Thaleh is charged with murder.

272
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:36,495
Because Foreman Mhee's witnesses
falsely accused him.

273
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:41,633
But our lawyer, Wit,
is trying to argue it was self-defense.

274
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,496
The penalties are different.

275
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,735
Police recommend compensating both
the deceased's family and the injured

276
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:47,861
to satisfy relatives.

277
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:50,440
This might lighten the case, Auntie Yai.

278
00:23:51,187 --> 00:23:54,640
I've had my dad's men
talk to the police already, P'Yai.

279
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,465
I have the PR team on standby.
Comments on the store's page are closed.

280
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:06,993
I think we should issue a statement quickly,
before Siamraphe's reputation suffers more.

281
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:10,850
- Klang.
- Yes?

282
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,360
Coordinate with Sin's people about the case.

283
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,971
Chon, help me with the injured and deceased.

284
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:20,979
Yes.

285
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:22,396
As for Lek...

286
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:28,471
Issue a statement
that Siamraphe is not involved in any way.

287
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:29,613
Yes.

288
00:24:29,613 --> 00:24:30,972
Wait, P'Yai.

289
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:34,850
This happened because
Thaleh was protecting Siamraphe's interests.

290
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,802
But now that it's a legal case,
Siamraphe won't protect him at all?

291
00:24:37,802 --> 00:24:41,171
I have to protect Siamraphe.

292
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:43,942
Because if anything happens,
it's not just Thaleh...

293
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:48,751
everyone in Raphethada and tens of thousands
of employees would be affected.

294
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:51,149
I won't let this end on my watch.

295
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:55,372
P'Yai, we're already fixing the problem.

296
00:24:55,372 --> 00:24:57,544
It might not be as bad as we think.

297
00:24:57,544 --> 00:25:00,724
But your son killed someone.

298
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:04,924
As Siamraphe's leader, you should think of
the greater good, not yourself.

299
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:08,708
If you were selfish,
Thaleh would've been sent abroad by now.

300
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,786
- Have you bought the ticket yet?
- Lek!

301
00:25:10,786 --> 00:25:12,600
Enough.

302
00:25:16,935 --> 00:25:19,956
If I cause trouble for everyone,

303
00:25:19,956 --> 00:25:22,426
don't help me.

304
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:28,728
This is exactly why he acts on impulse.

305
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:31,907
Your dad even sent you to ordain,
thinking you'd improve.

306
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:35,284
You're out less than six months
and already causing trouble.

307
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,384
Auntie Yai, please don't scold Thaleh.

308
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:39,644
He got into trouble with Foreman Mhee

309
00:25:39,644 --> 00:25:42,280
- because he was helping me.
- No need, Chon!

310
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:46,416
You and Mom warned me to come back quickly.

311
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,318
I didn't listen.

312
00:25:51,112 --> 00:25:54,240
The family creed says we must be brave.

313
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,783
I acted bravely,
I'll accept the consequences.

314
00:26:02,617 --> 00:26:04,916
Let the law handle it.

315
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,338
Thaleh!

316
00:26:06,338 --> 00:26:07,423
- Thaleh!
- Thaleh!

317
00:26:07,423 --> 00:26:09,320
Thaleh!

318
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,127
Talk to me first.

319
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:20,663
Tell others if asked,
that you have nothing to do with this.

320
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:24,325
It doesn't involve anyone in Raphethada.

321
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:08,904
Dao, Tawan, go shower and sleep.

322
00:27:08,904 --> 00:27:11,270
You have school early tomorrow.

323
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,720
Come on.

324
00:27:28,876 --> 00:27:33,777
Thaleh, shower and rest.

325
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,800
I will handle the rest.

326
00:27:39,729 --> 00:27:42,360
We'll get through this together.

327
00:27:56,446 --> 00:27:59,791
Dad, I'm not okay.

328
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,772
Come talk to me.

329
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,929
I think Siamraphe must stand up for Thaleh.

330
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,658
Let everyone know Foreman Mhee cheated
so he isn't blamed alone.

331
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,336
We shouldn't think about reputation
or profit, Dad.

332
00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:26,337
We should think about his feelings too.

333
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,099
You might think that Auntie Yai and I
are cruel,

334
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,960
leaving Thaleh to fight alone.

335
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:35,435
I understand, Chon.

336
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:41,900
From your perspective,
it's concern for your brother.

337
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:48,184
But try to see it from the perspective
of someone about to lead Siamraphe.

338
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,671
If Siamraphe is dragged into this case...

339
00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:55,280
the company could collapse.

340
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,933
Thaleh would feel even guiltier.

341
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:02,061
But everything's falling apart because of me!
Dad, it's my fault he's like this!

342
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:04,327
Because of me!

343
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:08,061
Because of me!

344
00:29:30,492 --> 00:29:32,623
I'm sorry, Mom.

345
00:29:41,774 --> 00:29:44,320
I'm sorry, Dad.

346
00:29:50,148 --> 00:29:52,040
Chon.

347
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:55,680
I'm sorry.

348
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:09,232
Stay strong, son.

349
00:30:09,232 --> 00:30:11,836
Consider it a lesson.

350
00:30:11,836 --> 00:30:13,647
Learn from it.

351
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:17,788
And get through this.

352
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,726
It may be hard,

353
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:31,200
but at least you still have a family
that loves you.

354
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,133
Still mad enough to punch him?

355
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:22,172
Put him in jail.

356
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:25,085
Our friend said he was hot-headed in school,
picking fights everywhere.

357
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:27,196
Scary. Don't support a killer's store.

358
00:31:27,196 --> 00:31:29,305
Today is the trial,

359
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,982
which is closely watched by the public.

360
00:31:31,982 --> 00:31:35,434
It involves the heir of
a famous department store,

361
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:38,085
who is accused of assault.

362
00:31:38,085 --> 00:31:42,009
Months ago, a brawl led to a death.

363
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:45,360
Thalehluang went to the construction site,

364
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,668
and went on a rampage,
destroying vehicles and equipment.

365
00:31:49,668 --> 00:31:53,736
We tried to stop him,
but there was an argument.

366
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:59,380
And my son unfortunately got caught in it.

367
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,039
My friend only went to help his dad,
trying to talk it out.

368
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,364
But he was stabbed with metal
that was just broken, and died.

369
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:18,320
The hashtag BanSiamraphe
has been trending number 1 for five days.

370
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:23,393
Celebrities canceled work fearing backlash.

371
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:27,720
This happened at Siamraphe
because of your son.

372
00:32:28,889 --> 00:32:30,734
Stop visiting Siamraphe.

373
00:32:30,734 --> 00:32:32,925
Don't support a family of killers.

374
00:32:32,925 --> 00:32:35,705
Thalehluang is known to be hot-headed.

375
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:38,811
He probably thinks being Raphethada
allows him to do whatever he wants.

376
00:32:38,811 --> 00:32:40,083
Lies!

377
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,197
- You're lying!
- Thaleh!

378
00:32:42,197 --> 00:32:44,272
I never started trouble with anyone!

379
00:32:44,272 --> 00:32:46,548
- Why is everyone lying?
- Thaleh!

380
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,096
- Lies! Lies!
- Calm down.

381
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:50,041
- You're lying!
- Calm down!

382
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:53,388
- Thaleh!
- I'm about to launch Midnight Sales.

383
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,075
Customers should start coming back.

384
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:57,614
Will it be in time?

385
00:32:57,614 --> 00:33:01,062
It's been two months
and we've lost nearly half our customers.

386
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,231
And now the tenants are all complaining.

387
00:33:04,231 --> 00:33:05,613
If it doesn't get better,

388
00:33:05,613 --> 00:33:08,800
I'll propose to the board
that we lower the shop rents.

389
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:13,650
And this just in...
the defense has presented key evidence.

390
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,668
It clearly shows that Foreman Mhee

391
00:33:15,668 --> 00:33:19,002
deliberately incited
the rider group and workers to cause trouble.

392
00:33:19,002 --> 00:33:24,724
This evidence could change
the course of the case.

393
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:30,895
This is dashcam footage of my younger brother
trying to defend himself.

394
00:33:30,895 --> 00:33:35,330
The loss that happened
was more of an accident.

395
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:45,066
The law isn't made to punish the rich.
They always walk free.

396
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,720
Give justice to the poor too!

397
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,492
You said this evidence would help.
So where's the improvement?

398
00:33:49,492 --> 00:33:52,760
Since the incident,
profits have dropped by 20%.

399
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,680
You can't let this continue!

400
00:33:57,776 --> 00:34:00,467
It'll be months before the court rules.

401
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:03,234
I think our mall needs to take some action.

402
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:06,168
We still don't know
how the court will decide.

403
00:34:06,168 --> 00:34:09,025
If acquitted, great.

404
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:14,400
But if punished,
the mall will suffer even more.

405
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:19,596
I understand the situation.

406
00:34:19,596 --> 00:34:22,363
But blaming everything on Thalehluang
isn't right.

407
00:34:22,363 --> 00:34:25,480
P'Klang, you can't mix personal matters
with work.

408
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,884
You can't just protect Thaleh
and let everyone else go down.

409
00:34:27,884 --> 00:34:30,760
So that means Thaleh can die, then?

410
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:37,228
The third family creed says
to have faith in the family.

411
00:34:37,228 --> 00:34:39,929
We can still believe in it, can't we?

412
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:44,320
The family creed exists
to protect everyone in Raphethada,

413
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,440
not just one person.

414
00:34:47,303 --> 00:34:51,160
And I won't let Siamraphe end
because of this.

415
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:56,560
What are you going to do, P'Yai?

416
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,560
Lek.

417
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:02,605
Issue a new statement.

418
00:35:02,605 --> 00:35:08,479
From now on, Thalehluang will have
no involvement with Siamraphe,

419
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:11,103
and is removed from all positions
in the company.

420
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:14,244
Siamraphe will not protect the guilty,

421
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:18,560
and will not take responsibility
for any of Thalehluang's actions.

422
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,889
- P'Yai!
- Auntie Yai!

423
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:47,351
The court finds the defendant guilty
of killing another person,

424
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:53,695
with excessive self-defense
under Criminal Code Section 288,

425
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:56,125
in conjunction with Sections 68 and 69.

426
00:35:56,125 --> 00:36:00,944
He is hereby sentenced to
five years imprisonment.

427
00:36:00,944 --> 00:36:05,188
But because the defendant
showed remorse, cooperated,

428
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:10,229
and compensated the victim's family fairly,

429
00:36:10,229 --> 00:36:14,529
and because the defendant
did not provoke the victim first,

430
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:20,175
the court deems it reasonable
to reduce the sentence by one-third.

431
00:36:20,175 --> 00:36:25,200
Final sentence will be
three years and four months.

432
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:39,587
Thaleh!

433
00:36:39,587 --> 00:36:40,800
Take him away.

434
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,101
Thaleh! Thaleh!

435
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,477
Are you okay, son?

436
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,436
Thaleh!

437
00:36:56,436 --> 00:36:58,007
Thaleh!

438
00:37:00,622 --> 00:37:04,393
- It's okay, bro, it's okay.
- Thaleh!

439
00:37:15,827 --> 00:37:17,800
Chon...

440
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:40,670
Side Shower.

441
00:38:46,713 --> 00:38:49,735
Khun P',
what's the fastest way to the office?

442
00:38:49,735 --> 00:38:51,224
Helicopter.

443
00:38:51,224 --> 00:38:53,455
Seriously.

444
00:38:53,455 --> 00:38:57,132
By car, I recommend Rama IV Road,

445
00:38:57,132 --> 00:38:59,739
take the Chalerm Maha Nakhon Expressway,

446
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:03,635
turn onto Rama IX Road
and into the Dao Khanong Expressway,

447
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:07,457
exit at Exit 2 Victory Monument.

448
00:39:07,457 --> 00:39:13,358
Total distance 9.9 km,
24 minutes travel time.

449
00:39:14,282 --> 00:39:17,790
Khun P', call the driver for me.
I'll leave in ten minutes.

450
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,360
Yes.

451
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,887
- Khun P', lock the lights and room.
- Yes.

452
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,561
And this is Raphe High Living Residence,

453
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,908
a luxury condo where you can command

454
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:01,777
your personal assistant Khun P'
from anywhere in the room.

455
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:04,565
Your life will be easier, more convenient,

456
00:40:04,565 --> 00:40:09,025
and you'll have more time
with the ones you love.

457
00:40:19,045 --> 00:40:22,783
Mr. Natee,
what are your expectations for this project?

458
00:40:22,783 --> 00:40:26,867
Before, Siamraphe focused only
on department stores.

459
00:40:26,867 --> 00:40:31,478
Now we think real estate
is an exciting new business,

460
00:40:31,478 --> 00:40:36,079
and we'll make Siamraphe Group
number one in Asia.

461
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,951
So you're confident you can beat competitors?

462
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:43,657
Because Heaven Plaza
just launched a new Little Heaven mascot.

463
00:40:43,657 --> 00:40:47,571
The line to take photos is out the door.

464
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:50,016
We congratulate them.

465
00:40:50,016 --> 00:40:54,385
But now,
Siamraphe isn't just looking at Thailand.

466
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:59,094
We'll make Siamraphe
a check‑in spot for tourists worldwide.

467
00:40:59,094 --> 00:41:02,476
Do you mean the Raphe Complex project?

468
00:41:02,476 --> 00:41:07,250
The one Mr. Chon is negotiating
to buy central city land from Lady Amorn?

469
00:41:09,992 --> 00:41:12,647
News travels fast!

470
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:15,155
By the way, have you seen it yet?

471
00:41:15,155 --> 00:41:20,489
Chon was chosen as one of Asia's
top 10 young entrepreneurs to watch.

472
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:22,826
Let her brag a little.

473
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:24,424
And what about Mr. Thalehluang?

474
00:41:24,424 --> 00:41:29,560
He's been out of prison for months.
Won't he come back to help Siamraphe?

475
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:34,085
Right now, Thaleh is still adjusting.

476
00:41:34,085 --> 00:41:38,826
Today is Chon's day,
so we'll answer only about him.

477
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,194
May we take a photo together?

478
00:41:41,194 --> 00:41:42,572
May we?

479
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:43,911
Of course.

480
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:54,750
Hello, Auntie.

481
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,205
Hello.

482
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,468
Thank you, P'Klang,
for clearing your schedule.

483
00:41:59,468 --> 00:42:01,047
Really you didn't have to.

484
00:42:01,047 --> 00:42:03,436
We already told P'Yai
no welcome party for Mut.

485
00:42:03,436 --> 00:42:05,786
But she insisted.

486
00:42:05,786 --> 00:42:10,640
Well, Mut is her beloved nephew.

487
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:13,551
Of course we'd come.

488
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:21,270
P'Yai wanted to celebrate
Chon's condo project surpassing its target.

489
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:25,068
She's proud of her nephew.

490
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,200
Mom.

491
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:38,000
Hello, Auntie Yai.

492
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,021
How was the latest radiation treatment?

493
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:55,000
Same as always.

494
00:42:56,007 --> 00:43:00,720
Don't worry.
I'm back to help Uncle Klang and Chon.

495
00:43:02,201 --> 00:43:06,219
The boss there really regretted losing Mut.

496
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:10,974
He was about to promote him
to head of Luxury Retail.

497
00:43:10,974 --> 00:43:14,680
Last year,
he increased sales by more than 200%.

498
00:43:15,463 --> 00:43:17,361
But I'm worried about Auntie Yai.

499
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,040
It's my duty to come back
and help take care of Siamraphe.

500
00:43:22,448 --> 00:43:25,040
You're still the same.

501
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:28,861
- Chon.
- Yes.

502
00:43:28,861 --> 00:43:30,665
Very good.

503
00:43:30,665 --> 00:43:35,296
Nam said your new condo is fully booked.

504
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:38,120
Doing all this... are you tired?

505
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,706
I am tired, Auntie Yai.

506
00:43:42,432 --> 00:43:46,699
That's why I want to ask you.
Can I bring Thaleh back to help me?

507
00:43:52,535 --> 00:43:56,000
Wouldn't it be better to have Mut help?
He has experience.

508
00:43:59,528 --> 00:44:04,032
I planned for Mut
to help in Luxury Retail, P'Yai.

509
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:07,678
Since he's already in this field.
What do you think?

510
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,703
I'm fine either way.

511
00:44:10,703 --> 00:44:12,999
But about Thaleh...

512
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:16,920
Ask him first if he wants to come back.

513
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,960
Thank you, Auntie Yai.

514
00:44:26,784 --> 00:44:29,775
Today, I brought you
a belated birthday present.

515
00:44:29,775 --> 00:44:31,120
Hmm?

516
00:44:44,168 --> 00:44:45,673
Chef Taiga.

517
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:49,140
The one from the New York restaurant
you queued two hours for?

518
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,089
Yes.

519
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:54,480
Why wait, Chon? No other restaurants?

520
00:44:56,218 --> 00:44:58,266
Watch your mouth.

521
00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:06,266
Taiga, this is my Aunt Tara.

522
00:45:06,924 --> 00:45:08,455
This is Chef Taiga,

523
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,708
owner of an American‑Japanese
fusion restaurant in New York.

524
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,626
Nice to meet you.

525
00:45:15,233 --> 00:45:19,160
Mahasamut told me a lot about you.

526
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,085
His restaurant is very famous.

527
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,807
He has only three branches worldwide.

528
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:25,990
New York, France, Shanghai.

529
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:30,640
The 4th will be at our Siamraphe.

530
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:42,664
Today is Khun Tara's birthday.

531
00:45:42,664 --> 00:45:47,209
I've made a special meal
for the Raphethada family.

532
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,673
Enjoy.

533
00:46:17,673 --> 00:46:19,600
Thank you.

534
00:46:24,684 --> 00:46:29,128
Thanks to Aunt Nam
for making this surprise happen.

535
00:46:29,128 --> 00:46:31,790
We're one family, we help each other.

536
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,827
Who's family with you?

537
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:35,320
Lek!

538
00:46:36,015 --> 00:46:38,480
I don't like people who forget their place.

539
00:46:41,305 --> 00:46:43,477
Don't worry.

540
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:47,320
I never forget I'm the mistress's child.

541
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,435
Let's eat.

542
00:46:55,435 --> 00:46:56,840
Please.

543
00:47:01,116 --> 00:47:05,236
Mut asked me to help find a location
for Chef Taiga.

544
00:47:06,104 --> 00:47:12,948
So I thought to give him
the front food zone to attract customers.

545
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:17,229
Coincidentally, Ms. On's lease expired.

546
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:22,336
I thought Chef Taiga could open there.

547
00:47:22,336 --> 00:47:26,515
Let Taiga see if he likes that space or not.

548
00:47:26,515 --> 00:47:28,400
Sure.

549
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:39,360
About yesterday, don't mind Lek.
She's always like this.

550
00:47:43,935 --> 00:47:47,055
I wouldn't dare be angry at her.

551
00:47:47,055 --> 00:47:51,699
Khun Yai, Khun Klang,
Khun Lek have all helped me.

552
00:47:52,852 --> 00:47:55,800
Otherwise I might be like...

553
00:47:56,448 --> 00:47:58,600
that mother and child.

554
00:48:00,696 --> 00:48:03,400
But they might be happy.

555
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,724
Have you ever pictured yourself
with a family?

556
00:48:15,555 --> 00:48:17,280
I have.

557
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:24,049
But at that time,
Klang wasn't ready and Lek was too young.

558
00:48:24,049 --> 00:48:26,562
So I chose Siamraphe.

559
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:30,727
You've sacrificed so much.

560
00:48:30,727 --> 00:48:33,386
I want to be like you.

561
00:48:35,253 --> 00:48:37,489
You don't have to be like me.

562
00:48:38,465 --> 00:48:42,640
Just love and do it for Siamraphe.

563
00:48:46,251 --> 00:48:50,659
Yes, I'll do it for Siamraphe.

564
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,360
[Samerdhamma Monastery]

565
00:49:35,645 --> 00:49:37,708
Juat.

566
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,325
Juat.

567
00:49:40,324 --> 00:49:43,298
Stop pressing or the live stream will freeze.

568
00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:44,920
Put it down.

569
00:49:50,005 --> 00:49:52,212
Wow.

570
00:49:52,212 --> 00:49:55,275
Oh wow, nice work.

571
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:59,341
When I was in there, my work sold best.

572
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:02,055
I taught him myself, monk.

573
00:50:02,055 --> 00:50:07,280
If Teacher Juat hadn't taught him,
his work wouldn't be this good.

574
00:50:08,136 --> 00:50:10,082
So much boasting.

575
00:50:13,459 --> 00:50:17,094
I'll make a set for you
to use in the hall and your cell.

576
00:50:17,094 --> 00:50:19,529
Not making one for home?

577
00:50:19,529 --> 00:50:21,780
You've been here almost half a year.

578
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,012
Don't you want to visit home?

579
00:50:24,012 --> 00:50:26,427
I do, monk. I want to go home so badly.

580
00:50:26,427 --> 00:50:29,217
But there's no home to go back to.

581
00:50:29,217 --> 00:50:33,800
Those without homes want to go back.
Those with homes don't want to.

582
00:50:34,682 --> 00:50:37,278
Remember when you first ordained?

583
00:50:37,278 --> 00:50:40,520
You disrobed and rushed home immediately.

584
00:50:41,157 --> 00:50:43,458
I realized I wanted to help others,

585
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,400
like you helped me.

586
00:50:46,163 --> 00:50:49,466
Also, the people at home
probably don't want me back much.

587
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:51,756
Instead of thinking about people
who don't love you,

588
00:50:51,756 --> 00:50:54,320
why not think about people who do?

589
00:50:55,812 --> 00:50:57,534
Because I do think of them.

590
00:50:57,534 --> 00:50:59,830
Everyone's suffered enough
because of me already.

591
00:51:02,285 --> 00:51:03,920
Thaleh!

592
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,864
Greetings, Venerable.

593
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:09,009
Blessings to you.

594
00:51:09,009 --> 00:51:10,546
- Hello, P'Juat.
- Hi.

595
00:51:10,546 --> 00:51:11,640
A gift for you.

596
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,972
Hey, this is for me?

597
00:51:12,972 --> 00:51:14,478
- Of course. Take a look.
- Hey.

598
00:51:14,478 --> 00:51:19,440
Hey, this is... wow, it's beautiful.

599
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,863
Venerable,

600
00:51:21,863 --> 00:51:25,852
I came to ask if I could take
my younger brother home for three days.

601
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,440
What you just thought,
you might have imagined it.

602
00:51:58,841 --> 00:52:01,420
Yay!

603
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,940
- We won!
- Yeah, we won!

604
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,014
Can't handle it.

605
00:52:15,545 --> 00:52:18,250
Wow... it took Thaleh forever
to make that shot.

606
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,680
I lost count of how many attempts.

607
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,497
He's good.

608
00:52:22,497 --> 00:52:25,706
- What? You're tired already?
- Wow.

609
00:52:25,706 --> 00:52:27,351
Too used to sitting on chairs
in the air-conditioned room, right?

610
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:29,759
Wow, look at him talk.

611
00:52:29,759 --> 00:52:32,415
No one is helping me.

612
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:36,812
I already spoke to Auntie Yai.
She said to ask you.

613
00:52:37,611 --> 00:52:39,343
Auntie Yai just said that.

614
00:52:39,343 --> 00:52:44,368
Thaleh, I agree with Chon.

615
00:52:44,368 --> 00:52:49,017
And this next project,
the land we got from Lady Amorn is huge.

616
00:52:49,017 --> 00:52:51,111
We can't handle it alone.

617
00:52:51,775 --> 00:52:54,080
Thaleh, come back to help Chon.

618
00:52:57,561 --> 00:52:59,800
Like Dad had Mom's help.

619
00:53:00,698 --> 00:53:02,896
Then you should get a wife, not me.

620
00:53:02,896 --> 00:53:05,494
Huh? Arguing?

621
00:53:05,494 --> 00:53:07,991
Arguing?

622
00:53:09,821 --> 00:53:12,684
You think everyone won't forgive you, right?

623
00:53:12,684 --> 00:53:16,951
If that's the case, you need to hurry back
and show everyone you've changed.

624
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:21,254
I've changed.

625
00:53:21,254 --> 00:53:23,400
But can they change?

626
00:53:32,902 --> 00:53:35,356
Then can you promise me?

627
00:53:36,135 --> 00:53:39,322
If one day, the family needs you,

628
00:53:39,322 --> 00:53:41,502
you must return immediately.

629
00:53:41,502 --> 00:53:46,052
Just like the LINE group Dad named:
Together we stand.

630
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:55,760
So outdated.

631
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,863
It's called classic.

632
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,027
- Dad, let go.
- Outdated, huh?

633
00:54:06,027 --> 00:54:08,127
- Outdated?
- I give in.

634
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,720
Take it slow, son.

635
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,211
I'm sorry, Dad.

636
00:54:11,211 --> 00:54:13,115
Ouch!

637
00:54:13,115 --> 00:54:14,855
- What the...
- What is this?

638
00:54:14,855 --> 00:54:16,439
- Ouch!
- Here.

639
00:54:16,439 --> 00:54:17,717
Ouch, Mom!

640
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,040
The beef's here!

641
00:54:43,076 --> 00:54:44,520
Wow.

642
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:47,854
Ready to eat.

643
00:54:47,854 --> 00:54:50,383
- Chon, pour the wine.
- Oh, almost forgot.

644
00:54:50,383 --> 00:54:52,257
Dad first.

645
00:54:52,257 --> 00:54:54,295
- So fast, huh?
- Hungry, right?

646
00:54:54,295 --> 00:54:55,420
Hungry, right?

647
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:58,172
- Try a small piece first.
- Just a little.

648
00:54:58,172 --> 00:55:01,256
- Haven't eaten in a while.
- If not enough, we'll add more.

649
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,160
- Come on.
- Thank you.

650
00:55:06,863 --> 00:55:09,080
I miss your grilled meat.

651
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,561
Then stay together.

652
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:14,000
Dad will make it for you every day. Deal?

653
00:55:20,408 --> 00:55:23,191
P' Thaleh won't eat. He's at the monastery.

654
00:55:23,191 --> 00:55:24,929
We don't need it then.

655
00:55:24,929 --> 00:55:26,793
Sit down.

656
00:55:26,793 --> 00:55:28,847
Observing precepts, aren't you?

657
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:34,140
When will you stop picking at the vegetables?
That's why you're so little.

658
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,774
- Ouch, and stop complaining.
- Hey!

659
00:55:37,774 --> 00:55:39,859
Shorty.

660
00:55:39,859 --> 00:55:41,656
P' Chon.

661
00:55:42,822 --> 00:55:44,360
Eat some.

662
00:55:44,998 --> 00:55:46,640
Hurry.

663
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:51,617
See? That's what a good brother does.

664
00:55:51,617 --> 00:55:53,911
What's so good?
That's called spoiling the younger.

665
00:55:53,911 --> 00:55:55,148
Don't criticize him, okay?

666
00:55:55,148 --> 00:55:57,366
Fine, we'll say it instead.

667
00:55:57,366 --> 00:56:00,305
Already grown,
yet still acting like a child with him.

668
00:56:00,305 --> 00:56:02,372
Jealous, huh? Can't do it yourself, right?

669
00:56:02,372 --> 00:56:05,864
Oh, stop arguing, you two.
What's wrong with you?

670
00:56:05,864 --> 00:56:08,480
Every time you meet, you argue.

671
00:56:09,097 --> 00:56:10,286
Exactly.

672
00:56:10,286 --> 00:56:14,898
Tomorrow, Dad, Mom, and Chon won't be here.
We're going to Phuket.

673
00:56:14,898 --> 00:56:17,400
Don't fight while I'm gone, okay?

674
00:56:18,178 --> 00:56:19,960
Understand?

675
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,579
- Come
- Eat.

676
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:24,407
- I will cut for you.
- Ouch, no need.

677
00:56:24,407 --> 00:56:26,710
- No need, Mom.
- It's okay, Mom. Here, Dad will do it.

678
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,010
- Hey, I will do it.
- I will do it.

679
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,640
Chon, no need.

680
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,111
- Oops!
- Dad.

681
00:56:32,111 --> 00:56:33,440
Ouch.

682
00:56:35,845 --> 00:56:37,307
It's just a little cut.

683
00:56:37,307 --> 00:56:39,739
- I will get the medicine.
- Yeah, get the medicine.

684
00:56:39,739 --> 00:56:42,920
Why fight over it?

685
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:47,080
I'm trying to please.

686
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,781
Everyone, just a little.

687
00:56:56,502 --> 00:56:58,316
Wow.

688
00:56:58,316 --> 00:57:01,196
Mom, rest. I will go with Dad.

689
00:57:01,196 --> 00:57:05,000
No, I have an appointment with Aunt Ploy.

690
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:12,174
Mom, if you go while still sick,
Ploy will scold you.

691
00:57:12,994 --> 00:57:16,720
So, rest properly, you stubborn one.

692
00:57:21,145 --> 00:57:22,760
Good.

693
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,790
Ouch. What are you doing, Chon?

694
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,489
It's rare to see Mom sick.

695
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,891
Let's take a picture.

696
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:34,244
Hurry, Dad. Come.

697
00:57:34,244 --> 00:57:37,000
- Come.
- Gen Z style.

698
00:57:39,104 --> 00:57:40,800
Smile, Mom.

699
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:45,471
- I'll send it to the younger ones.
- Another Gen in the photo.

700
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:48,006
See you this evening, Mom.

701
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,160
- Yes.
- Get well soon.

702
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,240
[Together we stand]

703
00:57:52,694 --> 00:57:54,502
You must recover quickly.

704
00:57:54,502 --> 00:57:58,219
Once I sign with Lady Amorn,
Auntie Yai will throw a celebration party.

705
00:57:58,219 --> 00:58:00,021
You must come.

706
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:09,737
Hello, I'm about to board to the island.
How's Mom?

707
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:11,505
She wouldn't sleep earlier.

708
00:58:11,505 --> 00:58:13,520
She's talking to Jom.

709
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,354
So I made her take her medicine.
She should be asleep now.

710
00:58:16,354 --> 00:58:18,142
Please take care of her.

711
00:58:18,142 --> 00:58:19,800
See you this evening.

712
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,226
Okay.

713
00:58:21,226 --> 00:58:22,663
Please.

714
00:58:24,403 --> 00:58:26,692
- Come on.
- Come on.

715
00:58:26,692 --> 00:58:28,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

716
00:58:32,029 --> 00:58:34,461
Watch your head, Dad.

717
00:59:12,954 --> 00:59:16,280
- Come, Dad, take a photo to show Mom.
- Come.

718
00:59:23,808 --> 00:59:24,824
- Wow, Dad.
- Huh?

719
00:59:24,824 --> 00:59:26,536
There it is, that island.

720
00:59:27,308 --> 00:59:29,105
See it?

721
00:59:29,105 --> 00:59:30,453
Wow.

722
00:59:30,453 --> 00:59:32,640
- Beautiful.
- Very.

723
00:59:34,524 --> 00:59:36,960
Take a photo to show Mom.

724
00:59:46,092 --> 00:59:48,596
- Captain, what's wrong, Captain?
- Captain?

725
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:53,394
- Captain!
- Hey, hey.

726
00:59:53,394 --> 00:59:54,840
Captain, what's wrong?

727
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,420
- Hey, Captain!
- Captain!

728
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,360
- Wake up.
- Captain, wake up.

729
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:02,442
- Captain!
- Captain!

730
01:00:02,442 --> 01:00:04,090
Captain!

731
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:05,202
Captain!

732
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:07,423
Captain!
