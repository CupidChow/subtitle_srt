1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
You lied to me, didn't you?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,244
You lied to me!

3
00:00:04,244 --> 00:00:07,813
I trusted you. And you betrayed me!

4
00:00:09,947 --> 00:00:11,716
You lied to me!

5
00:00:14,053 --> 00:00:15,716
Enough!

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,760
That's enough!

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,283
You brought this clip here
because you want to destroy Anda,

8
00:00:20,283 --> 00:00:22,751
to put him in prison like your own son,
right?

9
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:24,653
Get a grip, Lek.

10
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:28,178
Dao's in that clip too.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,604
Mom and I brought it to Aunt Yai and Aunt Lek

12
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:37,302
because we wanted to ask
what we should do next.

13
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:41,289
Please delete it. Delete the clip, okay?

14
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:42,693
We've already got enough trouble.

15
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:44,378
Ever since Nali went live to expose Mut,

16
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,600
now Mut's missing,
and I keep calling but he won't answer.

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,145
- You...
- Yai, please...

18
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:50,631
you have to help your nephew.

19
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:53,644
Lek, instead of worrying about the case,

20
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:56,058
shouldn't you be worried
about Dao and Anda first?

21
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,750
How's Dao doing now?

22
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:06,391
Not great. I'm thinking of taking her
to see a psychiatrist.

23
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:09,676
Because once she accepts the truth,

24
00:01:09,676 --> 00:01:13,342
she'll have to relive it again and again.

25
00:01:13,342 --> 00:01:17,276
I just want her strong enough to handle it.

26
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:22,298
As for Anda, I've been trying
to get him to see a doctor too.

27
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:24,182
But he refuses.

28
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:29,200
And if he finds out this clip still exists,
he'll completely break down.

29
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,516
Weerin, please delete it.

30
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:40,298
You're a mother too.

31
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:47,880
You know how much it hurt
when Thaleh was in prison.

32
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:52,533
Anda's not as strong as he was.

33
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:56,729
If he ends up in there, he won't survive.

34
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:01,284
I'm begging you.

35
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:03,333
- Lek.
- I'm begging you.

36
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,276
Please delete this clip.

37
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:09,458
Lek, instead of hiding your child's mistake,

38
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:14,044
why don't you help him face it
and make it right?

39
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:15,920
Wouldn't that be better?

40
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:22,173
And that tennis coach. He didn't do it.

41
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:24,320
But he's paying the price because...

42
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:27,331
Because what?

43
00:02:29,213 --> 00:02:31,720
I've been wondering that too.

44
00:02:33,764 --> 00:02:35,920
He's connected to you, isn't he?

45
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:38,822
Huh?

46
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:40,640
Isn't he, Lek?

47
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,662
Aunt Yai, there's something else.

48
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:50,516
I got this clip from Dernthap, Jaruek's son.

49
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:54,196
He got it from Aunt Nam.

50
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:01,862
Seenam worked with Master Kee.

51
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:05,867
She must have planned to use this clip
to destroy us.

52
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:14,329
The only move she has left...

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,342
is to stir up the case between Mut and Nali.

54
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:24,413
I'll have Pat gather evidence
to take her down.

55
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,684
Then I'll find Mut as soon as possible.

56
00:03:36,987 --> 00:03:40,378
I know I was wrong for getting involved
with Pipe.

57
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:42,978
I hated that Sin cheated.

58
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:45,000
But I ended up doing the same thing.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,440
Pipe was there for me when I was weakest...

60
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:55,480
when even my own child pushed me away,
and Sin didn't care.

61
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:59,418
He was the only one beside me.

62
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:04,196
And what about now?

63
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:06,760
Why did you let yourself become so weak?

64
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,800
What did Sin do to you?

65
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:14,560
Lek, you have to tell me.

66
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,587
We're already this far.
You can't keep me in the dark.

67
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:20,827
I can help you.

68
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,756
He beat me.

69
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:41,533
From the first time I caught him cheating.

70
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:45,511
When I said I'd tell you,

71
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:49,396
he beat me and threatened me to keep quiet.

72
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:51,591
Why did you let him?

73
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,520
Our family doesn't have to bow to him.

74
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,702
What reason did you have to endure this, huh?

75
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:07,982
I didn't want to lose to you.

76
00:05:09,347 --> 00:05:10,476
Lek.

77
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,000
I know.

78
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:16,364
I know Pasin only married me
because he was forced to.

79
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:22,147
But he's never been able to let go of you.

80
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:26,920
Every time you were with Klang,
I saw the way he looked at you.

81
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:31,133
I kept telling myself to endure it.

82
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,400
That I would never lose.

83
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:50,907
How many years has it been, Lek? Huh?

84
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:53,467
Why didn't you tell me?

85
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,720
Don't throw your life away just to beat me.

86
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:15,062
You've always had more than I do.

87
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:20,969
A family that loves and supports you.

88
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:27,030
I never wanted perfection.

89
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:30,471
I just want to see you happy.

90
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:36,307
If you don't love him anymore, leave him.

91
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:39,156
I won't let anyone hurt my sister again.

92
00:06:40,702 --> 00:06:42,160
Yai.

93
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,471
Okay?

94
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:16,449
Dad.

95
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:19,458
Don't forget our deal.

96
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:22,142
Yeah, son. Thanks.

97
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:29,151
I won't forget.

98
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:33,920
If you can beat me,
Seenam won't have to work for me.

[Jaruek: 2; Dernthap: 0]

105
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:04,720
You cheated, Dad!
You broke the rules on purpose!

106
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:06,396
That's right.

107
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:08,200
Hey. Don't.

108
00:09:09,284 --> 00:09:11,093
I cheated on purpose.

109
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,813
I promised to race you.
I never promised not to cheat.

110
00:09:14,813 --> 00:09:17,511
Remember this.
Before you try to be a good person,

111
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:19,520
you have to be smart enough to survive first.

112
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,196
Otherwise,
you'll get lost in someone else's game.

113
00:09:21,196 --> 00:09:24,493
Just like how you couldn't catch up to me.

114
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:28,058
But I believe even without cheating,
I can still win.

115

00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:35,924
Follow me!

Hey!

118
00:09:45,476 --> 00:09:46,747
Sorry, everyone.

120
00:10:02,924 --> 00:10:04,707
Where's your phone?

121
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:07,382
Send me the clip you got from Seenam.

122
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:11,542
- Did Nam tell you already?
- Yes, she did.

123
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:14,298
Do you even know how important that clip is?

124
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:17,164
Nam and I spent years trying to get it.

125
00:10:17,164 --> 00:10:19,804
Just a little more
and Siamraphe will be mine.

126
00:10:19,804 --> 00:10:21,862
Then it'll be yours.

127
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:25,222
- But I don't want to win by cheating!
- Oh, please.

128
00:10:25,222 --> 00:10:30,778
If you want to change the world,
you have to survive in it first.

129
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:32,431
Give me the clip!

130
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:36,364
I don't have it anymore.

131
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:39,178
What do you mean, you don't?

132
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:43,911
Don't tell me you deleted it like an idiot.

133
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,733
Who did you send it to?

134
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:47,244
Who?

135
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:50,858
Speak!

00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:01,898
I'll play fair. Unlike you.

00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:10,040
I'm not done. Get back here!

139
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:30,587
Hello?

140
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:35,818
I think Dernthap already gave the clip
to the Siamraphe people.

141
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:38,613
Who did he give it to?

142
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:40,671
I asked, but he wouldn't say.

143
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:45,209
That's fine. I'll find out myself.

144
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:54,369
Odd, please hurry today.

145
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:56,292
Mom wants me home early.

146
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:57,316
Sure thing.

147
00:12:37,662 --> 00:12:40,320
Mr. Tawan, Ms. Nam is here.

148
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:47,756
Hello, Aunt Nam.

149
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:49,960
Are you here to see Mom?

150
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,902
Yes.

151
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:54,640
I called, but she didn't pick up.

152
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,964
Someone at the company said
she came home already.

153
00:12:58,964 --> 00:13:01,142
Mom's in a meeting upstairs.

154
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:04,240
She told me not to let anyone disturb her.

155
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,862
Once she's done,
I'll have her call you, okay?

156
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:12,538
Can't you tell her now? It's urgent.

157
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:15,876
Sorry, Aunt Nam, I really can't.
She's still in a meeting.

158
00:13:16,938 --> 00:13:18,720
Why not?

159
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:23,316
You're not lying to me, right?

160
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:25,440
Or maybe she's not even home.

161
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,640
Why would I lie about that?

162
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:32,084
Then I'll just go see for myself.

163
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:34,738
Wait, Aunt Nam.

164
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:39,044
You shouldn't just barge
into someone's house.

165
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,000
Dao, you've lost weight.

166
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:48,258
Stressed about something?

167
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:55,098
Please go home, Aunt Nam. Mom's really busy.

168
00:13:55,098 --> 00:13:58,440
I didn't see you at Master Kee's funeral.

169
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,498
I thought you two were close.

170
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:03,680
You worked together, right?

171
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,440
If I could turn back time,

172
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,431
I'd never get close to someone like that.

173
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,596
Oh really?

174
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:15,822
I thought you were close. Maybe even dating.

175
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,044
What happened between you two?

176
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,529
If you've got time to gossip,

177
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:30,142
I guess your business with Mom
isn't that important after all.

178
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:32,120
Please see yourself out, Aunt Nam.

179
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:38,262
Oh. Ms. Nam, what brings you here?

180
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:40,169
Tawan, your mom's upstairs, right?

181
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:42,112
I brought her some documents.

182
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:43,404
I'm heading upstairs.

183
00:14:47,308 --> 00:14:49,356
Is something going on?

184
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:52,853
Aunt Nam didn't believe
Mom's actually in a meeting.

185
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:57,760
Ms. Nam, Tawan's not lying.
Here, I brought the documents.

186
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,338
Excuse me now.

187
00:15:08,844 --> 00:15:10,240
Aunt Nam.

188
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:25,476
How did you get here?

189
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:30,169
Thaleh sent me to keep an eye on you two.

190
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:32,676
He thought Nam would come looking for Weerin.

191
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:34,822
And he was right.

192
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:37,440
But why did Thaleh tell us to lie to her?

193
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,763
Let's wait until Ms. Weerin and Thaleh
get back.

194
00:15:39,763 --> 00:15:41,373
They'll explain everything then.

195
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:47,524
Tawan, call your mom and tell her
that Ms. Nam's heading to Ms. Yai's house.

196
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:48,720
Okay.

197
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:56,062
Wit, gather all the evidence first.

198
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:58,587
If we can't reach an agreement with Sin...

199
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,924
we'll take it to court.

200
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:04,280
Do you want to sue for adultery or divorce?

201
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:09,213
Divorce.

202
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:32,511
Did Nam go to see me at home?

203
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:40,031
Seenam is on her way back here.

204
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:10,978
Who are you looking for?

205
00:17:15,227 --> 00:17:17,764
You, of course.

206
00:17:17,764 --> 00:17:19,440
What are you doing?

207
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:24,067
Nothing. Just walking, lost in thought.

208
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,084
And you?

209
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:30,427
I heard from Oil
you went out early this morning.

210
00:17:30,427 --> 00:17:31,893
Where'd you go?

211
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:35,222
I went to settle things
with one of our tenants.

212
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,880
They're worried about Mut's name
being linked to shady business.

213
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,289
No matter how much I explained,
they didn't believe me.

214
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:48,200
So I thought I'd ask Ms. Rin and Thaleh
for advice,

215
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,280
but neither of them picked up their phones.

216
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:58,124
I even went to their house earlier.

217
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:00,604
Tawan wouldn't let me see them.

218
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:03,880
Have you seen the two of them today?

219
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,600
Not yet.

220
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:12,520
But Weerin called me.

221
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,751
Called you?

222
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:17,053
About what?

223
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:18,640
About...

224
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,933
the 58th anniversary event.

225
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:25,480
She's busy planning it right now.

226
00:18:26,698 --> 00:18:28,458
Why?

227
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,867
Is there something else I should know?

228
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,016
No, nothing.

229
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:44,004
Wanna play Jenga with me?

230
00:18:53,404 --> 00:18:54,729
Sure.

231
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:58,351
But the game just started,

232
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:00,360
so it might take a while.

233
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:05,929
That's okay, I'll finish it for you.

234
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:21,164
Mom.

235
00:19:21,164 --> 00:19:23,827
Did Aunt Nam know you were at Aunt Yai's?

236
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:27,884
No. As soon as Tawan told me, I snuck out.

237
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:30,320
Dao, Tawan, you two have to be careful.

238
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,418
Don't trust Aunt Nam.

239
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:35,573
She's the one who told me
to consult with Master Kee about the shop.

240
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:45,440
Hello? Thaleh?

241
00:19:46,364 --> 00:19:49,960
I'm at your house,
Dao and Tawan are here as well.

242
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,934
Hold on.

243
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:56,338
Mom, I went to look for Mut
at his friends' places.

244
00:19:56,338 --> 00:19:57,724
I couldn't find him.

245
00:19:57,724 --> 00:20:00,062
No one would take him in.

246
00:20:00,062 --> 00:20:02,400
They're all afraid of getting involved
in the case.

247
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,427
He must be furious. Everyone's rejecting him.

248
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:06,444
Yeah.

249
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:10,329
But don't worry, Mom. I'll find him.

250
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:13,058
Don't do anything reckless, Thaleh.

251
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:16,204
- Just bring Mut home.
- Yes, Mom.

252
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:24,249
Officer, how do you know Mut's father
doesn't know where that safe house is?

253
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:26,471
He's got connections everywhere.

254
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:29,609
I'm not accusing you. It's just true.

255
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,636
I don't want to take any more risks.

256
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:35,329
But don't worry, I've got my own safe house.

257
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:48,507
Where are you going?

258
00:20:48,507 --> 00:20:50,658
What are you doing?

259
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,891
Come here.

260
00:20:56,891 --> 00:21:00,040
Didn't we agree that if I paid you
ten million, you wouldn't expose me?

261
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,547
Why didn't you keep your word?

262
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:05,884
You think ten million is enough
after what you did to me?

263
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:07,973
Someone must've hired you to expose me.

264
00:21:07,973 --> 00:21:09,431
Jaruek, right?

265
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:11,778
If I were you,
I wouldn't be standing here asking questions.

266
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:14,413
I'd be running as far away as possible.

267
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:17,569
Or maybe you can't run.
No one to help you, huh?

268
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,400
Your dad and grandpa, maybe?

269
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:22,951
Happy now that you humiliated me?

270
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:27,071
If you are, then go clear up the story.
Then we'll call it even.

271
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:29,013
Siamraphe must be really powerful, huh?

272
00:21:29,013 --> 00:21:30,600
To make you think like this.

273
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,040
What you went through
is nothing compared to what I did.

274
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,920
You know what I thought about
when they shaved my head?

275
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,872
I thought about your face.

276
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:42,169
And I told myself I had to survive
long enough to take revenge on you.

277
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:44,447
Where are you going?
So you're really not going to let this go?

278
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:47,684
- Yeah, what about it?
- You're not letting it go, huh?

279
00:21:47,684 --> 00:21:49,836
Come here.

280
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,707
Who the hell do you think you are?
To ruin my life like this?

281
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:57,444
I'm the heir of Siamraphe!

282
00:21:57,444 --> 00:21:58,778
You want money that bad, huh?

283
00:21:58,778 --> 00:22:00,360
You just want to get rich, don't you?

284
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,187
You're just a greedy woman.

285
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,111
I'll kill you right here.

286
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,991
You want money? Then die for it.

287
00:22:11,551 --> 00:22:13,840
- Mut!
- Let go! Let go!

288
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,458
- That's enough!
- Let me go!

289
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,058
- Calm down!
- Calm down? Screw that!

290
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:19,142
You wouldn't understand
till it happens to you! Let go!

291
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:21,880
- Nali! Let go!
- Get a grip!

292
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,347
Let go of me!

293
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,031
Come back here!

294
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,484
Come back!

295
00:22:28,484 --> 00:22:30,160
Let go!

296
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:33,560
Focus, damn it!

297
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,182
Pull yourself together!

298
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:49,044
Why the hell are you stopping me?

299
00:22:49,044 --> 00:22:52,040
If I'd killed her just now,
I'd lose my future.

300
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,453
And you'd have no rival left,
you'd become Siamraphe's next leader, right?

301
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:57,138
Is that all you can think of?

302
00:22:57,978 --> 00:23:01,542
You used to look down on me,
always mouthing off.

303
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:03,902
Now's the time to do better, isn't it?

304
00:23:07,693 --> 00:23:10,084
Do you know what I've been through?

305
00:23:10,084 --> 00:23:13,191
My dad yelled at me, kicked me out,

306
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:16,067
my grandpa scolded me for bringing him shame.

307
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:17,880
And my friends, none of them gave a damn.

308
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,942
I feel like I'm nothing.
Like a piece of garbage.

309
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:22,933
Listen to me. I get it.

310
00:23:23,707 --> 00:23:25,729
Because when I went through it,

311
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:27,653
everyone turned on me too.

312
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:31,129
I made it through. So you can too.

313
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:36,151
What matters is,
you still have Aunt Yai, your mom,

314
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:39,587
my mom, and me.

315
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:41,271
We're all here for you.

316
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:43,084
Why are you helping me, Thaleh?

317
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,511
Don't you hate me?

318
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,796
Yeah, I do.

319
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:50,244
But you're still a Raphethada.

320
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:54,991
Family Code, Article 3.

321
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:58,338
Trust in family.

322
00:23:58,338 --> 00:23:59,916
Remember?

323
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:11,258
I don't even know what to do anymore.

324
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:13,511
What should I do?

325
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,804
Can you just trust me for once?

326
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:36,533
You serious, Thaleh?

327
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:39,218
Yes.

328
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:43,924
It's safe here. No one can reach him.

329
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:48,578
I think keeping Mut here
will help him clear his mind.

330
00:24:48,578 --> 00:24:50,356
When you teach someone,

331
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:52,311
you have to see if they're willing to learn.

332
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:56,564
If they're not,
it's like throwing a rock at a wall.

333
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:58,924
Nothing gets through.

334
00:25:03,773 --> 00:25:05,053
Mut.

335
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:07,880
Didn't you say you'd trust me?

336
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:25,240
I'd like to stay here too, monk.

337
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,613
Juat, prepare a room for him.

338
00:25:33,622 --> 00:25:35,467
Hey.

339
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,227
Make sure it has air conditioning.

340
00:25:37,227 --> 00:25:39,831
- Want a pool villa too?
- Got one?

341
00:25:45,702 --> 00:25:47,284
Huh?

342
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:49,538
Mut's at a monastery?

343
00:25:50,502 --> 00:25:52,960
Thaleh said it's the safest place.

344
00:25:53,591 --> 00:25:56,258
No reporters can get in.

345
00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:58,556
That's why I came right away,

346
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,533
so you don't have to worry about him.

347
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,280
Take things one at a time, Lek.

348
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,609
When Thaleh was in trouble...

349
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,382
how did you get through it?

350
00:26:18,858 --> 00:26:22,778
I didn't know if I could.

351
00:26:23,547 --> 00:26:25,618
But when I thought about my son...

352
00:26:26,907 --> 00:26:28,840
I had to.

353
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,413
At least with Mut there,
we can breathe easier now.

354
00:26:37,187 --> 00:26:38,907
He's safe there.

355
00:26:38,907 --> 00:26:43,920
He won't do anything reckless.

356
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,058
But what about Anda?

357
00:26:50,213 --> 00:26:53,387
It's clear in the clip.
Anda was the one who...

358
00:26:55,693 --> 00:26:58,316
I should take him to see a doctor.

359
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,400
And Pipe too.

360
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,924
He's caught up in this because of me.

361
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:10,298
Is Yai going to cut Anda off,
like she did with Thaleh?

362
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:15,951
Back then, I understood.

363
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:19,853
She had to protect Siamraphe.

364
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:25,480
But now, it's chaos again.

365
00:27:26,756 --> 00:27:30,000
She won't help Mut or Anda this time,
will she?

366
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,249
Lek.

367
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:35,862
Before you expect others to help,

368
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,564
you have to help your own child first.

369
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:45,364
What should I do?

370
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:46,924
Your child did wrong.

371
00:27:47,738 --> 00:27:51,911
He has to face it.

372
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:54,680
The more he runs away,

373
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,876
the worse it'll get.

374
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,987
You have to talk to Anda.

375
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:04,084
Help him find the courage to face the truth.

376
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,164
You mean...

377
00:28:09,164 --> 00:28:11,938
you want me to tell Anda to turn himself in?

378
00:28:19,524 --> 00:28:20,787
Lek.

379
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:04,578
I'll fix you, you sick bastard of a son.

380
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:06,444
Dad, please don't hurt me!

381
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,716
What sick bastard.

382
00:29:08,716 --> 00:29:10,684
Dad, stop, it hurts!

383
00:30:11,084 --> 00:30:15,160
Breaking news. Police have arrested
the suspect behind Nali's abduction,

384
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,920
Manop Nathongphoom.

385
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,877
After actress and influencer Nali
was kidnapped

386
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:22,800
and forced into a call-center scam,

387
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,973
the suspect denies all charges.

388
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:29,542
However,
police claim they have solid evidence

389
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:33,511
and are now linking the case
to Pasin Weerakitkamon,

390
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:36,236
father of Mahasamut, Nali's ex-boyfriend,

391
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:41,911
with whom she had prior conflicts.

392
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:49,716
Authorities believe several
high-ranking officials may also be involved.

393
00:30:49,716 --> 00:30:56,027
Meanwhile, Mahasamut Weerakitkamon
remains at large.

394
00:30:56,027 --> 00:31:01,773
Anyone who spots him is urged
to contact local police immediately.

395
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:04,431
And the Siamraphe saga continues.

396
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:09,316
An update on the murder of
renowned astrologer Master Keeta,

397
00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:11,880
family astrologer to the Raphethadas.

398
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:18,658
The court has approved the detention
of tennis coach Prakarn Tharaphon,

399
00:31:18,658 --> 00:31:23,538
who maintains his innocence.

400
00:31:24,804 --> 00:31:26,107
I'm sorry.

401
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:30,360
Mom, I can't stand this.

402
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,400
Coach Pipe is taking the blame
even though he's innocent.

403
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:40,356
- Should I tell the truth?
- Dao!

404
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:43,996
Do you dare to say?

405
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,760
If you do, then Anda will go to prison too.

406
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:12,431
I know it's hard.

407
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,400
But I want you to tell the truth.

408
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,622
You're the victim, Dao.

409
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:28,031
What happened doesn't define your worth.

410
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:33,053
As for Anda,

411
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:35,093
I've spoken with Lek.

412
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:38,124
She'll talk to Anda herself.

413
00:32:39,018 --> 00:32:43,440
If he's ready,
we'll go to the police together.

414
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:48,058
Dao.

415
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:50,284
Don't be afraid.

416
00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:54,138
You and Anda were both victims of Master Kee.

417
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:59,844
The court will see that.

418
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:09,347
But will Anda be okay?

419
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:12,302
He looked terrifying that day, Mom.

420
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:28,800
What are you doing, son?

421
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:33,449
Just a report. My friend sent it.

422
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,524
I think I'm going to drop out.

423
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:47,320
What? Why?

424
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:51,484
I'll turn myself in.

425
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,814
Everyone can finally be at peace
once it's over.

426
00:33:57,604 --> 00:33:59,138
Anda.

427
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,560
Aunt Yai will be relieved.

428
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,151
Siamraphe won't lose more face.

429
00:34:07,356 --> 00:34:11,289
Aunt Rin won't have to stress.

430
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:13,342
Dao won't have to keep lying for me.

431
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:16,760
Mom, you'll be at ease...

432
00:34:17,716 --> 00:34:19,938
knowing Coach Pipe won't take the fall.

433
00:34:21,249 --> 00:34:26,129
And Dad. He won't have to look at
his 'perverted' son anymore.

434
00:34:27,813 --> 00:34:29,142
Anda...

435
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:35,600
whatever happens, I'll be by your side.

436
00:34:39,307 --> 00:34:44,364
Everyone must face the consequences
of what they've done, Mom.

437
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:40,262
You should use another garland.

438
00:35:43,698 --> 00:35:44,991
Thanks.

439
00:35:54,524 --> 00:35:57,062
Nas stayed loyal to me until death.

440
00:35:59,729 --> 00:36:02,080
I should honor that.

441
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:06,520
I just don't want you and Dad
to go any further down this path.

442
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,933
Wrong against who?

443
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,813
If it's against people who looked down on me,
then I'm right.

444
00:36:15,027 --> 00:36:18,120
People like you, who were born lucky...

445
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:24,262
You'll never understand
how hard I've had to fight to get here.

446
00:36:24,262 --> 00:36:26,364
But now you have me.

447
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:28,636
You don't have to fight anymore.

448
00:36:29,764 --> 00:36:31,760
I will take care of you.

449
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,280
What we have is enough.

450
00:36:40,636 --> 00:36:42,000
Thap.

451
00:36:43,249 --> 00:36:47,240
Have you ever lived in a house
with just ten baht left?

452
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,671
You wouldn't know, Thap.

453
00:36:53,782 --> 00:36:59,124
You've never feared, hunger,
never feared being poor.

454
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,449
Your 'enough' isn't the same as mine.

455
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:10,471
So you're not going to stop?

456
00:37:11,111 --> 00:37:14,391
Where's the clip?

457
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:22,182
- Where is it?
- Nam.

458
00:37:22,182 --> 00:37:23,467
Nam!

459
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:25,564
- Where is it?
- Stop, Nam.

460
00:37:25,564 --> 00:37:27,356
I gave it to Thaleh.

461
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,653
And I deleted all copies from my phone.

462
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:34,484
Go home.

463
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:37,213
You have no right to pay respects
to my mother.

464
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:44,573
Go!

465
00:37:44,573 --> 00:37:46,524
Why are you still here? Go!

466
00:37:46,524 --> 00:37:49,938
- Go back!
- Nam, please. Listen.

467
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:53,280
I just don't want us playing dirty anymore.

468
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,320
And you think the Raphethadas
are good people?

469
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:01,093
Where's the clip, huh?

470
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:02,720
Where's the clip?

471
00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:07,022
Did he give it to the cops already?

472
00:38:08,018 --> 00:38:11,720
He's probably deleted it.
To protect his family.

473
00:38:14,564 --> 00:38:16,520
Your naïve goodness, Thap...

474
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,360
It's destroying me.

Please don't do this.

We can talk.

00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:36,774
I love you.

479
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:42,198
I want to marry you.

480
00:38:51,036 --> 00:38:52,849
Marry me?

481
00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:09,520

Yes, Ms. Rin.

Police are here to search Mut's room.

486
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:37,947
I was just about to tell Ms. Yai.

00:39:37,947 --> 00:39:39,653
No need.

488

489

Let the police search freely.

491
00:39:47,622 --> 00:39:48,867
Yes, ma'am.

I'll take the officers to Mut's room.

This way, please.

494
00:40:00,884 --> 00:40:03,942
Oh, by the way, Ms. Rin, when I came up,

495
00:40:03,942 --> 00:40:06,573
there were reporters downstairs.

496
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,756
They wanted to ask about Mut,

497
00:40:08,756 --> 00:40:10,751
but I didn't say anything.

498
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:13,231
Good.

This is Mahasamut's room.

Are you insane,
telling my son to turn himself in?

505
00:41:09,573 --> 00:41:11,818
That's the same as throwing him in jail!

506
00:41:11,818 --> 00:41:15,022
No one in my family will be a convict!

507
00:41:16,093 --> 00:41:18,987
You convinced him to do it.
For that man, didn't you?

508
00:41:18,987 --> 00:41:20,498
What kind of mother are you?

509
00:41:20,498 --> 00:41:21,813
Hey!

Watch your mouth when you talk to my sister!

511
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:29,449
Oh, Yai, you don't know yet, do you?
Your sister slept with the tennis coach.

512
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:31,489
She told me herself.

513
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,849
And I know you hurt both her and my nephew.

514
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:37,013
That's how I discipline my son.

515
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:40,151
And your sister deserved it too.

516
00:41:40,151 --> 00:41:44,187
If you don't stop acting like this,
then divorce her.

517
00:41:44,187 --> 00:41:46,173
I'll have my lawyer handle it.

That guy you're talking about, he's your son.

00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:03,764
Yeah, and if he weren't,
I'd have let him rot in prison already.

523

And no. I'm not divorcing.
And don't talk to me about love.

00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:45,773
Stop it.

533
00:42:45,773 --> 00:42:48,049
My phone's almost dead.

534
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:49,473
Look at this.

535
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,393
She's accusing me of assault.

536
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,427
- That's your problem.
- Hey!

537
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:09,440
Thanks for convincing Nali to press charges.

538
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,600
Now Mut's got no way out.

539
00:43:13,902 --> 00:43:15,973
Took a lot of work though.

540
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:17,920
She was genuinely terrified this time.

541
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,951
Ms. Yai called a meeting.

542
00:43:21,636 --> 00:43:25,756
I'm curious to see how she'll fix this.

543
00:43:25,756 --> 00:43:29,431
And how this story will end
under her leadership.

544
00:43:29,431 --> 00:43:31,382
Even without that clip...

545
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:35,058
I'll still destroy Siamraphe.

546
00:43:36,422 --> 00:43:39,493
If anything happens,
I'll call you right away.
