1
00:00:11,756 --> 00:00:13,133
Bullying the poor!

2
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,867
We won't give in, we won't give in!

3
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:23,378
Everyone, everyone!

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,840
I'm not here today as an enemy.

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,920
I understand that you're worried,

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,813
because all of you are affected.

7
00:00:32,813 --> 00:00:35,978
But if we don't make changes,
within five years or even sooner,

8
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:38,551
you may face even bigger problems.

9
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:42,280
I'm not here to order you to stop.
I'm here to ask for cooperation,

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,671
to talk about how we can
move forward together.

11
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:51,182
Change always brings impacts,

12
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:56,084
but the question is how to make that impact
as small as possible for you,

13
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:59,418
and how to create
new and better opportunities for you.

14
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:06,578
We've prepared food and drinks.

15
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:08,618
Please eat until you're full.

16
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:11,373
After that...

17
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:14,378
send representatives from your shops to talk.

18
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:16,867
That way, we can find a solution together.

19
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:21,800
Go ahead and hand them out.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,764
Take some food and water.

21
00:01:25,764 --> 00:01:27,938
Eat first, okay?

22
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:34,084
Thaleh, Thaleh!

23
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:35,640
Thaleh, look at this!

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,160
Someone just posted a bad review
about Dao's shop.

25
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,671
It's really harsh.

26
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:45,486
Dao is furious now,
she's already heading to the shop.

27
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:47,342
I tried to warn her but she wouldn't listen.

28
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:50,747
I'll call Ms. Rin.
Thaleh, you stay here for now.

29
00:01:50,747 --> 00:01:53,856
I just called Mom, but she didn't pick up.

30
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:55,720
She's probably in a meeting.

31
00:01:58,253 --> 00:02:00,684
How about this? Thaleh, go check on Dao.

32
00:02:00,684 --> 00:02:04,498
If we let this drag on, it'll get worse.
I'll handle things here.

33
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:10,093
Then I'll leave it to you and Jom.

34
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:16,720
How is it?

35
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,893
Those who swallow will die,
those who spit will survive.

36
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,613
Doesn't look like survival here.

37
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:31,218
Hey, what are you doing?

38
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,893
Give that back! Return it now!

39
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:36,498
Sorry, but reviews aren't welcome.

40
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:38,164
Please leave the shop.

41
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:39,791
Why?

42
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,280
Can't handle the truth?

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:50,164
Nobody forced you to come anyway.
Taste is subjective.

44
00:02:50,164 --> 00:02:52,404
Are you the one who posted that tweet?

45
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:53,520
You came here for revenge?

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,040
I'm just here for reviewing,
stick to the point.

47
00:02:58,627 --> 00:03:01,387
Alright, third dish...

48
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:02,560
- will it pass or flop?
- So what?

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,551
- Look at it...
- Didn't I tell you not to live stream?

50
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,449
Hey, what are you doing?
Give me my phone back!

51
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,258
Ouch!

52
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:20,044
Sorry, but please leave my sister's shop.

53
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:24,370
The older brother who just got out of prison.

54
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:29,560
No wonder your sister turned out like this.

55
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:33,578
- You...
- Stop filming.

56
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:37,476
- I told you to stop filming.
- Hey, what are you doing?

57
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:39,658
Give it back.

58
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,858
- Careful, careful...
- Why are you being so rough?

59
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:50,947
Thaleh, stop.

60
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:55,262
Calm yourself, son.

61
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,853
- Get these people out.
- Sure.

62
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:06,267
Alright, alright, let me go.

63
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:08,177
- Get out.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

64
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:10,204
Let us go.

65
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:14,080
Just calling your mom over this?
What a mommy's boy.

66
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,240
I said let go.

67
00:04:23,316 --> 00:04:25,120
Dao, are you hurt badly?

68
00:04:27,124 --> 00:04:29,200
You should see a doctor.

69
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:34,889
Tawan, Dao, head home first.

70
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:38,342
Ask Mon to put medicine on her.

71
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:41,476
Thaleh and I will handle things here.

72
00:04:57,551 --> 00:05:00,493
Sorry, but please leave my sister's shop.

73
00:05:00,493 --> 00:05:03,129
The older brother who just got out of prison.

74
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:05,796
What are you filming? Stop filming now.

75
00:05:05,796 --> 00:05:07,142
I told you to stop...

76
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,511
How are the protesters?

77
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:19,738
They've all left. I already settled it.

78
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:22,667
And how did you convince them to leave?

79
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:30,000
Because I really understood them.
I understand deeply...

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,027
because...

81
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:37,080
After all,
my own mother wasn't the main wife.

82
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,782
And I myself grew up in a tiny house
where my mother had to struggle to survive.

83
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:46,970
So I understand everyone.

84
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,436
Being forced out of the place we built
with our own sweat and effort...

85
00:05:50,436 --> 00:05:53,809
it hurts, it's painful.

86
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:59,027
I promise you,
your voices will not be silenced.

87
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:04,907
I'll be the one to help
push for the fairest solution.

88
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:09,920
Because justice should not belong
only to the rich,

89
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,999
it should belong to everyone.

90
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,040
That's right.

91
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:20,680
Mom, I called Coach Pipe
but he wouldn't pick up.

92
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,444
Did you talk to him?

93
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:26,902
I didn't say anything.
Out of nowhere, he just canceled your class.

94
00:06:28,453 --> 00:06:30,876
But I don't want to take class
with anyone else.

95
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:33,649
Doesn't matter who you learn tennis with,
it's the same.

96
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:36,404
Stop whining, it's annoying.

97
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:38,916
Why are you so irritated?

98
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,596
Mom, did you see Aunt Nam's clip?

99
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:43,218
It's gone viral already.

100
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,013
Can we stop talking about her?

101
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:47,547
I'm sick to my stomach.

102
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:50,009
Now she's the only one
who gets all the credit.

103
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:56,724
Where are you going?

104
00:06:56,724 --> 00:07:00,382
Instead of sitting here sulking,
Mut, come out with me.

105
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:04,253
Can you stop spoiling him already?

106
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:07,311
You're not the only one who can help him.

107
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:11,324
And the reason we're struggling like this
is because you voted for Thaleh.

108
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,822
Mut, come with me.

109
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:18,813
Crazy.

110
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:22,360
Mom.

111
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:22,345
I saw the news.
[T]

112
00:08:22,345 --> 00:08:25,040
Just wanted to check if you're okay.
[T]

113
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,540
[This number called you]

114
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:35,991
Mom.

115
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:37,653
Let's go eat.

116
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:39,849
I'll be right down.

117
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,693
Hurry, Mom.

118
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,380
[Jailed executive]

119
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,635
[Same rotten behavior,
both brother and sister]

120
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,191
[Loudmouth celeb!]
[Good only at exploiting others]

121
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:32,840
[Vile nature]
[Just like the brother... evil]

122
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,307
[The whole family's the same]
[Arrogant to the max]

123
00:09:38,307 --> 00:09:39,160
[Siamese thug!]

124
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,395
[Jailed executive]

125
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:42,080
[Same rotten behavior,
both brother and sister]

126
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,053
[Murderer sibling!]

127
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:52,348
The news said the worker
was just standing still,

128
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:54,427
and he stabbed him with an iron bar.

129
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,618
Not surprising. Dao once sprayed paint
all over the teacher's car.

130
00:09:57,618 --> 00:09:59,784
Yeah, but I've heard people gossiping too.

131
00:09:59,784 --> 00:10:02,800
The siblings,
both of them are just as violent.

132
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,582
If you don't know the facts,
stop making things up.

133
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:07,271
Thaleh was attacked first.

134
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:09,507
He never intended to kill anyone.

135
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:13,129
Even without intending to,
someone still died.

136
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:17,449
But your family will probably
just use money to cover it up.

137
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:21,187
With an uncle who's the son of a minister,
he'll get away for sure.

138
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:30,133
That ski trip we planned...
I'm not going anymore.

139
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:32,577
I don't want to be friends
with a murderer's sibling.

140
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:50,329
Hey!

141
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:52,342
Dao, what's this?

142
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:04,258
When you first came back,
I tried not to think about it.

143
00:11:05,295 --> 00:11:10,289
Four years ago, it was so hard for me
to get past being called a murderer's sister.

144
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,071
And now that you've returned, not long after,

145
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,720
people are calling me that again,
just like back then.

146
00:11:16,418 --> 00:11:18,049
Can't you go back to staying at the temple?

147
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:19,720
Dao!

148
00:11:21,396 --> 00:11:25,067
Thaleh isn't going anywhere.
He needs to be here,

149
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:27,680
helping out in Dad and Chon's place.

150
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,920
Why does everyone forget so easily?

151
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,693
Have you forgotten what he did?

152
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:36,196
Dao, I don't care what outsiders think,

153
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,267
but within the family,
forgiveness has to come first.

154
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:41,058
But I don't want to go through that again.

155
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:43,471
Now there's no Dad or Chon
to fix things for us anymore.

156
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:45,507
And you think you're the only one
facing this?

157
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:47,987
Everyone else is suffering from it too.

158
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:50,511
And the reason it's gotten
this out of hand...

159
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,618
part of it is because of you.

160
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:54,720
Grow up already.

161
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,360
Erase all of this right now.

162
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:07,787
I'll erase it myself, Mom.

163
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:19,338
No need!

164
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,778
If it weren't for you,
these words wouldn't have come back at all.

165
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,018
Dao, stop thinking only about yourself.

166
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:31,680
So now I'm the one at fault?

167
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,653
Of course. In your eyes,
I never do anything right.

168
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:38,556
You only love your sons.

169
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:41,844
That's not true, Dao.
I love all of my children equally.

170
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,524
But the way you act doesn't show it.

171
00:12:44,524 --> 00:12:45,782
I work myself to death running the shop,

172
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:47,720
and I can barely count
the times you've praised me.

173
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,123
But Thaleh, after going to prison
and bringing trouble to everyone,

174
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:52,489
you still take care of him constantly.

175
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:55,373
And you call that

Back then, you never hugged me like this.

181
00:13:26,147 --> 00:13:30,218
You're hugging me now because
you're afraid I'll hate Thaleh, right?

Is Brother monk resting yet?

00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:29,978
Not yet. He's here.

202
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:32,760
You want to talk to him, right? Come, come.

203
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,960
He wants to talk too.

204
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,604
It's Thaleh.

205
00:16:38,857 --> 00:16:40,320
Greetings.

206
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,320
You must be going through a lot, Thaleh.

207
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,956
Even though you're deep in the forest,
you already heard.

208
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:48,524
There's 5G in the forest.

209
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:52,089
If only solutions to problems came with 5G,

210
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:55,693
then I'd know right away.

211
00:16:58,391 --> 00:17:00,849
I have a story to tell you.

212
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:03,356
The other day,
someone wanted to come to the temple.

213
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,333
They pinned the location on GPS.

214
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:09,400
But when they came, they drove past the gate.

215
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,796
The GPS recalculated.

216
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:18,289
They drove past again.
The GPS kept recalculating over and over.

217
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,511
And did they make it to the temple
in the end?

218
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:22,671
Yes, they did.

219
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:23,715
But it took a while.

220
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:26,009
They complained the whole way
about being lost.

221
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:29,013
Just like me right now.

222
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:31,529
When you say you're lost,

223
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:36,707
is it because we cling to the idea
that there's only one way to solve things?

224
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:38,827
Like the person who came to the temple.

225
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:42,262
At first,
they thought there was only one way.

226
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:47,129
But it turned out there were many paths
that could still lead them here.

227
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:50,702
That GPS theory of yours, it's pretty clever.

228
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:54,716
But the pins I need to set down in life,
there are probably a lot of them.

229
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:58,043
Even if there are many, you know, Thaleh,

230
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,080
that you already understand
how to solve things.

231
00:18:03,044 --> 00:18:06,631
Some problems need to be solved with wisdom.

232
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:10,440
But some problems need to be solved
with time, right?

00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:56,431

Damn, it's so hard.

236
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:09,029

237
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:12,142

00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:40,453
Yesterday I was looking through
photos on Chon's iPad.

254
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:44,498
It showed there were files
that hadn't been synced with iCloud.

255
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:48,360
When I hit sync, I found this clip.

256
00:20:49,044 --> 00:20:53,693
But last week, you were already working
on Chon's laptop all the time.

257
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:55,262
How come you didn't find it then?

258
00:20:55,262 --> 00:20:58,076
Because Chon's phone data
wasn't linked to the laptop.

259
00:20:58,076 --> 00:21:00,280
It was only linked to the iPad.

263
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:10,858
Thaleh found this clip on Chon's iPad.

264
00:21:11,556 --> 00:21:17,040
It seems to be the last recording Chon made
before the plane went down.

265
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,782
In the video,

266
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:21,034
the captain requested
an emergency landing

267
00:21:21,034 --> 00:21:23,684
because he felt something was wrong.

268
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:25,591
But what you told me was...

269
00:21:25,591 --> 00:21:30,044
air traffic control never received
any communication from the pilot.

270
00:21:30,044 --> 00:21:32,440
So which one is the truth?

271
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,791
Then let me take this clip
to the experts for another review.

272
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,324
Maybe we'll find out exactly
what was wrong with the pilot.

273
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:45,764
I'm starting to feel sure
that the crash wasn't an accident.

274
00:21:51,391 --> 00:21:54,329
Should we give this clip to Ms. Yai?

275
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:57,769
Maybe Ms. Yai can hire
a private investigator to look into it.

00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,440
Talk about what?

283
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,618
Well, I checked her old live streams.

284
00:22:21,618 --> 00:22:26,027
She was selling things to raise money
to care for her paralyzed son for years.

285
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:29,436
Lately, it looked like she was being evicted.

286
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:34,671
Part of me feels sorry for her,
but it's a lot to handle.

287
00:22:34,671 --> 00:22:39,138
Still, if I can calm her down,

288
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:41,876
she might stop attacking Thaleh.

289
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:46,320
Because if the plane crash
wasn't an accident,

290
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,489
someone's trying to destroy us.

291
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:55,800
And I won't let anyone stand in the way
of Thaleh becoming the number-one heir.

292
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:59,476

I plan to promote the shops

If you renovate the interior,
will you close this spot?

309
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,329
Actually I plan to make this zone
another magnet for the mall.

310
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:49,200
But if you fight,
the mall will fight with you.

311
00:24:52,602 --> 00:24:55,015
I'm already fighting, don't worry.

312
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:05,022
You're going to keep running this shop
for your brother, right?

313
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,800
I looked at your aunt's old live streams.

314
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,471
Is your home being evicted?

315
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:20,613
Yes, we're negotiating
with the new owner now.

316
00:25:20,613 --> 00:25:23,702
That's why I have to fight so hard
for this shop...

317
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:26,293
because it was Pong's dream.

318
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:29,764
Because Pong built this shop
to take care of me and Auntie.

319
00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:32,440
So it also became your dream too, right?

320
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:40,773
Honestly, I never wanted to come back
and run the mall.

321
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:44,343

Please, hear me out first.
I told you, I truly came here to help.

329
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,056
I'll take your son to the hospital
and cover all the expenses.

330
00:26:45,056 --> 00:26:47,867
So you want to throw money at us,
make us indebted,

331
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:50,311
and then silence us
from demanding anything more, right?

332
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:52,484
If there's anything else you want to demand,
tell me.

333
00:26:52,484 --> 00:26:55,213
If I can help, I will.

334
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:59,351
Enough. My son is not a tool
for the rich to use for publicity.

335
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,684
Publicity? We never even told anyone
we came here.

336
00:27:02,684 --> 00:27:03,825
So what do you want?

337
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:06,711
We don't help, you live stream insults.
We try to help, you accuse us of saving face.

338
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:08,169
Then there's nothing left to say.

339
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,080
Go. Get out!

340
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:18,276
I don't think you should
try talking to them anymore.

341
00:27:18,276 --> 00:27:19,951
If they live stream insults again,

342
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:22,147
let the legal team handle it.

343
00:27:22,147 --> 00:27:25,138
That'll just make them accuse us
of being rich and bullying the poor.

344
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:29,084
Let's wait until she cools down a bit.
Then I'll try talking to her again.

345
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:35,249
In that case,
why don't you wait at the shrine first.

346
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:37,560

00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:51,378
If everything's clear,
I'd like your answer within this week.

349
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,867
Then my tenant team will follow up.

350
00:28:04,498 --> 00:28:06,120
Thank you.

351
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,884
[Looks like Auntie's about to
shake the world again, Cheeva.]

352
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,587
[P'Jom]

353
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,867
Yes?

354
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:33,756
Thaleh, did you finish talking with
the shop owners? How did it go?

355
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:36,764
All settled. Everyone seemed satisfied.

356
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:37,938
Good.

357
00:28:37,938 --> 00:28:43,338
If the burger shop owner is okay,
can you ask her to call her aunt?

358
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:45,453
So she'll understand us.

359
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:46,724
What do you mean?

360
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:51,960
Well, Ms. Rin went to talk to her aunt,
but she drove her away like a stray dog.

361
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,040
And where's Mom now?

362
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,809
I told her to wait at the shrine.
I came here to buy water for Ms. Rin.

363
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:00,898
Ugh, stop talking about that mall.

364
00:29:00,898 --> 00:29:05,138
They came here offering money,
saying they want to help Pong.

365
00:29:05,138 --> 00:29:08,453
Damn it, I don't believe them.

366
00:29:09,418 --> 00:29:12,044
Want me to name them?

367
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:13,542
No, I can't.

368
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:16,529
Let's just say...

369
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:20,364
a few days ago,
someone dug up the record of her son...

370
00:29:20,364 --> 00:29:22,400
the one who went to jail.

371
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:35,843
Oh...

372
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:37,591
Hey.

373
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,080
[Thaleh]

374
00:31:36,773 --> 00:31:38,182
What is it, Thaleh?

375
00:31:38,182 --> 00:31:39,684
I'm in a hurry, I'll call back later.

376
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:41,662
Mom, hello? Mom.

377
00:31:41,662 --> 00:31:42,987
Mom.

378
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:52,298
- Fire! Help!
- Someone help!

379
00:31:53,151 --> 00:31:55,249
Have you called the fire department yet?

380
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:57,440
Hurry, help put out the fire!

381
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:06,453
Hey... where's your house?

382
00:32:06,453 --> 00:32:08,964
My mom went to see your aunt, they argued.

383
00:32:08,964 --> 00:32:11,178
Now I can't reach her.

384
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:13,924
I can't reach my aunt either.

385
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:16,320
Send me your house location.

386
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,373
I'll come too,
we have to stop her live stream.

387
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:20,662
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

388
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,040
It's spreading fast.

389
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:34,956
Where's the fire?

390
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:36,800
The shrine.

391
00:32:38,604 --> 00:32:40,849
My house is nearby.

392
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,111
Pong.

393
00:33:07,596 --> 00:33:08,604
Where's your house?

394
00:33:08,604 --> 00:33:10,507
Straight to the end of the alley.

395
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:12,973
What are you doing?

396
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,702
There's a fire!

397
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:46,360
Oh my god!

398
00:33:49,942 --> 00:33:52,222
We're here.

399
00:33:57,404 --> 00:33:58,733
Pong!

400
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:00,409
Hurry.

401
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,173
Take your aunt and get her out first.

402
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:10,280
I'll help your brother.

403
00:34:22,253 --> 00:34:24,858
Hey! Hurry, quick!

404
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:27,009
Go now.

405
00:34:27,009 --> 00:34:29,800
Auntie, go!

406
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:49,440
Pong!

407
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,405
What should we do?

408
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:59,538
Go, hurry Auntie!

409
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,880
This way, this way.

410
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,009
- Come on, come on.
- Auntie, watch your step.

411
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:20,729
Hurry.

412
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:22,316
- Careful.
- Put him down, put him down.

413
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:23,440
Okay. Slowly.

414
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,560
Hurry up.

415
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,191
- Okay.
- Careful.

416
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,467
Auntie, careful with the stuff.

417
00:35:32,018 --> 00:35:34,511
Thank you for helping Pong.

418
00:35:50,622 --> 00:35:51,787
Jom.

419
00:35:51,787 --> 00:35:53,244
Jom, are you with Mom?

420
00:35:53,244 --> 00:35:54,560
Thaleh.

421
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,271
Thaleh, Ms. Rin is trapped inside,
but I don't know exactly where.

422
00:35:58,271 --> 00:36:00,156
Thaleh.

423
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:01,551
Jom.

424
00:36:01,551 --> 00:36:04,044
She said she'll try to
find a way out herself.

425
00:36:04,044 --> 00:36:05,160
Then stay here, Jom.

426
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,929
I'll go find Mom myself.

427
00:36:15,578 --> 00:36:17,133
Oh no.

428
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,640
Hey, where are you going?
The fire's getting stronger.

429
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,684
I'm going in to find my mother.
She's trapped inside.

430
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:32,827
Hello?

431
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:35,022
Mom, where are you?

432
00:36:35,022 --> 00:36:36,193
I'm on my way out.

433
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:37,911
Stay right there, Mom.
I'm coming to help you.

434
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:39,893
Don't come in, son.

435
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:43,453
Ahh!

436
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:45,000
Mom!

437
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,729
Excuse me, where's the fire truck?

438
00:36:55,729 --> 00:36:58,280
It's on the way,
but stuck at the entrance of the alley.

439
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:15,818
- The fire truck can't get in?
- Yes, a cement truck is blocking the way.

440
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,960
And the driver's nowhere to be found.

441
00:37:18,773 --> 00:37:20,729
You'll have to ask the police what to do.

442
00:37:20,729 --> 00:37:22,440
Sorry, sorry.

443
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:24,804
We can't get through.

444
00:37:24,804 --> 00:37:26,707
Can you help us, please?

445
00:37:26,707 --> 00:37:30,084
- Break the glass!
- Got it, I'll clear the way.

446
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:31,960
Excuse me, excuse me.

447
00:37:36,218 --> 00:37:37,987
Right here.

448
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,858
Mom!

449
00:37:53,858 --> 00:37:55,698
- Mom!
- Thaleh.

450
00:37:55,698 --> 00:37:57,542
Thaleh, be careful, son.

451
00:37:58,311 --> 00:38:00,142
Thaleh, watch out.

452
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:18,413
Thaleh, careful.

453
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,293
Let's go.

454
00:38:27,293 --> 00:38:28,778
Be careful.

455
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:37,787
Breaking news.: A fire has broken out
at the Thap Phueng Yai community,

456
00:38:37,787 --> 00:38:40,098
with flames spreading rapidly,

457
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:42,973
damaging many houses and buildings.

458
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:47,271
Fire trucks have already arrived at the scene
and are spraying water to contain the blaze,

459
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:51,933
while officials are rushing
to evacuate residents to safe areas.

460
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:54,969
- Ms. Rin, Thaleh.
- No reports of injuries or deaths yet.

461
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:57,427
And this is a live image from the scene,
One News.

462
00:38:57,427 --> 00:38:59,253
Are you alright?

463
00:39:01,364 --> 00:39:03,249
Ms. Weerin, Mr. Thalehluang,
may we interview you?

464
00:39:03,249 --> 00:39:04,511
- Sorry...
- How did you end up here?

465
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,471
Right now my mother and I aren't available.

466
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:08,827
Sorry, sorry.

467
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:13,462
Thaleh, I saw the arsonist.

468
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,591
Okay, but for now, please go and rest.

469
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:20,120
- Go.
- Hey.

470
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,271
Hey, Hey.

471
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,956
I bumped into him.

472
00:39:26,956 --> 00:39:29,391
And I saw in his bag
there was a bottle of gasoline.

473
00:39:29,391 --> 00:39:30,574
When I reached the shrine,

474
00:39:30,574 --> 00:39:33,556
the floor was covered in gasoline,
so I followed him.

475
00:39:33,556 --> 00:39:35,938
Do you think he's the one who set the fire?

476
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:38,671
Yes, I believe someone hired him.

477
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:40,404
Is anyone else with you?

478
00:39:40,404 --> 00:39:42,258
No, just me.

479
00:39:42,258 --> 00:39:44,298
You can remember his face, right?

480
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,351
Yes.

481
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:49,147
Then I'll have to ask you, Ms. Weerin,
to come inside and help sketch the suspect.

482
00:40:05,982 --> 00:40:08,458
This is from Mr. Jaruek's company.

483
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,449
Please follow my team to the police station.

484
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:14,440
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

485
00:40:16,804 --> 00:40:18,489
Let's go, Mom.

486
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:09,253
Ladies and gentlemen,
following the fire at the community,

487
00:41:09,253 --> 00:41:13,516
images have surfaced of Siamraphe executives
appearing at the scene.

488
00:41:13,516 --> 00:41:15,867
Our news team investigated
and found that before the incident,

489
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:19,516
the two of them met with Mother Um,

490
00:41:19,516 --> 00:41:24,240
the owner of the page Mother-Um,
P'Pong, Nong Cheeva,

491
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,880
and they helped Pongphop,
who is paralyzed, to escape.

492
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,330
This has turned Mr. Thalehluang Raphethada,

493
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,507
who had previously been the target
of social media drama,

494
00:41:33,507 --> 00:41:36,151
into an overnight hero.

495
00:41:36,151 --> 00:41:39,258
I sincerely apologize for misunderstanding,

496
00:41:39,258 --> 00:41:42,880
and thank you deeply for saving my son.

497
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,516
If you hadn't come,
I don't know what would have happened to him.

498
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:48,916
Previously, this community had already
been in a dispute over relocation

499
00:41:48,916 --> 00:41:52,502
with a new landowner,

500
00:41:52,502 --> 00:41:59,529
which has led many to suspect whether this
fire was an accident or deliberate arson.

501
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:03,711
Police are now speeding up
their investigation to collect evidence.

502
00:42:05,582 --> 00:42:07,804
It's alright, Tawan. Don't need to rush home.

503
00:42:07,804 --> 00:42:10,609
Finish your report with your friends first.

504
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:11,764
Okay.

505
00:42:11,764 --> 00:42:14,991
I'm having dinner with Thaleh and Jom now.

506
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,600
Alright?

507
00:42:18,738 --> 00:42:21,182
Not sure if he's the son or the father.

508
00:42:21,804 --> 00:42:25,333
Looks like only Tawan can boss you around.

509
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:30,742
Then why did you suddenly
go talk to Pancheeva's aunt?

510
00:42:31,862 --> 00:42:34,556
I spoke with Uncle Non.

511
00:42:34,556 --> 00:42:37,036
When he saw the clip on Chon's phone,

512
00:42:37,036 --> 00:42:40,560
he felt that something was really strange.

513
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,774
And if it wasn't an accident,

514
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:47,844
that means someone is trying
to destroy our family.

515
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:52,707
That's why I don't want anything
to disrupt your work.

516
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:59,122
And what you said

517
00:42:59,122 --> 00:43:02,674
about the company belonging to Mr. Jaruek
that was helping the villagers

518
00:43:02,674 --> 00:43:04,182
what does that mean?

519
00:43:07,182 --> 00:43:09,716
This community had problems
with the new landowner,

520
00:43:09,716 --> 00:43:13,200
which is Mada Construction, Jaruek's company.

521
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,707
And suddenly, it was set on fire.

522
00:43:18,732 --> 00:43:21,889
And today, the fire trucks were delayed

523
00:43:21,889 --> 00:43:24,849
because a cement truck was parked there,
blocking the entrance.

524
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:29,747
Residents said normally
