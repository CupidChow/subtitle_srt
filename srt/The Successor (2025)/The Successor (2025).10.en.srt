00:00:01,886 --> 00:00:03,609
Mom.

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:05,253
Oh, Thaleh.

3
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:08,978
How did it go, son?
Did things with Kaew work out?

4
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:12,067
They did, but not because of me.

5
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:16,973
She'd already closed a deal with Aunt Nam
before I got there.

6
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:19,896
Seenam?

7
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:21,716
Yes, Mom.

8
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:23,942
Aunt Nam said she wanted to help me.

9
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:27,764
When Jom and I arrived,
we saw her talking to someone I didn't know,

10
00:00:27,764 --> 00:00:29,920
so I had Jom check the license plate.

11
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:36,080
Turns out,
it was the car of Thap, Jaruek's son.

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,760
So, is Seenam feeding info to Jaruek?

13
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,849
Pasin, why won't you pick up?

14
00:01:18,893 --> 00:01:20,622
And what's all this?

15
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,738
A party to celebrate that
Nali and I made up, Mom.

16
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:26,698
That day was just a misunderstanding.

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,858
Hello, Mother, come join us.

18
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,644
I need to talk to you.

19
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:36,649
- I don't feel like talking.
- Well, I'm talking now.

20
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,013
Pasin!

21
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:43,582
Damn it!

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,031
Weerin says you're a mole for Jaruek.

23
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:56,244
At first I didn't believe it,
now I'm not so sure.

24
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:59,809
- Me, a mole for Jaruek? Are you insane?
- Yes!

25
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:02,951
Yai suspects he hired her
to destroy Siamraphe.

26
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:05,498
You cozy up to her
because you're working with her, right?

27
00:02:05,498 --> 00:02:07,097
How can you be like this?

28
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:10,871
Hey... what? Wait!

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,818
Nali is a plant for Jaruek?

30
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:16,240
Of course she is, don't play dumb.

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,173
Someone like you would never forgive her.

32
00:02:18,173 --> 00:02:20,320
You're being nice
because you're in on it, right?

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,202
How could you?
I'll tell Yai. I'm filing for divorce.

34
00:02:24,952 --> 00:02:27,053
So all this yelling is just
you looking for an excuse

35
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:28,230
to divorce me and run off
with that guy, huh?

36
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,627
That's not it.

37
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:34,036
I will never let anyone
trying to destroy Siamraphe live in my house.

38
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:35,778
- Go home. Now.
- I'm not going!

39
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:37,711
- Go home first. We'll talk at the house.
- Tell me how she ended up here.

40
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:40,067
- Go home.
- Why is she here? I'm not going.

41
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:42,493
- Whatever it is, we'll discuss it at home.
- No, let's settle it now.

42
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:43,511
- You...
- Take Lek home.

43
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:44,778
No. I'm not going.

44
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:46,898
- Go first.
- We're settling it here. I'm not going!

45
00:02:46,898 --> 00:02:49,049
- Then I'll go with Mother.
- Let go, let go.

46
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:51,658
Hey, what's the rush?

47
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:53,396
- Get Lek home.
- Yes.

48
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:55,093
- This way.
- I said I'm not going.

49
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:57,116
What is going on here?

50
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,391
Why the rush?

51
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:04,120
Exactly, babe, we just made up.

52
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,733
But I have an early job tomorrow.
I don't want to get back late.

53
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:10,382
It's fine. Have one more glass of wine.

54
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:12,538
I was about to open a new bottle.

55
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:14,249
Stay and drink with us.

56
00:03:15,142 --> 00:03:16,880
Sit down.

57
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,004
Let's start over.

58
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,578
Are you afraid I'll spike your drink?

59
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:51,160
Why be afraid? Did you do something wrong?

60
00:03:53,164 --> 00:03:56,132
If you're going to talk like that,
I'd better go.

61
00:03:57,077 --> 00:04:02,991
Watch your bag, or the rental company
will fine you if it gets scratched.

62
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:05,636
These earrings too?

63
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:07,293
And the watch.

64
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:10,689
Or did an ex buy them?

65
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:15,422
Which ex? The one in prison,
or the one with a wife?

66
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,396
Which one?

67
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:21,960
You're pretty slick, conning men into
taking out loans for you, millions.

68
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,360
What are you talking about?
I-I don't know anything about that.

69
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,693
Know where you slipped up?

70
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:30,760
At first I thought you were just a flirt,

71
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,107
trying to have both me and Thaleh.

72
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,048
But after the temple incident,

73
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:38,933
it was obvious you set it up
to make me and Thaleh fight.

74
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:42,631
So we wondered why...

75
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:46,413
until my father's people dug up
that you're a fake.

76
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:48,729
Condo? Rented.

77
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,280
Car? Rented.

78
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,462
Watches and bags? All rented.

79
00:04:53,462 --> 00:04:55,871
And you get men to borrow money for you, too.

80
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:58,596
You're in debt everywhere.

81
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:02,093
When you landed my son,
you thought you'd live easy, huh?

82
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,427
Huh?

83
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:10,218
I'm sorry, I promise I won't get involved
with you again.

84
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:13,360
Someone hired you to wreck my family,
didn't they?

85
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,587
Are you going to say who, or should I?

86
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:23,116
Huh?

87
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:29,649
I'm sorry, he forced me. He forced me.

88
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:31,569
Your mother told me everything.

89
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,107
Hey, Mut, give it back.

90
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:40,351
Let go.

91
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:44,058

92
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:52,289

Oh, no thanks. My girlfriend's drunk.

106
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,396
Make sure you get her
all the way to her condo.

107
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,831
Will do.

- Yes, sir.

What's wrong with you?

126
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:19,644
Your mom sent a clip to my dad.

127

What clip?

128
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:25,649
I used to think grown-ups fighting
had nothing to do with us...

129
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,497
that we could still be friends.

130

I heard yours and Tawan's voices,

Let's go back.

179
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:02,889
Wait, Jom.

180
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:20,364
Seenam really is Jaruek's informant.

181
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:27,138
No need to film, Jom.

182
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,116
I'm waiting here.

183
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:58,893
Nam.

184
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:02,692
Nam.

185
00:18:10,182 --> 00:18:11,928
What are you playing at, Thap? Hm?

186
00:18:11,928 --> 00:18:14,506
So, nice house, right?

187
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:23,169
I missed you.
Can't I want to be near my girlfriend.

188
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,413
You can. Just not here.

189
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:29,076
What if someone sees?

190
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:32,680
Even better. Then I can tell them
straight out you're my girlfriend.

191
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:36,196
Wait, Nam, hold on.

192
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:38,853
Fine, I won't play anymore.

193
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:42,960
Next month I've got to fly to Singapore
for a deal.

194
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,796
Come meet me there.

195
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:49,511
Send me your schedule
and I'll clear my calendar.

196
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:55,511
Stop missing me already.

197
00:18:57,831 --> 00:18:59,653
Wait...

198
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:02,640
You can go now.

199
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:15,240
Didn't know you two were this close.

200
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:21,040
Hello.

201
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:25,036
Is Jaruek not joining you?

202
00:19:25,036 --> 00:19:28,449
- He isn't. Actually, Nam and I...
- Thap.

203
00:19:28,449 --> 00:19:30,431
Thap, go home first, please.

204
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:38,627
I don't want to leave you alone.

205
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:41,002
You can't say that.

206
00:19:41,002 --> 00:19:45,607
Everyone here is family...

207
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:48,542
except you.

208
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:53,809
Please go.

209
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,600
Ms. Yai.

210
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:26,018
The reason I met Thap was to
investigate Heaven Plaza, per your orders.

211
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:32,782
Seenam, I'm sixty this year.
You think I can't tell?

212
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:38,493
You're colluding with Jaruek to stir chaos
and destroy Siamraphe, aren't you?

213
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:42,004
No, I'm not.

214
00:20:42,004 --> 00:20:46,818
You deliberately sent the photo of Thaleh
and Cheeva to Uncle Manit to discredit him,

215
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:51,453
and tipped Nali about their temple visit

216
00:20:51,453 --> 00:20:54,462
to make Mut jealous so he'd cause a scene.

217
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,600
All of that was you.

218
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,844
I'm sorry.

219
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:13,880
I was wrong.

220
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:19,324
But I would never, ever betray Siamraphe.

221
00:21:19,324 --> 00:21:20,707
Yes...

222
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,880
Thap and I...

223
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:27,022
we're together.

224
00:21:27,742 --> 00:21:29,880
We're in love.

225
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,671
And we've been secretly dating for two years.

226
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:36,367
Even knowing he's Jaruek's son?

227
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:45,853
When I first met him, I truly didn't know.

228
00:21:45,853 --> 00:21:48,596
He had just moved back to Thailand

229
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:51,387
and wasn't working with his father yet.

230
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:56,120
We met in Krabi.

231
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,173
He didn't even know who I was.

232
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:03,207
And after you found out,
why didn't you end it?

233
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:07,742
When you learned Klang was
the brother of the woman your ex married,

234
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:09,840
were you able to let go?

235
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:18,124
We tried.

236
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:23,978
But I knew if you or anyone in Raphethada
found out, it would explode.

237
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:27,951
Even so, I couldn't leave him.

238
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:32,653
Thap is a good man and he loves me deeply.

239
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:37,169
He told me he'll make everyone
accept our love.

240
00:22:40,338 --> 00:22:41,978
How touching.

241
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:48,076
Break up, or leave Siamraphe.

242
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:50,738
I can't choose. Please don't do this.

243
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:55,120
Then prove to everyone
you're loyal to Siamraphe.

244
00:22:56,024 --> 00:23:00,393
Find the insider working with Jaruek
and bring them to us.

245
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:13,901
I... I asked Thap.

246
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:19,422
Jaruek does have a mole inside Siamraphe.

247
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:28,564
That person teamed up with Jaruek
for money...

248
00:23:30,204 --> 00:23:31,716
and...

249
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:35,391
wants to be above everyone here.

250
00:23:35,391 --> 00:23:40,267
You know you can't throw accusations around
without proof.

251
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,378
Yes. I have evidence.

252
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:51,649
It's Pasin.

253
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,240
He's colluding with Jaruek.

254
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:16,196
You don't have to do all this for me.

255
00:24:16,196 --> 00:24:17,804
I'm not doing it for you.

256
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:20,347
I'm doing it for Pong.

257
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:46,138
- All set.
- Thank you.

258
00:24:46,138 --> 00:24:47,409
Here you go.

259
00:24:54,373 --> 00:24:57,413
When Pong comes home,
he'll sleep comfortably...

260
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,453
and you won't worry about the electric bill.

261
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:03,400
This model has smart AI power-saving
and cools fast.

262
00:25:04,196 --> 00:25:05,729
Thanks.

263
00:25:06,382 --> 00:25:11,156
But if people see you doing this for me...

264
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:13,507
I don't want trouble for you anymore.

265
00:25:13,507 --> 00:25:15,040
That's all?

266
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:17,827
Yeah. Why?

267
00:25:17,827 --> 00:25:19,258
Then we're fine.

268
00:25:20,671 --> 00:25:23,698
One air conditioner won't get me in trouble.

269
00:25:25,511 --> 00:25:27,862
Latest update: The manager of Nali,

270
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:32,969
currently a trending actress and influencer,

271
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:36,027
says she hasn't been able to reach her
for three days.

272
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:38,867
Their last chat was Monday night.

273
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:42,898
She told him she was going to dinner
with a mall heir,

274
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:46,400
then messaged around 11 p.m.
that they'd split for the night

275
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,418
and she was heading to a club.

276
00:25:48,418 --> 00:25:52,960
That was the last contact.

277
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:00,338
He's checked relatives' and friends' places,
but no leads.

278
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:03,493
If you have any information,

279
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:06,596
please contact police or our newsroom.

280
00:26:06,596 --> 00:26:08,582
I'll head back to the mall.

281
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,218
I saw them partying in the early evening.

282
00:26:15,218 --> 00:26:17,111
Nothing seemed off.

283
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:18,778
But I left first.

284
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:21,911
She was very drunk,

285
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:24,493
so I had my father's men take her home.

286
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,249
Normally, you're close.
Why didn't you take her home yourself?

287
00:26:30,249 --> 00:26:33,138
I'd been drinking.

288
00:26:34,564 --> 00:26:38,351
After that,
my son was with me the entire night.

289
00:26:38,351 --> 00:26:40,440
I can vouch for that.

290
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:45,307
And these two are the ones who drove Nali.

291
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:48,030
I drove her toward her condo,

292
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:53,098
but halfway there, she woke up
and told me to take her to a club.

293
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:56,720
She was really drunk.
I tried to stop her, but she insisted.

294
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,907
She insisted on going, so I drove her.

295
00:26:59,907 --> 00:27:02,200
What's the club's name, and what time?

296
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:06,373
She asked to get out around Thonglor
at about 10:30 p.m.

297
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,040
Did Nali call anyone to meet up on the way?

298
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,356
No.

299
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:18,084
Okay. If anything else comes up,
we'll need to question you again.

300
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:19,907
Sure, no problem.

301
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,040
And if you hear anything, please let me know.
I'm really worried about her.

302
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,658
Yes, sir.

303
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:28,307
See the officer out.

304
00:27:52,848 --> 00:27:54,226
What is it?

305
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:59,618
Yai said once you finish your statement,
go to the house.

306
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:10,667
Let's go.

307
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,769
Nali's been missing
since she left my dad's condo.

308
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:19,124
My father and I really don't know anything,
Aunt Yai.

309
00:28:19,124 --> 00:28:21,209
Don't lie to me, Mut.

310
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:24,538
If you're involved in Nali's disappearance,
you know how serious that is.

311
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:31,822
It could affect your standing
as Siamraphe's heir.

312
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,529
I'm not involved.

313
00:28:39,036 --> 00:28:41,151
The reason she's this concerned

314
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:46,258
is because Jaruek is doing anything
and everything to destroy Siamraphe,

315
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,778
hiring people both outside and inside.

316
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,613
Lek told me...

317
00:28:52,538 --> 00:28:54,404
you suspect me, Rin?

318
00:28:56,845 --> 00:28:58,943
I didn't do it, Yai.

319
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:02,681
And I'm not even close to that guy, Jaruek.

320
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:06,156
But you and Mut met him
at the racing event, didn't you?

321
00:29:06,156 --> 00:29:08,831
Yeah, but we just chatted.

322
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:11,840
I was with my father the whole time.

323
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,573
He just came over to say hi,

324
00:29:13,573 --> 00:29:15,853
and then we all went our separate ways.

325
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:17,564
What about other days?

326
00:29:17,564 --> 00:29:19,809
Are you always with your father?

327
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:24,084
So that's it, you're trying to paint me
as the bad guy, huh?

328
00:29:26,907 --> 00:29:31,413
I know everyone thinks I'm not a good person,

329
00:29:31,413 --> 00:29:33,822
but I'm not so evil
I'd destroy my own family.

330
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:35,471
And Mut is my son.

331
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:40,262
All I'm trying to do is push my boy
to become Siamraphe's leader.

332
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:42,924
Why would I team up with Jaruek?

333
00:29:42,924 --> 00:29:44,724
For money.

334
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:47,204
What money, Rin?

335
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,351
I've got money.

336
00:29:58,591 --> 00:30:04,316
Here's proof your crypto portfolio
is down 80 million baht.

337
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,533
What the hell?

338
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,432
And this joint venture in Singapore
is losing money,

339
00:30:11,432 --> 00:30:13,933
and you still haven't found new investors.

340
00:30:28,582 --> 00:30:31,409
Have you been digging into my life?

341
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:33,609
I told Nam to do it.

342
00:30:34,982 --> 00:30:38,129
I'm sorry, I was just doing my job, Pasin.

343
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,080
What job, huh?

344
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,576
A mistress's child like you,

345
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:43,155
your only job is to trail after Yai,
you witch.

346
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:46,848
So it's true, that's why you're mad?

347
00:30:46,848 --> 00:30:48,702
It's my business.

348
00:30:48,702 --> 00:30:51,880
If I invest and blow it, it's my money.

349
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,271
And I didn't collude
with that bastard either.

350
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:56,284
- That's enough, Pasin.
- Hey!

351
00:30:56,284 --> 00:30:58,813
If you're not going to help me,

00:46:02,898 --> 00:46:05,516
and the owner of that bruise.

527
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:14,213
The twist? The man who steps in to stop him
is also an heir to the same mall.

528
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:19,040
Should we move now, Yai?

529
00:46:21,551 --> 00:46:26,569
Not yet. Playing against people like this...

530
00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:29,320
sometimes you let them win a little.

531
00:46:30,071 --> 00:46:36,053
So we learn what the tower they want to build
really looks like.

532
00:46:39,494 --> 00:46:43,018
Isn't that too risky?

533
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:49,031
We have no idea what Jaruek and Nam
will try next against Siamraphe.
