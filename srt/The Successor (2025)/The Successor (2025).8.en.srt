1
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,220
I took the Happy Water bottle from the scene
to check for latent fingerprints.

2
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,951
We found they were his.

3
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:44,404
So the police questioned him,
sand he confessed.

4
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,511
Tell them why you did it.

5
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:49,947
Your daughter cursed me first.

6
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:52,013
Dao did?

7
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:53,289
Yeah.

8
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:55,964
I just cut in front of her on my bike
and she threw a fit, called the cops.

9
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:59,009
You think rich people
can do whatever they want?

10
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,040
When people get drunk,
they're all like dogs anyway.

11
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,809
Hey, calm down, watch your mouth.

12
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:05,258
When did this happen?

13
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,191
I had the police check it.

14
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:11,742
Yes.

15
00:02:11,742 --> 00:02:14,556
It happened a week before the party,

16
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:16,853
on the road by the mall entrance.

17
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:21,693
This guy has a drug record.
Been in and out of jail.

18
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:24,920
So I charged him with possession.

19
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,987
The police will take it from here.

20
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:31,076
So that means Mut had nothing to do with it?

21
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:32,951
Right.

22
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:35,320
Mut got punished for nothing.

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,387
I was wrong to decide too fast
before knowing the truth.

24
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:44,667
But everything I did was for Siamraphe.

25
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,431
Please proceed with the case, officer.

26
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:50,960
But keep it as quiet as possible.

27
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,356
Will do. Take him away.

28
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:55,920
- Thanks.
- Yes.

29
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,832
Are you okay, Rin?

30
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:07,222
I don't know. It all seems a little too easy.

31
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:09,920
You're trying to pin this on Mut
no matter what, aren't you?

32
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:15,498
No, that's not it at all, I...

33
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:23,471
Okay. Anyway, thank you very much, Pasin,
for finding the culprit.

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,778
I'll get back to work.

35
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:42,800
Do you think the same as Rin?

36
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:49,396
Check whether that waiter
has any ties to Jaruek.

37
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:52,871
Yes.

38
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:16,729
Coach, let's play again later.

39
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,760
That's enough, Anda.

40
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,160
You've already played so many games.

41
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,440
Come on, though I'm not your coach anymore,
but we can still meet like this.

42
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,413
It's not the same.

43
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:30,533
Mom, help me talk to him.

44
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,827
Or do you want more money?

45
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:35,156
Mom, give the coach a raise.

46
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:36,907
Stop it, Anda.

47
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:39,800
Not every problem can be fixed with money.

48
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:46,560
I'm going to shower.

49
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:13,911
I feel bad for Anda.

50
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,858
Don't go soft, Pipe.

51
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,387
I only go soft for you.

52
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:52,862
Dao, wait!

53
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:54,889
I'm coming too.

54
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:57,289
I'm going to discuss work, go home first.

55
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:59,520
I already called Aod to pick you up.

56
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,311
Is she meeting Kee about business again?

57
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,520
How do you know?

58
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,880
I saw those two walking together
at the mall the other day.

59
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,769
Didn't know they were that close...

60
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:18,889
Close enough to talk business.

61
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,631
Wait.

62
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,782
Hey, come with me, Anda.

63
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:30,622
Okay, let me tell my mom first.

64
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:40,378
Dao, I left something in your car.

65
00:06:40,378 --> 00:06:41,942
Wait a sec.

66
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,880
Mom, I'm going with Tawan.
You head home first.

67
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,063
What?

68
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,200
Why are you getting mixed up
with that family?

69
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,498
And what about the omakase reservation?

70
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,973
Go with the coach, then.

71
00:06:57,973 --> 00:06:59,396
Coach Pipe.

72
00:07:00,547 --> 00:07:02,271
What?

73
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,120
Please look after my mom.

74
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,476
Anda.

75
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:12,093
I'm not going. Too crowded.

76
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:17,391
So if it weren't crowded, you'd go?

77
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,880
Master Kee?

78
00:07:27,623 --> 00:07:29,067
Dao.

79
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:33,231
Did Ms. Rin tell you who they caught?

80
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:35,791
Mom said it was a waiter from the party.

81
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,293
But you know what's crazy? Guess what he did.

82
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:39,409
What?

83
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:43,058
He cut me off in traffic and we argued.
That's it.

84
00:07:52,844 --> 00:07:55,636
Tawan, Anda, how did you get here?

85
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:58,902
Tawan put an AirTag in your car.

86
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:00,484
Hi, Kee.

87
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:02,949
Why would you do that?

88
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,978
I wanted to know what work Dao's doing.

89
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:07,667
Why all the secrecy?

90
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:10,493
Because it's something
I'm not ready for anyone to know yet.

91
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:14,818
Do you realize the more you act like this,
the more people worry about you?

92
00:08:14,818 --> 00:08:17,422
Okay, okay, no arguing.

93
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:23,969
I'm the one who told Dao to wait
until it's done, then tell everyone.

94
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,476
You want to know what she's working on?

95
00:08:33,476 --> 00:08:36,480
I'll have the staff
give you a tour of the office.

96
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,484
Ask anything you want.

97
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,427
Kee, Tawan will tell Mom.

98
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:46,498
If after you see it,
there's nothing to worry about,

99
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:49,996
can you promise
not to tell anyone about this?

100
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,342
It's very important to Dao.

101
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:54,671
She wants to prove herself to everyone.

102
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,680
Think of it as doing it for Dao.

103
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:04,507
Then let me take a look first.

104
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:10,511
- Jane.
- Yes, Master Kee.

105
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:14,391
This way, please.

106
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:35,036
Dao knows,

107
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:37,333
but she's not suspicious.

108
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,360
Told you, it looks seamless.

109
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,680
What are the fees, Kee?

110
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,169
Make everyone believe
you don't like this woman.

111
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:07,240
Have Don spike her at the party.

112
00:10:08,004 --> 00:10:09,573
What drug should it be?

113
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:13,596
Ice, K, or Happy Water, it's trendy.

114
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:17,347
Up to you. Don't worry.

115
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:19,938
If you get caught,
I'll take care of Aunt Mam.

116
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:21,978
I can get her a kidney transplant now.

117
00:10:21,978 --> 00:10:25,053
Whoa, Kee. Thank you so much.

118
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:45,533
Mut. Mut.

119
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,067
No... Mut!

120
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:49,444
Mut... Mut...

121
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:53,373
Mut...

122
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:56,511
No... Mut!

123
00:10:56,511 --> 00:11:00,422
Go shower first. I need to check on work.

124
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,182
Mut, go.

125
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:34,840
I checked my schedule...
Free all day next Wednesday.

126
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:40,022
Are you free?

127
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:49,138
Who are you talking to?

128
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,280
A friend.

129
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:54,653
- Mut...
- Then why'd you lock your screen so fast?

130
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,164
Mut, I finished the call.

131
00:11:57,164 --> 00:11:58,733
Mut, give it back.

132
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:01,138
Hey, what are you doing?

133
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,956
What are you going to do?

134
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,838
[...Free all day next Wednesday]
[Are you free?]

135
00:12:08,182 --> 00:12:10,720
I told you not to mess with him.

136
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,782
I was talking about work.

137
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:16,218
And besides, you have no right
to check my phone like this.

138
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:18,404
Give it back, Mut, give it back.

139
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,591
Mut!

140
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:29,702
Anyone's fine, just not that Thaleh.

141
00:12:36,113 --> 00:12:38,584
Mut!

142
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,991
Hello?

143
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:10,618
I want another new bag.

144
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:15,698
That's fine, but the price depends on
the quality of the job.

145
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:22,898
Then a bag isn't enough.

146
00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:25,422
I also need a Richard Mille.

147
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:29,591
I guarantee this gig will be huge.

148
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,680
Then make sure the work is great.

149
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,691
Hey.

150
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,280
Dad, I'm not coming home this weekend.

151
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,991
Off to stay with your girlfriend again?

152
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,338
You've been together for years,
when will she be ready to meet me?

153
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:49,840
I'll ask her. I want to know too.

154
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:51,920
Go on, go.

155
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:09,320
Oh, Thap. Hello.

156
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,813
Hello.

157
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:24,133
Happy anniversary.

158
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,760
Happy anniversary.

159
00:16:42,053 --> 00:16:43,640
Thank you.

160
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:53,680
I told you not to meet in Bangkok.
It's packed.

161
00:16:54,422 --> 00:16:56,538
I only have one free night.

162
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:58,529
If we go all the way to Pranburi,

163
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:00,458
I'm afraid you'll be exhausted.

164
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:05,276
Here.

165
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:08,742
Dad asked again, when will you meet him?

166
00:17:12,871 --> 00:17:16,804
You saw it that day, right?

167
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:21,298
How much your father and Ms. Yai
hate each other.

168
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,080
Nam.

169
00:17:25,698 --> 00:17:29,422
I think there must be a way
to make them accept us.

170
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:43,267
It would've been easier if I'd stopped
the day I learned you're Mr. Jaruek's son.

171
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:47,676
Even if you stop,

172
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:49,400
I won't.

173
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,160
Stubborn.

174
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,133
Come here.

175
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:05,631
Will there ever be a day, Thap...

176
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:12,458
when Siamraphe and Heaven Plaza can unite?

177
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:25,156
I'll make it happen.

178
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:26,613
I promise.

179
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:54,960
Shocking news in the charity world today.
Police raided and arrested

180
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,732
Ms. Ampika Songbunya, known as Mae-Um,

181
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:01,107
owner of the page Mae-Um,
P'Pong, Nong Cheeva,

182
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:04,382
on charges of poisoning her own son.

183
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:06,076
Her son is paralyzed,

184
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:09,636
and she posted his photos
to solicit donations.

185
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:11,169
Even more shocking,

186
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:13,357
the person who filed the complaint
was Ms. Pancheeva Songbunya,

187
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:15,142
Mae-Um's own niece.

188
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:20,818
Auntie, ma'am,
how long have you been doing this?

189
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:23,253
Did you deliberately poison your own son
to get donations?

190
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:27,133
Deliberately what? Keep accusing me like that
and I'll sue the lot of you.

191
00:19:29,707 --> 00:19:32,302
You, Pancheeva, you ungrateful brat!

192
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:35,262
I never should've taken you in,
I should've let you die.

193
00:19:35,262 --> 00:19:37,627
I hope you're ruined.

194
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:43,462
That girl even reported her own aunt?

195
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:48,160
Former donors are coming out
saying she's been doing this for years.

196
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,880
Living off people's pity, easy money, huh?

197
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:59,129
Has Thaleh seen the news yet?
What did he say?

198
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:02,782
Give the money back!

199
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:05,156
I donated so many times.

200
00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:06,733
I gave over ten thousand baht.

201
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:08,622
Give me my five thousand back, now.

202
00:20:08,622 --> 00:20:12,169
Your aunt did this,
so you take responsibility. Refund us.

203
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,338
Give the money back!

204
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,191
Everyone, please, calm down.

205
00:20:16,191 --> 00:20:18,769
I understand you're upset.

206
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:22,093
I really want to fix this, everyone, please.

207
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:24,773
Acting all nice just to kick us out.

208
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,369
Yeah, aren't you going to
take responsibility?

209
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:28,822
- Give the money back!
- Everyone, calm down.

210
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:35,182
Everyone, stop.

211
00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:38,244
Sorry, on behalf of the mall,

212
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:40,040
I have to ask you to leave this area.

213
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,196
Not until we get our money back!

214
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:46,089
If you want refunds from Ms. Ampika,

215
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:48,831
gather your evidence
and file a report at the station.

216
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,991
We'll settle it case by case.

217
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:54,436
But right now,
I need you to stop this behavior.

218
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:56,613
So the police side with the guilty now?

219
00:20:58,378 --> 00:21:00,542
I'm not siding with anyone.

220
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,747
But what you're doing is harassment

221
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:06,009
and being a public nuisance.

222
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:08,031
You could be charged yourselves.

223
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:09,271
Who's being bothered?

224
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:12,498
- We are!
- We are!

225
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:16,324
Please, I'm asking you, please.

226
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:18,751
Cheeva.

227
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:21,320
Let's go speak with Legal
and see what we can do.

228
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,427
Let's go.

229
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:25,449
Hey. Hey.

230
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:27,262
Let go.

231
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:30,402
Hey, let go.

232
00:21:33,013 --> 00:21:34,316
Hey.

233
00:21:37,418 --> 00:21:38,800
Wait here a moment.

234
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,516
I told Jom. Legal is on the way.

235
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:43,276
I've already contacted a lawyer.

236
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:44,618
Wait.

237
00:21:44,618 --> 00:21:45,902
Hey.

238
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:50,600
Hey, let me help.
I'm the one who told you to file the report.

239
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,684
I want to help.

240
00:21:51,684 --> 00:21:56,560
I don't want you or Siamraphe
involved anymore, okay?

241
00:21:57,431 --> 00:22:00,502
Do you know the police
called me this morning?

242
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:03,116
They said my aunt testified
that I was involved...

243
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:06,884
that I reported her
because of a conflict of interest.

244
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:08,631
Does your aunt not care at all?

245
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:11,520
If something happens to you,
who'll look after Pong?

246
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,480
She's mad at me.

247
00:22:17,284 --> 00:22:20,320
She's like this because she's mad at me.
That's all.

248
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:25,569
I'm exhausted, okay?

249
00:22:26,582 --> 00:22:30,107
There's nothing more to it,
she's just angry at me.

250
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:37,667
Please, don't get involved right now.

251
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:38,813
Hey, you.

252
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:39,858
Hey.

253
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,080
Take it slow, one thing at a time.

254
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:47,653
When my case happened four years ago,

255
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:49,551
I fell apart too.

256
00:23:04,964 --> 00:23:06,440
You know what...

257
00:23:10,787 --> 00:23:13,036
This morning I woke up...

258
00:23:15,907 --> 00:23:18,640
and the house felt empty.

259
00:23:22,107 --> 00:23:24,756
She may not be a good person...

260
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:31,707
but she's the only family I have left.

261
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,560
Thaleh.

262
00:23:54,356 --> 00:23:56,782
I've brought Cheeva to wait for Legal.

263
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:02,813
Have her wait in the small conference room.
I'll have Jom bring Legal there.

264
00:24:02,813 --> 00:24:06,000
Thaleh, meet me in my office.

265
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:30,036
I'm the one who told Cheeva
to report her aunt,

266
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,858
so I should help her.

267
00:24:31,858 --> 00:24:33,364
Help her if you want,

268
00:24:33,364 --> 00:24:35,964
but don't put yourself or Siamraphe at risk.

269
00:24:35,964 --> 00:24:38,444
Are you afraid people
will use this against me

270
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:41,253
so I won't become Siamraphe's leader?

271
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:46,787
This is small and unrelated to my work.

272
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:49,360
Isn't that nonsense?

273
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,524
Hey.

274
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:54,796
Nothing I worry about is nonsense.

275
00:24:54,796 --> 00:24:57,505
Remember when I told you to leave the site
and you said I was overthinking?

276
00:24:57,505 --> 00:25:00,920
And how did that turn out?

277
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,347
Mom.

278
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:15,884
I just want to help a friend.

279
00:25:16,538 --> 00:25:18,396
She has no one.

280
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:26,289
Be careful then.

281
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:32,280
At the next board meeting,
someone will bring this up.

282
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,453
You should prepare your answers.

283
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,644
[Siamraphe]

284
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:53,453
Nam has found an organizer
for the 58th anniversary.

285
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:56,169
Lek, please handle the details with them.

286
00:25:56,169 --> 00:25:58,196
Anything else?

287
00:25:58,196 --> 00:26:00,071
Yes.

288
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:04,298
I propose we remove My Fav Burger
behind the mall.

289
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,698
Because of her aunt's scandal, right?

290
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:10,640
The shop owner isn't involved.

291
00:26:11,244 --> 00:26:13,360
But the investigating officer
told the press that

292
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,853
the aunt testified her niece knew all along,

293
00:26:16,853 --> 00:26:20,453
and that she filed the report
because of a conflict of interest.

294
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,951
If we leave this alone,
our mall's reputation will suffer.

295
00:26:24,604 --> 00:26:27,013
That's just the aunt's accusation.

296
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:28,460
The court hasn't ruled yet.

297
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,196
Are we going to punish her
before the court does?

298
00:26:30,196 --> 00:26:32,044
Do you understand to nip it in the bud?

299
00:26:32,044 --> 00:26:33,575
If we wait for a verdict,

300
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,609
who knows how far people
will drag our name through the mud.

301
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:36,898
Accuse us of what?

302
00:26:36,898 --> 00:26:38,582
- Siamraphe helps a crook?
- Yes.

303
00:26:38,582 --> 00:26:40,436
But she isn't a crook.

304
00:26:40,436 --> 00:26:42,466
How would you know?

305
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:44,036
Are you close with her?

306
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:46,466
If she really colluded,

307
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:48,747
why would she file a report
that hurts herself?

308
00:26:49,596 --> 00:26:51,551
For money.

309
00:26:51,551 --> 00:26:54,084
Desperate people will do anything.

310
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:58,427
Then I'd say it's not about rich or poor.

311
00:26:58,427 --> 00:27:01,742
Plenty of rich people
will do anything for money too.

312
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:26,636
Defending her that much, you must like her.

313
00:27:27,591 --> 00:27:29,791
She's just an acquaintance.

314
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,849
I doubt it.

315
00:27:40,462 --> 00:27:43,040
You two could be hooking up on the sly.

316
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:58,124
Excuse me, Uncle,
where did you get that clip?

317
00:27:58,124 --> 00:28:01,689
That's not important. It shows...

318
00:28:01,689 --> 00:28:06,329
Thaleh can't separate work
from his personal life.

319
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:10,836
With that,
becoming Siamraphe's leader will be hard.

320
00:28:17,444 --> 00:28:18,991
And Mut?

321
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:24,831
His results aren't exactly tangible.

322
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:35,947
There are more capable people.

323
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,360
I wouldn't mind at all, Yai,

324
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,627
if Siamraphe's next leader were a woman.

325
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,489
I wasn't the one
who sent the photo to Uncle Nit.

326
00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:27,116
If not you, then who?

327
00:29:27,116 --> 00:29:29,124
That photo came from your people.

328
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:31,124
I never should've trusted you.

329
00:29:31,124 --> 00:29:33,000
Calm down, Weerin.

330
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,164
I'll try to find out
who sent Uncle Nit that photo.

331
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:38,804
Do whatever you want,

332
00:29:38,804 --> 00:29:41,751
but I'm going to recover my data.

333
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:55,200
You sure?

334
00:29:56,844 --> 00:29:59,169
Yeah? Okay. Thanks a lot, man.

335
00:30:00,987 --> 00:30:02,438
My friend checked,

336
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:05,591
the number that sent Uncle Nit the photo
is a mule account.

337
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:09,200
The person who took the picture
lost their phone,

338
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,244
and then out of nowhere
someone sent that photo to Uncle Nit.

339
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:16,493
That's clearly framing you.

340
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:19,280
And whoever it is
also wants to take Thaleh down.

341
00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:24,071
Weerin says she'll recover the data.

342
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:26,804
I need to find proof I didn't do it,

343
00:30:26,804 --> 00:30:29,671
before she sends our photos to Pasin.

344
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:34,467
Honestly, I don't think Rin will.

345
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:37,093
If she were going to,
she'd have done it long ago.

346
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,623
Pipe, don't trust someone like Weerin.

347
00:30:42,623 --> 00:30:45,084
After what happened to Thaleh,

348
00:30:45,084 --> 00:30:47,200
she's capable of anything.

349
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:17,627
Where are Mut and Pasin?

350
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:21,382
Mr. Mut is upstairs.
Mr. Pasin took a call and left.

351
00:31:21,382 --> 00:31:23,738
He said he won't be back tonight.

352
00:31:23,738 --> 00:31:25,124
The girl, I bet.

353
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,391
Good that Dad's not around, Mom.

354
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:30,356
Let's eat.

355
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:33,622
- Please bring the food.
- Yes.

356
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,045
Where are you going, Mut?

357
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:41,698

If he were here, he'd finish a whole bowl
of this braised pork himself.

423
00:37:00,316 --> 00:37:06,680
Do you know this dish is the reason
your father and I got married?

424
00:37:07,613 --> 00:37:10,196
Really? How?

425
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:14,116
Back then I was his secretary.

426
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:18,288
He liked working late
and often forgot to eat,

427
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:20,644
so I made this for him.

428
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:23,280
He told your grandparents,

429
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,440
and one day they asked me
to make it for them too.

430
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:30,653
They loved rice porridge.

431
00:37:30,653 --> 00:37:32,880
Is that why you got married?

432
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:36,058
Not because they liked it, dear.

433
00:37:36,058 --> 00:37:40,662
I think it was because
they saw how much I cared for your father.

434
00:37:40,662 --> 00:37:45,062
I could've made plain minced-pork porridge,

435
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:50,813
but I knew he loved braised-pork porridge,
so that's what I made.

I didn't say anything.

443
