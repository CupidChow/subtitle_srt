1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,644
Alright, dip it in the tub now.
Okay, pour, shake, dip... there.

2
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:07,157
Once you're done,
lift it up and wring the water out.

3
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:10,975
Yes, wring it out, get all the water out.
Hang it over there.

4
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:14,742
- Whoever's finished, come get a burger.
- Come on over.

5
00:00:14,742 --> 00:00:15,844
Don't snatch, kids.

6
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:17,862
- One at a time.
- Here you go.

7
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:19,520
Looks tasty, huh?

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,809
Good?

9
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:26,689
You're good, nice work.

10
00:00:27,587 --> 00:00:30,387
How are you feeling? Better?

11
00:00:31,627 --> 00:00:34,240
Thanks for bringing me here.

12
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:36,969
- Venerable sir.
- Yes?

13
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:39,720
- I have a question.
- Sure.

14
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:45,378
What I did to my aunt... was it a sin?

15
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:49,431
Law and religion share one thing.

16
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:51,124
They look at intention.

17
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:54,764
Your intent was to stop your aunt
from doing bad deeds

18
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:57,124
and to save your brother's life.

19
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,867
That's a good intent. It isn't wrong.

20
00:01:09,173 --> 00:01:12,049
Hey, is that her?

21
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,338
Yeah, I think so.

22
00:01:20,684 --> 00:01:22,920
It really is you, Thaleh.

23
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:26,520
How did you get here, Nali?

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,569
When I'm stressed, I like to make merit.

25
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:32,627
I'd heard about this place, so I drove over.

26
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:34,440
And you?

27
00:01:36,084 --> 00:01:39,689
Oh, I was ordained here before.

28
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,120
This is Samer,
the monk who oversees the place.

29
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:46,489
My respects.

30
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:49,956
It's so peaceful here. Do you lack anything?

31
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:52,276
I can invite my fans to come make merit.

32
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,413
Nali.

33
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,302
You brought people to make merit
all the way here?

34
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:03,729
I just wanted to make merit,
what's wrong with that?

35
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:06,418
- Come here.
- Mut, let go!

36
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,373
- Let go, Mut!
- Come here.

37
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:10,560
Let go, let go!

38
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:19,898
I told you not to get involved with him.

39
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:21,298
So why are you here with him?

40
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:23,213
I just wanted to make merit.

41
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,116
- Ow!
- So you like him, huh?

42
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:27,800
- Mut, stop.
- Huh?

43
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,107
Mut.

44
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,782
Stop picking a fight with me, okay?

45
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:32,329
You already did that the other day.

46
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:33,818
Show me some respect.

47
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:36,760
If you're going to wave red flags like this,
then let's break up.

48
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:45,229
You'll dump me, to be with him?

49
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,382
- I told you, anyone but him.
- Mut, ow, Mut!

50
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:51,947
- Don't you get it? Anyone but Thaleh.
- Mut, let go!

51
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:53,107
- Help! Someone help!
- Psycho!

52
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:55,600
Mut, that's enough!

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,411
You bastard.

54
00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:02,471
Stop acting crazy!

55
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,516
- You're insane.
- Mut... Mut, stop!

56
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:07,048
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Stay away from my girlfriend.

57
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:08,049
What's your problem?

58
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:10,471
- Stay away from my girlfriend.
- I'm not messing with your girlfriend!

59
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:12,489
- Are you going to stop or not?
- Stop it!

60
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,116
What the hell!

61
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:19,293
This is a temple,
show some respect to the monk.

62
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:43,960
A few days ago, everyone was buzzing
over a story by star influencer Nali,

63
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,929
guessing where that bruise came from.

64
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:49,831
Today, you can stop guessing,

65
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:52,907
because I have the answer.

66
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:56,124
This happened at a hermitage.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,765
Look at this, Lek.

68
00:04:01,765 --> 00:04:03,160
What?

69
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:09,422
The first man who walks in
is the heir to a famous mall,

70
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:14,556
previously rumored to be in love with Nali,
and the owner of that bruise.

71
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:16,533
But here's the kicker...

72
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,898
The man who steps in to stop him

73
00:04:18,898 --> 00:04:22,800
is also an heir to the very same mall.

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,093
And it doesn't end there. They're cousins.

75
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:31,004
And he had a homicide case years ago.

76
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,262
Peak drama, right?

77
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:34,582
There's more.

78
00:04:34,582 --> 00:04:37,831
See the girl in the clip who throws water?

79
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:42,760
She's the niece of the woman
who drugged her son and scammed donations.

80
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,591
The question is, what was she doing there?

81
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:51,622
And what's her connection to the mall heir?

82
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:56,084
Curious how much more peak this gets?

83
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't forget to like and share for me. Bye!

84
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,760
[K]

85
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,585
[J]

86
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:13,142
Hello.

87
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:15,769
How are our shares and likes?

88
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,164
The highest I've ever had.

89
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:23,396
Thanks to that hidden-camera clip.

90
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:25,911
Okay, keep hammering it.

91
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:28,124
I'll send more info.

92
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:31,827
And remember, when Siamraphe is mine,

93
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:33,849
you'll get a bonus.

94
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:35,360
Thank you.

95
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,520
[Nali]

96
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,418
You'll need to make the rounds on shows
for a while.

97
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:57,164
If I can get another Hermès bag,

98
00:05:57,164 --> 00:06:01,480
tell me what you want me to torch,
and I'll do it.

99
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:06,351
Okay, I'll send you two bags.

100
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:14,244
By the way, how did you know
Thaleh would go to the temple that day?

101
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,840
[This Sunday, Thalehluang will take Pancheeva
to make merit]

102
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,124
[Here, Sunday 7:00 a.m.]
[Time for Nali to reveal whose bruise it was]

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,098
[Siamraphe]

104
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:49,027
Thaleh secretly arranged
to meet my girlfriend.

105
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:51,364
- How can you expect me not to be angry?
- I didn't set anything up.

106
00:06:51,364 --> 00:06:52,996
I just took Cheeva to make merit.

107
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,307
I had no idea Nali would show up there,

108
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:57,938
and I don't know why the timing
was such a coincidence.

109
00:06:57,938 --> 00:06:59,198
That excuse is a little too convenient,
isn't it?

110
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:00,662
Want to check my phone?

111
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:03,924
- By now you've deleted everything...
- Mut, enough. Stop.

112
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:07,987
Your old wounds haven't even healed,
are you going to fight again?

113
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:13,951
Thaleh, when did you set up the meeting
with your friend?

114
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:16,213
Thursday night.

115
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:18,773
And it was only the two of us, me and Cheeva.

116
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:20,858
I don't think she told anyone.

117
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:24,267
If it wasn't a coincidence,

118
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:29,804
does that mean Nali went there on purpose
to make you two fight?

119
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:32,640
But why would she do that?

120
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,693
Nali's never had a grudge against us.

121
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:41,373
Or maybe someone hired her
to sabotage Siamraphe.

122
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:46,418
So posting the bruise...

123
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:51,436
then going to pick a fight with Mut
so someone could film it...

124
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:53,773
that was deliberate?

125
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:57,302
It's possible, isn't it?

126
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:05,604
I don't think Nali did it alone, Dad.

127
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:07,476
She has no personal vendetta
against Siamraphe.

128
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:09,894
They dared do that to you?

129
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:11,760
Fine, I'll handle it.

130
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:21,373
Tong, I've got a job.
Find a couple extra hands.

131
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:23,818
Yeah.

132
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:54,871
Too many things are happening, Yai.

133
00:08:54,871 --> 00:09:00,298
Could all of this really be Jaruek alone?

134
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:02,187
Are you saying...

135
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:05,600
someone inside Siamraphe
is working with Jaruek?

136
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:09,391
Isn't that likely?

137
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:12,293
Otherwise how would they dare go this far?

138
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:17,684
Like the photo of Thaleh and Pancheeva
sent to Uncle Manit in the boardroom.

139
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:19,458
If it wasn't an insider,

140
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,222
how would they know we were discussing it?

141
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:26,680
And the temple visit, too.

142
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:34,369
Pat still hasn't found the man
who paid Seksan.

143
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:38,911
We need to find the person
colluding with Jaruek, fast.

144
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,640
We'll start with the people
who were in that meeting.

145
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:51,400
Right now, we're sitting ducks.

146
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:57,324
I don't think this mess ends here.

147
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:06,473
Let me go!

148
00:10:09,738 --> 00:10:11,173
Move.

149
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:18,578
Hello, sir, ma'am.

150
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:21,013
I figured.

151
00:10:22,142 --> 00:10:26,111
Mut, next time if you want to see me,
just ask nicely.

152
00:10:26,111 --> 00:10:28,160
Doing this scares me.

153
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:32,538
Why, did you do something wrong?

154
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,222
Do you have something going on with me?

155
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:43,129
Who told you to do it?

156
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:46,222
Don't tell me you don't know anything.

157
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:51,858
You went there on purpose, posted the photo,

158
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:56,849
provoked Mut, then let him come
and assault you, didn't you?

159
00:10:57,702 --> 00:11:01,871
Excuse me, ma'am, why would I do that?

160
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:04,609
Your son is the one who hurt me.

161
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:09,227
And IG is my personal space,
I can post whatever I want.

162
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:12,600
Mut got angry and attacked me.

163
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,924
You should be teaching your son.

164
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:23,925
Watch your mouth.

165
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:25,751
How did you end up there?

166
00:11:27,196 --> 00:11:30,200
It was just a coincidence.
I genuinely went to make merit.

167
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,569
You won't admit it, will you?

168
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:33,262
That you set out to ruin my reputation.

169
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:35,476
I told you I didn't know anything.

170
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:38,356
And you can't treat me like this.

171
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:43,089
People today don't like rich folks
abusing their power.

172
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:48,342
Sounds like you don't know me well enough.

173
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:55,276
When Mut was a kid
and got bullied at school...

174
00:11:56,369 --> 00:12:00,560
a few days later,
that kid's parents were fired.

175
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,960
They couldn't afford tuition...

176
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:08,236
and had to pull their child out.

177
00:12:10,182 --> 00:12:12,573
I'm not threatening you.

178
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:26,649
I'm not afraid, because I did nothing wrong.

179
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:30,329
If we're done,
please take me back to the gym.

180
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,342
I have work.

181
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:36,594
Fine.

182
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:41,689
But if I catch you lying,

183
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:44,013
say goodbye to your fan base.

184
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:50,862
Take her away.

185
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:07,089
I don't buy that Nali didn't know anything,
Dad.

186
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,332
Dig into her, turn over every stone.

187
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:19,523
Yes.

188
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:23,618
Damn it.

189
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,831
What is going on?

190
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:38,053
C-could I stop now?

191
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:40,920
I don't want to get involved
with the Siamraphe people anymore.

192
00:13:43,178 --> 00:13:44,738
What happened?

193
00:13:44,738 --> 00:13:47,231
I was threatened by Mut's father.

194
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:49,938
He suspects someone put me up
to hurting his son.

195
00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:52,889
I'd heard Mut's grandfather is a minister,

196
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:55,960
but I didn't think his family
would be this scary.

197
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,160
You don't need to worry
about something like this.

198
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,258
I'll make sure they don't have time
to bother you.

199
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,213
What are you going to do to them?

200
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,831
Won't that be too extreme?

201
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:34,382
Can I back out now?

202
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:35,880
Wait.

203
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,920
What a pity...

204
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:49,200
Such nice things.

205
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:54,796
Here you go.

206
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,053
Ever heard the saying,
"once you ride a tiger, you can't get off"?

207
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:05,000
Know why?

208
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:10,929
Because the moment you get off...

209
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:15,738
the tiger will eat you.

210
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:35,076
Ms. Lek, Ms. Lek!

211
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:36,942
- Yes?
- Ms. Lek!

212
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,338
Do you have any other number for Coach Pipe?

213
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:46,089
Just this one. Why?

214
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:48,333
We haven't seen him at all today.

215
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,964
- He's never late.
- Exactly.

216
00:15:50,964 --> 00:15:55,991
I called him and he wouldn't pick up.
No idea if something's happened.

217
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,498
[Coach Pipe]

218
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,653
[Where are you?]

219
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:27,951
Mom, Coach Pipe still hasn't read my message.

220
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:31,738
I called hospitals and the police,
no accident reports.

221
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,880
Oh? How come you're home today?

222
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:43,160
I have something to discuss with you.

223
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:48,080
Anda, don't go. Stay here.

224
00:16:49,827 --> 00:16:51,396
About what?

225
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,840
Someone sent me a clip today.

226
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:57,356
What clip?

227
00:16:57,356 --> 00:16:58,973
A clip of Nali?

228
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:16,102
What clip, Mom?

229
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,440
A clip of your mom having an affair
with that tennis coach.

230
00:17:22,173 --> 00:17:23,502
Hey!

231
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,431
Coach Pipe!

232
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:31,209
Coach Pipe!

233
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,271
Why are you pining after him, Anda?
Why do you care?

234
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:38,742
- Or you're covering this up for your mother?
- Let go... let go!

235
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:42,493
- Let go... don't touch the kid! Let him go!
- Tell me. Tell me!

236
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,236
Son!

237
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:47,013
Lek,

238
00:17:47,013 --> 00:17:50,560
have you been using the kid
as an excuse to go see him all along?

239
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:57,151
Why? So you can do it,
but when I do it, you get mad?

240
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:00,218
Mad where?
When have I ever been mad at you? Where?

241
00:18:00,218 --> 00:18:01,560
Mom!

242
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:07,360
When have I ever been mad at you?

243
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,084
Mr. Sin, Mr. Sin!

244
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:12,738
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

245
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:15,360
Don't hurt Lek.
It's my fault for getting involved with her.

246
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,236
I'm sorry.

247
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:18,884
You bastard.

248
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:23,400
Your face is already smashed up
and you still want to play the hero?

249
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,262
- Don't mess with what's mine.
- Sin.

250
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:28,644
- Stop. Sin, stop... let go.
- Hold him.

251
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:29,898
- Go.
- Don't hurt him.

252
00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:31,373
Hey, let go! Let go!

253
00:18:31,373 --> 00:18:32,751
Let go.

254
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,564
- Sin, don't.
- I'm begging you. I'm sorry.

255
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:39,151
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:42,098
I hear you're good at playing the net, huh,
you bastard?

257
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:44,396
Don't... Sin, stop.

258
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:46,218
Huh?

259
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:49,360
- Wanna face me?
- Stop... let go!

260
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
Let go! I said let go!

261
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,987
- Wanna face me? Huh?
- Stop, stop, Sin, stop!

262
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:55,622
Prakarn.

263
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:56,818
Stop. Let go.

264
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:59,284
- Want more?
- Don't.

265
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:00,538
Stop.

266
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:05,724
- Want some more?
- Enough! I'll stop seeing him... stop!

267
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,658
You sure about that?

268
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:24,431
Don't let me find out
you're in contact again,

269
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,760
or that coach won't get a chance
to beg like today.

270
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:31,893
Understood?

271
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:35,906
Take him away.

272
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:38,653
Come here.

273
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,516
Do whatever you want...

274
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:17,249
but I'm going to recover my data from you.

275
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:04,840
It's alright, I'll fix it.

276
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:18,933
I thought my photo was ruined just now.

277
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:21,204
Very good.

278
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:25,222
There's no right or wrong in art, Nam.

279
00:22:25,222 --> 00:22:28,702
Stop telling yourself you're not good enough.

280
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:31,058
I think you're talented, dear...

281
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,800
More talented than many on the board.

282
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,196
Oh, not that much.

283
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,444
I'm serious.

284
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:46,871
I don't understand why Yai can't see
that you're more suited to lead Siamraphe

285
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:49,111
than those two kids.

286
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:53,684
Excuse me, sir, the lawyer is here.

287
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:58,458
Let's talk in the study.

288
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:02,356
And have you consulted Ms. Arada?

289
00:23:02,356 --> 00:23:04,689
Why should I consult her?

290
00:23:04,689 --> 00:23:08,316
These days, does she ever show her face
unless there's trouble?

291
00:23:08,316 --> 00:23:11,182
Only Nam has been looking after me.

292
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:14,613
And what's wrong with me changing my will

293
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:17,120
to leave my assets to Nam?

294
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:21,733
Uncle...

295
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,471
Erm...

296
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:27,573
I am only looking after you on Yai's orders.

297
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:31,502
I want you to be a good person, dear Nam.

298
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:34,453
Good people deserve good things in return.

299
00:23:35,698 --> 00:23:37,013
Let's go.

300
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:56,031
Ja Mongkut dessert.

301
00:23:57,991 --> 00:24:01,840
I found it at a shop next to the temple
where I made merit today.

302
00:24:04,084 --> 00:24:06,947
You were gone all day.
Did you go to the temple?

303
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:11,822
Yes.

304
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:18,893
I dreamed of my mother,
so I went to make merit for her,

305
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:21,387
and then stopped by to bring something
to Uncle Nit.

306
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:28,333
How is Uncle Nit?

307
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:32,529
I heard he's been arguing with Da lately,
have they made up?

308
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:35,413
I don't know.

309
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:38,817
I only dropped by briefly.

310
00:24:38,817 --> 00:24:41,151
I didn't dare bother him long.

311
00:24:48,902 --> 00:24:52,156
Look into Thap for me.

312
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:54,587
Jaruek's son.

313
00:24:54,587 --> 00:24:56,169
Sorry?

314
00:24:56,169 --> 00:25:02,000
I suspect the chaos at Siamraphe
is coming from Jaruek.

315
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:08,013
If he can strike us,
why can't we strike back?

316
00:25:08,013 --> 00:25:12,302
Sorry, Yai, why me?

317
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:16,409
You know him, don't you?
It should be easier for you to dig.

318
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:20,160
Alright.

319
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:27,916
Then I'll excuse myself.

320
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:32,889
Nam.

321
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:35,791
Come play with me a bit.

322
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:38,831
Okay.

323
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:53,702
How was your massage today?

324
00:25:56,249 --> 00:25:57,724
Good.

325
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:20,938
Ms. Nam is so diligent.
I often see her at Mr. Manit's house.

326
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:26,636
She probably just stops by
to bring things to Uncle Manit.

327
00:26:26,636 --> 00:26:28,582
Not just stop by.

328
00:26:28,582 --> 00:26:31,911
Each time, she stays quite a while.

329
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:33,643
Like this morning,

330
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:37,213
I went to massage Ms. Prim
next door to Uncle Manit's,

331
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:40,662
and saw Ms. Nam drive in.

332
00:26:40,662 --> 00:26:47,200
And after I'd finished three clients,
her car was still there.

333
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,231
You're getting better at this.

334
00:27:12,804 --> 00:27:16,898
Rin suspects someone on the executive board
is feeding info to Jaruek?

335
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:20,613
Yes, and we need to
identify that person fast,

336
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:23,320
before things get messier.

337
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't think it's Aunt Lek or Mut,

338
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,924
since Mut's getting dragged in the news too.

339
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:34,484
Then the current suspects are
Mr. Manit, Ms. Arada,

340
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:38,680
Mr. Thanakorn, Mr. Pasin, and Ms. Seenam.

341
00:27:40,853 --> 00:27:43,893
Uncle Nit himself has clashed with Yai
many times

342
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:46,471
over how to run Siamraphe.

343
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:49,782
He considers himself a co-founder.

344
00:27:49,782 --> 00:27:52,404
But many times, he's nowhere to be seen...

345
00:27:53,111 --> 00:27:54,787
So arrogant!

346
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:00,693
Uncle...

347
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:15,111
It's possible he's teamed up with Jaruek

348
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:18,680
to push himself to become Siamraphe's CEO.

349
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:23,129
Or to pave the way for his child, Arada?

350
00:28:24,773 --> 00:28:27,542
He would never install his own child.

351
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:32,271
They just argued.
Da listened to Phot more than to him.

352
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:34,431
Then I apologize, Dad.

353
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,187
Hey... dear?

354
00:28:41,204 --> 00:28:42,720
Go.

355
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,436
If you trust your husband
more than your father, then go, get out!

356
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:49,591
Classic father-in-law versus son-in-law.

357
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:54,038
The one most torn is
the person in the middle, which is Da.

358
00:28:54,038 --> 00:29:02,560
So she would have reason
to cooperate with Jaruek to beat her father.

359
00:29:06,142 --> 00:29:07,831
And Uncle Korn?

360
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,538
He's scary.

361
00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:15,938
Many times, I can't guess what he's thinking.

362
00:29:28,022 --> 00:29:32,311
As for Nam,
she's been Yai's right hand for a long time.

363
00:29:32,311 --> 00:29:37,862
Everyone knows she's capable
and deserves more recognition.

364
00:29:37,862 --> 00:29:40,253
Even we feel that.

365
00:29:40,253 --> 00:29:42,342
So wouldn't she feel it herself?

366
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:48,920
And as for Pasin,
we all know why he married Lek.

367
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:56,600
So any of those five
could be Jaruek's informant.

368
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:18,009
Thaleh, the staff said
you stopped by my shop today?

369
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:20,075
Yeah.

370
00:30:20,075 --> 00:30:22,924
The new mayong-chid dessert is tasty.

371
00:30:22,924 --> 00:30:24,978
But you don't usually eat sweets.

372
00:30:24,978 --> 00:30:27,013
Are you checking up on me?

373
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:29,084
I just dropped by.

374
00:30:30,116 --> 00:30:32,400
Why assume I'm checking up?

375
00:30:33,951 --> 00:30:36,538
Or do you have something
you can't tell others?

376
00:30:38,138 --> 00:30:41,676
Yes, and I don't want anyone to know

377
00:30:41,676 --> 00:30:44,889
because I want people to see
I can do it myself.

378
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:47,964
I want Mom to be proud of me.

379
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,071
What are you two talking about?

380
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,347
I was telling Dao our mall PR team
can help promote her new dessert,

381
00:31:11,124 --> 00:31:13,627
but she said she already has a plan.

382
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:20,142
If you need anything, just tell me.

383
00:31:21,324 --> 00:31:22,876
Thank you.

384
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,080
Hi, Jom.

385
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:50,951
Fun?

386
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,471
Yup!

387
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:55,898
I'll buy you more next time.

388
00:31:58,827 --> 00:32:00,182
What do you want?

389
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,564
About Dao...

390
00:32:08,564 --> 00:32:10,582
Are you keeping something from me?

391
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,120
I really can't say.

392
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,613
I promised Dao.

393
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:18,947
But I'm the one
who asked you to look into her.

394
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,720
What is she doing?

395
00:32:24,196 --> 00:32:26,889
I get that you're worried about her,

396
00:32:26,889 --> 00:32:29,653
but try seeing it from her side.

397
00:32:29,653 --> 00:32:32,693
She's frustrated that no one recognizes her.

398
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:35,960
She even set a pitch meeting with Aunt Yai,
and she forgot.

399
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,093
So this time she wants to succeed on her own,

400
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:40,951
so people will finally see her.

401
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:44,929
I understand.

402
00:32:46,436 --> 00:32:50,369
But right now, Mom and I suspect someone's
trying to stir up chaos at our mall.

403
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,600
If you know anything, Tawan,
you have to tell me.

404
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:02,991
Come on, keep playing and have fun.

405
00:33:23,524 --> 00:33:25,111
Anda.

406
00:33:36,938 --> 00:33:38,160
Mut.

407
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,449
I think you should cancel
today's live stream with Nali.

408
00:33:44,449 --> 00:33:46,400
I don't want her mixed up with Siamraphe.

409
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,591
I think you're the one
who shouldn't meddle with my work.

410
00:33:51,991 --> 00:33:57,027
Dad did vile things to you,
why aren't you mad at him?

411
00:33:57,027 --> 00:34:01,329
I know Dad's vile.
So what does that make you?

412
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:05,173
You curse Dad, then do the same yourself.

413
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:07,680
And you expect me to believe
anything you teach me?

414
00:34:09,302 --> 00:34:11,364
From now on, I'm not listening to you.

415
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:36,444
[Weerin]

416
00:34:41,551 --> 00:34:42,760
Pull over.

417
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,902
Wait here. Don't follow me.

418
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:52,840
Ow!

419
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,284
I told you, I wasn't the one
who sent that video to Uncle Manit.

420
00:34:56,284 --> 00:34:59,191
If you want revenge, come hurt me.

421
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:01,436
Why hurt my family?

422
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:03,738
Wait, Lek... stop.

423
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:07,782
Lek, your face...

424
00:35:10,262 --> 00:35:12,067
Pasin beat me.

425
00:35:12,787 --> 00:35:14,693
He beat Anda.

426
00:35:14,693 --> 00:35:17,129
He nearly killed Pipe.

427
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:20,333
All because of you. Happy now?

428
00:35:21,284 --> 00:35:23,227
Hold on, Lek.

429
00:35:23,227 --> 00:35:26,493
I did recover that clip,
but I haven't sent it to Pasin.

430
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:27,804
Lies.

431
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:31,542
You're the only one who had it.
If not you, then who?

432
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:34,409
Same as the photo of Thaleh
that went to Uncle Manit.

433
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:37,738
You were the only one with it.
If not you, then who?

434
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,728
Get a grip, Lek.

435
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:43,307
Someone's trying to destroy
both our families,

436
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,840
to make our families fight.

437
00:35:47,862 --> 00:35:53,640
Right now, Yai and I suspect someone
inside Raphethada is working with Jaruek

438
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,351
to take down Siamraphe.

439
00:35:56,351 --> 00:35:58,404
That's why I called you today.

440
00:35:58,404 --> 00:36:00,356
Because of this,

441
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:04,676
I suspect someone on the executive board,

442
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:06,982
and I'm investigating.

443
00:36:11,058 --> 00:36:13,538
I want you to keep an eye on Pasin.

444
00:36:15,276 --> 00:36:16,964
Pasin?

445
00:36:16,964 --> 00:36:18,644
Are you insane?

446
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:21,573
He wants Mut to become Siamraphe's leader.

447
00:36:21,573 --> 00:36:24,480
Why would he destroy Siamraphe?

448
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,138
- For money.
- What money?

449
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:33,382
Think carefully, if Pasin joined with Jaruek
to seize Siamraphe,

450
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:37,667
with all that power and money,
he'd be above everyone.

451
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:41,071
Not true. Stop slandering my family.

452
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:45,044
And if someone put Siamraphe
into Jaruek's hands,

453
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:47,342
would you accept that, Lek?

454
00:36:48,884 --> 00:36:50,271
Sorry,

455
00:36:50,964 --> 00:36:55,956
but I'm more Raphethada than you are.
Don't lecture me.

456
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:04,684
How are you, Pipe?

457
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:06,360
Are you badly hurt?

458
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,311
Don't worry about me, I'm okay.

459
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:13,733
I can cover the bruises with makeup.
No one will see.

460
00:37:14,684 --> 00:37:17,791
Right now, Pasin has people tailing me.

461
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:20,380
Don't contact me.

462
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,640
Take care of yourself.

463
00:37:29,404 --> 00:37:31,724
How are you, Pipe?

464
00:37:31,724 --> 00:37:33,493
Are you badly hurt?

465
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:36,404
Don't worry about me, I'm okay.

466
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:40,822
I can cover the bruises with makeup.
No one will see.

467
00:37:41,831 --> 00:37:44,444
Right now Pasin has people...

468
00:37:46,502 --> 00:37:48,444
So you still feel nothing?

469
00:37:48,444 --> 00:37:51,151
After what my dad did,
you still won't end it?

470
00:37:52,431 --> 00:37:55,142
Has he done anything else to you and Lek?

471
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:56,920
Why are you here worrying?

472
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,969
Afraid you won't be able to use me anymore?

473
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:02,476
That's not true, Anda. I never thought that.

474
00:38:02,476 --> 00:38:06,338
Didn't think so? I told you everything.

475
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:08,276
I thought you meant well.

476
00:38:08,276 --> 00:38:10,422
I trusted you.

477
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:13,867
But you were good to me
just because you wanted my mom.

478
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:17,160
Calm down, Anda. It's not like that.

479
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,493
I really care about you and Lek.

480
00:38:19,493 --> 00:38:22,782
If that's what caring looks like,
then stay out of my life.

481
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:39,963
[May this year be a good one for you, Anda.
From Coach Pipe]

482
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:47,547
Anda... wait, Anda!

483
00:38:47,547 --> 00:38:49,569
Anda, please wait.

484
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:55,720
You can be mad at me,
but hear everything first.

485
00:38:57,013 --> 00:38:58,818
What excuse now?

486
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:05,356
I admit I was wrong to get involved with Lek.

487
00:39:06,484 --> 00:39:10,298
But this whole mess blew up because Rin
used my situation to blackmail Lek.

488
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:14,151
To force her to vote her son
back into Siamraphe.

489
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,782
I never meant to cause trouble
for you or Lek.

490
00:39:29,782 --> 00:39:32,222
And when I saw that birthday card...

491
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:34,404
I don't know if you remember...

492
00:39:35,604 --> 00:39:37,102
That year,

493
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,720
Lek fought with your father

494
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:44,662
because he bought a condo for another woman.

495
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:52,040
And instead of apologizing, he hit Lek again.

496
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:57,649
She sat there crying, covered in bruises.

497
00:39:59,178 --> 00:40:00,924
When I saw that...

498
00:40:02,302 --> 00:40:07,241
I couldn't understand
why a woman who loves her child,

499
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:11,849
cares for her family, and works so hard,

500
00:40:12,773 --> 00:40:16,440
had no one to protect her.

501
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:21,738
Say it as nicely as you want,
you're still wrong for being with my mom.

502
00:40:35,658 --> 00:40:38,724
About Ms. Kaew, I'm not so sure.

503
00:40:38,724 --> 00:40:41,129
If she opens a shop,

504
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:44,840
she'd likely choose Heaven Plaza
since they're close.

505
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,040
But she hasn't opened yet.

506
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,929
So we still have a chance.

507
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:06,415
Ready?

508
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:08,345
Yes.

509
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,604
Excuse me, we have an appointment
with Ms. Kaew.

510
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:23,009
She's speaking with a guest right now.

511
00:41:23,009 --> 00:41:25,347
I'm not sure when she'll be free.
Please wait a moment.

512
00:41:25,347 --> 00:41:26,756
Thank you.

513
00:41:33,387 --> 00:41:34,804
Hello, Ms. Jom.

514
00:41:34,804 --> 00:41:37,769
- Hello, Ms. Kaew.
- I thought you wouldn't make it.

515
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:39,920
I'm here.

516
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,289
- Ms. Kaew...
- Yes?

517
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:44,693
This is Mr. Thalehluang.
He is here to see you.

518
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:46,738
- Hello.
- Hello.

519
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:49,533
I know Chon spoke with you before,

520
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:51,893
but today I've brought a new proposal.

521
00:41:51,893 --> 00:41:56,000
I truly want your shop at Siamraphe.

522
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,760
Oh, but I just agreed with Ms. Seenam.

523
00:42:03,671 --> 00:42:05,382
Seenam?

524
00:42:05,382 --> 00:42:11,133
Yes, she just left through
the parking-lot door a moment ago.

525
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:15,244
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

526
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:17,333
I'll be right back.

527
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:37,996
- You're here to see Ms. Kaew?
- Yes.

528
00:42:37,996 --> 00:42:40,782
I set the appointment with her for Thaleh.

529
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:50,689
Sorry, Thaleh,
I didn't know you'd booked her.

530
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:56,516
I've already finalized terms with her.
I'll present them to the board.

531
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,031
Thank you, Aunt Nam.

532
00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:04,951
I have a meeting this afternoon.
See you at the office.

533
00:43:15,933 --> 00:43:19,409
So Seenam approached Kaew for Siamraphe...

534
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:21,773
Maybe...

535
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:24,920
she isn't one of Jaruek's people.

536
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:35,071
Jom, please check license plate KHL-49.

537
00:43:36,253 --> 00:43:38,373
I want to know who Aunt Nam met.

538
00:43:49,982 --> 00:43:52,248
What is it, son?

539
00:43:52,248 --> 00:43:55,622
Mom, about... the night we had porridge...

540
00:43:55,622 --> 00:43:58,276
you still haven't sent me the photos.

541
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:01,707
Hold on.

542
00:44:05,716 --> 00:44:07,747
Continue with your work.
I'll help you send them instead.

543
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,822
By the way, have you talked to Anda?

544
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:23,604
We met in-game.

545
00:44:23,604 --> 00:44:26,438
Why? Is there trouble over there again?

546
00:44:28,105 --> 00:44:30,453
Please check in on him.

547
00:44:30,453 --> 00:44:33,716
He doesn't talk to many people,

548
00:44:33,716 --> 00:44:35,924
so having you as a friend helps.

549
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,476
Tawan.

550
00:44:49,476 --> 00:44:54,467
If I suspect someone stole a clip
from my phone,

551
00:44:54,467 --> 00:44:56,622
how do I check?

552
00:44:56,622 --> 00:44:59,227
Depends where they downloaded it from.

553
00:44:59,227 --> 00:45:02,538
If it was from an app,
we check inside that app.

554
00:45:02,538 --> 00:45:07,209
Right now, all I can see is...

555
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:11,516
the last thing you sent was to Aunt Nam.

556
00:45:12,298 --> 00:45:15,893
But I can't see what it was.

557
00:45:21,067 --> 00:45:22,302
Here...

558
00:45:25,578 --> 00:45:27,022
This.
[Seenam]

559
00:45:32,587 --> 00:45:35,000
Thank you, everyone, for today.

560
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,720
Hello. Is Thaleh coming in today?

561
00:45:54,924 --> 00:46:00,164
IT just finished the food-court queuing app,

562
00:46:00,164 --> 00:46:03,636
so we'd like Thaleh to help test it.

563
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:07,844
He'll come in this afternoon.
I'll let him know.

564
00:46:10,172 --> 00:46:13,293
Why is he coming late? Where's he going?

565
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:20,436
It's okay. It's not urgent.

566
00:46:20,436 --> 00:46:21,769
It's okay.

567
00:46:21,769 --> 00:46:24,951
Then please ask Jom to pass the message
to Thaleh for me.

568
00:46:26,471 --> 00:46:28,436
- Thank you.
- Jom,

569
00:46:28,436 --> 00:46:31,471
go look after him, not help cover for him.

570
00:46:34,316 --> 00:46:36,911
Thaleh went to see Monk Samer.

571
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:40,142
If it's just that, why couldn't you tell me?

572
00:46:41,756 --> 00:46:44,160
He went with Cheeva, didn't he?

573
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:48,720
Yes.

574
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:51,893
I'll call Thaleh myself.

575
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:58,164
And where's my phone?

576
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:05,360
Rin, sorry, your phone is here.

577
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,760
- Oh?
- I...

578
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:11,356
I grabbed the wrong one.

579
00:47:14,884 --> 00:47:16,498
It's fine.

580
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,249
