Upstairs. I'll go get her.

- Should I go pick up Mr. Tawan now?
- Go, Odd.

It's confirmed.
The plane went down in Surat Thani.

And... and what about Klang and Chon?

21
00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:04,747

Mut really knows how to play the part.

63
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,680
What's P'Yai saying?

64
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:20,244
About what?

65
00:06:20,884 --> 00:06:25,600
With Klang and Chon gone,
who's going to be CEO?

66
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:31,169
Of course it should be Mahasamut.

67
00:06:31,844 --> 00:06:35,707
Our son has experience,
he's the most suitable.

68
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:39,969
But by seniority, Thaleh should step up.

69
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,804
He's older than Mut.

70
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:44,431
By only a few months.

71
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:49,227
And he's an ex-con.
P'Yai will never make him number one.

72
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:53,564

P'Jom, Mr. Jaruek is here.

He's just here out of courtesy.

00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:36,253
Is that true?
I had a friend who worked there.

78
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:38,751
Someone once carried
a Siamraphe shopping bag inside,

79
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,960

My condolences, Ms. Yai.

Thank you.

00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:54,831
So now you have to take back control
of Siamraphe yourself?

83

Only temporarily.
I'll let the nephews manage later.

If you care,

Why are you walking away?

144
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,729
Because I'm right?

145
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:09,609
You're only still here
because your dad and brother are dead.

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,222

- You gonna kill me too?

148
00:13:14,222 --> 00:13:16,836
Go on. Hit me! Do it!

149

Go on.

154
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,676
Or do you want to find out?

155
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:30,093
Come on then.

156
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:33,209
But lucky for you, the monk taught me this...

157
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:37,040
Using force doesn't solve anything.

158
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,547

00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:43,778
going to be some sniveling sucker
who sues people?

165
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,782
Don't stick your nose in.

166
00:13:58,782 --> 00:14:03,284
And don't be scared
that I'll steal the CEO job from you.

167
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:05,622
If you want it, take it...

168
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:07,758
I'll watch.

169
00:14:07,758 --> 00:14:12,138

never do as well as my father and brothers.

Let's start with the victims.
What happened to you?

257
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:36,360
Well, I used my Siamraphe card
to shop at the mall.

258
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:42,440
Then that evening I got a message saying
250,000 baht had been charged to my card,

259
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,911
even though I hadn't used it at all.

260
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:48,440
For me, I used the Siamraphe card
for online shopping through the mall's app.

261

Alright.

262
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,898

one day, I got a message saying

for a purchase in Singapore. 200,000 baht!

264
00:22:57,653 --> 00:23:01,987
Now many people wonder...
Lawyer, has the mall done anything yet?

265
00:23:01,987 --> 00:23:06,142
They said they're still investigating
whether the leaked data is real.

266

for customers' personal data!

yes, customer data was hacked.

they had set up protection systems.

Normally, Chon would check every month,

but now that he's gone,
no one's been doing it.

274
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,271
I think we need to quickly issue a statement
apologizing to customers

275

and telling them we're handling the problem.

276
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:46,502
Otherwise they'll say
we're not taking action.

277
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:49,578
I propose we set up a task force
to handle this,

278
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:53,258
and open a 24-hour hotline and live chat
for customers.

00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:47,200
But his actions brought Siamraphe
a lot of praise,

356
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,040
for helping bust the gang.

357
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,587
I know.

358
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:58,600
Then let's treat this
as turning a crisis into an opportunity.

359
00:30:00,911 --> 00:30:02,840
Thank you.

360
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:09,489
I want Mut and Thaleh
to both help with Siamraphe.

361
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,867
Hold on, Auntie.

362
00:30:13,867 --> 00:30:18,800
The only reason Thaleh caught them
was because he got help from prison contacts.

363
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,573
If he comes back to work,

364
00:30:20,573 --> 00:30:23,480
Siamraphe might get dragged into that world.

365
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:33,831
Didn't we already announce
Thaleh had nothing to do with Siamraphe?

366
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:37,031
That was before Klang and Chon died.

367
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:41,524
Thaleh, what do you think?

368
00:30:47,434 --> 00:30:50,314
If you believe I can help Siamraphe...

369
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:54,200
I'll do it.

370
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,182
Wait...

371
00:30:58,182 --> 00:31:00,564
Having Thaleh help is one thing.

372
00:31:00,564 --> 00:31:03,400
But helping Mut run Siamraphe?

373
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,529
People will call us a mall
with a convict CEO.

374
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:10,533
Why keep judging by the past?

375
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:12,689
Why not judge by results?

376
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:15,800
Or are you afraid
Mut can't compete with Thaleh?

377
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,200
How can someone who's been in prison
and temples compete with my son?

378
00:31:21,351 --> 00:31:25,138
As a board member of Siamraphe, I disagree.

379
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,867
Then let the board decide.

380
00:31:31,284 --> 00:31:35,240
Nam, call an urgent meeting.

381
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:40,840
Agenda is whether Thaleh can qualify for CEO.

382
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,684
Sure.

383
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:46,440
Let's eat.

384
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:29,658
Here you go, hothead.

385
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:32,560
Funny how you don't like
eating hot porridge though.

386
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:39,422
So Thalehluang is out?

387
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:45,133
Yes, but he asked to stay
at his old temple first.

388
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:49,564
You really spoil your son.

389
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:54,604
Meaning...

390
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,173
if I let him return to work, you'll be okay?

391
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,440
Instead of asking me,

392
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,391
why not ask your son if he's ready?

393
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:13,311
He's stubborn and hot-tempered.

394
00:33:13,924 --> 00:33:17,151
Arguing with him is like arguing with myself.

395
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:25,431
Then if Thaleh is ready,

396
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:29,031
can you give him a chance?

397
00:33:32,227 --> 00:33:33,880
Don't take too long.

398
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:37,787
I don't want to keep playing the cruel aunt.

399
00:33:48,031 --> 00:33:50,298
I've done my part now, Klang.

400
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,240
[Siamraphe]

401
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,680
[Siamraphe Building]

402
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:23,591
If one day the family needs you,

403
00:34:23,591 --> 00:34:25,227
you must return immediately.

404
00:34:26,653 --> 00:34:29,067
Just like the LINE group Dad named.

405
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,898
Together we stand.

406
00:34:47,147 --> 00:34:49,089
Don't worry, Mut.

407
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,173
Yesterday, I spoke with Nid.

408
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:54,760
He doesn't agree with Thaleh
having rights to CEO.

409
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,831
And Da won't dare oppose her father.

410
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,542
If Nid disagrees, Da must disagree too.

411
00:35:05,662 --> 00:35:10,822
The only rightful leader
of Siamraphe is you, Mut.

412
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:16,160
Come on.

413
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,293
Oh, wait... I'll be right there.

414
00:35:33,293 --> 00:35:35,213
Let's meet in the conference room.

415
00:35:43,782 --> 00:35:44,973
Come on.

416
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:05,680
Where's Lek?

417
00:36:07,836 --> 00:36:09,480
Call Mom.

418
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:12,560
Sorry I'm late.

419
00:36:28,116 --> 00:36:33,658
I called this meeting
to discuss about Thalehluang.

420
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,516
I want him back at work,

421
00:36:36,516 --> 00:36:41,733
but Lek believes
he shouldn't qualify for CEO.

422
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,720
What do you all think?

423
00:36:48,564 --> 00:36:54,529
I know Thaleh is talented,
but four years ago when it happened,

424
00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:58,231
our mall lost 20% of profits.

425
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:03,982
If he returns and something happens,
we can't handle it.

426
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:11,004
He spent over three years in prison,
months in a temple.

427
00:37:11,004 --> 00:37:14,796
The world has changed so much.
Can he keep up?

428
00:37:15,507 --> 00:37:19,720
Four years ago,
this place judged him before the court did.

429
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,996
Are we really going to do that again?

430
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,342
If we want Siamraphe
to catch up with the world,

431
00:37:32,342 --> 00:37:35,031
we should start by changing ourselves.

432
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:41,853
But don't forget.
We're the reason Siamraphe still stands today.

433
00:37:43,747 --> 00:37:47,840
But it'll survive tomorrow
because of the new generation.

434
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,489
Thaleh did wrong, but he paid for it.

435
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:56,236
I say give him a chance.

436
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:04,249
I agree with Mr. Thanakorn.

437
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:10,000
Especially now
that Mr. Klang and Mr. Chon are gone,

438
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,627
we need more help.

439
00:38:11,627 --> 00:38:16,493
And seeing how Thaleh handled the data leak,

440
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:22,533
I think he can help.

441
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:25,289
Help, or cause more trouble?

442
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:28,542
What trouble?

443
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:33,124
He earned us praise just yesterday.

444
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:35,520
That was only once.

445
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:41,373
How do we know he won't lash out again?

446
00:38:44,911 --> 00:38:48,360
Have you forgotten the day
of Uncle Klang and Chon's ashes ceremony?

447
00:38:50,907 --> 00:38:55,520
Exactly. Still hot-tempered.
Can he handle it?

448
00:38:56,964 --> 00:38:58,524
Right, Lek?

449
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:03,280
Lek.

450
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:05,307
Huh?

451
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,520
How about this, for fairness, let's vote.

452
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:31,742
Whoever agrees Thaleh should qualify as CEO,
raise your hand.

453
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,560
Four out of eight votes.

454
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:23,240
Not a majority, motion fails.

455
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:41,978
Mom!

456
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,738
What?

457
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:58,560
Five votes.

458
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:03,618
Meaning Thaleh qualifies to be CEO.

459
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:22,573
Mut. Thaleh.

460
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:25,484
Both of you,
come up with a project to revamp Siamraphe.

461
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:31,222
This will show who's more fit to be CEO.

462
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,516
Lek...

463
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:41,840
wait!

464
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,467
Why did you vote for him?

465
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,711
Yeah, Mom, what was that?

466
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,084
Well...

467
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:49,356
- Well what? Say it!
- Well...

468
00:41:51,387 --> 00:41:53,600
Oh, Thaleh...

469
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,582
Thank your Auntie Lek.

470
00:41:57,862 --> 00:41:59,507
Thank you, Auntie.

471
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:07,169
What's the reason? Tell us.

472
00:42:07,169 --> 00:42:08,351
I won't.

473
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:09,400
Let go.

474
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,760
Lek!

475
00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:15,756
Ms. Lek voted for Thaleh.

476
00:42:15,756 --> 00:42:17,933
Why?

477
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:20,760
She was against it at first.

478
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:25,800
Everyone has their own reasons.
