1
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:22,818
Let go! Mut, let go of me!

2
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:24,920
Sin, stop!

3
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:31,089
Tell me.

4
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:33,622
What the hell happened here?

5
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:37,618
- Dad.
- Talk!

6
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:43,787
It's not here. Where did you hide the clip?

7
00:00:43,787 --> 00:00:45,036
He's got another device.

8
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:47,098
Anda!

9
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:56,680
Dao, open the door!

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,644
Anda, open the door!

11
00:00:59,973 --> 00:01:01,324
Dao.

12
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:24,000
Give me the phone.

13
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:26,849
Why did you do this?

14
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:30,044
That night, I was drunk. We both were.

15
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:32,036
Not true. You drugged me!

16
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:34,831
Don't believe him, Anda.
He's lying to both of us.

17
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,680
Give me the phone, Anda.

18
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:39,700
I loved you.

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,898
Everyone warned me, but I didn't listen.

20
00:01:41,898 --> 00:01:43,369
Damn it.

21
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,987
Don't throw a tantrum now.

22
00:01:44,987 --> 00:01:46,867
Give me the phone.

23
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:49,342
Give it. Anda, give it to me!

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,858
Anda!

25
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:55,773
Dao!

26
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,529
Dao! Give me the phone! Give it!

27
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:05,347
- No!
- Give me the phone!

28
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:06,880
- Give it!
- No!

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,147
Let go!

30
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:13,627
- Give me the phone. Let go!
- No!

31
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:15,631
Let go, Dao! Let go!

32
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:20,360
Let go!

33
00:02:23,036 --> 00:02:25,027
Dao! Let go!

34
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,058
You lied to me, didn't you? You lied to me!

35
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:06,480
You lied to me!

36
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,373
I trusted you. And you lied!

37
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:12,627
You lied to me!

38
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,098
You lied!

39
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:16,867
I should never have trusted you.

40
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:19,858
Anda! Stop! That's enough!

41
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:21,231
Anda!

42
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:37,653
Put it here.

43
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:39,160
Quickly.

44
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:43,756
Go wash your hands and face.

45
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,240
Go!

46
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,480
Go, Anda.

47
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:14,140
Go put on your shoes.

48
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:25,178
Don't worry, Nas.

49
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:33,400
I will make sure Siamraphe
falls harder than what they did to us.

50
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:39,880
Then I rode back with Dao.

51
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,173
She told me to throw the bag away.

52
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:45,022
But... But I...

53
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:54,333
- Give me your hand.
- What are you doing, Dad?

54
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,236
Give me your hand!

55
00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:56,738
- What are you doing, Dad?
- Give me your hand!

56
00:05:56,738 --> 00:05:58,080
Give me!

57
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,129
What are you doing to me? I'm sorry!

58
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,991
You did that shit and don't even realize it?

59
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:05,316
Please, I'm begging you.

60
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:06,760
Get up!

61
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,660
I'm sorry!

62
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,109
I'll beat this sickness out of you,
you worthless brat!

63
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:23,404
Dad. Dad.

64
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:26,018
I'm sorry! Please don't hurt me!

65
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:30,222
Sin, open up!

66
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:33,940
- Mom!
- Don't hurt him. Don't hurt Anda, Sin!

67
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,533
Dad! It hurts!

68
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,422
Mut! Mut, help your brother!

69
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:43,711
Let go of me!

70
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,529
Let go! Don't!

71
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:47,400
It hurts!

72
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:53,702
Mut!

73
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,724
I thought you weren't going to show up.

74
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:03,631
Thanks for coming.

75
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,436
I wanted to talk to you too.

76
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:07,809
So we're on the same page, then.

77
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:10,542
Yes. But doing this too often can't be good.

78
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:13,720
I came today because I want to talk about...

79
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,400
- My Aunt Nam.
- Your Aunt Nam.

80
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:31,809
Good thing we don't like the same food.

81
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:33,400
No need to compete.

82
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,817
I've never liked taking
what's someone else's.

83
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,320
Are you saying you're not like your father?

84
00:07:47,182 --> 00:07:50,560
If you mean the part
where he sent spies into Siamraphe,

85
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,480
I don't agree with that either.

86
00:07:53,444 --> 00:07:55,271
You don't agree,

87
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:58,187
but you let your girlfriend
be one of his spies?

88
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:02,782
Nam? A spy for my father?

89
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,507
You really didn't know?

90
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:07,253
She was working with your father.

91
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,120
And you?

92
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,796
You might just be another pawn in his game.

93
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:19,422
You've underestimated my girlfriend.

94
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:23,133
I didn't say that to make you two fight.

95
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:27,884
What I said
was because I want us to play fair.

96
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:29,916
Stop playing dirty.

97
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:35,271
I want the end of this game to be one

98
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:37,169
where we can still smile at each other.

99
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,231
What are you trying to tell me?

100
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:48,178
I suspect Aunt Nam doesn't only have you.

101
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,591
Master Kee,
the famous fortune-teller who just died,

102
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:55,653
he knew her since childhood.

103
00:08:58,325 --> 00:09:00,449
If you don't believe me, I'll prove it.

104
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:05,822
I want to know, too,
what their relationship was.

105
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:13,441
Tonight is the third night
of the funeral rites

106
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:15,409
for Master Kee, the prognosticator,

107
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:18,773
and tonight the host is Siamraphe mall.

108
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:21,764
Of course, everyone's watching closely

109
00:09:21,764 --> 00:09:25,196
for the appearance of the Raphethada heirs,

110
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:28,147
namely Mr. Thalehluang Raphethada.

111
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:34,020
Previously, he was a suspect in the murder.

112
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,778
Please make way.

113
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:36,631
- We'd like an update on the case.
- Please let us through.

114
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:38,400
Please make way.

115
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,960
- We'd like...
- Please make way.

116
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:42,520
Please make way.

117
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:48,333
Nas.

118
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:52,102
Teacher...

119
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
made some beef panang for you.

120
00:10:57,796 --> 00:11:02,440
She says she wants to come every day,

121
00:11:03,524 --> 00:11:06,000
but is afraid people will notice.

122
00:11:09,227 --> 00:11:11,280
I said don't worry.

123
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,471
You won't be angry.

124
00:11:19,116 --> 00:11:21,031
You understand, right?

125
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:38,373
You're devastated, aren't you?

126
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:53,191
He was the family fortune-teller
for the Raphethada.

127
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:56,502
I thought you were sad
because he was an old friend.

128
00:11:56,502 --> 00:12:01,098
Wait... Or maybe more than a friend?

129
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:10,164
You two conspired to destroy Siamraphe,

130
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:13,529
tricking everyone, tricking my child.

131
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:18,004
Good thing he died first.

132
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:22,916
Otherwise, I'd drag you both to jail.

133
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,449
On what charges?

134
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:35,502
And is your family ready to be in the news
like four years ago?

135
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:38,538
Maybe even bigger this time.

136
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:41,653
I'm not as forgiving as Yai.

137
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,298
If I find the evidence one day,

138
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:49,698
I won't just kick you out of Siamraphe.

139
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:54,493
I'll ruin your standing in society forever.

140
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:58,283
I'm scared.

141
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:09,871
You see?

142
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:15,040
What your girlfriend really is?

143
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:05,236
Master Kee was my school friend from

144
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:08,462
before I joined the Raphethada household.

145
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:16,742
Did you really collude with him and my father
to destroy Siamraphe?

146
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:21,600
I hate them all.

147
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:31,689
Nas knows how much I have been oppressed,

148
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:34,071
how terribly my heart was harmed.

149
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,133
He felt sorry for me

150
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:42,160
and promised to help me
get revenge on everyone.

151
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:46,160
What about my father?

152
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:50,298
Your father also wants Siamraphe.

153
00:14:50,298 --> 00:14:52,587
I want to destroy it.

154
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:54,502
It's a win-win for us both.

155
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:00,458
Thap.

156
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:06,040
But it's different with you.

157
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:14,680
I never knew you before.

158
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:19,480
I may have lied to everyone at Siamraphe,
but I never lied to you.

159
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:26,191
And me being a mole for Mr. Jaruek,

160
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:29,622
doesn't mean I don't love you.

161
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:37,582
And what about Ms. Rin's family.

162
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:40,009
What got you involved?

163
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:44,413
Her daughter and Ms. Lek's son...

164
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:47,240
killed my friend.

165
00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:51,018
I found a clip in my friend's room.

166
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:53,027
Nam.

167
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:57,364
So why didn't you give it to the police?

168
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:01,013
Good people like you won't understand.

169
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:08,667
Do you still love me?

170
00:16:09,404 --> 00:16:10,742
Huh, Thap?

171
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:14,284
Or...

172
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,764
do you believe Rin and Thaleh more than me?

173
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:30,498
Huh, Thap?

174
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,093
I don't trust them.

175
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:45,000
But I'm worried about you.

176
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:49,000
Your friend is already dead.

177
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,427
What if more happens?

178
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:58,293
I don't want to lose you too.

179
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:06,204
Thap, do you trust me?

180
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,796
Thap.

181
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,822
You still love me, right?

182
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:17,084
Do you believe me now?

183
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:26,621
I haven't slept for nights.

184
00:18:28,844 --> 00:18:33,049
Then sleep, Nam. I'll take care of you.

185
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,347
Two hundred baht in gold.

186
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:19,129
Ten million.

187
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:21,893
And keep your promise.

188
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:24,627
Or you know what'll happen next.

189
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:27,711
Whoa, threatening again?

190
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:29,400
I'm not stupid.

191
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:32,124
Good.

192
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:33,640
By the way...

193
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:37,853
How does your father know those people?

194
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:41,809
Raphethada and Siamraphe look clean enough.

195
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:45,720
Nothing personal.

196
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,769
Just in case I ever hate someone,
maybe I'll ask you to pass the message along.

197
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:52,307
You know those people are brutal, right?

198
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:54,533
They made us work day and night.

199
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:57,440
At first,
I didn't think I'd make it out alive.

200
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:00,849
So how did you get out?

201
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:03,560
Did Jaruek help you?

202
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:06,724
He had nothing to do with it.

203
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:09,929
I just got lucky.
Found someone else who wanted to escape too.

204
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:15,929
But when I got out,
I saw your father's men heading in.

205
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,004
What were they doing there?

206
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:22,769
Saving you, of course.

207
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:25,236
I know now I went too far.

208
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:27,169
You're a decent guy, huh?

209
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:29,400
Owning up when you mess up.

210
00:20:34,578 --> 00:20:36,547
Let's call it even.

211
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,618
All settled, Dad.

212
00:20:57,618 --> 00:21:00,027
You sure this is really over?

213
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:03,911
After all that. And she got ten million too.

214
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:06,880
If she's smart, she'll stop now.

215
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,889
But when I got out,
I saw your father's men heading in.

216
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:26,151
What were they doing there?

217
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,960
Saving you, of course.

218
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,089
I know now I went too far.

219
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,938
You're a decent guy, huh?

220
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:34,009
Owning up when you mess up.

221
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,360
[Mr. Jaruek]

222
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:48,427
I told you. He'll pay up.

223
00:21:48,427 --> 00:21:51,262
And you're happy with just ten million?

224
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,053
That's only the first ten million.

225
00:21:56,342 --> 00:21:59,564
There'll be plenty more after that.

226
00:21:59,564 --> 00:22:02,947
I don't think it's worth
playing with someone like Pasin.

227
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,800
Here's the deal.

228
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,627
I'll give you thirty million
and a safe house anywhere you want.

229
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:09,480
Your choice.

230
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,533
And what do you want me to do?

231
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,680
[Building a future for youth:
Upload Your Future]

232
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:42,600
Mut.

233
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:47,662
Okay, the system's ready.
Let's go, everyone! Come on!

234
00:22:47,662 --> 00:22:49,951
Yay!

235
00:22:51,018 --> 00:22:53,973
- Let's go!
- Yay!

236
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:07,124
You know how to use a computer?

237
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,498
I saw your father's men heading in.

238
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:14,240
What were they doing there?

239
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,111
Saving you, of course.

240
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:18,276
I know now I went too far.

241
00:23:18,276 --> 00:23:20,302
You're a decent guy, huh?

242
00:23:20,302 --> 00:23:22,440
Owning up when you mess up.

243
00:23:23,524 --> 00:23:28,738
I thought about this for a long time
before deciding to speak up.

244
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:30,791
At first, I was scared.

245
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,840
But then I remembered being kidnapped
and forced to work in a call center.

246
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:38,329
It was the worst time of my life.

247
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:43,613
So I decided I had to speak out...

248
00:23:45,036 --> 00:23:49,373
so no one else would become
a victim of this family again.

249
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:50,871
Boyfriend or bastard?

250
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:52,511
Both. But filthy rich.

251
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:53,884
Put him in jail.

252
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:56,133
Siamraphe. Always rotten to the core.

253
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,013
These bruises?

254
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:02,249
I was beaten with computer cables.

255
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:04,356
Then I was locked up.

256
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:05,871
They starved me.

257
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:07,982
I kept asking myself...

258
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,756
What did I do wrong?

259
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:13,196
Why would someone who loves me...

260
00:24:13,196 --> 00:24:17,369
Why would my boyfriend do this?

261
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:21,209
I just want justice.

262
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,907
To punish those responsible.

263
00:24:25,782 --> 00:24:28,858
And stop supporting a shopping mall

264
00:24:29,507 --> 00:24:35,822
whose executives let their kids
hurt people like this.

00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:41,196
Mut!

266
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:43,240
Mut!

267
00:24:45,782 --> 00:24:47,347
Mut, where are you going?

268
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:48,880
Stay out of it.

269
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,065
Can you calm down for a second?

270
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:53,173
You know Nali's working with Jaruek.

271
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:56,396
She's provoking you so you'll go after her.

272
00:24:56,396 --> 00:24:57,724
And you want me to just sit back?

273
00:24:57,724 --> 00:24:59,680
I'm saying, keep your head straight.

274
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:04,138
This isn't just about you anymore.
It's about Siamraphe.

275
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:07,209
I told you before.

276
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:09,138
It's just us left now.

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,840

278
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,560
[Dad]

279
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:29,204
Go back inside. I'll follow.

280
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:34,227
Or do you want to stay
and hear my dad yell at me?

281
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:50,102
I saw it already, Dad. I'll handle it.

282
00:25:50,102 --> 00:25:52,191
Handle what, huh?

283
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:54,502
Do you realize how serious this is?

284
00:25:54,502 --> 00:25:57,644
Your grandfather just called to chew me out!

285
00:25:57,644 --> 00:26:00,280
But you're the one
who told me to use this method!

286
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,436
I told you to talk to her. Clear things up.

287
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:05,809
Not talk in whatever damn way
gets you recorded!

288
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:07,649
Damn it! Go wherever you want then!

289
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,609
What's that supposed to mean, Dad?

290
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,724
Or do you want to come home
so the cops can drag you out by the collar?

291
00:26:12,724 --> 00:26:15,569
Even your grandfather's pull
won't save you this time.

292
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:17,120
Damn it.

293
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:24,511
Kee.

294
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm sorry.

295
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:31,342
Please don't be mad at me, I didn't mean to.

296
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:38,773
Thank you so much.

00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,870

00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:11,676
Anda.

300
00:28:11,676 --> 00:28:13,342
It's me.

301
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:38,907
If you're hungry later, you can eat, okay?

302
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,009
I'll give you medicine.

303
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,444
Anda,

304
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:54,253
I'm sorry.

305
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,520
No matter what, you're my child.

306
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:05,258
Get out.

307
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,236
Get out!

308
00:29:09,236 --> 00:29:11,724
- Anda.
- Get out!

309
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:17,693
Get out!

310
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:23,133
Get out!

311
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,640
Get out!

312
00:29:37,271 --> 00:29:40,298
Where did everyone disappear to
when trouble happened?

313
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,653
Mr. Pasin.

314
00:29:45,587 --> 00:29:47,671
Have you taken care of everything?

315
00:29:47,671 --> 00:29:52,822
I've handled Anda's fingerprints and
the condo CCTV at Master Kee's place, sir.

316
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:57,098
But you should see the footage
from your camera.

317
00:29:57,098 --> 00:29:59,844
What the hell is this about now?

318
00:29:59,844 --> 00:30:01,058
Here you go.

319
00:30:08,147 --> 00:30:10,124
Jesus, you bastard.

320
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:15,284
I went in to talk to him,
but they chased me out.

321
00:30:15,284 --> 00:30:17,276
What should I do, Pipe?

322
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:21,791
Calm down first.
I'll ask the doctor what they can do.

323
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:25,871
Don't panic yet. I'll help you and Anda.

324
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:27,378
Okay?

325
00:30:34,262 --> 00:30:37,569
I told you to break up with him.
Why haven't you?

326
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,302
What are you talking about?

327
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,462
You said you didn't know
he was seeing that guy.

328
00:30:49,462 --> 00:30:51,893
So why bring him home?

329
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,204
Well...

330
00:30:53,204 --> 00:30:55,960
I heard from Pipe
that our kid's close to Master Kee.

331
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,573
So I went to talk to them,

332
00:30:57,573 --> 00:31:00,622
but Pipe stopped me
because he was afraid he'd run off.

333
00:31:00,622 --> 00:31:02,609
I'm the father. Why wasn't I told?

334
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:04,867
But you had to tell him?

335
00:31:05,862 --> 00:31:08,844
Have you ever cared for our child at all?

336
00:31:08,844 --> 00:31:12,004
Have you seen what our child looks like?

337
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:14,773
If anything happens to them,

338
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:16,560
it's because of you.

339
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,071
You think I'm the one?

340
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:20,796
And you lot.
Running around with that tennis coach,

341
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,182
never looking after the kids.

342
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:25,600
You love him so much, right?

343
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,351
I'll make him disappear from your life.

344
00:31:28,351 --> 00:31:30,867
Stop it, Sin. Don't.
What are you going to do? Don't.

345
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:32,556
- You'll see.
- Ow!

346
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:37,049
Sin!

347
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:48,326
Pipe, did you hear that?

348
00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:50,129
Run away, Pipe.

349
00:31:50,129 --> 00:31:53,369
No. I won't run.

350
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,756
I'll protect you and Anda myself.

351
00:32:18,594 --> 00:32:21,214
- Mr. Prakarn Tharapol, right?
- Yes.

352
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:27,507
You're suspected of involvement
in the death of Keeta Sapkajorn.

353
00:32:27,507 --> 00:32:29,022
This is a summons.

354
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:35,822
Please come give a statement
at the police station.

355
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:37,062
Please come.

356
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:46,003
Tennis coach Prakarn has been summoned

357
00:32:46,003 --> 00:32:50,636
after being suspected in the murder
of famed fortune-teller Keeta.

358
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:54,631
Police found important evidence.

359
00:32:54,631 --> 00:33:01,209
His bag contained a heavy object,
which is likely the murder weapon,

360
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:03,400
hidden in his trunk.

361
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:12,129
Witnesses also saw Prakarn coming and going
from the victim's condo before the incident.

362
00:33:12,129 --> 00:33:15,800
Police are focusing on two main motives,

363
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:21,173
which are disputes over benefit
and a love affair.

364
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:32,902
Why would a tennis coach kill Master Kee?

365
00:33:32,902 --> 00:33:34,978
Isn't it related to the mall owner's family?

366
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:38,644
My kid studies with Coach Pipe.
I can't believe he'd kill Master Kee.

367
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:41,440
A love affair? With Master Kee?

368
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,080
Is he the scapegoat?

369
00:33:46,378 --> 00:33:50,689
I won't let you throw this on someone else.

370
00:33:54,724 --> 00:33:58,142
Why didn't you take the case?
Did Sin order you not to?

371
00:33:58,142 --> 00:34:02,191
Lek, you planted the evidence
in Pipe's car, didn't you?

372
00:34:06,173 --> 00:34:08,529
You put the evidence in Pipe's car,
didn't you?

373
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:10,844
I was trying to help.
You said I never did anything for the kids.

374
00:34:10,844 --> 00:34:13,742
So I fixed it so he wouldn't go to jail.

375
00:34:13,742 --> 00:34:16,107
By framing someone else?

376
00:34:16,107 --> 00:34:20,049
Rin, I'm trying to help you
solve the kids' problem.

377
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:23,809
So Dao and Anda won't have to be involved
in that fortune-teller's death case.

378
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:25,809
My kid and your child has no record.

379
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:27,520
But Pipe didn't do it.

380
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,267
"But Pipe didn't do it."

381
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:33,373
Then go tell the police Anda killed Keeta.

382
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:36,129
I'd like to see if you'd love him enough
to protect him

383
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:38,813
while your child goes to jail.

384
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,982
He may have been wrong for having an affair,

385
00:34:41,982 --> 00:34:44,271
but he doesn't deserve this.

386
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:46,400
You're destroying his life, Sin.

387
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,947
Are you being naive? Huh?

388
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:52,253
If my kid gets nailed,
your kid will be charged with conspiracy too.

389
00:34:52,253 --> 00:34:53,849
You want that?

390
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:56,284
Do you want us to lock them all up?

391

396
00:35:21,182 --> 00:35:24,218
Well, the 58th anniversary is coming up.

397
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:27,022
And if that day comes,

398
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:31,369
they'll have so much bad press
no one will trust them anymore.

399
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:37,320
Then only I'll be left
to take over as Siamraphe's leader.

400
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,564
Exactly. This.

401

If my son got a passionate girlfriend
like you, that'd be perfect.

402

He's about to get married.
