00:00:00,717 --> 00:00:02,527
See ya.

2
00:00:04,076 --> 00:00:06,769
Sorry, Mr. Mut.
Mr. Thaleh insisted on coming in.

3
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:10,587
I tried to stop him, but he wouldn't listen.

4
00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:12,147
I'm so sorry.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,636
It's fine.

6
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:16,707
I was just finishing the meeting.

7
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:20,658
Thanks, everyone.

8
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:37,240
What do you want?

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,907
You want to beat me?
Then compete with me directly.

10
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:43,520
But don't drag Siamraphe into it.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,604
I'm not afraid to lose to someone talented.

12
00:00:46,604 --> 00:00:48,840
But I refuse to lose to a bastard.

13
00:00:50,022 --> 00:00:52,284
- Who are you calling that?
- You!

14
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:54,964
Needing your mom to plan everything
just to make achievements.

15
00:00:54,964 --> 00:01:00,004
Don't you ever think?
If kids fight and someone gets hurt...

16
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:03,613
having your girlfriend live stream
to bring people back won't solve it.

17
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:05,978
But I solved it, didn't I?

18
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:07,867
And Aunt Yai praised me.

19
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,844
After all those years abroad,

20
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:13,081
all those internships...

21
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:15,093
and this is all you can do?

22
00:01:16,222 --> 00:01:18,427
Bigger waste of time
than me sitting in prison.

23
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:19,769

24
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:21,676
Hey!

00:01:23,137 --> 00:01:24,470
Hey!

26
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:30,107
Let go!

27
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:32,636
Thaleh, let me go!

28
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:36,520
I used to think, if you were really capable,

29
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,951
I'd let you run Siamraphe.

30
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:44,671
But now I know,
in your hands, it'll be destroyed.

31
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,951
Let me go, Thaleh!

32
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:51,898
I'll do whatever it takes
to become the leader of Siamraphe.

33
00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:55,693

This way, please.

48
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:25,356
Yes, look at the camera. Fabulous.

49

Closer, please.
It doesn't look natural enough.

Okay, closer.

Next time, I'll bring my mom
to have her fortune told with you.

Of course, I'll book her a slot.

Yes. But what are you
going to do with them?

I told you, just add their names
as part of your down line.

And there's no way the information leaks?

It's been a long time, Mr. Dernthap.

97
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,496
Hello, Ms. Yai.
Lately I've been flying a lot,

98
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:30,880
lining up new shops to put in the complex
for my dad.

99
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:35,093
Heaven Complex is massive...

100
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:36,747
Good thing Dernthap's been helping.

101
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:40,293
I only have one child,
but he's capable, so it works out.

102
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:43,616
If you have many children
and they're not capable,

103
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:45,164
it just causes trouble.

104
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:48,933
So, why did you want to see me?

105
00:08:49,978 --> 00:08:52,191
I brought you a gift.

106
00:09:03,351 --> 00:09:05,587
And I want to tell you...

107
00:09:06,382 --> 00:09:08,973
stop interfering with my family.

108
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:13,840
Whatever you're doing,
you're not the only one capable of it.

109
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,862
So what, am I supposed to act scared now?

110
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:19,117

111
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:22,827
Term said they just voted
to change the sky train route.

112
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:27,276

If the sky train won't pass...

116
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:46,711
maybe Heaven Complex should give out

117
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:51,116
monthly bus passes on Grand Opening day?

118
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:59,147
You went as far as ordering the route change?

119
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:03,289
An old woman on her deathbed like me...

120
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:06,071
how could I have the strength
to order anyone around?

121
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:09,427
Besides, that land doesn't belong to me
anymore.

122
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:12,044
Why would I push for the train
to pass through it?

123
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:16,604
Being an only child is tiring, isn't it?

124
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:52,200
Are you stressed?

125
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:56,493
She really plays tough, doesn't she.

126
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:02,284
Think of it as a test
for the heir of Heaven Plaza.

127
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:05,561
Then I must have failed,

128
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:08,511
because no matter what I propose,
my father never approves.

129
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:13,067
Being Jaruek's son is tough, isn't it?

130
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,740
And being Tara's sister isn't tiring for you?

131
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:23,609
No, I think it's fun to face problems.

132
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:26,391
Because every time I solve one,

133
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:28,693
I feel like...

134
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:30,480
I've grown stronger.

135
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:36,673
And if you couldn't solve it?

136
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:38,647
Couldn't solve it...

137
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,249
never happened yet.

138
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:45,329
That's impressive.

139
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,600
I wish Heaven Plaza had someone like you.

140
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:51,707
If we could join forces, it would be great.

141
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,142
Wow. That hurts more than my dad scolding me.

142
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,951
I didn't know you were close
with Jaruek's son.

143
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,764
I only checked in to see
how much trouble he was in.

144
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:41,796
And just now, what did you mean?

145
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:44,907
Why did you tell him
not to interfere with our family?

146
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:48,022
I just wanted him to see...

147
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:51,653
that our family isn't as weak as he thinks.

148
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:54,844
But before I get to that point,
I have a question.

149
00:12:56,013 --> 00:13:01,440
Ms. Yai was sitting here for a long while,
then disappeared. Did anyone see her?

150
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,044
I was just about to... oh, okay.

151
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:14,689
Thank you for coming back to listen.

152
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:17,480
Because what I'm about to say...

153
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,956
is about Ms. Tara Raphethada.

154
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:26,284
For decades in this industry,

155
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:31,729
I've walked alongside you
as a business rival.

00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:34,293
I want to thank you...

157
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:38,173
for keeping me alert, bold, daring,

158
00:13:38,173 --> 00:13:42,160
for making me enjoy developing
and improving without stopping.

159
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,747
Thank you, for always being a driving force.

160
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:52,653
But from now on...

161
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:55,462
I want to say...

162
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:57,107
things will never be the same.

163
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:59,942
The entire game is going to change.

164
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:06,809
I will repay you tenfold.

165
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:13,000
I will become a pressure
you've never faced in your life.

166
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,147
And Heaven Plaza will rise as the leader
of this game, without a doubt.

167
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:28,342
Remember my words,
whether they comfort you or not.

168
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:30,400
It will happen.

169
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:33,778
Thank you.

170
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,218
Now, all the villagers
have agreed to relocate.

171
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:47,987
And the case has been closed.
It was ruled an accident.

172
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,461
The fire started at the shrine.

173
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,653
Even with you sketching the suspect's face,
nothing can be done?

174
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,756
A friend of mine
who knows people on the case said

175
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:00,973
they were ordered to close it quickly.

176
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:07,516
And about the plane crash,
did you get anything new, Non?

177
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:11,524
I took the pilot's video you gave me
to a doctor.

178
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:14,778
He said the pilot did look strange.

179
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:16,911
But when we checked their medical history,

180
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:19,160
neither had any chronic illness.

181
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,933
And did the doctor say
what caused the symptoms?

182
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:28,036
He couldn't. And I checked
the air traffic officer's finances.

183
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:31,573
Money was transferred
to clear his credit card and other debts,

184
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:34,276
two weeks before the crash.

185
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:37,520
But we can't trace
where that money came from.

186
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:49,231
Yes?

187
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:52,378
If you want to know
who killed Klang and Chon...

188
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:54,200
we need to talk.

189
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,836
Don't forget about safety.

190
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:16,399
I think we should add more security.

191
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,111
On the actual day,
there'll be lots of kids and pets.

192
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:23,404
Got it. If there's anything else,
just let me know.

193
00:16:23,404 --> 00:16:25,004
Thank you.

194
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:36,316
She hasn't come yet.

195
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:38,156
I know.

196
00:16:38,156 --> 00:16:40,538
I just wanted to ask how she's doing.

197
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:43,053
Is something going on?

198
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:45,800
No wonder yesterday
she seemed quiet, unusual.

199
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,227
She asked to leave early,
and today she texted she'd be late.

200
00:16:50,227 --> 00:16:52,191
Is something wrong between you two?

201
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:53,893
A little.

202
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:56,596
But I'm worried about her.

203
00:16:56,596 --> 00:16:58,702
She won't pick up my calls.

204
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:02,720
Could you try calling Cheeva for me?

205
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,013
Sure.

206
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:13,314
- Hello...
- Don't answer, just hang up.

207
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:15,073
Come talk to me face-to-face.

208
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:16,733
Tong's calling.

209
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:18,720
- If it's about work...
- Forget work.

210
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,724
Come talk to me properly.
How can you say things like that?

211
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:24,769
Hey, what the hell between you two?

212
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:27,307
I'll call you back.

213
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,811
Don't lie to me.

214
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:38,071
I already know
you threw Pong's medicine away.

215
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:40,791
Every day, do you give Pong vitamins?

216
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,480
How did you find out?

217
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:46,067
We tested it.

218
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,058
How could you do that?

219
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:51,444
That's your son.

220
00:17:55,262 --> 00:17:57,099
Auntie...

221
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:59,415
- Auntie...
- If he wasn't my son,

222
00:17:59,415 --> 00:18:01,582
I would have let him die a long time ago.

223
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,009
Don't you feel anything?

224
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:09,396
What am I supposed to feel?

225
00:18:09,396 --> 00:18:11,090
Even if he's half-asleep there,

226
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,676
he supports me,
he sends me a hundred thousand a month.

227
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,018
And if he gets better
and goes to sell burgers with you,

228
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:18,564
at most he'll make ten thousand.

229
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,204
Is that enough to live on?

230
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:23,667
And every day,
the money we eat and live on...

231
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,556
Don't you start claiming
you're the one supporting me.

232
00:18:25,556 --> 00:18:28,062
The cash spend and the money
propping up your burger shop...

233
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:31,284
it's all the same money
you keep chewing me out over.

234
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:33,618
But you're deceiving everyone.

235
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:38,928
I still remember the first day
you chose to go live.

236
00:18:38,928 --> 00:18:41,644
You said you wanted Pong to get better.

237
00:18:41,644 --> 00:18:44,284
You said you'd use the money to treat him.

238
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:47,080
And now?

239
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:52,102
You're trying to kill your own son.

240

241
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:56,480
Sooner or later he would have died anyway.

242
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,236
Shouldn't he be grateful
he can support his mother?

243
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:02,858
- You're not going to stop, are you?
- You stop.

244
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:07,862
And don't pretend to be some saint,
acting outraged.

245
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:09,836
Everything was fine till you had to butt in
and find out for yourself.

246
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:11,485
And don't you dare tell anyone.

247
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,591

the way you have been.

Get out. I'm going live.

Thank you.

254
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:42,812
- to talk about the live-studio project.
- Okay.

255
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,351
Okay.

for the Green Tech interactive project,

267
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:38,138
and arranged a live studio for Nali,
and she approved.

268
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:40,560
Then we'll find another space, okay?

269

But that spot has heavy foot traffic.

273
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,613
If we make a studio for Nali to live stream,

274
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:02,271

You shouldn't have talked to him like that.
He was helping me.

You know I don't like him.

00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:36,227
But at least Thaleh doesn't cheat.

357
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:42,815
Why did you make Mut and Thaleh
play Jenga today?

358
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:46,720
If you two keep fighting like this...

359
00:27:48,018 --> 00:27:52,360
I'll appoint someone else
as leader of Siamraphe.

360
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:59,276
No, you can't let an outsider run Siamraphe.

361
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:01,124
Who said outsider?

362
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:03,636
There are still many board members.

363
00:28:08,871 --> 00:28:12,982
I'm sorry for arguing in front of the staff.

364
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,871
Next time, I'll control myself better.

365
00:28:19,551 --> 00:28:23,160
I'm sorry too. I'll focus on work

366
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,124
and won't cause headaches.

367
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:27,138
Please give me another chance.

368
00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:35,569
You'll get another chance.

369
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,258
But remember...

370
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:42,284
mistakes don't always come with do-overs.

371
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:47,364
Siamraphe is being targeted.

372
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,733
Do you mean Jaruek?

373
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:53,960
I mean all competitors.

374
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:58,187
And if the leaders of Siamraphe
keep fighting like this,

375
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:00,916
no one else needs to destroy us.

376
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:04,396
We'll collapse like that Jenga just now.

377
00:29:06,604 --> 00:29:10,569
A true leader isn't just skilled.

378
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:14,556
They must earn trust from those around them.

379
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:17,222
You're both doing well now.

380
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,160
Keep it up.

381
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:23,844
On Siamraphe's 58th anniversary...

382
00:29:24,911 --> 00:29:30,036
I'll announce the heir,
the one who will lead Siamraphe.

383
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:47,133
Sorry, the food is ready.

384
00:29:53,618 --> 00:29:54,920

385
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:14,418
- Nam.
- Yes?

386
00:30:14,418 --> 00:30:16,978
What did Yai call Weerin to talk about?

387
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:20,227
I don't know.

388
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:24,676
Must be personal,
she didn't say anything to me.

389
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:28,400
Are you calling me nosy?

390
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,702
Thaleh, Dao, want to play pickleball
at the sports club?

391
00:30:48,702 --> 00:30:51,151
I have to go to the new market
behind the mall.

392
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:52,907
I've got a work meeting first.

00:30:54,671 --> 00:30:57,351
No, I'm not going to the mall.

You're meeting Kee again, aren't you?

397
00:31:08,004 --> 00:31:11,244
Don't look at me like that.
I'm really going for work.

- Yes?

399
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:19,960
- Keep an eye on her for me, tell me later.
- Sure.

400
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:31,484
Non said neither pilot had chronic illnesses.

401
00:31:31,484 --> 00:31:35,493
But I saw their symptoms,
they looked strange, like...

402
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,560
Like they'd been drugged, right?

403
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,547
Two weeks before the crash,

404
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:56,764
Seksan met someone near his home.

405
00:31:56,764 --> 00:32:00,529
Not long after,
he suddenly had money to pay off debts.

406
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:04,658
And do you know who he met with?

407
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:10,964
If we find that man,
we might learn who's really behind this.

408
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:12,311
Could it be...

409
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:14,076

00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:16,840
What are you two talking about?

411

Is there something
Weerin can know but I can't?

412
00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:22,862
Don't worry,

413
00:32:22,862 --> 00:32:26,489
I'd never say anything that harms you.
I'm not that kind of person.

414
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:29,022
I'm just afraid you'll take advantage
of my child.

415
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:31,427
This has nothing to do with the kids.

416
00:32:31,427 --> 00:32:35,000
Then is there something you can't tell me?

417
00:32:38,196 --> 00:32:43,267
It's the same as when
you and Weerin keep things from me.

418
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:48,947
Don't think I don't notice.

419
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:52,698

440
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:31,747
Yes, my aunt really did it.

441
00:34:31,747 --> 00:34:34,622
And I already told her to stop.

442
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:36,711
But she won't.

443
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:39,529
She even cursed me,
told me to stop pretending,

444
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:43,711
because our whole household
survives on donations.

445
00:34:43,711 --> 00:34:45,062

447
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:51,680
She raised me. She paid for my schooling.

448
00:34:52,573 --> 00:34:54,569
I owe her everything.

449
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:57,413

aren't the same.

00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:28,062
Thank you.

533
00:42:31,044 --> 00:42:33,222
I'm sorry.

534
00:42:34,004 --> 00:42:36,698
If I'd known sooner,

535
00:42:36,698 --> 00:42:38,938
I could've helped you.

536
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:49,262
But I truly didn't know how to stop her.

537
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,458
I don't want to betray her,

538
00:42:55,422 --> 00:42:59,000
but I really didn't know
how to make her stop.

539
00:43:07,716 --> 00:43:10,227
You knew all along, Pong?

540
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:18,924
Go. Go back.

541
00:43:18,924 --> 00:43:22,893
And don't meddle with Cheeva.
Stop poking at her.

542
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:24,489
I want to talk to Cheeva.

543
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:25,738
I told you not to talk to her.

544
00:43:25,738 --> 00:43:29,733
- Cheeva!
- I told you not to talk to her.

545
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:31,840
Go away. Go back.

546
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,636
Enough, Auntie.

547
00:43:32,636 --> 00:43:33,756
- Go back.
- Cheeva.

548
00:43:33,756 --> 00:43:35,760
Don't let him in, don't talk to him,

549
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,702
and don't believe what he says.

550
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:39,613
Pack your things and go home.

551
00:43:39,613 --> 00:43:41,538
Now!

552
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:43,360
Go now!

553
00:43:44,178 --> 00:43:45,920
Anything else?

554
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,893
What is this? What are you doing?

555
00:43:47,893 --> 00:43:49,187
Throwing your stuff away.

556
00:43:49,187 --> 00:43:52,311
- Why? That's my stuff.
- From now on,

557
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:54,249
you need to stop live-streaming
donation drives.

558
00:43:54,249 --> 00:43:56,031
This is my stuff!

559
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,911
I told you to stop being naïve.

560
00:43:58,911 --> 00:44:01,542
If I don't do this, how will I feed myself?

561
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:05,400
The money from your burger stall isn't
enough to pay for your brother's treatment.

562
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,951
That's enough.

563
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:09,320
If you quit online gambling.

564
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:17,960
That's not true, Cheeva. It's not true.

565
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,538
Wait... what?

566
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:24,267
Give me that!

567
00:44:24,267 --> 00:44:26,520
If you're not gambling anymore,
what are you afraid of?

568
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:30,996
Go inside and talk. Talk in the house. Go in.

569
00:44:30,996 --> 00:44:32,187
Cheeva!

570
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:33,462
Go!

571
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,920
Cheeva!

572
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:55,187
How is it?

573
00:44:55,187 --> 00:44:58,053
Turns out Auntie really gambled.

574
00:44:58,053 --> 00:45:00,449
She said it was an investment.

575
00:45:02,227 --> 00:45:04,307
What should I do?

576
00:45:05,609 --> 00:45:08,640
I can't tell you what to do...

577
00:45:09,951 --> 00:45:13,067
but a monk who once taught me said,

578
00:45:13,067 --> 00:45:15,987
whenever you must choose
between what's right and what you like,

579
00:45:15,987 --> 00:45:18,132
choose what's right.

580
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,440
People's hearts can change,

581
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,827
but what's right never changes.

582
00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:26,573
Okay.

583
00:45:26,573 --> 00:45:28,800
I'm parking in front of your place.
