00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,711
Oil.

2
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:39,582
Why are you moving my things?

3
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:51,182
I'm transferring you to Customer Relations.

4
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:55,671
Because of Thap?
I've never discussed work with Thap.

5
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:59,738
Then how did you get the connection
at Ms. Kaew's shop?

6
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:01,673
Don't say you knew her before.

7
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:05,102
I know Ms. Kaew is close to Jaruek.

8
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:07,689
But Siamraphe benefited from it.

9
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:15,920
Are you going to make Siamraphe
benefit every single time?

10
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:22,258
Everything I'm doing is for you...

11
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:27,831
So you can date him
without work getting mixed in.

[Thara Raphethada]

14
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,840
The projects you've left unfinished...

15
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,996
hand them over to Mut and Thaleh.

16
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:06,240
You both take over from Seenam.

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,836
Where is Aunt Nam going?

18
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:16,253
Nowhere, just a small reassignment.

19
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:20,773
From now on,
Seenam won't sit on the executive board.

20
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:24,502
You don't need to attend board meetings.

21
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:30,556
Your duty is assistant.
Take orders from me only.

Get ready to go down to Phang Nga next week.

23
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:37,249
I'm going to wrap up
Klang and Chon's unfinished deals.

24
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:38,600
You may go.

25
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:02,409
Thaleh.

26
00:03:05,898 --> 00:03:07,987
Hey, Thaleh.

27
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,191
Come here.

28
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,173
- What's your problem?
- Hurry up.

29
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,742
What did Aunt Nam do
to make Aunt Yai this angry?

30
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,880
If you want to know, ask Aunt Yai yourself.

31
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:24,582
Don't be a jerk. I know you know.

32
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:28,218
You didn't even look surprised
when she gave the order.

33
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,276
How about you stop
nosing into others' business.

34
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:35,200
Worry about yourself first.

35
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,307
How far has the Nali mess gone?

36
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:44,164
- What's that got to do with me?
- She's your girlfriend.

37
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:46,622
Aren't you worried?
Your girlfriend's missing.

38
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,756
Or did she disappear because of you?

39
00:03:51,884 --> 00:03:53,311
Bastard.

40
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:55,351
You picking a fight with me?

41
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,009
I've got nothing to do with it.

42
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:02,191
I don't know what you did,

43
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:05,307
but you know Jaruek's
trying to destroy us right now.

44
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:07,960
Don't screw up like I did.

45
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,336
A jailbird like you
thinks he can lecture me?

46
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:12,373
I've been to prison, that's why I can.

47
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:17,756
If you slip up now and it hits Siamraphe,

48
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:20,329
there'll be no one left to fix things for us.

49
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:22,907
It's just us now.

50
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:27,209
I will never mess up like you.

51
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:41,933
Ms. Nam, ma'am!

52
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,021
What is it?

53
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:45,351
Orders are you're not allowed inside.

54
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,680
- Why?
- I don't know, ma'am. I'm sorry.

55
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:02,840
Ms. Da...

56
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,098
You can go now.
And stop meddling with my father.

00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,156
Ms. Da, what is going on?

58
00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:10,297
I know everything.

59
00:05:10,297 --> 00:05:14,551
How you buttered up my father
until he changed his will for you.

60
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:16,996
You think I'm too stupid to see through you?

61
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:18,409
Leave. Now.

00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:20,573

Please calm down and hear me out.

66
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:28,649
Don't, Ms. Nam. Please go.

67
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:34,036
Counselor, what's going on?
Is Uncle angry at me?

68
00:05:34,036 --> 00:05:37,351
He's asked me to amend the will
back to what it was.

69
00:05:43,622 --> 00:05:49,067
Uncle. Uncle, I don't care about the will.

70
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,382
Why are you angry with me?

71
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:52,356
Can you tell me?

72
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:59,604
Yai told me about you and Jaruek's son.

73
00:05:59,604 --> 00:06:03,840
I can't leave my estate
to someone dating the enemy's child.

74
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,289
Go home. If it's not necessary, don't come.

75
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,040
Uncle, please listen to me.

76
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,533
Uncle, please.

77
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,791

gave you Seenam's projects to handle?

81
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:38,020
If anything comes up, tell me.

82
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,529
Thank you, Dad.

[Pasin: 0; Mr. X: 2]

89
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:48,107
So you're not that tough after all.

90
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:49,684
Or are you only tough with women?

91
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:51,831
What the hell is your problem?

92
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,142
You think just because you're Jaruek's son,
I won't touch you?

93
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:59,964
And you think being a minister's son
makes you untouchable?

94
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,951
Don't you lay a finger on Nam again.

95
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:03,982
Nam?

96
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:08,498
- That Seenam?
- Nam is my girlfriend.

97
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:11,476
If the Siamraphe people can't protect her,

98
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:13,613
then I will protect her myself.

99
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,707
What is it, Pasin?

100
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:34,831
Seenam is dating Dernthap, Jaruek's son.

101
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:38,378
I think Jaruek planted her as a mole.
Go tell Yai.

102
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,276
I already told Yai.

103
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:42,400
So you and Yai knew all along?

104
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,369
Then why suspect me?

105
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:48,124
Yai and I have our reasons.

106
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:50,200
You don't need to worry about it, Pasin.

107
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,813
Isn't that a little too convenient, Rin?
My household's a mess,

108
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:56,000
my son won't even look at me,
and I can't attend board meetings.

109
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,418
I'm suddenly taking the blame
for something I didn't do?

110
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:01,538
Don't make a scene, Pasin.

111
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:04,204
Or are you using this to cut a rival?

112
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,191
Wow, you've really changed, Rin.

113
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,138
You're going too far, Pasin.

114
00:10:09,138 --> 00:10:11,827
Fine. Then pretend I said nothing today.

115
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:14,382
As for Jaruek, I'll handle him myself.

116
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:16,409
And what exactly are you going to do to him?

117
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:30,871
Yai, Pasin knows about Dernthap and Seenam.

118
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:33,871
I'm afraid he'll do something
that tips Seenam off.

119
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:49,942
Thap, didn't we agree
not to tell anyone about us?

120
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:53,578
That was before Yai and Rin found out.

121
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:55,369
They know now.

122
00:10:55,369 --> 00:10:57,049
No need to hide.

123
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:07,471
Then I'm going.

124
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,733
Nam, I did it to protect you.

125
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:23,280
I don't want anyone hurting you.

126
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,333
If you do that,

127
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:29,120
how will you protect me?

128
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:35,107
You don't know those people well enough.

129
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,884
I'm not afraid.

130
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:40,360
But I am.

131
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:46,231
You're Jaruek's son.
They won't dare touch you.

132
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:50,142
I'm just a mistress's child.

133
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:54,796
Nam, I am trying to protect you.

134
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:00,676
You can't do that forever.

135
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:05,391
Do you know what I've lost...

136
00:12:09,471 --> 00:12:11,849
since they found out about us?

137
00:12:13,342 --> 00:12:18,013
You know how hard I worked...

138
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,653
to get here.

139
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:24,280
And...

140
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:30,129
And now everything
is slipping out of my hands...

141
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:34,200
over this nonsense.

142
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,876
Thap.

143
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:49,831
Thap.

144
00:12:49,831 --> 00:12:54,107
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

145
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,236
I'm really sorry...

146
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,920
I didn't mean it.

147
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:07,787
Nam.

148
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:11,978
You're right, Nam.

149
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:18,138
Compared to your work,
our relationship really is trivial.

150
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:20,551
I'm sorry.

151
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:26,582
We hardly get to meet.

152
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:29,831
Let's not fight. Come on, let's eat.

153
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:35,231
Come on.

154
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:16,413
Miss you. Come back already.

155
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:17,760
When will we see you?

156
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,813
The medium said she's very far away.

157
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:22,573
Why is her boyfriend so quiet?
Weren't they so in love?

158
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:23,978
Did they break up?

159
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:25,658
Even if they did, he should still be worried.

160
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:30,480
Her boyfriend's the grandson of a mall owner,
of a minister. Yet he's doing nothing?

161
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:35,613
Dad.

162
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:38,227
What?

163
00:14:41,987 --> 00:14:44,604
How's the police probe about Nali?

164
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:46,884
Do they suspect us?

165
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:48,407
Not right now.

166
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:51,631
But if you keep acting paranoid, who knows.

167
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:03,489
Is something going on?

168
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:08,053
Found a new influencer to replace Nali yet?

169
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:10,244
Stay out of that.

170
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,929
I've lined up some influencers
for our son to choose from.

171
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:16,093
Have you chosen, Mut? I'll call them.

172
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:19,022
Don't, Mom. I'll find one myself.

173
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,693
Mut, where are you going?

174
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:33,676
Eat with us first.
I had the staff prepare dinner.

175
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:36,404
I'm eating out.

176
00:15:45,804 --> 00:15:49,529
Anda, have you eaten? Want to join us?

177
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,284

00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:57,462
How did you know I turned my phone back on?

181
00:16:57,462 --> 00:17:01,093
I didn't. I just kept calling.

182
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:06,062
How are you? Did he hurt you again?

183
00:17:06,062 --> 00:17:08,053
No one's doing anything to me.

184
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,040
No one even cares about me.

185
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:19,044
Do you know Anda
returned everything I ever gave him?

186
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:21,249
He must be really mad at me.

187
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,951
I'm sorry...
sorry for dragging you into this.

188

I truly didn't think
Rin would send that clip to Pasin.

189
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:34,658
The other day, I ran into Weerin.
She said she didn't do it.

190
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:38,778
She said someone wants our families
to fight each other.

191
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:40,324
Really?

192
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:42,782
But I don't know if she's telling the truth.

193
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:45,498
Maybe she wants trouble for my family

194
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,978
so her son can beat Mut.

195
00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:50,444
If that's true, that's scary.

196
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,196
It means the person
knows your family's business.

197
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:55,427
Are you being too trusting, Pipe?

198
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,742
Do you think she didn't do it?

199
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:12,320
Anyway...

200
00:18:13,098 --> 00:18:16,738

Don't worry about me.

202
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:25,689
Pasin just has people tailing me.

203
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:28,058
No one would dare touch me.

204
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,221

205
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:46,484

Hello, Lek?

209
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:10,871
Hello?

210
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,702
Yai was supposed to go to Phang Nga
for three days. It's now seven.

211
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:50,720
Because she wants to give us time
to find evidence against Nam, right?

212
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:59,084
Yes. Aunt Yai is afraid that Uncle Pasin
will tip Aunt Nam off and ruin things.

213
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:00,782
But I still don't really get it.

214
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:05,982
If Nam got the Kaew deal through Dernthap,
that benefits Siamraphe.

215
00:20:05,982 --> 00:20:08,467
How could she be Jaruek's mole?

216
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:10,680
Honestly, there are two ways to see it.

217
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:13,942
Aunt Nam is doing it for Siamraphe...

218
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,351
or for her own credit.

219
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,138
True.

220
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:24,160
Come to think of it, Nam's the type
who jumps in to fix everyone's problems.

221
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,084
It's a pity...

222
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:29,471
Someone as capable as Nam
should have gone farther.

223
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:33,231
I don't want to hound her either.

224
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:35,480

Do you know what Aunt Nam was doing
at the temple?

227
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,440
This temple is near her old home,

228
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,853
and her mother's ashes are kept there.

229
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:09,507
So she went to make merit for her mom?

230
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:11,298

00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,529
We're truly sorry.

355
00:35:01,529 --> 00:35:04,138
Handle the damages, too.

356
00:35:04,138 --> 00:35:05,169
Yes.

357
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,733
This way, please.

358
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,071
Ms. Rin, Mr. Jaruek's Heaven Complex project

359
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,493
has been suspended
until it passes inspection.

360
00:35:22,149 --> 00:35:24,098
Is this Pasin's doing?

361
00:35:31,302 --> 00:35:33,120
That's vile.

362
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,756
He's clearly picking a fight.

363
00:35:34,756 --> 00:35:37,693
When we asked how long
the inspection would take, they wouldn't say.

364
00:35:37,693 --> 00:35:40,596
My friend who works there said
someone filed a complaint.

365
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:44,876
Looks like someone with connections
pressed them to act fast.

366
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,707
So should we push back hard?

367
00:35:46,707 --> 00:35:49,840
Go public, say we're being targeted.

368
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,564
If we let it slide, we only lose.

369
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:54,329
Do it, bring in the press.

370
00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:56,800
Find out who's behind it!

371
00:35:58,178 --> 00:35:59,538
What?

372
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:16,120
Whoa, you're that stressed, huh?

373
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,404
Good!

374
00:36:17,404 --> 00:36:21,067
Now you know how it feels
when you stress other people out.

375
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:22,364
It was you, wasn't it?

376
00:36:22,364 --> 00:36:25,044
Am I that obvious?

377
00:36:25,044 --> 00:36:27,973
Don't think you're the only one
who can do this, you freaking jerk.

378
00:36:27,973 --> 00:36:30,996
- You only ever ride your dad's coattails.
- Yeah, my dad's powerful.

379
00:36:30,996 --> 00:36:33,213
And he loves me.

380
00:36:33,213 --> 00:36:37,204
Unlike you.
What kind of crappy father uses his own kid?

381
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:40,067
You even sent him to date Nam?

382
00:36:43,498 --> 00:36:47,276
Sorry, kid,
too late to change who your dad is.

383
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:52,311
Now quit messing with me, and with my family.

384
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:54,613
Or I won't stop here.

385
00:36:56,342 --> 00:36:58,209
You freaking jerk.

386
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,200
Is that why...

387
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,404
you've never brought your girlfriend
to meet me?

388
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,391
I want to.

389
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:23,111
But Nam asked me not to.

390
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:27,524
So how did you two even start dating?

391
00:37:27,524 --> 00:37:31,062
I first met Nam in Krabi,
right after I came back.

392
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:35,347
I didn't know who she was,
she didn't know me either.

393
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:40,787
Krabi.

394
00:37:44,018 --> 00:37:46,018
About two years.

395
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:51,142
Dad, Ms. Yai and Ms. Weerin already know.

396
00:37:51,911 --> 00:37:56,662
So they think Nam's with me
because she's your mole.

397
00:37:56,662 --> 00:37:59,769
She's been removed
from the executive board now.

398
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:05,058
Who's your insider?

399
00:38:06,342 --> 00:38:07,973
Tell them to stop.

400
00:38:11,573 --> 00:38:13,359
Can you stop playing dirty, Dad?

401
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,204
Keep to your lane,
so Nam won't get dragged into this.

402
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:26,796
Alright.

403
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:31,280
I'll do it, for your love.

404
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,142
Really, Dad?

405
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,942
Why not?

406
00:38:41,827 --> 00:38:44,407
You're my only child.

407
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:48,138
But don't tell Nam I know yet.

408
00:38:48,138 --> 00:38:51,898
Wait till she's ready to tell me herself,
so she won't feel pressured.

409
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:57,920
Okay. Thanks, Dad.

410
00:39:00,283 --> 00:39:04,669
And what about Heaven Complex?
What's your next move?

411
00:39:16,716 --> 00:39:21,169
Hey, calm down.
Maybe Nali's got some issue. She'll be back.

412
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:23,369
But she didn't fight with anyone, right?

413
00:39:27,676 --> 00:39:29,244
Miss.

414
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:31,644
Miss? Ow!

415
00:39:31,644 --> 00:39:33,982
- Hey, what's wrong?
- What is it?

416
00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:35,320
What happened?

417
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,924
- Call an ambulance, quick!
- Hey, hang in there!

418
00:39:42,924 --> 00:39:44,431
Call, hurry!

419
00:39:54,356 --> 00:39:56,080
How's Mut?

420
00:39:56,933 --> 00:40:00,124
The knife pierced his stomach.
There's internal bleeding.

421
00:40:00,124 --> 00:40:01,929
The doctors are trying to stop it.

422
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:04,160
If they can't, he could go into shock.

423
00:40:04,964 --> 00:40:07,529
Goddammit!

424
00:40:07,529 --> 00:40:10,253
If anything happens to our son,
it's because of you.

425
00:40:10,253 --> 00:40:14,378
You pissed Jaruek off,
so he took revenge on our kid.

426
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:17,956
I just went to teach him a lesson
so he'd stop messing with our family.

427
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:19,027
You're the one.

428
00:40:19,027 --> 00:40:21,204
When things are this bad,
you still let him go out partying.

429
00:40:21,204 --> 00:40:24,764
- Oh, so now you're blaming me?
- Yeah.

430
00:40:24,764 --> 00:40:26,671
You never do shit for our son.

431
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:29,342
You spend your days fooling around
with that tennis coach.

432
00:40:29,342 --> 00:40:31,876
And you? Flirting with girls all day...

433
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:33,960
You don't even spare the chef
who cooks at our house.

434
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,280
Better than you,
sleeping with our kid's coach.

435
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,059
Enough!

436
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:40,462
What the hell are you two fighting for?

437
00:40:40,462 --> 00:40:42,400
You're both awful.

438
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,252
[Weerin]

439
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,573
Hello.

440
00:41:17,573 --> 00:41:21,831
Mut was stabbed at a club.
He's at the hospital.

441
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:24,462
How is he?

442
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:25,893
Don't know yet.

443
00:41:25,893 --> 00:41:27,738
I'm on my way.

444
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:31,622
But I suspect Jaruek did it.

445
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,938
I figured.

446
00:41:34,938 --> 00:41:37,329
Pasin really screwed this up himself.

447
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:40,902
And have you found any more evidence?

448
00:41:40,902 --> 00:41:43,716
The principal still can't find
that year's yearbook.

449
00:41:43,716 --> 00:41:49,444
I checked the laptop and desktop
in Seenam's office, nothing yet.

450
00:41:49,444 --> 00:41:52,262
I think you should come back first.

451
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:54,996
If Seenam really is Jaruek's mole,

452
00:41:54,996 --> 00:41:58,849
it's too risky for you
to stay so close to her.

453
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:03,462
Why'd you do that, Thap?
Do you know how people will see me?

454
00:42:03,462 --> 00:42:05,493
Huh, Thap?

455
00:42:05,493 --> 00:42:07,120
I have to go.

456
00:42:09,564 --> 00:42:12,115
Why didn't you consult me first, Thap?

457
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:15,964
Don't make excuses for your father.

458
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,329
If it wasn't Mr. Jaruek, then who?

459
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:23,013
He was mad at Pasin,
so he took it out on Mut.

460
00:42:24,244 --> 00:42:28,400
Stop, Thap. If you don't believe me,
then don't talk to me.

461
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:42,440
Have you heard about Mut?

462
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:48,218
Fighting with your boyfriend?

463
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,702
Yes. I suspect Jaruek's people hurt Mut,

464
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:58,858
so I called Thap.

465
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:04,169
That's how I learned the Heaven
Complex shutdown was because of Pasin.

466
00:43:05,004 --> 00:43:07,489
But he doesn't believe his dad did it.

467
00:43:10,058 --> 00:43:13,187
Being in the middle is tough.

468
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,742
I stand with Siamraphe.

469
00:43:18,569 --> 00:43:21,107
And if Jaruek hurt Mut...

470
00:43:21,956 --> 00:43:24,280
I'll go after him to the end.

471
00:43:25,964 --> 00:43:28,098
I've never been in the middle.

472
00:43:32,689 --> 00:43:35,911
Shall we move our flight back to Bangkok
up to tomorrow?

473
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:39,511
I'll cancel the remaining appointments.

474
00:43:41,382 --> 00:43:46,778
No, we'll finish our work
and return as planned.

475
00:43:47,653 --> 00:43:48,911
Okay.

476
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:12,880
The car is ready.

477
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,364
I'll grab your after-meal meds.

478
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:46,187
Go wait in the car.
I'll use the restroom and follow.

479
00:45:46,951 --> 00:45:48,273
Okay.
