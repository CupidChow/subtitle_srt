1
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:05,307
Slowly, honey.

2
00:00:05,307 --> 00:00:07,644
You haven't eaten yet. You'll get drunk.

3
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:09,818
Let him drink, will you?

4
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:12,649
He hasn't had a proper meal
since he ran away.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,049
Mut.

6
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:18,573
Where have you been?

7
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:21,053
I thought the police caught you already.

8
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:31,200
Hello, Weerin?

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,591
I'm going to sleep now. We'll talk later.

10
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,427
I'll go open the door.

11
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,049
Weerin and Thaleh are at the gate.

12
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:44,818
Mut, go hide.

13
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:55,627
What's so urgent?

14
00:00:55,627 --> 00:00:57,684
Dernthap sent me a message.

15
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:02,622
He said Jaruek has a meeting
with Mr. Li on Wednesday afternoon.

16
00:01:02,622 --> 00:01:05,538
Li Wang, the owner of Real Estate.

17
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:09,004
That's not strange.
Jaruek could just be starting a new project.

18
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:13,378
Do you remember when we were
bidding on that land in Chiang Mai?

19
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:17,582
Back then, Mr. Li contacted us,
wanting to rig the auction,

20
00:01:17,582 --> 00:01:20,013
but Klang refused.

21
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,702
I'm beginning to suspect

22
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:27,120
Jaruek meeting with Mr. Li
might have something to do with Siamraphe.

23
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:30,031
Aunt Rin, you're right.

24
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:30,871
- Mut!
- Mut!

25
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:32,227
Mut!

26
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:33,942
Why did you come out?

27
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:38,964
I've been secretly following Aunt Nam
for a while.

28
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:43,471
Today, she had a meeting with Jaruek
about selling Siamraphe.

29
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:44,631
What?

30
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,773
Then that means Mr. Li might be Jaruek's
nominee buyer.

31
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,818
That bastard won't stop trying to destroy us.

32
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:04,129
Police officers. We are requesting permission
to conduct a search.

33
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:08,276
Come with me.

34
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:17,627
Are you insane, Seenam?

35
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:19,342
Why are you bringing the police
into my house?

36
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:21,524
To arrest a fugitive criminal.

37
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:24,324
Ms. Seenam reported
that Mr. Mahasamut Weerakitkamol,

38
00:02:24,324 --> 00:02:27,049
a wanted suspect, is hiding here.

39
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:28,996
My son ran away from home a week ago.

40
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:30,458
Why would he come back?

41
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,000
Maybe he needed advice.

42
00:02:33,956 --> 00:02:35,849
How do you know that?

43
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,400
Or are you trying to hide something from us?

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,898
I think we should just go inside and check.

45
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:45,916
They keep stalling with all these questions.
Maybe they're trying to delay?

46
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,649
Here's the search warrant.

47
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:56,698
Excuse us.

48
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:21,404
Who were you having dinner with just now?

49
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:23,920
I was eating with Lek and Thaleh.

50
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:29,600
Then who drank the wine?

51
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,858
Why? You gonna arrest me for that too?

52
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:39,756
Shame there's no breathalyzer,
otherwise we'd know who's lying.

53
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:43,049
Watch yourself, Seenam.

54
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:54,916
- Be careful, Mut.
- Yes, Dad.

55
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:05,862
We found nothing, ma'am.

56
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:08,138
- You searched everywhere?
- Yes.

57
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:10,836
Lek.

58
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:13,587
Why are there so many police here?

59
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,289
They're here to arrest Mahasamut.

60
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,120
Where have you been, Sin?

61
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,618
Your car's been parked there for ages.

62
00:04:19,618 --> 00:04:21,329
What's it to you?

63
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,849
You the census or something?
Do I have to report to you?

64
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,236
My son isn't here, officer.

65
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,484
If you're done, you can leave now.

66
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:33,800
Or should I call my father, huh?

67
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:36,302
This way, Ms. Nam.

68
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,329
It's because you keep defending your son

69
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:47,893
that all Siamraphe heirs end up criminals.

70
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:54,187
True. We're criminals.

71
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:55,191
But you, Aunt Nam...

72
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:58,840
You're an ungrateful murderer.

73
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:04,316
A bastard like you,
you're no better than a venomous snake.

74
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:08,547
Don't think we'll ever let you and that
sleazy Chinese bastard do whatever you want.

75
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:13,844
Siamraphe belongs only to
the Raphethada family, you filthy parasite.

76
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:16,533
So Mut was here.

77
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:21,973
Of course he was. This is his home.

78
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,716
Why shouldn't he come back?

79
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:28,196
You, on the other hand. What are you hiding?

80
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,142
Nothing.

81
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:37,360
Good.
Then everyone should prepare themselves.

82
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:49,262
Seenam knows now.

83
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:51,751
She knows that we know
she's selling Siamraphe.

84
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,249
Which means she'll try to sell it
even faster.

85
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:58,173
Then we need to act first,
stop her from selling Siamraphe.

86
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:02,569
But to sell it,
she still needs board approval.

87
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:06,213
If we can convince the board members
to change sides,

88
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:08,742
Seenam won't be able to sell it.

89
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:16,147
You both need to stop supporting her.

90
00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:18,276
Seenam is trying to sell Siamraphe.

91
00:06:18,276 --> 00:06:20,600
At the next board meeting,
you have to vote against her.

92
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,938
I'm really sorry, Lek.

93
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:25,636
I'm just following Father's orders.

94
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:30,160
Whatever Uncle Nit says,
that's what I have to say too.

95
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:34,809
Da.

96
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,258
Korn.

97
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,535
[Siamraphe]

98
00:06:52,218 --> 00:06:53,733
That's enough, Ms. Rin.

99
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,680
We've been standing outside
Mr. Nit's house for ages.

100
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,636
Called him dozens of times,
but he won't answer.

101
00:06:58,636 --> 00:07:02,747
But Lek said both Da and Korn
only listen to Uncle Nit.

102
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:06,191
If we can convince him
not to side with Seenam,

103
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:10,707
then at the next board meeting,
we can stop the sale of Siamraphe.

104
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:17,764
Uncle, please...

105
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:20,147
This is important.

106
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:22,760
It's about the survival of Siamraphe.

107
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,107
All Siamraphe shareholders are invited

108
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:37,587
to a meeting on the management
of the company's assets.

109
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:41,720
Seenam has called for a shareholders'
board meeting this Wednesday.

110
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,018
Uncle, you've seen the meeting agenda, right?

111
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:53,391
Seenam is planning to sell Siamraphe.

112
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:58,160
If we don't act now,
there will be nothing left of the company.

113
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,640
[Uncle Nit]

114
00:08:11,676 --> 00:08:16,120
Hello, Uncle.
Please, you can't let Seenam sell Siamraphe!

115
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,684
What? Seenam dares go this far?

116
00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:22,764
Yes. She's working with Jaruek.

117
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:26,427
You have to tell Da and Korn
not to vote for her.

118
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:29,262
I can't help you this time.

119
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:30,938
Uncle Nit!

120
00:08:30,938 --> 00:08:35,880
Please don't ask why, but I have no choice.

121
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:40,987
Uncle, we can't let Seenam sell Siamraphe!

122
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:50,231
Then have the lawyer
file for a temporary court injunction.

123
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:57,516
That'll suspend her CEO powers.

124
00:08:57,516 --> 00:09:01,978
Even if she gets board approval to sell,

125
00:09:01,978 --> 00:09:04,524
she won't be able
to finalize or transfer anything

126
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:08,280
until the investigation
of the power of attorney is complete.

127
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:15,151
Thank you so much.

128
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:17,480
I never told you about this, okay?

129
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:20,818
Of course.

130
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:23,920
I'll contact Lawyer Wit right now.

131
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,036
He said the injunction could be issued
by Wednesday noon at the earliest.

132
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:37,840
If the shareholders' meeting is at 10 a.m.,
it'll be too late.

133
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,556
Then can we make Seenam postpone it?

134
00:09:40,556 --> 00:09:41,924
I already tried.

135
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:45,991
I told her I had another meeting,
and that Mom couldn't attend either,

136
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:47,578
but she didn't care.

137
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:50,440
She insisted the meeting stays on schedule.

138
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,182
Then let her go ahead and vote first.

139
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:54,676
Once we get the court order,
we can still block it, right?

140
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:56,551
It's too risky, Lek.

141
00:09:56,551 --> 00:10:00,053
If she gets the shareholders' approval,

142
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:03,302
and something goes wrong with our injunction,

143
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,680
Seenam could sell Siamraphe immediately.

144
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,400
So we have to make sure
she's forced to delay the meeting.

145
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:13,436
I think I've got a way.

146
00:10:26,338 --> 00:10:29,529
Good afternoon.
I'm Police Captain Thanon Rojanapurin

147
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,138
from the Crime Suppression Division.

148
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:32,978
We'd like to ask some further questions

149
00:10:32,978 --> 00:10:36,187
regarding the supposed suicide
of Mr. Seksan Jamjerd.

150
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:39,267
We have evidence suggesting your involvement.

151
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:42,258
Please come with us to give your statement.

152
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:43,996
- This way, please.
- Go.

153
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:45,244
Hey, stop!

154
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:48,213
I said stop!

155
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:50,502
Stop!

156
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:52,836
Stop!

157
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:56,018
Stop right there!

158
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:59,147
- Hold him!
- Let go!

159
00:10:59,853 --> 00:11:01,040
Let me go!

160
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,333
Let me go!

161
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:09,947
Is this you in the photo?

162
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:13,796
And what was in the bag
you gave to the victim?

163
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:16,698
Money, right?

164
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:25,320
Captain, this is Attorney Chatchai.

165
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,716
Let me speak with my client first.

166
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:39,124
He's still refusing to talk, isn't he?

167
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,253
I just saw the lawyer go in.

168
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:44,000
Are we really letting him go?

169
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,640
We can hold him for 48 hours.

170
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,747
We have to make him confess.

171
00:11:49,747 --> 00:11:51,818
If he doesn't,

172
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:54,142
we'll have no proof to bring Jaruek down.

173
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:00,164
Where are you going?

174
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:03,396
To pee.

175
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:05,333
Or would you like me to do it here?

176
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:08,902
I'm sorry about your father and brother.

177
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:12,636
So it was you.
You're the one who killed them, right?

178
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:15,360
Why did you do it?

179
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,591
- What did they ever do to you?
- Thaleh!

180
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:20,840
You just wait.

181
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:24,249
I'll put you all in jail.

182
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:25,511
You'll pay for this.

183
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,302
Thaleh!

184
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:29,916
- Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:41,160
From our evaluation,

186
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,836
your son has Depression with Psychosis.

187
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:49,218
This likely developed after he killed Keeta,

188
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:54,582
causing severe depression,
auditory hallucinations, and delusions.

189
00:12:54,582 --> 00:12:58,271
Will he recover?

190
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:00,858
There's a chance, but it will take time.

191
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:04,667
How long will it take
before he stops being crazy?

192
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:07,142
Wait, he's not crazy.

193
00:13:07,142 --> 00:13:09,391
Not crazy? He shot me!

194
00:13:09,391 --> 00:13:11,907
- You don't need to call him...
- Please stop, both of you.

195
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:16,813
If you want your son to recover quickly,

196
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:19,644
you both need to start with yourselves first.

197
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:23,053
I understand that the two of you
are in conflict right now,

198
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,684
but for your son's recovery,
he needs his parents' love.

199
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:29,471
When he's home, he has to feel safe.

200
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,324
That's the most important thing.

201
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:35,058
If he feels unsafe or stressed,

202
00:13:35,058 --> 00:13:37,400
his recovery will take much longer.

203
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,853
So what should my husband and I do?

204
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:45,413
I'm not saying you have to
forgive each other right away,

205
00:13:45,413 --> 00:13:49,169
but you shouldn't argue
in front of your child.

206
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:52,596
You should encourage him, show him love.

207
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:56,689
Parental love doesn't mean
you two have to love each other,

208
00:13:56,689 --> 00:14:00,618
but it means you must
love your child together.

209
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:03,822
Don't let him feel like
he has to fight his pain alone.

210
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:06,111
Don't let him feel isolated.

211
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:09,187
A parent's love is crucial.

212
00:14:09,187 --> 00:14:14,747
And whether Anda recovers quickly or slowly
depends on that love too.

213
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:25,702
Tawan, are you cheating?

214
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:28,596
How did I only get green cards?

215
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:30,716
I'm not cheating. You saw it yourself.

216
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:32,396
No way, deal again. I'm done.

217
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:33,458
- No, we're playing this round.
- Deal again!

218
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,640
- Hey, no!
- Enough!

219
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:46,271
Anda, how are you, son?

220
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,444
Dad came to visit you today.

221
00:14:52,644 --> 00:14:54,258

222
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:01,893

Are you okay, son?

235
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:01,084
I'm not angry.

236
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,640
Ow... Dad, that hurts!

00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:50,307
I said we'd talk later.

243
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,147
put me on speaker so I can talk to Anda.

244

He's still scared.

245
00:16:55,996 --> 00:16:58,333
I won't yell at him, I promise.

246
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,267
Let me talk to him.

247
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:06,413
Okay, you're on.

248
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:08,760
Anda.

249
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:14,462
I'm sorry, son.

250
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:19,480
I've done a lot of wrong things to you.

251
00:17:20,671 --> 00:17:24,160
But I promise.
I'll try not to let it happen again.

252
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,520
I want you to come back to being yourself.

253
00:17:32,547 --> 00:17:36,262
Please get better soon, Anda.

254
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:22,196
Why did you decide to turn yourself in today?

255
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:24,742
Were you pressured, Mr. Pasin?

256
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:27,538
Please, just answer a bit.
Why turn yourself in now?

257
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:30,524
Are you afraid of Siamraphe's reputation
being ruined? Mr. Mahasamut, any comment?

258
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:32,124
Hey!

259
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:35,369
Please listen to the facts before you judge.

260
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:39,040
Sometimes,
the victim might actually be my son.

261
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,782
- This way, please.
- This way.

262
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:47,329
Please step outside.

00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:16,680
What's going on?

264
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:20,333
This morning,
Mr. Mut and Mr. Pasin turned themselves in.

265
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,996
So the police came to search for evidence.

266
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,578
They're not done yet.

267
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:33,853
I think we'll have to postpone
the shareholders' meeting.

268
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:39,262
The police also need to
check my PR department.

269
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:42,360
Please be patient, CEO.

270
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,049
Trying to stall, are you?

271
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,067
We're just cooperating
with the investigation.

272
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:48,524
I just called to check.

273
00:19:48,524 --> 00:19:50,556
This morning, Grandpa Nit had chest pains.

274
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,578
Aunt Da rushed him to the hospital.

275
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:55,022
So I postponed the meeting to 1 p.m.

276
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:03,609
Is that all the Siamraphe heirs can do?

277
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:09,400
Whether it's at 10 or 1,
Siamraphe will still be sold.

278

Not yet.

But I think she's on her way.

She's still not here?

294
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:33,022
She went to meet a client.

as you all know, Siamraphe has been
surrounded by chaos lately.

Ms. Yai is still lying unconscious
in the hospital,

305
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:15,911
and our heirs are facing criminal charges
that have damaged the company's reputation.

306
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:20,280
And as you can see, the retail market today
has changed drastically.

307
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,231
Shopping malls may no longer
meet consumer needs.

308
00:22:24,231 --> 00:22:26,951
If we keep clinging to the old ways,

309
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:29,862
our competitors will overtake us.

00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:40,044
Thaleh's not my boyfriend.

354
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:42,187
I didn't even say his name.

355
00:26:42,187 --> 00:26:45,084
- Oh? You sound guilty. Busted!
- Yeah...

356
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:47,222
Go, get back to work.

357
00:26:47,222 --> 00:26:49,516
- You're blushing!
- You've got deadlines, don't you?

358
00:26:49,516 --> 00:26:51,004
Still blushing!

359
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,609
Feels like a drama series plot.
Poor heir, got slandered for nothing.

360
00:26:57,609 --> 00:26:59,767
Turns out the influencer wasn't assaulted.

361
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:02,720
She took money from a rival mall
to frame him.

362
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,947
Now people are digging
into Jaruek's background.

363
00:27:04,947 --> 00:27:07,724
And the tide's turning in Mut's favor.

364
00:27:13,378 --> 00:27:18,000
#NaliXHeavenMall is trending number one now.
Are you okay?

365
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,120
A bit busy, but fine.

366
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,156
I'll hire some media pages to push the story.

367
00:27:29,156 --> 00:27:32,502
Make sure their mall gets torn apart
worse than we ever did.

368
00:27:32,502 --> 00:27:34,671
- Lek.
- Don't stop me.

369
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:36,864
As head of PR,
you can't let our name be trashed.

370
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,480
Hit them hard.

371
00:27:46,093 --> 00:27:47,898
This morning, it was trending only on X,

372
00:27:47,898 --> 00:27:50,649
but now multiple pages are picking it up.

373
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:52,116
Nali's getting dragged.

374
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:54,676
People are saying she's fake, manipulative,

375
00:27:54,676 --> 00:27:57,760
and the public's starting to believe
Mut was the victim.

376
00:27:59,684 --> 00:28:01,920
It must be Lek's doing.

378
00:28:15,044 --> 00:28:17,502
I saw the news.

379
00:28:17,502 --> 00:28:21,089
That father-son duo clearly
want social media to destroy your mall.

380
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:23,560
I don't care about baseless gossip.

381
00:28:24,164 --> 00:28:26,929
But they're digging into Nali's history.

382
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:29,947
And soon they'll dig into yours.

383
00:28:29,947 --> 00:28:32,533
I've read the data. These kinds of scandals
only last about 11 days.

384
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:34,938
Then new ones replace them. Forget it.

385
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:37,916
What about the shareholders' vote?

386
00:28:39,627 --> 00:28:41,103
It passed.

387
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:44,271
But Weerin got a court injunction,

388
00:28:44,271 --> 00:28:46,040
so I can't move forward.

389
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,724
I'll handle the court issue myself.

390
00:28:48,724 --> 00:28:52,462
But the reason I called is, we need to meet.

391

There's something important
I need to discuss.

392
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,324
With the news this intense,

393
00:29:12,324 --> 00:29:14,956
Seenam and Jaruek won't stay quiet.

394
00:29:14,956 --> 00:29:17,120
I checked with the lawyer.

395
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,249
If Jaruek wants to file
to lift the injunction,

396
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:23,369
it'll take at least a week.

397
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:25,702
Then that means

398
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:29,284
we have to gather solid evidence
against Seenam and Jaruek before then.

399
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:32,027
Otherwise, they'll sell Siamraphe for sure.

400
00:29:34,058 --> 00:29:38,609
Today marks 48 hours
since Uncle Non detained one of Jaruek's men.

401
00:29:39,351 --> 00:29:43,844
If he still doesn't confess,
we'll have to release him.

402
00:29:56,978 --> 00:29:59,120
Please wake up soon,

403
00:29:59,724 --> 00:30:03,716
so you can expose Seenam
for what she did to you.

404

Don't worry, Auntie.

just like you told me, Aunt Yai.

who destroyed our family.

to bargain with me and Dernthap, right?

It was really an accident.

You know I planned to sell Siamraphe
to start a new life abroad.

you really love my son?
