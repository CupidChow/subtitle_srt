1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,493
I brought you some food.

2
00:00:05,493 --> 00:00:08,853
There you go.
She really made beef panang curry.

3
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:13,427
I heard you two saying you wanted it,
so I cooked some.

4
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:16,724
And it's also to cheer up the patient.

5
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:18,560
Oh, I'm all better now.

6
00:00:20,022 --> 00:00:22,671
Why go to all this trouble, dear?

7
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:26,240
But it's worth it.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,360
I think Ms. Yai probably believes me now.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,796
Good thing you called Nas
to say Thaleh came here.

10
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:37,329
That's how I realized
Ms. Yai and Ms. Rin still suspect me.

11
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:41,782
But this is getting out of hand, Nam.

12
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:44,480
Nas, when will it finally be done?

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,342
It will, teacher.

14
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:49,547
Nam and I are eliminating Siamraphe's heirs.

15
00:00:49,547 --> 00:00:52,671
If Ms. Yai has no grandchild left to lead,

16
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:55,227
she'll have to rely on Nam.

17
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:57,387
And I've checked feng shui for her.

18
00:00:57,387 --> 00:00:59,764
Nam will definitely become CEO.

19
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:05,289
Just don't take any bigger risks than this.

20
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:09,280
Your mother entrusted you with me
when she died.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,329
If anything happens to you two,
she'd come back and wring my neck.

22
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:16,111
- Do you understand?
- Yes, teacher.

23
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:19,364
Alright, go on. Eat.
I'll step outside for a bit.

24
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:22,258
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah. Get some rest.

25
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:30,293
When will you stop being Jaruek's informant?

26
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:33,764
I don't like you getting mixed up
with his son.

27
00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:35,276
And you, Nas.

28
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:38,778
You've got two, and I never complain.

29
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:40,600
For whom do you think I'm doing this?

30
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,242
Nas.

31
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:50,360
Believe me,
you're the most important person in my life.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,520
For us to get here,
we've been through so much.

33
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:17,409
Wait here a moment.

34
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:51,587
I didn't do anything wrong,
why did they do that to me?

35
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,222
Damn it!

36
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:58,236
Nas. Nas, come back, calm down!

37
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:05,369
Are you okay? It's alright, okay?

38
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:11,960
Sorry, boss. I apologize for the kid.

39
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:19,578
This is my adopted son. His name is Keeta.

40
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,804
Mut. Thaleh.

41
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:40,351
Come up with a project to revamp Siamraphe.

42
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:45,720
This will be one way to show your vision.
To see who's fit to be the next CEO.

43
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:50,076
I've worked so long and helped so much,

44
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:53,333
and now, with the younger ones gone,
instead of picking me,

45
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,400
they're propping up that ex-con
and that greenhorn.

46
00:03:57,116 --> 00:03:58,711
Nam, Nam.

47
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:01,418
Don't worry, Nam.

48
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:05,720
The leadership of Siamraphe must be yours.

49
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,440
I'll help you.

50
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:11,844
Once I become the leader of Siamraphe...

51
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:17,044
I'll ruin all of them.

52
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:20,040
Go get a mystic golden-face charm done.

53
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,631
Aunt Nam's into spiritual charms?

54
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,627
With this kind of thing,
you won't know unless you try.

55
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:27,044
Mut invited me to Colin's party,

56
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:29,480
but I don't want trouble with Mom and Thaleh.

57
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,440
Shall we let the cards say
whether you should go?

58
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,271
The Devil card.

59
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:36,876
The cards say someone will deceive you.

60
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:40,240
You may be lured into a bad situation.

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,360
Make everyone believe we dislike this girl,

62
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,920
to the point we drug her at the party.

63
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:14,280
Mind if I join?

64
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,173
Hey, hey.

65
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:18,840
Dao.

66
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,187
- What are you doing?
- Dao.

67
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,151
We're not even close.

68
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:27,467
But I want to be close to you.

69
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:30,271
Is this okay, Kee?

70
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:33,373
It's direct sales,
not a pyramid scheme, right?

71
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:36,089
I get that you're afraid of being scammed.

72
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:40,631
But if you're unsure,
you can check my company's name.

73
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,218
You brought the documents, right?

74
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:46,356
Yes, but what exactly will you do with them?

75
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:49,138
Done. Got the whole household's.

76
00:05:49,138 --> 00:05:50,876
Wow. Are you good, or just that charming?

77
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:52,898
With this much investment,

78
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:56,698
make sure you nail both the older
and the younger one. Get it done.

79
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:59,898
It'll work.

80
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:04,840
If the Siamraphe heirs and their household
end up tied to online gambling,

81
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,862
mule accounts, or call-center scams,

82
00:06:08,862 --> 00:06:11,641
who's going to let them become CEO?

83
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:14,413
Good. Okay. Bye.

84
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,396
I've got a gift for you too.

85
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:22,760
What?

86
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:41,342
Nice.

87
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:45,787
If her mother and siblings see this,

88
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,213
they'll be shocked.

89
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:49,407
As for the other one,

90
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:52,680
his mom's going to take him
to a psychiatrist.

91
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,133
He refused to go home
and ran away to stay with me,

92
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:57,231
and he already told me he loves me.

93
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,742
Nas.

94
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:06,631
Just a little more.

95
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:09,062
Just a little more, Nas,

96
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,409
and we'll destroy them.

97
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,356
Hello, auntie.

98
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,822
- Hello, hello.
- Hello.

99
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:25,756
I brought my guys to celebrate a birthday.

100
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:27,849
Oh, that's lovely.

101
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:29,302
May we push some tables together?

102
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:31,844
Sure. Go ahead, go on.

103
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:33,093
Let's take these two tables.

104
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:34,307
Here, let me help.

105
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:36,409
Turn it. Line it up like this.

106
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:39,680
Yeah. Over here, I'll help.

107
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,720
Okay. It's heavy. Lower it a bit?

108
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,240
Down. Down a bit more.

109
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,716
Back it up, back it up.

110
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,871
Is that good?

111
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:49,293
Good thing we had the teacher
install an emergency bell.

112
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:51,120
Turn it. Line it up like this.

113
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,942
Yeah. Over here, I'll help.

114
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:58,204
It's heavy. Lower it a bit?

115
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,591
Down. Down a bit more.

116
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:00,973
Back it up, back it up.

117
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,440
Is that good?

118
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,987
Kids, I'll get the menus.

119
00:09:36,698 --> 00:09:38,582
Order whatever you like.

120
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:41,604
- It's on me.
- Yay!

121
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:57,827
Let's go.

122
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:11,457
If those two followed me all the way here,

123
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:13,311
that means...

124
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:15,578
Yai lied about trusting me?

125
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:18,204
How did they know I'm here?

126
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:20,631
They must have had me tailed.

127
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:25,609
But don't worry.
I'll keep them too busy to mess with us.

128
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:28,649
Nas.

129
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:33,213
This time, you'll have to take a hit.

130
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:35,293
But trust me. It'll be worth it.

131
00:10:36,324 --> 00:10:41,747
Because we're going to trade it for
getting Thaleh sent back to prison again.

132
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:47,151
And Mahasamut?

133
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:56,787
If Seenam really came to this room,

134
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:58,658
someone must be with her,

135
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,644
because I saw two plates in there.

136
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,960
[Jom]

137
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,996
Yes, Jom?

138
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,369
Got it. Send it over.

139
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:40,578
Manas is Master Kee.

140
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:42,604
I think it's strange.

141
00:11:42,604 --> 00:11:45,964
Master Kee is the kid
the feng-shui master adopted,

142
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:48,627
so he can come and go
at the Raphethada house.

143
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:52,169
Up until now,
whenever Master Kee is with Ms. Nam,

144
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,920
she never showed any sign
of having known him before.

145
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:59,467
Did Aunt Nam come before or after the
fortune-teller took Master Kee in to raise?

146
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:03,524
Nam arrived a year earlier.

147
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:08,524
That's right. Ms. Nam came the year
I moved to work with Mr. Klang.

148
00:12:08,524 --> 00:12:11,258
The following year, the fortune-teller
took Master Kee in to raise him.

149
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:14,320
At that guesthouse,

150
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,920
there's a photo of Master Kee
with the guesthouse owner.

151
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,809
They look really close.

152
00:12:21,196 --> 00:12:24,338
Could the person who was in the room
with Aunt Nam that day be Master Kee?

153
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:29,440
So these two worked together
to destroy Siamraphe?

154
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:32,564
Should we call the police to arrest them now?

155
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,667
If we don't have evidence,
they won't admit it.

156
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:41,707
I'll get a detective to find proof
to pin these two down.

157
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:44,711
But for now, we have to stay put.

158
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:47,062
Because when we went
to that guesthouse today,

159
00:12:47,062 --> 00:12:49,356
I think they already realized
we were onto them.

160
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:59,529
Pat, I have urgent work for you.

161
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,440
I need it done within this week.

162
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,253
Walk slowly.

163
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:15,031
It's been a week already, damn.

164
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:17,053
You still haven't found her?

165
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:18,280
Dad.

166
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,244
Find her.

167
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,200
Are you looking for Nali?

168
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:27,489
How do you know?

169
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:29,351
What did you do to her?

170
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:34,840
Yeah?

171
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,917
After the disappearance of Nali,

172
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:46,564
a famous actress and influencer,
for nearly two months,

173
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:48,436
there's finally good news, everyone.

174
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:50,942
The police have found her.

175
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:53,538
She was discovered near the Thai border,

176
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:55,253
around Sa Kaeo province.

177
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:58,884
Shockingly, her condition was extremely weak.

178
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:00,538
Her head had been shaved,

179
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:02,658
and there were clear signs of abuse.

180
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:05,930
It's believed she was abducted by scammers

181
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,902
and forced to work
as part of a call-center gang.

182
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:10,764
- Pasin, did you...
- Stay out of it.

183
00:14:10,764 --> 00:14:13,018
I'll handle this myself.

184
00:14:21,582 --> 00:14:23,653
- Here they come!
- Go, go. Quick!

185
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:25,484
Why are you only coming out now?

186
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:26,756
How do you feel about it?

187
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:27,782
- How do you feel?
- Are you happy?

188
00:14:27,782 --> 00:14:29,687
What made you come out now?

189
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:32,240
What made you decide to come out now?

190
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,686
- Why come out now?
- Sorry, I have to rush to see my girlfriend.

191
00:14:35,686 --> 00:14:37,627
Do you know who's behind this?

192
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,520
Who. Who's behind all this?

193
00:14:40,307 --> 00:14:43,116
Why did you come out now? Who told you to...

194
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:47,840
Hey, your mic just hit my head.
Watch it, please.

195
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,698
I just got stabbed, you know.

196

Please answer us.

197
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:54,173
Mr. Mahasamut.

198
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm glad to see you safe.

199
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,858
Glad?

200
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:20,280
I thought you'd be more shocked.

201
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:29,418
Don't worry, I'm not recording you.

202
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:31,676
Because I've got something to say too.

203
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:33,822
So I'll be blunt.

204
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:49,298
Let's call it even and move on.

205
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,080
Only a hundred baht?

206
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:06,929
Is that what my life's worth to you?

207
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:08,680
Just that?

208
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,120
Sorry.

209
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,293
I don't accept apology baskets
worth less than ten million.

210
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:15,447
Isn't that too much?

211
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:18,033
Shouldn't I be the one saying that?

212
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:21,513
Three days.

213
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:26,067
Otherwise, you and Siamraphe
will be the talk of the town.

214
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:28,147
You love attention anyway.

215
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:40,913
Now, take a deep breath and step in.

216

Slowly.

217
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:52,120
Breathe like when you meditate.

218
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,200
Immerse your whole body.

219
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:08,267
- It's cold, monk.
- Don't move.

220
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:10,887
If you move, it'll hurt more.

221
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:34,480
Sitting in ice water means
you willingly facing the cold.

222
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,387
It's no different
from facing a bully you can't avoid.

223
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:40,871
Don't react too fast.

224
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:42,627
You'll lose.

225
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:44,182
Stay calm.

226
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:47,742
Use your mind. Don't play their game.

227

After giving the statement at the station,
where did you go?

239
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:56,498
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

240
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:58,013
Tell me first. Where did you go?

241
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,067
- I went to see a friend.
- Who?

242
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:02,093
Why do you want to know?

243
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:03,493
He hurt you, didn't he?

244
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:05,044
Tell me who it was.

247
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,302
Why didn't you tell me he did that to you?

248
00:19:12,302 --> 00:19:14,951
Were you with him? Or did he call you?

249
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:18,116
He didn't call. He sent a video.

What clip?
I don't know what you're talking about.

then he drugged me, raped me,
and recorded it.

opened his condo for us to visit, you know.

I'm so excited to finally meet him.

You killed him, didn't you?

317
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:03,418
- Call the police.
- No.

318
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,036
- I didn't kill him.
- Master.

319
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:08,982
Why is this happening?

Where's Thaleh?

323
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:31,098
Thaleh went to Master Kee's condo.

00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:33,387
- Why?
- He went to look for you.

325
00:25:34,587 --> 00:25:37,978
Calm down, Dao. Master Kee is dead.

326
00:25:37,978 --> 00:25:40,542
Thaleh is being accused of killing him,

327
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:43,018
because someone saw him with the body.

328
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:45,289
Mom is taking Uncle Wit to sort it out now.

329
00:25:57,676 --> 00:25:59,996
I think Master Kee intended for me to go there.

330
00:25:59,996 --> 00:26:02,409
Why would you think that?

331
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:04,436
You said so yourself.

332
00:26:04,436 --> 00:26:07,373
He never allowed students to visit his condo,

333
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:09,462
but this time he let them go.

334
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:13,422
And before the incident,
he purposely provoked me

335
00:26:13,422 --> 00:26:14,787
until I went to see him.

336
00:26:14,787 --> 00:26:16,622
What did the deceased do?

337
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:27,338
Tell the director, it affects the case file.

338
00:26:32,327 --> 00:26:33,964
He sent me a clip.

339
00:26:33,964 --> 00:26:38,022
Why do you think the deceased was confident
that the clip would make you mad enough

340
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:39,298
to go after him?

341
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,000
Excuse me.

342
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,720
You called me and asked for Master Kee's address,

343
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,200
with that angry voice.

344
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,747
Is this it?

345
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,480
What clip, Thaleh?

346
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:30,573
No. It's not. What clip? This can't be real.

347
00:27:30,573 --> 00:27:31,213

348
00:27:31,213 --> 00:27:34,893
- Thaleh, this is. This isn't it, right?
- Mom.

349
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:41,729
How could this happen, Thaleh?
This can't be true.

Didn't the fortune-teller ever read his own fate?

352
00:27:58,351 --> 00:28:00,493
What a shame. He was spot on.

353
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:05,973

and wait for the police investigation first.

356
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,622
It's my fault.

357
00:28:53,813 --> 00:28:57,138
If I'd spent more time with you,

358
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:58,942
you wouldn't have to suffer this.

359
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,053
Dao.

360
00:29:08,676 --> 00:29:10,467
Don't be afraid, Dao.

361
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:14,853
I won't leave you to face this alone anymore.

362
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:18,769
We'll get through it together.

363
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:38,840
Back then,
I truly believed he was a good person.

364
00:29:39,716 --> 00:29:42,324
He helped me make the shop a success.

365
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:45,942
When the police came to arrest us,
I got angry.

366
00:29:46,676 --> 00:29:50,351
So I barged into his condo to confront him.

367
00:29:54,373 --> 00:29:56,591
He drugged me.

368
00:29:59,738 --> 00:30:04,156
When Thaleh called and said he'd sent a clip,

369
00:30:04,156 --> 00:30:09,649
I rushed to him
because I was afraid he'd send it to others.

370
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:13,089
He denied it.

371
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,551
It's okay.

372
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,604
If you can't tell it now,

373
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:35,360
you don't have to.

374
00:30:39,591 --> 00:30:40,760
Dao.

375
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,267
But...

376
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:52,240
You need to tell me first.

377
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:59,560
Did you kill Master Kee?

Pick up the phone, Nas.

Nas, pick up the call.

384
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:01,822
Nas, pick up the call. Don't do this to me.

385

Nam, it's me.

386
00:33:22,351 --> 00:33:24,120
Yes?

387
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:27,200
Have you seen the news about Master Kee?

388
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,982
So sad. I was shocked when I first saw it.

389
00:33:34,982 --> 00:33:38,831
But Weerin says
Thaleh was only found with the body.

390
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:43,213
I don't know who got into a fight with him
to cause that.

391
00:33:43,213 --> 00:33:46,342
Anything you need me to do?

392
00:33:46,342 --> 00:33:48,622
Please order the wreaths for tomorrow.

393
00:33:48,622 --> 00:33:50,916
And check on the sinsei's relatives.

394
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:53,942
Find a date when we can host the ceremony.

395
00:33:53,942 --> 00:33:55,760
Will do.

396
00:33:58,227 --> 00:34:00,142
Are you crying?

397
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:07,960
He was a good man. Everyone loved him.

398
00:34:09,044 --> 00:34:14,671
I was going to invite him
to do a reading for you and Jaruek's child.

399
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:18,360
Looks like we need a new fortune-teller.

400
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:21,253
Thank you.

401
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,569
Please handle it.

402
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:26,151
Will do.

403
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:00,116
Have you slept at all, Mom?

404
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:03,658
I can't sleep.

405
00:36:05,698 --> 00:36:08,347
I've been in this room since last night.

406
00:36:11,827 --> 00:36:13,427
Thaleh, do you think...

407
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:17,124
will Dad and Chon be angry with me...

408
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,533
that I couldn't protect you all?

409
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,902
If they're going to be angry...

410
00:36:27,316 --> 00:36:29,093
they should be angry at me.

411
00:36:32,196 --> 00:36:35,868
I'm the one who have is supposed
to take care of you and the siblings

412
00:36:35,868 --> 00:36:37,662
instead of Dad and Chon.

413
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,916
Can you manage, Mom?

414
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:57,560
Take a day off work.

415
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,533
I can't, Thaleh.

416
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,804
Last night...

417
00:37:05,645 --> 00:37:08,805
Dao told me everything that happened.

418
00:37:11,222 --> 00:37:13,196
Before...

419
00:37:14,182 --> 00:37:16,533
I couldn't protect her.

420
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:21,720
But today, I will.

421
00:37:22,422 --> 00:37:26,920
So regarding her,
if you need anything, tell me.

422
00:37:29,351 --> 00:37:33,236
As for Jaruek and Aunt Nam,
I'll handle it myself.

423
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:37,671
Thanks, Thaleh.

424
00:37:40,276 --> 00:37:43,369
Thank you for deciding
to come back to live with me.

425
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:50,418

426
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:52,831

427

Don't worry.

428
00:38:23,102 --> 00:38:27,187
Hey, Rin. You came to see me.
Need help with Thaleh?

429
00:38:27,187 --> 00:38:29,280
It'll be tough.

430
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,167
Killing someone, that's a second-degree case.

431
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,058
It's hard to fix.

432
00:38:33,058 --> 00:38:35,360
I'm not here about my son.

433
00:38:36,076 --> 00:38:38,489
I'm here about your children.

434
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:40,489
What are you bargaining
with my child for now?

435
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:42,160
I'm not bargaining.

436
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,069
I feel that as parents,

437
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:49,000
we should work together
to solve our kids' problems.

438
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,827
When Master Kee was murdered,
it wasn't Thaleh.

439
00:38:56,827 --> 00:38:59,098
It was Mukdao and Andaman.

440
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:06,120
By the time Thaleh arrived,
Master Kee was already a corpse.

441
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,804
Are you joking, Rin?

442
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:10,293
What does Anda
have to do with that fortune-teller?

443
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:11,760
Right, Lek?

444
00:39:16,111 --> 00:39:18,680
Anda went to Master Kee's condo.
What did he do there?

445
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,200
Huh, Lek?

446
00:39:21,373 --> 00:39:25,507
That day I argued with him, and he ran away.

447
00:39:25,507 --> 00:39:28,427
I just thought he went to a friend's house.

448
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,564
So he just hid there for a bit, that's all.

449
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:36,293
No motive to kill that fortune-teller.

450
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,591
But I think...

451
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:44,227
Anda was angry with Kee over Mukdao.

452
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,671
Anda and Kee...

453
00:39:50,978 --> 00:39:53,107
weren't just friends.

454
00:39:56,622 --> 00:39:59,387
- Lek. What's going on?
- Sin.

455
00:39:59,387 --> 00:40:01,293
You must help your child.

00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:03,333

Handle all evidence for my kid.

460
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,258
Anda must not be involved in this.
