1
00:00:00,393 --> 00:00:01,951
Is this true, Mr. Jaruek?

2
00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:03,458
Why did you do this, Ms. Seenam?

3
00:00:03,458 --> 00:00:06,413
- Have you been doing this for a long time?
- Is it true? Please answer.

4
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:08,100
Where are you rushing off to?

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,680
The event isn't over yet.

6
00:00:15,898 --> 00:00:18,013
Since when did you wake up?

7
00:00:20,049 --> 00:00:21,684
Surprised, aren't you?

8
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:50,058
Found it.

9
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,249
The evidence is this clear.

10
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:32,387
Hurry and hand it to the police.

11
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:34,236
I already called Non just now.

12
00:01:34,236 --> 00:01:36,924
He said we must verify the evidence we found

13
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:38,876
before we can arrest Seenam
and Mr. Jaruek.

14
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:41,564
If the evidence is this clear,
what else needs checking?

15
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,871
If it were me,
I'd say this kind of evidence is fake.

16
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:49,200
Grease a few palms and the case disappears.

17
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,431
You must have done that all the time.

18
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:53,313
Lek!

19
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,164
Please don't argue yet.

20
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:57,871
We need to stay calm.

21
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:02,027
If we make a mistake now,
we might lose Siamraphe.

22
00:02:02,947 --> 00:02:05,680
I think we should wait until Aunt Yai
is a bit stronger,

23
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:09,058
so she can confirm Seenam
pushed her down the stairs

24
00:02:09,058 --> 00:02:11,187
and that the power-of-attorney documents
were forged.

25
00:02:11,187 --> 00:02:12,791
Yes.

26
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:18,920
And we must be very careful
not to let them know that Yai has woken up.

27
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,667
From earlier when we met,

28
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:24,680
I think Aunt Nam is already suspicious.

29
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:29,271
So we need to make them see that
I'm still in a coma.

30
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:33,369
Do you have a plan?

31
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:39,036
How is Aunt Yai doing, doctor?

32
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:43,476
Her lung cancer has weakened
her immune system.

33
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:46,502
She's been bedridden for a long time,

34
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:53,413
which raises the risk of a lung infection
and sudden heart failure.

35
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,964
Please prepare yourselves, relatives.

36
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:02,813
Yai.

37
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:10,724
I would like to
ask everyone to keep this quiet for now,

38
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:14,022
because Siamraphe's situation is fragile.

39
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:17,680
If word gets out, it will only get worse.

40
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:21,507
Yes.

41
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:31,160
How could you miss such a small thing?
So stupid.

42
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,560
You're even more stupid for trusting me.

43
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:37,164
Would you go this far just to get Siamraphe?

44
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:39,533
Did you really think you could protect it?

45
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:44,067
Even if Siamraphe now is full of old people,
women, and children,

46
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:47,151
our family never abandons its own.

47
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:50,391
You wouldn't understand.

48
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:54,818
Even with a family, you never appreciate it.

49
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,684
Mr. Jaruek, do you have anything to say?

50
00:03:56,684 --> 00:03:59,676
- Will you accept the charges?
- Was that voice really edited?

51
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:02,604
Ms. Thara, anything to tell Mr. Jaruek?

52
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:04,320
Certainly.

53
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:11,462
Siamraphe belongs only
to the Raphethada family.

54
00:04:11,462 --> 00:04:15,191
How you reached where you are today
isn't because you're talented.

55
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,373
You're just better at cheating than others.

56
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,191
And you.

57
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:28,480
Stop using mistress' child
as an excuse for your life.

58
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,471
Your rotten nature is the reason
your life is like this.

59
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,320
Is it true? Did you really do it?

60

64
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:48,729

69

can't be in this business.

If you want more evidence about my father,

182
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:17,378
- I'll cooperate.
- Dernthap!

183
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:21,933
I am your father!

184
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:25,316
It's precisely because you're my father,
I have to stop you.

185
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:28,969
I can't stand seeing people keep cursing you.

186
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:31,951
You taught me to win by stepping on others,

187
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:34,111
but I don't want to be like you.

188
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:38,067
To have to sit and decide who to hurt today
so I can take their things.

189
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:41,578
You ungrateful son.

190
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:46,067
Don't you realize everything I built,
everything I did, was meant to be yours?

191
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,644
Don't use me as your excuse, Dad.

192
00:18:49,644 --> 00:18:51,484
I never wanted anything you stole.

193
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:52,756
I didn't steal!

194
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,600
It's called doing business.

195
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,320
If you had trusted me,
if you had helped me and Seenam,

196
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,742
your wife wouldn't have ended up like this.

197
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:04,440
That's not true.

198
00:19:06,627 --> 00:19:08,240
I know.

199
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:12,013
I know you used Nam for your own gain.

200
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:21,880
You...

201
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:28,658
You should've never been born my son.

202
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:37,280
But I've never regretted being your son.

203
00:19:42,276 --> 00:19:44,129
Though if I had a choice,

204
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,480
I wouldn't want a father like you.

205
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,720
Please.

206
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:12,147
Thanks to Dernthap's evidence,

207
00:20:12,147 --> 00:20:15,422
Jaruek and Seenam were prosecuted.

208
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:21,098
For everything that happened at Siamraphe,
and for the case involving Klang and Chon,

209
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:25,600
Heaven Plaza was boycotted
and emptied of customers.

210
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,831
[Heaven Plaza]

211
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,382
[Siamraphe]

212
00:20:48,524 --> 00:20:53,996
Dernthap gave the copied evidence
to Thaleh to oppose the sale of Siamraphe,

213
00:20:53,996 --> 00:20:57,711
and at last, we took Siamraphe back.

214
00:21:10,147 --> 00:21:12,924
Jaruek was sent to prison,

215
00:21:12,924 --> 00:21:16,769
but a few days later, news broke that
he had died of sudden heart failure

216
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:18,920
despite never having any prior condition.

217
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,636
Please give your comments.

218
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:22,507
Please make way for the officers.

219
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:30,222
As for Seenam, after she miscarried,

220
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,378
she was convicted of the attempted murder
of Ms. Yai,

221
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:36,320
complicity in the case
involving Klang and Chon,

222
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,408
and document forgery.

223
00:21:38,408 --> 00:21:41,400
She was sentenced to 50 years in prison.

224
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,668
[I'm one...]

225
00:22:29,668 --> 00:22:32,762
[... Raphethada]

226
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:35,698
[One of them...]

227
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,600
[I'm one of the Raphethadas too]

228
00:22:49,182 --> 00:22:52,876
Under Dernthap's leadership,

229
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:58,689
Heaven Plaza recovered within two years,
built on principles opposite to Jaruek's.

230
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,164
Marry me.

231
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:33,627
I promise I'll be a good wife...

232
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:37,280
and a good mother to our child.

233
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:43,324
Nam.

234
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:46,160
Nam, don't...

235
00:23:49,116 --> 00:23:51,329
I never dreamed...

236
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,769
of having a family with you.

237
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:02,329
I didn't even know
why I need to hold onto it.

238
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:21,222
As for Lek's family,
they reconciled and began healing together.

239
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,249
Welcome home, son.

240
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,943
[Welcome home]

241
00:24:46,156 --> 00:24:48,364
Tell me what you want to eat.

242
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:49,840
I'll take you.

243
00:24:51,196 --> 00:24:53,756
And if you want anything, just tell me.

244
00:24:53,756 --> 00:24:55,480
I'll get it for you.

245
00:25:10,182 --> 00:25:12,098
Dad, can you let Mom go?

246
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:25,520
The doctor said if we feel something,
we should say it. Don't keep it inside.

247
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,507
I know you and Mom
don't love each other anymore.

248
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:30,840
Don't hold onto it.

249
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,809
I just want everyone to be happy.

250
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,311
Don't let Mom become like me, Dad.

251
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,684
From the time you were little,
you never asked me for anything.

252
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:07,842
I'll take care of it.

253
00:26:28,782 --> 00:26:32,658
Whatever makes you happy, do it.

254
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,356
Thank you, son.

255
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:57,356
As for Nali's case, after months in court,

256
00:26:57,356 --> 00:27:00,458
the judge ruled that Mut and Sin
were victims of her false accusations

257
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:05,640
and reduced their sentences
to five years each for cooperation.

258
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:18,987
For Master Keeta's case,
Andaman and Mukdao confessed

259
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:20,684
and cooperated as victims.

260
00:27:20,684 --> 00:27:23,733
The court gave both of them
suspended sentences.

261
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:04,778
[Siamraphe]

262
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:10,258
I've gathered everyone here today
to make an important announcement.

263
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:14,942
You all know Siamraphe
has just gone through a crisis.

264
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:19,649
And that incident made me see clearly

265
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:24,738
who truly deserves to carry on this legacy.

266
00:28:24,738 --> 00:28:27,302
To lead Siamraphe forward.

267
00:28:29,676 --> 00:28:32,924
You all know him as my nephew,

268
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:37,911
but I want you to see him as a man.

269
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:43,618
A man once doubted upon,
a man who almost lost his place here.

270
00:28:43,618 --> 00:28:46,004
But instead of giving up,

271
00:28:46,004 --> 00:28:53,347
he proved that he is worthy
of this responsibility.

272
00:28:55,173 --> 00:28:57,591
Thalehluang Raphethada.

273
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,249
Thank you, everyone.

274
00:29:14,707 --> 00:29:17,360
You all know I've been through a trial.

275
00:29:18,578 --> 00:29:21,787
The hardest one of my life.

276
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:24,054
That experience taught me many things.

277
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:29,200
It made me grow, become stronger,
and ready to face any challenge.

278
00:29:29,871 --> 00:29:31,791
My father always told me...

279
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:34,436
Together, we stand.

280
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:40,369
And today, I finally understand that's true.

281
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,636
I promise to my father, to Chon,

282
00:29:45,636 --> 00:29:49,427
to my family, and everyone here...

283
00:29:50,613 --> 00:29:52,822
I will protect Siamraphe...

284
00:29:55,427 --> 00:30:00,600
and make it grow
greater than it ever was before.

285
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,742
Since everyone's here together today,

286
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:21,640
I would like to treat everyone to lunch.

287
00:31:29,258 --> 00:31:31,107
Hello.

288
00:31:31,107 --> 00:31:33,680
Ms. Weerin asked Jom to bring me here.

289
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,560
Is there something you wanted to discuss?

290
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:40,436
Come walk with me for a bit.

291
00:31:43,587 --> 00:31:45,738
How's your brother doing?

292
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:50,062
He's getting much better.
I've been helping with his physical therapy.

293
00:31:50,062 --> 00:31:52,324
His arm has started moving again.

294
00:31:54,591 --> 00:31:58,964
Did you call me here to ask about that?

295
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:03,676
I want you to help me find a pen.

296
00:32:03,676 --> 00:32:06,938
I dropped it while walking around
inspecting the mall earlier.

297
00:32:10,653 --> 00:32:13,876
You called me here to look for a pen?

298
00:32:15,591 --> 00:32:19,333
I want to see if you can do it.

299
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,738
But if you don't want to, that's fine.

300
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:26,769
I can do it.

301
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:28,796
What does the pen look like?

302
00:32:55,503 --> 00:32:57,881
Why did she call Cheeva here?

303
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,098
If you want to know, wait and see.

304
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:08,018
I searched everywhere,
but I still can't find it.

305
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:11,809
Every place you've looked...

306
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:15,920
those are all areas Thaleh is responsible for
as the leader of Siamraphe.

307
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,151
You didn't really want me to find a pen,
did you?

308
00:34:23,547 --> 00:34:25,271
Don't be upset.

309
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,427
I know Thaleh likes you.

310
00:34:28,427 --> 00:34:32,396
And now that he's the leader of Siamraphe,

311
00:34:33,018 --> 00:34:35,471
it's only natural for a mother
to want to know

312
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:40,293
what kind of person her son is seeing.

313
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:42,000
And whether she's suitable.

314
00:34:46,471 --> 00:34:48,889
I don't think I can answer that, ma'am.

315
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:53,058
But if you're talking about the pen...

316
00:34:56,424 --> 00:34:59,538
it might not be expensive,

317
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:02,489
but I can guarantee it writes beautifully.

318
00:35:04,178 --> 00:35:08,284
All I ask is that you give it a try
with an open mind.

319
00:35:19,027 --> 00:35:21,387
Please excuse me. I'll get back to work now.

320
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,622
Mom.

321
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:37,396
Why did you ask Cheeva to come?

322
00:35:41,745 --> 00:35:43,718
You've got good taste, son.

323
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:48,542
Thank you.

324
00:35:55,178 --> 00:35:56,369
Hey.

325
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:20,587
Let's go.

326
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,511
You know...

327
00:36:28,511 --> 00:36:32,920
that girl reminds me of you
when you first started dating Klang.

328
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:37,671
I was much less harsh than you back then.

329
00:36:37,671 --> 00:36:41,844
You once made me look for a tiny earring,
barely visible.

330
00:36:41,844 --> 00:36:43,742
And did you find it?

331
00:36:45,018 --> 00:36:46,756
No, I didn't even bother looking.

332
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:51,960
I told her that
I already knew it was never lost.

333
00:36:54,524 --> 00:36:58,196
And because of that answer,
I let them be together.

334
00:36:59,804 --> 00:37:01,676
Why's that, Ms. Yai?

335
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:08,636
Because a good leader
needs a partner who's both wise and brave.

336
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,080
And that girl...

337
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,129
she reminds me of you.

338
00:37:28,387 --> 00:37:30,404
You don't have to follow me anymore.

339
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:11,911
An heir isn't just someone
who inherits blood or a business,

340
00:38:11,911 --> 00:38:16,249
but someone who inherits
the family's shared values:

341
00:38:16,884 --> 00:38:22,889
love, loyalty,
and responsibility toward others.

342
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:27,093
And that is the reason
for Siamraphe's greatness.

343
00:38:27,093 --> 00:38:30,351
Not just its fame or wealth.

344
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:34,093
As long as every heir
never lets go of one another,

345
00:38:34,093 --> 00:38:41,013
Siamraphe and the Raphethada family
will remain together, forever.
