[Siamraphe]

2
00:00:00,884 --> 00:00:03,593
The reason I called
this emergency meeting today

3
00:00:03,593 --> 00:00:09,458
is to discuss the upcoming
58th anniversary celebration of Siamraphe.

4
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:12,320
Right now, Yai is still unconscious,

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,333
and I don't think she'll recover in time
for the event.

6
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:20,698
She also hasn't chosen her successor
as Siamraphe's next leader.

7
00:00:20,698 --> 00:00:23,898
So I'd like to propose
that we postpone the anniversary celebration.

8
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,667
Siamraphe isn't just about Yai.

9
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,973
It's the entire organization.

10
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:30,378
If one person is missing
and we cancel the event,

11
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:33,053
what will people think of Siamraphe?

12
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:35,822
And with all the scandals involving
Mut, Dao, and Anda,

13
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:38,636
our reputation is already damaged.

14
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:40,471
If we cancel now,

15
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:44,053
I think Siamraphe
will completely lose credibility.

16
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:46,942
But she is still in a coma at the hospital.

17
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:49,084
How can we celebrate while she's like this?

18
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:51,844
Everyone knows she's the CEO.

19
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:55,587
Holding a party right now
would make Siamraphe look heartless.

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,440
Then let's vote.

21
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:03,920
Who thinks we should cancel the event?

22
00:01:18,956 --> 00:01:20,720
Four to three.

23
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:26,920
Then we postpone the 58th
anniversary celebration until Yai recovers.

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,124
Thank you, everyone.

25
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:31,360
Wait.

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,680
I have another announcement to make.

27
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:37,116
What is it?

28
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:40,280
At first, I planned to announce this
during the anniversary,

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,827
but given the situation, I'll do it now.

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,507
[Power of Attorney document]

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,413
That's not true. Yai would never do this.

32
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:06,951
- This is a fake.
- Ms. Yai

33
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:09,547
signed over her authority to me.

34
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:14,471
To manage operations, make decisions,
hold shareholder meetings,

35
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:16,604
and many other executive powers.

36
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:19,284
- I don't believe that's her signature.
- That's enough!

37
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:22,289
Nam showed it to me already.

38
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:26,160
If this is Yai's decision,
then we'll respect it.

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,329
- Grandfather.
- Meeting adjourned!

40
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:54,684
I'm sure that document is forged.

41
00:02:54,684 --> 00:02:56,960
We can report it to the police,

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,484
but the verification process will take time.

43
00:02:59,484 --> 00:03:02,182
And since the document states clearly that

44
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,262
Ms. Nam is acting

45
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:05,100
with full authority on Ms. Yai's behalf
until the review is complete,

46
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,213
that means she can legally act
in Yai's place for now.

47
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:09,236
So we can't stop her?

48
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:10,867
Not at this stage.

49
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:15,449
So that woman can do anything she wants.
Even sell Siamraphe?

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,667
What's the worst-case scenario, Wit?

51
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:27,284
If she sells Siamraphe
and the contracts are signed and paid,

52
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:31,729
even if the power of attorney
is proven fake later,

53
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:35,156
the sale would still be legally binding.

54
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:39,884
We could request a police investigation
and file in court,

55
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:43,604
but there's no guarantee
we could stop the transaction in time.

56
00:03:43,604 --> 00:03:45,058
So...

57
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:48,591
Siamraphe could end up
belonging to someone else?

58
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:51,698
No exceptions?

59
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,187
One.

60
00:03:53,187 --> 00:03:59,933
If we can prove the buyer
knowingly colluded with Ms. Seenam,

61
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:02,831
the sale can be nullified.

Is there any way we can stop her right now?

69
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:36,258
According to company policy,

70
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:42,129
appointing or removing executives
requires a majority board vote.

71
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:45,871
So if Mom, Uncle Lek, and I
skip the meeting tomorrow,

72
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:47,689
can she still proceed?

73
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:50,613
If more than half
of the board members attend,

74
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,933
then yes, she can hold the meeting and vote.

75
00:04:55,822 --> 00:05:02,520
Then if we can make sure either Uncle Nit,
Ms. Da, or Mr. Korn doesn't show up,

76
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,787
she won't have enough votes to act.

77
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:06,040

78
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:26,200

79
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,409
I'm sorry to bother you,

80
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:32,507
but you've heard about
Nam's emergency board meeting, right?

81
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:35,804
If that's what this is about,
I have nothing to say.

82
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:39,413
But she might be behind Yai's fall.

83
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:43,387
Whatever feud you have,
don't drag me into it.

84
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:46,458
You say she acts for herself.

85
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,324
But you all act for your own children too.

86

Leave!

87
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:54,480
But this concerns
the very survival of Siamraphe!

88
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:57,320
I said I won't talk about this again.

89
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,884

or should I have someone escort you out?

Hello, Uncle.

91
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,760
You dare to blackmail me with these photos,
and now you come to greet me politely?

92
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,778
I just thought you liked polite,
respectful young people.

93
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:32,524
Maybe you'll end up liking me, too.

94
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:34,347

95
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,764

You have to help me.

Especially during the board meeting.

98
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:52,124
You, Ms. Da, and Mr. Korn must support me.

99
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,093
Never.

100
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:03,756
I'll never let Siamraphe fall into the hands
of someone as vile as you.

101
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:08,116
Oh? Then I hope...

102
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:14,044
you don't plan on
dying from a heart attack anytime soon.

103
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:22,893
Because if these pictures happen to reach
the hands of reporters...

104
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,080
Do you know how I found out, Uncle?

105
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:40,493
Every time you get a massage,
you always choose male therapists.

106
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,893
At first, I didn't think much of it.
Maybe you just like strong hands.

00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:46,720
Until...

108
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:50,404
I saw one of your paintings.

109
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:56,067
A bird in an open cage.

110
00:07:56,067 --> 00:08:01,484
It means the bird's too afraid to fly away.

111
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:04,942
Because it's hiding a secret.

112
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:10,689
I was foolish to ever trust someone like you.

113
00:08:12,462 --> 00:08:17,409
Uncle, you'll be gone in a few years anyway.

114
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,702
Don't be mad.

115
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:25,529
Just use what time you have left
to help your dear nieces and nephews, okay?

116
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:35,169
- Da.
- Yes, Dad?

117
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,524
If Weerin's family comes looking for you,
don't go out to meet them.

118
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:42,507
And tell Korn to come home immediately.

119

If neither of you shows up,

120
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:49,120
I'll cancel the guarantee contract I signed.

121
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,587

00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,916
Excuse me. Could you keep your voice down?

127
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,293
You're being too loud.

128
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:17,796
So what if I am?

129
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:22,298
Da! I know you're in there!

130
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:28,871
Mr. Korn isn't here. He just left.

131
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:30,640
Then I'll wait.

132
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,040
Please don't. Mr. Korn said if you come,

133
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,423
we're to tell you he's not available to meet.

134
00:09:36,423 --> 00:09:38,240
I'm sorry.

135
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:41,338
I'm sorry, Aunt Yai.

136
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:44,800
You wanted me to turn myself in,
but I couldn't.

137
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:47,622
I've let you down.

138
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,689
Please look after them for me.

139
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:24,991
Come out.

140
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,787
How did you know I was here?

141
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:39,760
Your perfume.

142
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:43,720
Even the ROTC instructor hated it.

143
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,560
You think I'd forget that scent?

144
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,776
I saw in the group chat
that Aunt Yai fell down the stairs.

145
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:57,009
She's always careful. How could that happen?

146
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,444
My mom suspects Aunt Nam.

147
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:02,693
She's been feeding information to Jaruek.

148
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:08,138
Is that why Aunt Yai was furious with her
that day?

149
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:09,871
Then why didn't she fire her?

150
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:11,987
Because she had no proof.

151
00:12:11,987 --> 00:12:13,978
And when she finally got the evidence

152
00:12:13,978 --> 00:12:16,302
and was about to call the police
to arrest Aunt Nam,

153
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,960
the incident happened first.

154
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,684
She even had an alibi. She was with Dernthap.

155
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:23,636
So we still can't touch her.

156
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:32,822
Mut, come back and surrender.

157
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:35,236
Fight the case.

158
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:39,204
At least we'll be in this together.

159
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:46,604
If I surrender now,
I'll go straight to prison.

160
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,511
There's no way
I can save Siamraphe from there.

161
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:52,916
But you promised Aunt Yai.

162
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:57,231
That you'd protect Siamraphe.

There's been so much chaos lately.

165
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:59,036
I called everyone today for an urgent matter.

166
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:05,342
Without a CEO, operations have stalled.

167
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:08,778
And we don't know
when Ms. Yai will return to work.

168
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:10,756
Are you cursing her?

169

Excuse me,

170
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:18,649
I'd like today's meeting
to be calm and rational.

171
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,476
Siamraphe is in crisis.

172
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,578
Fine. What do you want?

173
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:33,809
I want the board to vote for a new CEO
to act in Ms. Yai's place.

174
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:46,538
I nominate Nam as interim CEO.

00:31:36,738 --> 00:31:39,658
Not to hide fingerprints,

352
00:31:39,658 --> 00:31:42,600
but because he was wearing a prosthetic hand.

353
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:48,280
If we find him,
we'll know who's behind everything.

354
00:32:27,436 --> 00:32:28,649
Hey.

355
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:37,173
Uncle Non, you saw the video I sent, right?

356
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:40,684
The guy's wearing the same black gloves
we saw in the CCTV footage.

357
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:42,498
Where did you see him?

358
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:44,422
At Heaven Plaza.

359
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:46,142
He works for Jaruek.

360
00:32:46,142 --> 00:32:48,969
Can you check if it's the same man?

361
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:51,164
Because if it is...

362
00:32:51,164 --> 00:32:54,373
then Jaruek's involved
in my father and Chon's deaths.

363
00:32:54,996 --> 00:32:57,378
- Got it.
- Thanks, Uncle Non.

364
00:33:03,956 --> 00:33:06,529
How could you help Nam like that?

365
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:09,396
You know if Thaleh finds proof you lied,

366
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:10,809
you could go to jail, right?

367
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:12,276
Don't worry, Dad.

368
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:14,360
I've collected all the evidence.

369
00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:18,000
You really love her that much?

370
00:33:22,498 --> 00:33:24,280
Nam's pregnant, Dad.

371
00:33:31,231 --> 00:33:33,133
What did she tell you?

372
00:33:41,449 --> 00:33:43,716
Thap.

373
00:33:43,716 --> 00:33:45,529
Nam.

374
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:46,609
Thap.

375
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,458
What's going on, Nam?

376
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:49,720
I... I...

377
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,991
Ms. Yai was going to hand the evidence
to the police to arrest me,

378
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:56,684
so I grabbed it from her... and then...

379
00:33:56,684 --> 00:34:00,640
she accidentally fell down
the stairs herself.

380
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:05,004
I just knew if anyone found out,
they'd think I did it.

381
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:06,084
Thap.

382
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:08,871
Please help me, Thap.
I don't want to go to jail.

383
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:13,422
What do you want me to do?

384
00:34:13,422 --> 00:34:16,418
Can you testify that you were with me?

385
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:20,529
You want me to lie?

386
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:26,000
Do it for me.

387
00:34:30,547 --> 00:34:32,720
For our baby, please?

388
00:34:36,763 --> 00:34:39,591
Where were you just now?
You went to the house, didn't you?

389
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:41,609
Did you hurt Yai?

390
00:34:43,218 --> 00:34:44,942
She was with me.

391
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:54,604
She's really pregnant?

392
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,618
I took her to the hospital already.

393
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:05,320
We're talking about getting married.

394
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,498
I'm happy for...

395
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,169
you.

396
00:35:29,716 --> 00:35:31,889
You're not mad at me or Nam?

397
00:35:34,636 --> 00:35:36,462
Of course not.

398
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:40,391
Heaven Plaza is about to
have its third-generation heir.

399
00:35:40,391 --> 00:35:43,431
That's something to celebrate.

400
00:35:46,551 --> 00:35:48,173
Really, Dad?

401
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,631
Thank you, Dad.

402
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:58,084
Thank you so much.

403
00:36:04,302 --> 00:36:08,333
Dad, about the Wednesday meeting
to review the revised Heaven Complex plans,

404
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,778
can we move it to 1 p.m.? Would that be okay?

405
00:36:10,778 --> 00:36:13,640
Sure, do whatever works for you.

406
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,582
I'm busy Wednesday afternoon.
I've got lunch with Mr. Li.

407
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,298
Mr. Li?

408
00:36:19,298 --> 00:36:21,689
You've got another project with him?

409
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:24,440
No, just lunch. He's here on vacation.

410
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,187
I'm just meeting him, that's all.

411
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,729
Okay, Dad.

412
00:36:38,422 --> 00:36:40,418
I want the red card.

413
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:42,724
Dao, you knew I don't have any red cards,
right?

414
00:36:42,724 --> 00:36:43,929
No idea.

415
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:45,862
Hurry up, draw!

416
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,582
Anda, do you have it?

417
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:12,493
How are you feeling?

418
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:16,409
I made your favorite strawberry cheesecake.

419
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:17,996
Let me help you.

420
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:25,262
How are you feeling?

421
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,151
Aunt Lek.

422
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:34,849
Let me feed you.

423
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,160
There's a package for Mr. Anda.

424
00:37:54,124 --> 00:37:56,027
Would you like to open it first, ma'am?

425
00:37:56,027 --> 00:37:57,080
Sure.

426
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:11,404
Anda.

427
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:24,778
I'm sorry.

428
00:38:29,222 --> 00:38:30,649
Fighting.

429
00:38:34,924 --> 00:38:36,382
I care about you.

430
00:38:40,124 --> 00:38:42,302
Can I see you, Anda?

431
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,931
[Can I see you, Anda?]

432
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:22,467
(I'm sorry.)

433
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:44,898
Here.

434
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:49,187
The signature on Seenam's power of attorney
looks very close to Yai's.

435
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:51,809
The police said the ink used

436
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:55,987
matches the pen Ms. Yai often used
to sign documents.

437
00:39:56,609 --> 00:40:01,440
Meaning Seenam used Yai's own pen
to forge her signature?

438
00:40:03,782 --> 00:40:05,600
That's possible.

439
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,800
Seenam had access to her office.

440
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:15,027
When will the police
be able to confirm it's fake?

441
00:40:15,027 --> 00:40:16,898
We need to move fast, Wit.

442
00:40:36,387 --> 00:40:38,182
Baking, Dao?

443
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:39,449
Yes.

444
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:46,391
The doctor said
I should do something I enjoy.

445
00:40:46,391 --> 00:40:48,249
To keep my mind off things.

446
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:52,556
Why aren't you sleeping yet, Mom?

447
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:55,116
Well...

448
00:40:55,116 --> 00:40:57,587
I wanted to ask you to look at this for me.

449
00:40:58,404 --> 00:41:03,431
I want to know if the signature
on this document is really Yai's,

450
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:07,267
same as her actual one here.

451
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:13,658
Or is there a program
we can use to compare the real and fake?

452
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:21,791
I'm not sure, Mom.

453
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:23,818
Maybe let Tawan check.

454
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:26,302
When I did something similar...

455
00:41:26,302 --> 00:41:30,360
I just cropped and pasted the signature
onto a copy of an ID card.

456
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,573
And the part about Aunt Nam
kicking you and Thaleh off the board...

457
00:41:42,573 --> 00:41:44,240
what's going on with that?

458
00:41:47,627 --> 00:41:52,009
The board just implements policies.

459
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,274
Now that I'm not on it,

460
00:41:53,274 --> 00:41:57,898
it just means I'm not managing
day-to-day business.

461
00:41:57,898 --> 00:42:02,933
But Thaleh and I
still hold our official positions.

462
00:42:02,933 --> 00:42:06,493
We're shareholders by law.

463
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:11,080
No one can remove us.

464
00:42:12,107 --> 00:42:16,271
If Nam wants to make any big decisions,

465
00:42:16,271 --> 00:42:18,418
she still has to get approval from us.

466
00:42:19,462 --> 00:42:21,440
So we'll be fine, right?

467
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,640
Of course. We can handle it.

468
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,960
- Now let me try that cake.
- Mom, it's hot!

469
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,720
- Just a sec, it's still warm.
- It's okay.

470
00:42:37,711 --> 00:42:39,058
Mom.

471
00:42:39,693 --> 00:42:42,013
Do you know someone named Mr. Li?

472
00:43:21,071 --> 00:43:22,258
Lek.

473
00:43:24,382 --> 00:43:26,369
Sin.

474
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:28,262
How did you get back here?

475
00:43:28,262 --> 00:43:30,187
Where's Mut?

476
00:43:30,187 --> 00:43:32,111
I thought he came back here!

477
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:34,182
He saw the news about you
being removed from the board.

478
00:43:34,182 --> 00:43:36,884
He got furious.
Jumped out of the car and ran off!

479
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:39,484
And you just let him run away?

480
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:41,724
What do we do? Maybe the police
have already caught him by now!

481
00:43:41,724 --> 00:43:42,982
I looked everywhere.

482
00:43:42,982 --> 00:43:46,267
His condo, the safehouse... nothing!
I thought he'd come here!

483
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:49,062
Oh, god...

484
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:53,880
Who's that?

485
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,382
Be careful.

486
00:44:03,618 --> 00:44:04,631
Dad.

487
00:44:04,631 --> 00:44:05,818
Mut.

488
00:44:07,764 --> 00:44:09,439
Are you okay, son?

489
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,661
Come inside.
