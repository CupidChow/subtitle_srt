1
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:45,200
Excuse me a moment.

2
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:55,092
I'm full. I'm going out to get a coffee.

3
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:56,883
Feel free to continue.

4
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,809
No one's arrived yet.

5
00:02:21,956 --> 00:02:24,800
Yai, are you angry with me?

6
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,173
I feel like you seem different today.

7
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:31,840
- I'm the same as always.
- That's not true.

8
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:35,320
I've known you a long time.

9
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:40,440
Do you think I'm a mole for Jaruek?

10
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,462
Let's not talk about this now.

11
00:02:45,462 --> 00:02:49,487
- I'll wait in the car.
- But I'm really uneasy.

12
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:51,880
I want you to trust me.

13
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,647
I just feel like you're the one
who's given me everything.

14
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:02,880
Between you and Thap,
I would always choose you.

15
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,380
I'll wait in the car.

16
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:13,953
Yai, watch out!

17
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:24,547
Nam!

18
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:25,993
Ms. Nam!

19
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,100
Yai!

20
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,453
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

21
00:03:45,453 --> 00:03:47,620
I'll go check on Ms. Nam.

22
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:09,580
You could say it helped.
Being in a business family...

23
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:37,768
Mom, Jom called.

24
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:39,960
The doctors moved Aunt Nam out of ICU,

25
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,267
but she'll need several days of rest.

26
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:45,553
As for Mut, the stomach bleeding has stopped.

27
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,353
I think he's improving.

28
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:56,960
Do you still suspect Aunt Nam?

29
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:03,380
It's not just about her.

30
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,847
Everything that's happening
keeps getting worse,

31
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:12,600
and only our family is still untouched.

32
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,867
I'm scared, son.

33
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:22,867
I'm not ready to lose anyone else.

34
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:40,300
Excuse me, Dao and Tawan
are done with their hair and makeup.

35
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,947
- Everything's ready.
- Okay.

36
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,447
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

37
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:49,840
For your toast shop to be this successful,

38
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,660
I'm sure you've faced many hurdles.

39
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,647
Did being an heir to a prominent family help?

40
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:00,840
You could say it did.

41
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,313
Growing up in a business family
lets me absorb certain things.

42
00:06:06,313 --> 00:06:09,447
When I face problems,
I have people to consult,

43
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,760
but most of the,
I try to solve them myself first.

44
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,900
Sounds like all upsides.

45
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,600
Any downsides to being an heir?

46
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:26,040
There's some pressure.

47
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,567
As everyone knows,
my family members are all very capable.

48
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,273
But Dao's capable too.

49
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:35,786
With her shop,
we hardly have to get involved.

50
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:38,347
She truly runs it herself.

51
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,600
And you, Tawan, how do you help your sister?

52
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,447
I just help with taste-testing.

53
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:50,973
And I want to help, but she won't let me.

54
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:57,987
Still, everyone's a great support to me.

55
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:00,340
And I have good news to announce here first.

56
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,433
I want to say that...

57
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,953
my second toast branch
will open early next month.

58
00:07:07,953 --> 00:07:10,707
It won't be inside Siamraphe.

59
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:13,513
It'll be a standalone shop in Ari.

60
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,987
Oh!

61
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:19,627
So this is what you kept secret from Mom?

62
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:23,253
Wow, I'm so proud of you!

63
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:25,387
- Surprised?
- Surprised.

64
00:07:25,387 --> 00:07:26,987
Ms. Rin.

65
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:34,540
Did something happen to someone?

66
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,760
I'm Police Lt. Col. Danthai Thitijinda.

67
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,520
We've found evidence
that your family is involved

68
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,033
with an online gambling network
and mule accounts.

69
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:45,353
Huh?

70
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,753
What?

71
00:07:48,753 --> 00:07:50,040
Where?

72
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,880
[Suspected of involvement in online gambling
and running mule accounts]

73
00:08:07,873 --> 00:08:10,480
Shocking business news today.

74
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,727
Police say they've found evidence
the family of Ms. Weerin Raphethada,

75
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,067
an executive at Siamraphe Mall,

76
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:21,380
is linked to gambling websites
and mule accounts.

77
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,520
The facts are still unclear,

78
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,853
but officers have invited all members
of Ms. Weerin's family

79
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:31,160
to the station to give statements.

80
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,973
They're arriving now.

81
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:34,840
Please make way.

82
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,460
- Ms. Weerin, could you say a few words?
- Excuse us, please make way.

83
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,020
No interviews right now, please clear a path.

84
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,973
- How are you linked to mule accounts?
- Please cooperate. Excuse us.

85
00:08:41,973 --> 00:08:44,313
Was the whole family involved?

86
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:46,466
- Please make way.
- How are you linked to mule accounts?

87
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:48,100
Ms. Yai.

88
00:09:14,307 --> 00:09:15,740
Dao.

89
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,340
What the hell are you doing?

90
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,387
I trusted you, why would you do this to me?

91
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:25,420
- Why would you do this?
- Dao, Dao...

92
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,773
- Listen, I didn't know.
- How could you not know?

93
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:32,633
You're the only one I gave copies
of my family's IDs and signatures to.

94
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,853
The police say we're mixed up
with gambling sites,

95
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:37,113
fake loans, mule accounts, whatever!

96
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:38,984
Siamraphe's name is being dragged
because of me.

97
00:09:38,984 --> 00:09:41,133
Dao, calm down.

98
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:44,233
The documents that leaked
didn't come from my company.

99
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:47,167
If they'd leaked from me,
other people's documents would've leaked too.

100
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,707
But I'm sure they leaked from your company.

101
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:52,080
Didn't you say everyone
was about to accept me?

102
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,117
- Everyone already was...
- Dao!

103
00:09:55,117 --> 00:09:56,920
Get a grip.

104
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,840
Calm down, steady yourself.
We can still fix this.

105
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,987
Fix what? Don't say another word.

106
00:10:01,987 --> 00:10:05,560
Okay, then I won't.

107
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,980
Go ahead and yell if you want.

108
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,715
This is exactly why...

109
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:11,440
Because you lose your head like this,

110
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,680
you never manage to get things done.

111
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,993
You know, right?

112
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:42,240
That I would never hurt someone I love.

113
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,360
But now my family's in trouble
because of you.

114
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,263
I don't dare tell anyone.
I don't know what to do.

115
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:49,627
Dao... Dao, listen to me.

116
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:54,300
I'm sorry I shouted at you.

117
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:59,787
And I panicked
that you and the family had to face this.

118
00:11:09,154 --> 00:11:10,974
Have you eaten?

119
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:30,087
Wow, so everything we saw
was just an illusion?

120
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:34,007
Is this only media gossip or the truth?
We want the facts.

121
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:36,680
Have there been lawsuits or charges yet?

122
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,053
Shocking. How could such a reputable family
have this kind of scandal?

123
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:44,047
If you did wrong, take responsibility.
An apology isn't enough.

124
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:46,287
Greed really spares no one.

125
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:50,253
Never thought a good family
would have a side hustle like this.

126
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:24,453
Eat something,
or your gastritis will flare up.

127
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,687
People are slamming my family
and Siamraphe everywhere.

128
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:34,400
Eat. If you don't,

129
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,413
I really won't give your phone back.

130
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,607
And I won't talk to you either.

131
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,720
[Siamraphe]

132
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,233
The lawyer says the leak
could have come through multiple channels,

133
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:34,787
either from the company or from transactions.

134
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:39,480
But I don't think your family's documents
came from the company,

135
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,900
because even your housekeeper's name leaked.

136
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,040
I think so too.

137
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,127
It was likely someone in the house,
or someone with access to my home.

138
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:54,487
If you learn anything else, tell me.

139
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:56,513
- Okay.
- I also called everyone together

140
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:59,980
to warn you to be careful.

141
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,387
Right now,
Siamraphe is swamped with problems.

142
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:07,360
Mahasamut being attacked,
and now Weerin's family.

143
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,947
Could this be connected to Jaruek?
Like with Mut.

144
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:14,687
Jaruek probably can't get into my house,

145
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,773
but his informant...

146
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:22,113
Pasin said Seenam is dating Dernthap.

147
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:24,853
She's the mole.

148
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:32,313
Let's wait for the police to conclude.

149
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,033
Thaleh, how are you holding up?

150
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:39,187
Doing both Mut's and Seenam's work...
are you tired?

151
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:40,947
Not tired, Aunt Yai.

152
00:15:41,793 --> 00:15:44,880
If I hit any roadblocks,
I'll tell you right away.

153
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:52,173
Honesty. Courage. Faith in family.

154
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:57,120
These three principles
will get us through this together.

155
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,633
With Aunt Yai's congee like this,

156
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,820
you'll get better fast, right, Mut?

157
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,387
Delicious as always. Thank you, Aunt Yai.

158
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:19,960
The deputy called me this morning,

159
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,960
said the station chief
is rushing to find the culprit.

160
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:27,993
But you really can't remember his face?

161
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:36,300
There were so many people,

162
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,040
and it was very dark, Aunt Yai.

163
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,940
And you were drunk too, right?

164
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,267
From now on,
be much more careful wherever you go.

165
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:49,220
Don't worry,
I'll get back at that bastard myself.

166
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,660
Stop right there. Do nothing.

167
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,193
But... He hurt my son.

168
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:58,560
If you truly care about him,
think harder than that.

169
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,976
If you're going to take on thugs,

170
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:05,753
make sure you've no weak points
they can hit back at.

171
00:17:05,753 --> 00:17:09,640
Otherwise next time,
it won't just be a knife.

172
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:16,640
What's going on?

173
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,220
Nothing, Aunt Yai.

174
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,913
Nothing, sis.

175
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:23,847
I'll excuse myself.

176
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,220
Tong, bring Nali back as quietly as possible.

177
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,447
However she is, just get her back.

178
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:45,667
And most important, don't let it become news.

179
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:05,440
Whether Mahasamut
can become Siamraphe's leader

180
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,993
depends on you too, Pasin.

181
00:18:08,707 --> 00:18:11,233
I know you love your son,

182
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:13,920
but love him the right way.

183
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,060
I made this for Mut, so I made extra for you.

184
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,800
Eat while it's hot.

185
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:35,880
Are you no longer angry with me?

186
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,293
What kind of question is that?

187
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:41,800
You risked your life to save me.

188
00:18:42,573 --> 00:18:45,380
Eat up and recover quickly,

189
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,573
so you can come back to your work.

190
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:51,320
My work?

191
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,740
The same duties you had before.

192
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:03,613
T-Thank you. Thank you for the chance.

193
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,560
[Manas]

194
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,314
Hello.

195
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:57,067
Doctor says I have to stay in the hospital
another week before I can be discharged.

196
00:19:57,067 --> 00:19:58,933
We'll meet later, then.

197
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,153
Do you trust me?

198
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,560
Of course.

199
00:20:10,853 --> 00:20:12,853
After everything I've done?

200
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,147
I'm not mad, when was I ever mad at you?

201
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:05,027
- Why would I be mad?
- Mom!

202
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:06,907
Go.

203
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:08,160
Don't. Stop!

204
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,460
Sin, stop.

205
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,192
Stop!

206
00:21:41,187 --> 00:21:42,520
Hit.

207
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:46,753
Ow, ow, ow!

208
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,253
Ow, ow, ow!

209
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:57,893
Ow, ow... hey!

210
00:21:57,893 --> 00:22:00,633
I'm already dead.
Why the hell are you still shooting?

211
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:08,267
Lek, you'd better come here right now.

212
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:10,880
Your kid broke several rules.

213
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,627
Here, the gun power must not exceed 400,

214
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:16,867
but his is nearly 600.

215
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:18,567
At that power,

216
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:22,187
shooting at close range is dangerous, kid.

217
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:29,067
Yeah, even with protective gear,
I still got hurt.

218
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:31,000
I don't think he should be playing.

219
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:34,753
I want to speak with his guardian.

220
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,440
Can I get a phone number?

221
00:22:39,553 --> 00:22:41,920
We done here? I'm leaving.

222
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,144
Hey, where are you going?

223
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:44,933
- Anda!
- Hey...

224
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,800
I'm his mother. What happened?

225
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,200
He didn't respect the rules
and was aggressive.

226
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,273
He isn't suited to this sport.

227
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:58,413
We won't allow him to play here anymore.

228
00:22:58,413 --> 00:23:01,007
Fine, I won't play.

229
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,867
Anda, wait... wait for me Anda! Hey, stop!

230
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:09,080
- How did you get here, Mom?
- Anda.

231
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,547
Why would you do that? It's really dangerous.

232
00:23:11,547 --> 00:23:14,080
How did you know?
Did you send someone to follow me?

233
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,920
Don't change the subject.
Come with me, I'm taking you to the doctor.

234
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,947
Come on...

235
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:19,980
See a doctor for what? I'm fine.

236
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,320
Come with me. Don't be stubborn, Anda.

237
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,840
Let go of me!

238
00:23:24,973 --> 00:23:27,000
Anda. Anda, calm down.

239
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,393
Easy, easy... Anda, get a grip.

240
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:31,907
- Calm down, Anda... stop.
- Let go.

241
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:34,507
Stop and listen.

242
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:37,024
I know what you're going through
is stressful,

243
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:38,787
and you need an outlet.

244
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:41,993
But trust me,
there are better ways than this.

245
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:43,360
Stay out of my business.

246
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,287
Anda!

247
00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:48,893
If you don't stop meddling with my mom,
don't try to lecture me.

248
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,867
And stop following me,

249
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:55,940
or I'll run far enough
that you can't find me.

250
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,800
Anda... Anda, wait for me!

251
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:06,127
Anda, stop first, son... Anda!

252
00:24:06,127 --> 00:24:07,133
Anda.

253
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:08,860
- Anda.
- Anda.

254
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,520
Anda.

255
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,580
Where are you headed, kid?

256
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,073
Just a sec.

257
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:27,927
Can I come see you?

258
00:24:49,173 --> 00:24:51,027
Anda.

259
00:24:51,027 --> 00:24:52,313
Come.

260
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,213
Wanna play a game?

261
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,400
Aren't you going to ask why I'm here?

262
00:25:24,947 --> 00:25:29,240
I told you, I'll be your safe zone.

263
00:25:57,093 --> 00:25:58,700
So you can forget.

264
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,680
Where can I buy emergency contraception?

265
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:30,340
[Searching the web]

266
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,567
Forensics has examined it.

267
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:44,960
They found that the signatures on all
documents related to the illegal transactions

268
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,193
do not match Ms. Weerin's real signature,

269
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:49,233
nor those of any family member.

270
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:52,553
But on the ID card copies,
the signatures are real...

271
00:28:52,553 --> 00:28:54,927
except Ms. Weerin's.

272
00:28:54,927 --> 00:28:57,680
Mr. Thalehluang, and Mr. Mooktawan...

273
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,240
those were inserted using software
to composite the signatures.

274
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,211
Has Ms. Dao done business
or contacted anyone new lately?

275
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,593
She just opened a second branch,

276
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:11,253
so she had to contact lots of people.

277
00:29:11,253 --> 00:29:15,620
Then I'll need to take a further statement
from Ms. Mukdao.

278
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,090
Jai, go... now, Jai.

279
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,653
Ms. Rin?
I have something to discuss with you.

280
00:29:23,653 --> 00:29:26,787
Can it wait, Jai? Let me finish this first.

281
00:29:26,787 --> 00:29:30,647
I think I know who leaked these documents.

282
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:54,253
Come talk to me, dear.

283
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:57,360
I'm tired, let's talk another day.

284
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,940
This second branch you opened...

285
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,073
where did you get the investment money?

286
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:12,500
Tell Mom the truth.

287
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:16,080
Tawan, why do you have my iPad?

288
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,260
Jai told me you asked everyone in the house
for their documents,

289
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,367
so I had Tawan take your iPad to check.

290
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,693
You're the one who forged my signature...

291
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:30,427
and Thaleh's, and Tawan's.

292
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:34,312
Was the investment money
you used for the second shop illegal, Dao?

293
00:30:34,312 --> 00:30:35,627
No, Mom.

294
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,999
Did Master Kee introduce you to those people?

295
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:39,720
No.

296
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,080
I don't know anything about the documents
that leaked to the gambling sites.

297
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,567
Kee only told me to use the documents for
a direct-sales business with him, that's all.

298
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:49,393
- Then how did the papers leak, Dao?
- I don't know.

299
00:30:49,393 --> 00:30:52,120
I asked Kee
and he said it didn't come from him.

300
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,427
And I didn't give the documents to anyone
except him.

301
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,867
Really, Mom, I'm not lying.

302
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:03,753
No matter how much I wanted
to fund Branch Two by myself,

303
00:31:03,753 --> 00:31:06,467
I would never get involved
in anything illegal.

304
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:08,927
I checked the company I invested in with Kee.

305
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:11,900
When the police questioned me,
I was scared, so I didn't dare tell them.

306
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,093
But I truly don't know
how the documents got out.

307
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:16,567
I'm sorry, I just wanted to make you proud.

308
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:20,280
Do you believe me, Mom? Really.

309
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:25,673
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay. I believe you.

310
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,533
Dao...

311
00:31:28,447 --> 00:31:31,400
I don't want to pin this on Master Kee,

312
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,240
but until we can prove
whether he's involved or not...

313
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,673
I want you to be careful.

314
00:31:38,673 --> 00:31:40,627
Don't trust him too quickly.

315
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,393
Besides this...

316
00:31:48,387 --> 00:31:51,533
did he invite you to do anything else?

317
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:03,680
If there's anything,
you have to tell me and Mom.

318
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:07,333
Like Dad's LINE group...

319
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,880
Together we stand.

320
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:56,007
Feel free, officer.
I'm happy for you to check everything.

321
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,400
Thank you.

322
00:33:03,553 --> 00:33:07,980
Then you can be at ease,
knowing I truly had nothing to do with it.

323
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,040
Sorry, but I think you should
stop seeing my sister.

324
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:21,460
I still have business with Dao.

325
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,520
I've spoken with her.
She said she's ending everything with you.

326
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,993
You're talking like Kee is the bad guy.

327
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:31,793
The one who forged the documents was Dao.

328
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:35,180
I invested with Kee too. No problem at all.

329
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,733
It's Dao who's dumping the blame on him.

330
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:41,000
- That's not true, Anda.
- What did you tell him?

331
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,093
My brother has never been like this.

332
00:33:44,113 --> 00:33:45,613
You talk like we're close.

333
00:33:45,613 --> 00:33:48,160
But that doesn't mean
you pay attention to us.

334
00:33:55,673 --> 00:34:00,007
Caring and paying attention
aren't the same thing.

335
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:02,680
Stay out of my family's business.

336
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,960
- Come on, Anda, I'll drive you.
- No!

337
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,553
Anda, come with me.

338
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:13,133
Go take care of Dao.

339
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:15,607
- Leave me alone.
- Anda!

340
00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:17,493
What the hell is wrong with you?

341
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:21,800
It's okay. I don't want trouble between us.

342
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,627
Go with Thaleh.

343
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,613
Stop seeing Kee. He's dangerous.

344
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,233
I'll talk to Anda myself.

345
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,887
Anda.

346
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:44,920
You disappeared. Were you with Kee?

347
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,007
If you're here to stop me from seeing him,
then go.

348
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:49,793
Don't you think it's strange?

349
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:53,280
Out of nowhere he cozies up to you, me,
and Dao at the same time.

350
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,380
And he's all nice to you and Dao.

351
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,987
Why do you think he's doing that?

352
00:35:58,987 --> 00:36:00,620
If you don't know, don't talk.

353
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,560
Do you really believe he wants what's best
for you more than your own family does?

354
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,380
Easy for you to say,
your home isn't like mine.

355
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,040
Having problems at home doesn't mean
you have to make yourself a problem.

356
00:36:13,107 --> 00:36:15,347
Try having a dad who sleeps around

357
00:36:15,347 --> 00:36:17,220
and beats you at the drop of a hat,

358
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,667
a mom who uses you
to have an affair with your coach,

359
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:22,500
and a brother who only cares about himself.

360
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,147
Don't you dare come preach to me,
Mr. Perfect.

361
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:27,947
You like Kee, don't you?

362
00:36:31,887 --> 00:36:33,840
Anda!

363
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,573
Can you just stay out of my life?

364
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:38,280
Don't butt in.

365
00:37:09,033 --> 00:37:11,360
This is our safe-zone boundary.

366
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:16,093
I want you to be your truest self.

367
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:22,300
At home...

368
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,673
they might not understand you,

369
00:37:24,673 --> 00:37:26,760
or accept you.

370
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:30,020
But not with me.

371
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,600
Home yet?

372
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,333
Yes.

373
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,513
Why did you answer so late?

374
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:48,867
Did he say things to make you hate me?

375
00:37:49,786 --> 00:37:51,533
Not that far.

376
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:53,980
It's up to you.

377
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,340
Whatever you think of me,

378
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,320
I still feel the same about you.

379
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:07,862
I love you.

380
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,087
Aunt Ann!

381
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,840
I spilled burger sauce today...
got it all over.

382
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,340
No worries, I'll take care of it.

383
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,953
Don't soak, don't scrub.

384
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,247
- I'll hang it to dry when I'm back.
- Thank you.

385
00:38:53,653 --> 00:38:55,920
Mr. Thaleh, someone sent this for you.

386
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,340
Thanks.

387
00:39:28,273 --> 00:39:30,807
Got the burger?

388
00:39:30,807 --> 00:39:32,340
Yep.

389
00:39:34,327 --> 00:39:36,207
Hey, did you change the menu?

390
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,160
What menu change?
I told Tong to bring the one you like.

391
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,420
You remember what I like?

392
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,044
I have a good memory.

393
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:49,280
Okay.

394
00:39:52,094 --> 00:39:55,720
So, did Tong end up staying at
Teacher Aumpai's guesthouse?

395
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,440
He said he did.

396
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,257
He walked around the second floor

397
00:39:59,257 --> 00:40:02,333
and saw there's a room for
the owner up there,

398
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,333
but it's not open to guests.

399
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:08,600
Wait, so Teacher Aumpai isn't the owner?

400
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,533
She said she was last time.

401
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:15,293
Maybe there's another owner?

402
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,360
Let me check.

403
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,520
[Aumpai Guesthouse]

404
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,793
[Aumpai Guesthouse]

405
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,283
My people said that
as soon as she left the hospital,

406
00:40:56,283 --> 00:40:58,573
Seenam came straight here.

407
00:40:58,573 --> 00:41:00,593
This is where her mother lived.

408
00:41:00,593 --> 00:41:04,487
Right. And the school Aunt Nam attended
is here too.

409
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:06,693
I walked around the other day.

410
00:41:06,693 --> 00:41:09,347
Local kids said
whenever she comes to make merit,

411
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:11,640
she likes to head to the guesthouse
in the back.

412
00:41:12,827 --> 00:41:15,380
If she came here the moment she recovered,

413
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,440
this place must mean something to her.

414
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,280
Hard to believe someone like her
would forget to be cautious.

415
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:28,440
She must truly believe I forgave her.

416
00:41:29,327 --> 00:41:31,967
She did go big to save my life...

417
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:34,173
so I have to play along a bit.

418
00:41:34,173 --> 00:41:38,140
The back guesthouse has a second floor
reserved for the owner.

419
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,720
When my friend tried to go up,
the owner wouldn't allow it.

420
00:41:44,353 --> 00:41:46,247
Then let's hurry.

421
00:41:46,247 --> 00:41:50,040
Maybe today we'll find out
what Seenam's hiding from us.

422
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,887
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

423
00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:06,660
Nam, I brought you some food.

424
00:42:09,873 --> 00:42:11,833
Nam.

425
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:15,860
Nam, dear, I brought you lunch.
Are you awake?

426
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,347
Nam.

427
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:21,000
Nam.

428
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,460
Are you sleeping?

429
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:26,960
Nam.

430
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:36,307
She'll leave it at the door anyway.

431
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,700
That's rude, Nas.

432
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,093
Huh?

433
00:42:40,093 --> 00:42:43,400
I miss my girlfriend.
We haven't seen each other in ages.

434
00:42:45,444 --> 00:42:49,540
I thought you'd forgotten me
after robbing the cradle.
