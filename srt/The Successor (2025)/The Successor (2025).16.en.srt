She's accusing me of assault.

00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:17,840
- That's your problem.
- Hey!

7
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:23,062
And what can you really do about it?

8
00:00:23,062 --> 00:00:27,409
If I could fix it, I wouldn't be here, monk.

00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:30,222
Juat, call Thaleh.
Tell him to come pick me up.

No, you're staying right here.

11
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:33,858
If you go out,
you'll just cause more trouble.

12
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:36,520
So you're just gonna let them
ruin my reputation like this?

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,462
Who's the one ruining it, really?

14
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:42,800
Who kidnapped her and started all this?

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,947
Who hurt her so badly
she had to go file a police report?

16
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:47,862
But she attacked me first, monk!

17
00:00:47,862 --> 00:00:49,738
She started it!

18
00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:53,658
Two cars, both speeding toward each other.

19
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:55,471
They both end up wrecked.

Hey, where the hell are you going?

25

and you didn't get it?

I did get it.

And maybe even money laundering!

Mut isn't just your son.

85
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,649
He's the heir of Siamraphe.

I've said it before.

89
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:32,493
Siamraphe heirs are meant to build,
not destroy.

90

But Nali worked with Jaruek to ruin me.

91

Why should I rot in prison?

94
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:47,653
Because those who buy righteousness
with money can never lead.

- There are many people like that, Auntie.
- But not in Siamraphe.

The descendants of the Raphethada family
must be honest and brave.

If you're afraid that having a criminal
record will stop you from becoming a leader,

00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,080
The courage to act.

101
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,333
And everyone was willing
to give him another chance.

I already told you I'm not getting divorced.

105
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:28,840
If my sister wants to end it,
I'll file for divorce.

106
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:32,582
If there's no love, why stay together?

107
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:05,111
- Dad.
- Huh?

108
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,458
Why did you bring me here?

109
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,289
Just taking you out for a walk.

110
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,858
Get used to the place.

111
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:14,498
Because soon, Siamraphe will be ours.

112
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:17,213
What did you do this time?

113
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:22,289
Stop it, Dad.
Even if we win Siamraphe like this,

114
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,476
it won't be something to be proud of.

115
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:28,347
Calm down. I didn't do anything.

116
00:08:28,347 --> 00:08:32,196
This all started because their own family
fought among themselves, okay?

117
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:36,756
You know, maybe we should
change the color of this laminate wall.

118
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:41,813
And the flooring. Should redo that too.

119
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,071
Now, about Master Kee's case.

120
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:49,218

to the police.

00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:50,924
Don't be afraid.

00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:53,764
Wit will take care of everything.

123
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,622
Do I really have to tell them everything?

124
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:10,902
If I do, everyone will know that I...

125
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:15,738
I don't want anyone to know.

126
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:17,613
I just want to forget.

127
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,649
If I could,

128
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:26,209
I wouldn't let this happen to you either.

129
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,391
But since it already did,

130
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:36,293
you have to face it bravely and move past it.

131
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:46,084
Remember this, Dao.
No matter what society says,

132
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:52,524
I want you to know that
you are a Raphethada I'm proud of.

133
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:00,449
Anda too.

134
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:04,600
You'll turn yourself in with Dao.

135
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:15,960
Do you know why I killed him?

136
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,511
Enough, Anda.

137
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:20,689
Whoever wants to confess can confess.

138
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:22,916
But I won't let my son ruin his future.

139
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,569
I'll send Anda abroad
and let Lek's lover take the blame.

140
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:28,389
He got involved with my woman.

141
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:30,371
- He deserves it.
- I'm not letting my son go!

142
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:31,822
So you care more about your lover
than your child?

143
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:34,231
Sin, control yourself!

144
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:35,956
Your kids are sitting right here.

145
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:39,720
At this point,
who cares what's right or wrong?

146
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,622
- What's already destroyed, just let it burn.
- That's enough!

147
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:47,053
I won't let Siamraphe fall apart any further.

148
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,191

It's always about Siamraphe, isn't it?

153
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:09,698
Fine. Then let it all burn.

What do you want to order me to do next?

159
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,280
Have you ever actually
made anyone listen to you?

160
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,662
That family constitution of yours,
who even believes in it?

161
00:11:24,662 --> 00:11:27,538
Honesty. Courage.

What's the third one again, Tawan?

163
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:30,347
Faith in family.

164
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:33,347
Bullshit.

165

Of course I care about you, Anda.

169
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,404
Wrong!

170
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:51,178
See? Even that's wrong.

171
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,791
If you care about me, you'd help me.

172
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,471
Why are you sending me to prison, then?
You only care about yourself.

173
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:59,276
If I cared about myself,
why'd you even come back to work here?

174
00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:02,262
Anda, listen to me.
Calm down and put the gun down.

175
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:04,000
Ordering me again?

176
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,213
That's all you ever do. Give orders!

But don't be afraid.

00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:20,640
We won't let you face this alone.

00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:24,111
Anda, please listen to me.

182
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:27,498
I'll never abandon you.
Please, put the gun down, son.

183
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,098
Put it down.

184
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:31,307
Why are you talking so nicely to him?

185
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:33,173
Anda, put the gun down right now!

186
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:35,027
Anda!

187
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:37,716
Anda, stop. Don't!

188
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:40,796
You think you're so perfect, huh?

189
00:12:40,796 --> 00:12:43,427
Always putting me down. So righteous, right?

190
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:46,724
Mom wanted you to be CEO,
Dad always took your side.

191
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,400
No matter what you do, you're never wrong.

192
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,942
If they have you,
why would they ever need me?

193
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:52,329
Anda!

194
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:54,240
Stop this madness!

195
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:56,387
Anda!

196
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:57,840
Sin!

197
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,280
- Sin, are you okay? Pasin!
- You bastard. You shot your father?

198
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,093
Yeah. And if you don't shut up,
I'll shoot you too!

199
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:08,724
Anda, that's enough.

200
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:10,271
This has gone too far already.

201
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,720
Why are you protecting him?

202
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,213
When you were the one in trouble,
who protected you?

203
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,867
I deserve this, Anda.

204
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:21,373
I was wrong. And so are you.

205
00:13:21,373 --> 00:13:22,831
Put the gun down.

206
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:26,400
It's not too late to turn back.

207
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,796
Turn back? From what?

208
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:30,147
They're the ones who need to change!

209
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,200
You think I'm just like them, huh?

210
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,760
You think I'm worthless, don't you?

211
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,093
Anda.

212
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:37,564
Fine. Then I'll show you
how worthless I can be.

213
00:13:37,564 --> 00:13:40,391
I'll shoot them all. Every last one of them.

214
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:43,516
No heirs left for Siamraphe.
And you'll be first.

215
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:46,431
Anda, listen to me.

216
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:49,062
We really did wrong you.

217
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,893
But everyone here has their faults
and their strengths.

218
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:55,724
When Aunt Yai tried to protect Siamraphe,

219
00:13:55,724 --> 00:13:58,418
she did it for all of us.

220
00:13:58,418 --> 00:14:02,036
Her choices might not please everyone,

221
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:03,764
but I truly believe.

222
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:06,036
She's never abandoned anyone.

223
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:12,333
Don't. Please, don't!

224
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,444
Anda!

225
00:14:13,444 --> 00:14:15,018
- No, Mut. Stop!
- Anda!

226
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:16,378
Anda!

227
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:18,022
- Anda, that's enough!
- Anda!

228
00:14:18,022 --> 00:14:19,027
Anda, stop, please!

229
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:20,324
- Anda!
- Let go of me!

230
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:22,124
- Anda!
- Let me go!

231
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:25,320
- Let me go!
- Anda!

232
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,689
Anda!

233
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:28,769
- Anda, enough. I'm begging you!
- Let me go!

234
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,551
Anda, I'm sorry!

235
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,267
- Anda, I'm sorry!
- Let me go!

236
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:34,862
- Anda, please stop.
- Let me go!

237
00:14:34,862 --> 00:14:37,258
- Anda, please, I'm begging you. I'm sorry!
- Anda, please, stop, Anda!

238
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:39,671
Because you tried to protect me,
this is what happened to you.

239
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,004
I'm sorry, Anda.

240
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:44,289
Anda, I give up. Please.

241
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:46,689
Anda, let's turn ourselves in.

242
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:50,071
I'll testify.
That Master Kee deceived both of us.

243
00:14:50,071 --> 00:14:56,280
Yes, Anda, I'll do everything I can
to get justice for you and Dao.

244
00:14:56,911 --> 00:14:59,298
You both didn't do anything wrong.

245
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,689
The guilty ones shouldn't be you or Dao.

246
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:09,098
Anda.

247
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:13,018
I'm here, okay? Calm down, son.

248
00:15:13,018 --> 00:15:14,618
Calm down.

249
00:15:14,618 --> 00:15:17,644
Anda. Come to me.

250
00:15:17,644 --> 00:15:22,347
I love you, Anda. Please calm down.

251
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:24,027
I'm sorry, son.

252
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:27,769
Please calm down.

253
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:33,964
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

254
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:19,951
Oil, take care of this.

255
00:16:27,978 --> 00:16:29,524
Don't worry, Dao.

256
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:32,102
Aunt Yai's will send lawyer Wit
all the evidence.

257
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:34,138
Me and Aunt Lek will go too.

258
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:36,920
Anda.

259
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:41,502
I'm not leaving you, okay? Don't worry.

260
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:46,342
Wait. Where's Mut?

261
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:48,907
I'll find him myself.

262
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,178
Mom, Aunt Lek. You go ahead.

263
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,062
Okay, okay. Let's go.

264
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:03,800
Mut!

265
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,427
Mut!

266
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:10,684
Mut!

267
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:14,173
Mut!

268
00:17:15,707 --> 00:17:17,089
Mut!

269
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,396
Where are you?

270
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:26,098
I can't do this. I'm not strong like you.

271
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,689
Are you sure Mut ran away?

272
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:52,876
Yes, I searched the whole house. He's gone.

273
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:54,680
I called, but he won't answer.

274
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:08,213
Pat, what about the evidence
I told you to find on Nam?

275
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:10,969
Too slow.

276
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:13,880
I want everything within two days.

277
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,053
I'm not letting Nam stay
in the Raphethada family any longer.

278
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:22,898
You're going to arrest her?

279
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:27,431
What happened to Mut
started because she worked with Jaruek.

280
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:31,889
What happened with Anda and Dao.
Also because she worked with Keeta.

281
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:35,160
I will not let that woman
remain in our family another day.

282
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,533
But I doubt she'll go down quietly.

283
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,149
Then I won't go easy either.

284
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:41,467
I won't let her destroy our family
any further.

285
00:18:57,831 --> 00:19:01,400
Tawan, where's Aunt Yai and Thaleh?

286
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,991
They're talking right now.

287
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:05,787
Is there something wrong, Aunt Nam?

288
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,873
I was worried about Aunt Yai.

289
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:12,307
With everything happening to the kids,
she must be really stressed.

290
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:15,067
So I came to ask
if there's anything I can help with.

291
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:18,200
Maybe you can help by just staying still.

292
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:22,520
That's what Thaleh told me.

293
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:25,742
That's why I'm sitting here waiting.

294
00:19:25,742 --> 00:19:27,969
Would you like to sit and wait with me,
Aunt Nam?

295
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:30,871
You're such an obedient kid, huh?

296
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:33,569
Always doing what your brother tells you.

297
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:35,196
I'm a good kid.

298
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:36,827
But not a stupid one.

299
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:41,164
Otherwise, I would've invested with Kee
and ended up tricked like Anda.

300
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:44,369
I think I've got a sense
for this kind of thing.

301
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:47,213
I can tell who's good and who's not.

302
00:20:00,858 --> 00:20:02,658
That's good then.

303
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:07,253
Use that sense to help protect
the Raphethada family.

304
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,338
So, about your argument with the victim
regarding the recording.

305
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:34,889
Do you have any proof?

306
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:10,964
But in the footage,
there's a moment where you disappeared,

307
00:21:10,964 --> 00:21:13,769
and when you came back,
you attacked the victim.

308
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:17,124
Where did you go? Can you tell us?

309
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:22,640
Come on, can you tell me what happened?

310
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,600
Don't be afraid, Anda.

311
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,729
Tell the police what really happened.

312
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:30,249
If you don't talk, I can't help you.

313
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,618
What did the victim do to make you so angry?

314
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:37,293
Why did you have to kill him?

315
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:40,164
- Did you hate him that much?
- Yeah! I hated him!

316
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:43,733
He tricked me. And he raped my sister!

317
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:46,600
- So I killed him!
- Calm down, calm down.

318
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,124
Take it easy.

319
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:51,751
- Calm down, okay?
- Let go of me!

320
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:55,093
- Calm down, please. Calm down.
- So I killed him!

321
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:57,196
I killed him!

322
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,889
- Let go of me!
- Calm down, calm down.

323
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:02,796
- Let go of me!
- Get down.

324
00:22:02,796 --> 00:22:04,591
- Let go of me!
- Captain. Call an ambulance, quick!

325
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:09,369
- I killed him! I killed him! Let me go!
- Calm down, sir. Please calm down!

326
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,609
- Calm down!
- I said let me go!

327
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:12,462
Captain, hurry!

328
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,502
Scandal strikes the famous
department store heirs again.

329
00:22:27,502 --> 00:22:28,634
Last night,

330
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:33,893
lawyers brought Ms. Mukdao Raphethada
and Mr. Andaman Weerakitkamon

331
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:37,724
to turn themselves in for the murder
of the fortune teller, Master Keeta.

332
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,367
Shortly after interrogation,

333
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:44,560
Mr. Andaman suffered a violent breakdown
and was sent to the hospital.

334
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:51,524
- Excuse me.
- Let me go!

335
00:22:51,524 --> 00:22:53,787
- Why did he turn himself in just now?
- Let me go!

336
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:56,098
What was the motive behind the murder?

337
00:22:56,098 --> 00:22:58,596
Why did he kill him?
Is he faking mental illness?

338
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:00,351
Wait! Just one question!

339
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:03,569
Right now,
it's truly the darkest era of Siamraphe.

340
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:11,298
Most recently, Mr. Pasin Weerakitkamon
was hospitalized due to a gun accident.

341
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:13,320
Meanwhile, his son,
Mr. Mahasamut Weerakitkamon,

342
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,200
is still on the run
for the assault of influencer Nali.

343
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,253
Father, aren't you going to help me
or your grandchildren?

344
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:22,520
Huh?

345
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,862
Father!

346
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,391
Damn it!

347
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:31,440
How do you call that raising your grandkids?
Letting them kill people like it's nothing?

348
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,520
And with the 58th anniversary coming up,

349
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,867
we still haven't chosen
the next leader of Siamraphe.

350
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:40,360
And none of them are ready.

351
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,760
What about Thaleh?

352
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,480
With results like his, you'd make him CEO?

353
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,929
What if he ruins Siamraphe? Then what?

354
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:56,902
Then I'll bring in a professional executive
from outside.

355
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,635
Oh, easy for you to say.

356
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:03,622
If family can't handle it,
how can you trust an outsider?

357
00:24:04,524 --> 00:24:06,200
So what do you suggest, then?

358
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,880
No one inside works, no one outside works.
What's left to do?

359
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,760
That's for you to figure out, not me.

360
00:24:27,164 --> 00:24:29,662
I broke up with Mr. Jaruek's son already.

361
00:24:30,742 --> 00:24:33,484
We have to help Siamraphe survive, Uncle.

362
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,182
You? Someone who dated the enemy's son?

363
00:24:37,182 --> 00:24:39,160
And you're worried about Siamraphe?

364
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:43,964
I...

365
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:47,507
I'm sorry for my mistakes.

366
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,640
I know now that what matters most
is Siamraphe.

367
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,689
- I...
- Enough!

368
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:59,107
I was foolish once and let you deceive me.

369
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:01,849
Don't think I'll fall for it again.

370
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:05,929
You want Siamraphe that badly?

371
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:09,018
Let me tell you something.

372
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:13,169
A mistress's daughter like you
will never have it.

373
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:20,409
Uncle.

374
00:25:30,524 --> 00:25:32,724
I'm sorry.

375
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,471
Please, just give me another chance.

376
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,800
Crocodile tears.

377
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,173
I'll do everything in my power
to make sure you never lead Siamraphe.

378
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,591
Sir.

379
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,009
There's no issue with Ms. Mukdao's bail.

380
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:19,796
We have clear evidence that she was deceived
and assaulted beforehand.

381
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:22,267
And Andaman?

382
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:26,551
He had a breakdown last night,
so we sent him to the hospital.

383
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:30,658
But did the family know
that he'd been using drugs?

384
00:26:32,822 --> 00:26:35,231
- Anda?
- Yes.

385
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:36,893
This morning, the hospital confirmed.

386
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:38,751
They found narcotics in his system.

387
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:41,173
And he confessed to the doctor

388
00:26:41,173 --> 00:26:45,902
that the victim had offered him
marijuana and ketamine.

389
00:26:45,902 --> 00:26:49,778
For now, I think the best thing
is to get him into treatment first.

390
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:52,911
As for the legal case,
we'll handle that later.

391
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:56,138
And Mahasamut? Any contact from him?

392
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,759
None at all, sir.

393
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:02,440
I tried reaching out to his friends,
but no one's seen him.

394
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,631
Hello?

395
00:27:07,631 --> 00:27:09,240
What?

396
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,947
Yes. Yes, thank you.

397
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:15,453
The prison just informed us
that Mr. Prakarn has been released.

398
00:27:22,627 --> 00:27:24,511
Pat.

399
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:25,636
Yes, ma'am.

400
00:27:29,209 --> 00:27:30,920
- Go inside.
- Yes, ma'am.

401
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,191
Document?

402
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:57,444
Anda is under severe stress.

403
00:27:57,444 --> 00:28:01,840
The doctor administered Diazepam,
and he's calm for now.

404
00:28:03,111 --> 00:28:05,964
How long until my son recovers?

405
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:07,880
We can't say yet.

406
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,622
I'll head out first. Thank you.

407
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,200
Ms. Noi has arrived.
I've sent her to wait in the massage room.

408
00:29:23,524 --> 00:29:25,782
Sorry to keep you waiting.

409
00:29:26,418 --> 00:29:28,578
It's fine.

410
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,045
Please lie down.

411
00:29:38,702 --> 00:29:41,791
Oh, did you happen to see Nam
when you came in?

412
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:43,564
No, I didn't.

413
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,200
[No Signal]

414
00:30:04,907 --> 00:30:07,200
Let's stop here for today.

415
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,369
Oil. Oil.

416
00:30:10,484 --> 00:30:12,400
Call the police
to come to the house immediately.

417
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,711
- What happened?
- Just call them now!

418
00:30:53,324 --> 00:30:54,533
Wes!

419
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,120
Wes!

420
00:31:36,587 --> 00:31:38,200
Looking for this?

421
00:31:45,724 --> 00:31:48,667
You even turned off all the security cameras,

422
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:51,116
and drugged the driver.

423
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:54,951
You really want to know
why Pat came to see me?

424
00:31:54,951 --> 00:31:57,151
Not really.

425
00:31:57,151 --> 00:31:59,880
I just came to get the monthly sales summary.

426
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,164
I was going to pass it to accounting.

427
00:32:04,151 --> 00:32:06,840
This is for Klang and Chon's deaths.

428
00:32:09,138 --> 00:32:11,102
How could you do this, Nam?

429
00:32:11,102 --> 00:32:14,533
I opened my home to you.

430
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:18,142
I gave you knowledge, work, everything.

431
00:32:18,964 --> 00:32:22,551
Klang and Chon were the ones
who protected you the most!

432
00:32:23,644 --> 00:32:25,831
You didn't raise me.

433
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:29,707
You treated me like a servant.

434
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:34,604
Don't talk like I owe you anything.

435
00:32:37,058 --> 00:32:39,240
Is that all you can think of?

436
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:42,080
How disappointing.

437
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:46,529
And why did you hurt Dao and Anda?

438
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,573
Those two idiots?

439
00:32:52,316 --> 00:32:55,409
Dao was Weerin's weakness.

440
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,498
And Anda?

441
00:33:00,404 --> 00:33:02,698
That was revenge on Lek.

442
00:33:05,196 --> 00:33:08,493
Lucky for you,
Thaleh was smart enough to survive.

443
00:33:08,493 --> 00:33:11,604
Otherwise he'd have been the first to die.

444
00:33:11,604 --> 00:33:13,258
And Mut?

445
00:33:16,212 --> 00:33:18,449
He's just as rotten as his parents.

446
00:33:19,276 --> 00:33:23,124
Arrogant, thinks he's clever.

447
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:31,720
I planned to destroy all of them.

448
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,738
Because they're your hope.

449
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:43,569
You've wanted to destroy Siamraphe all along.

450
00:33:50,053 --> 00:33:52,093
You found out too late, Yai.

451
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:53,818
Too late.

452
00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:56,827
You did this to yourself.

453
00:33:56,827 --> 00:34:01,644
If the day Klang and Chon died,
you had given me the CEO position,

454
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:03,840
none of this would've happened.

455
00:34:04,818 --> 00:34:06,804
You know what? I'm right.

456
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:13,960
If I'd made you CEO,
Siamraphe wouldn't exist today.

457
00:34:15,507 --> 00:34:18,791
And what does Siamraphe have left now?

458
00:34:28,502 --> 00:34:30,591
I don't know what's left.

459
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,689
But one thing's certain.

460
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:37,373
You won't be around to see it.

461
00:34:44,827 --> 00:34:46,951
You called the police on me?

462
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,680
I should've put you in prison long ago.

463
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,964
After everything I've done,
I'm not going to jail.

464
00:34:52,964 --> 00:34:55,796
- Let go.
- Give it to me. Give it here!

465
00:34:55,796 --> 00:34:57,129
Let go!

466
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,751
Give it to me!

467
00:35:05,502 --> 00:35:07,498
Officer, this way, please!

468
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:22,978
Ms. Yai!

469
00:35:22,978 --> 00:35:24,533
Call the ambulance now!

470
00:35:24,533 --> 00:35:25,858
Ms. Yai!

471
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:31,200
Ms. Yai!

472
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:43,160
What is it, Oil?

473
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,591
Ms. Yai fell down the stairs.

474
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:46,973
They're taking her to the hospital right now.

475
00:35:46,973 --> 00:35:48,009
What?

476
00:35:48,907 --> 00:35:50,604
Yai fell?

477
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,876
Thaleh.

478
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:03,004
How is she?

479
00:36:03,004 --> 00:36:05,178
Aunt Yai fractured her ribs and wrist,

480
00:36:05,178 --> 00:36:06,818
and there's bleeding in her brain.

481
00:36:06,818 --> 00:36:08,538
She's in surgery right now.

482
00:36:09,578 --> 00:36:11,693
But because she's already
battling lung cancer,

483
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:13,347
her body's weak.

484
00:36:13,347 --> 00:36:15,964
The doctors are worried about complications.

485
00:36:17,098 --> 00:36:19,058
How did she fall?

486
00:36:19,058 --> 00:36:20,272
I don't know.

487
00:36:20,272 --> 00:36:23,729
I stepped out to wait for the police,
just as she asked.

488
00:36:23,729 --> 00:36:27,933
When I came back, she was unconscious.

489
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,111
But she had a meeting with Pat today.

490
00:36:35,716 --> 00:36:37,542
Where's Seenam?

491
00:36:38,378 --> 00:36:41,960
I saw her at the house this morning,

492
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,729
but by afternoon she was gone.

493
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,480
[Pat]

494
00:36:56,996 --> 00:36:58,600
Ms. Rin.

495
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,738
I heard Ms. Yai fell. How is she?

496
00:37:01,738 --> 00:37:02,938
Where were you?

497
00:37:02,938 --> 00:37:05,542
You went to the house, didn't you?
You're the one who hurt her, aren't you?

498
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:07,378
Wait.

499
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:09,400
Why would I hurt her?

500
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,676
I wasn't even home.

501
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:13,311
Then where were you?

502
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:16,960
She was with me.

503
00:37:18,698 --> 00:37:20,893
We had lunch together since noon.

504
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:24,978
When I got the call,
I brought her straight here.

505
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:49,080
Pat.

506
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,804
Yes.

507
00:37:56,973 --> 00:38:00,160
The security cameras in Aunt Yai's house
were cut before the incident.

508
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,347
The driver she told to stay in the house
was drugged unconscious.

509
00:38:05,347 --> 00:38:10,480
There's no way this was an accident.

510
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,173
Was she dealing with anything recently?

511
00:38:14,111 --> 00:38:19,560
She was meeting Pat
about evidence to arrest Nam.

512
00:38:20,658 --> 00:38:22,529
Arrest Nam?

513
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:23,920
For what?

514
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,582
All the recent chaos.

515
00:38:27,582 --> 00:38:29,409
Nam's been involved in every piece of it.

516
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:35,662
Both I and Yai believed Nam was working
with Jaruek to destroy Siamraphe.

517
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:41,067
But now, Yai's in the ICU.

518
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,884
No one knows when she'll wake up.

519
00:38:42,884 --> 00:38:45,009
Pat's gone missing, too.

520
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:47,120
We can't contact him at all.

521
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,942
And the evidence he had. Gone.

522
00:38:50,942 --> 00:38:54,764
If we want to charge Nam,
we need Pat's evidence.

523
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,400
If that's true,

524
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:03,320
it's possible Ms. Nam staged Ms. Yai's fall
as an accident,

525
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,231
just like with Klang and Chon.

526
00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:11,080
And Non, any updates on the plane crash?

527
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:21,716
Yes. I had experts analyze this photo.

528
00:39:21,716 --> 00:39:27,876
They said the man was wearing black gloves
not to hide fingerprints.

529
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:30,773
But because he has a prosthetic hand.

530
00:39:36,884 --> 00:39:40,053
- A prosthetic hand?
- Yes.

531
00:39:40,053 --> 00:39:45,142
And the suicide note Sek left behind,
turns out it was fake.

532
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,702
So he really was murdered to be silenced?

533
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:51,689
We're tracking the man
with the prosthetic hand now.

534
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,298
If we find him,

535
00:39:53,298 --> 00:39:56,662
we might finally uncover
who's behind all of this.

536
00:40:03,924 --> 00:40:06,267
Wit. Any sign of Pat?

537
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:10,058
Ms. Rin,
Pat's office just burned down last night.

538
00:40:10,058 --> 00:40:12,133
What? And Pat?

539
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:14,969
No one's heard from him since last night.

540
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:25,244
Mr. Jaruek.

541
00:40:29,071 --> 00:40:31,124
Here's all the evidence on Seenam

542
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:33,440
that the private investigator
managed to gather.

543
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,569
It's all in here.

544
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:39,898
As for that investigator,
if you want to meet him,

545
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:42,120
you'll have to dig him out of his grave.

546
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:45,280
Good.

547
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,080
Destroy the evidence and the witness.

548
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,240
[Destroy the evidence and the witness]

549
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,649
Thank you.

550
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:18,711
Thap.

551
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:22,760
Thank you.

552
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:32,200
Thank you, Thap.

553
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:35,849
Now I know you truly love me.

554
00:41:38,684 --> 00:41:41,560
But you really didn't mean
to hurt Ms. Yai, right?

555
00:41:48,502 --> 00:41:50,800
It was an accident, Thap.

556
00:41:56,364 --> 00:41:58,604
You called the police on me?

557
00:41:58,604 --> 00:42:01,240
I should've sent you to prison long ago.

558
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,467
I've come this far. I'm not going to jail.

559
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:07,431
- Let go!
- Give it here!

560
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:09,400
Let go!

561
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:23,618
When she fell, I panicked.

562
00:42:23,618 --> 00:42:27,347
I knew no one would believe me.

563
00:42:27,347 --> 00:42:29,729
Everyone already thinks I'm the villain.

564
00:42:29,729 --> 00:42:32,204
They just want someone to blame.

565
00:42:32,204 --> 00:42:36,000
You're all I have. So I ran to you for help.

566
00:42:38,111 --> 00:42:39,982
Thank you so much, Thap.

567
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:43,391
It's okay, Nam.

568
00:42:44,364 --> 00:42:47,747
It's my duty to protect you.

569
00:42:58,502 --> 00:42:59,884
Yes, Dad.

570
00:43:03,996 --> 00:43:05,120
Yes.
