1
00:00:00,553 --> 00:00:03,571
So the man in this photo is you, correct?

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:08,791
Yes, sir. My boss ordered me
to deliver money to Seksan.

3
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,400
Money for what?

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,853
Payment for helping conceal information
from Air Traffic Control

5
00:00:14,853 --> 00:00:18,756
on the day Mr. Nathi and Mr. Chonlathan's
plane crashed in Surat Thani.

6
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:21,262
And who is your boss?

7
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:31,644
Mr. Jaruek Techametisakul,
owner of Heaven Plaza.

8
00:00:39,698 --> 00:00:42,053
Then tell me everything from the beginning.

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,427
I'd been trying to buy that plot of land
from you long before they did.

10
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:50,440
I even offered her several times the price.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,471
I just don't understand
why you sold it to Siamraphe instead.

12
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:54,636
Hello?

13
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,951
Hello? Hello?

14
00:00:56,951 --> 00:00:58,236
Hey.

15
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:08,960
I know what happened.

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,204
But I won't let them take it that easily.

17
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:13,684
You'll have to help me.

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,143
[Notification]

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,017
[Schedule of Mr. Nathi and Mr. Chonlathan -
January 29, 2025]

20
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:34,555
[2:00 p.m., Phuket Airport.
Private flight from Phuket to Koh Phangan]

21
00:01:36,657 --> 00:01:39,831
Thap, go ahead and start the meeting.
I'll join shortly.

22
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:40,987
Yes, Father.

23
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:46,538
I've already sent all the details.

24
00:01:46,538 --> 00:01:48,240
There's nothing much.

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,636
Just make sure they use a model
without a black box.

26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,987
Got it, thank you.

27
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:58,773
Handle the rest.

28
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:00,120
Yes, sir.

29
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:05,123
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

30
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:06,849
Please, go ahead.

31
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:09,791
Hey, how's the weather in Phuket?

32
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:12,533
Full flight?

33
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:20,240
Good, good. Stick to the plan.
All according to plan.

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,533
Hey.

35
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,724
- Hey.
- Nop!

36
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:26,082
Get an ambulance!

37
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:28,093
Nop!

38
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:29,291
Hey.

39
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:31,660
Hang in there.

40
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:34,753
- Undo his buttons!
- Okay, okay. Buttons undone.

41
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:37,142
Nop, breathe slowly. Calm down, Nop.

42
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:11,116
- Captain?
- Captain, are you okay?

43
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:12,240
Captain, are you okay?

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,700
I don't feel well. I can't breathe...

45
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,793
- Captain?
- Captain?

46
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:18,722
Captain! Captain, wake up!

47
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:20,338
- Hey, Captain!
- Captain!

48
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:21,500
- Wake up!
- Wake up! Captain!

49
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,584
- Captain!
- Captain!

50
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,504
Captain!

51
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,280
Cyanide?

52
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:29,800
So, was Seksan's death connected to you?

53
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,480
Yes.

54
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:36,040
I found out he was deep in debt.

55
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:40,473
So Mr. Jaruek told me to bribe him,

56
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:48,520
so he'd tell everyone that he hadn't
contacted the pilot on the day of the crash.

57
00:03:49,336 --> 00:03:52,484
After everything went as planned,

58
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:54,962
I went back to silence him.

59
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,320
Seksan, wake up!

60
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,593
Sek!

61
00:04:07,593 --> 00:04:08,864
Is Seksan okay?

62
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:12,011
I don't know, sir. He was fine one minute,
then suddenly collapsed.

63
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,880
No pulse.

64
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:17,956
After you poisoned Seksan,

65
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:23,647
you placed a suicide note and a bottle
of pills in his desk drawer, didn't you?

66
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,667
Yes, sir.

67
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:29,509
And do you know who gave Khun Jaruek
the flight information

68
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:33,198
and other insider data from Siamraphe?

69
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:35,120
Ms. Seenam.

70
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:44,338
Thaleh.

71
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:45,558
Thaleh!

72
00:04:45,558 --> 00:04:47,429
Thaleh.

73
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:50,191
Wait. Where are you going?

74
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:51,698
I'm going after Aunt Nam.

75
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:53,951
She killed Dad and Chon!

76
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:55,836
Wait for Uncle Non first.

77
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:59,504
You're the only heir Siamraphe has left now!

78
00:05:02,993 --> 00:05:04,931
- Non!
- Uncle Non!

79
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:07,309
Can we arrest Seenam and Jaruek today?

80
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:08,591
Not yet.

81
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:11,122
We have to gather more evidence first.

82
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:15,624
Thaleh, wait!

83
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:16,949
Stop!

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,882
[Mom]

85
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,038

[Juat]

88
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,616
Hello, Mom called you, didn't she?

89
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:56,747
Yes.

90
00:05:56,747 --> 00:06:00,022
And you didn't pick up because
you were afraid she'd stop you, right?

91
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:03,011
They killed Dad and Chon.

92
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:05,033
Revenge, huh?

93
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:07,400
It's powerful.
It makes you forget your mother, your family,

94
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,760
everything you've been through.

95
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:15,180
If you go for revenge, you won't hurt them.

96
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,920
You'll hurt your mother.

97
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:22,271
She only has you left, Thaleh.
You're all she has to hold on to.

98
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:25,822
Don't let your anger hurt her again.

99
00:06:35,773 --> 00:06:39,338
Thank you, for reminding me.

100
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,440
I really did forget myself.

101
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,196
Remember this, Thaleh.

102
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,818
Be mindful,
like a gatekeeper guarding your heart.

103
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:51,302
No matter what comes your way,
don't let it slip easily inside.

104
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:53,333
Don't let emotions carry your mind away.

105
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:56,849
And don't let what touches your heart
take control, right?

106
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:00,769
I remember your teachings.

107
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:03,413
Thank you again.

108
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,381
[Mom]

109
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:12,200
Hello, Mom.

110
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:16,604
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,987
Don't act impulsively, son.

112
00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:21,778
Non told me they can't arrest anyone yet

113
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:26,276
because the evidence
only points to Chai as Seksan's killer.

114
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:30,284
It doesn't directly connect
to Jaruek or Seenam.

115
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,302
We need more solid proof.

116
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:35,978
If we go after them now,
or if they sense something,

117
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:38,311
they might escape prosecution.

118
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:39,800
I understand, Mom.

119
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:43,018
I'll head back right away.

120
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,342
Okay.

121
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,650
[Mahasamut]

122
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:57,418
What's up, Mut?

123
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:26,742
Why did you go to Aunt Yai's house?

124
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:28,569
Aunt Yai still hasn't woken up,

125
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:30,658
so we went to get a sacred amulet for her.

126
00:08:30,658 --> 00:08:31,880
An amulet?

127
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:39,649
Is there anything else
you're suspicious about, Seenam?

128
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,533
We're going to visit Aunt Yai now.

129
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:46,400
Ms. Yai.

130
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,107
Is her condition getting worse?

131
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:51,351
Yes, my mother's been worried sick.

132
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:26,960
Yesterday, when I went to Aunt Yai's house
for the amulet,

133
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,156
I ran into Aunt Nam.

134
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:31,600
So I told her about Aunt Yai's condition.

135
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,818
Then why are you all standing here?

136
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:38,164
Is she alright?

137
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:42,667
- Are you cursing my sister now?
- Lek, calm down!

138
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:47,080
We don't know yet. The doctor's checking.

139
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:51,680
Please, come in.

140
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:59,000
Doctor, how's her condition?

141
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,436
Her lung cancer
has weakened her immune system.

142
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,040
Since she's been bedridden for so long,

143
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:10,151
there's a high risk of a lung infection,

144
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,427
which could cause sudden heart failure.

145
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:20,720
You should prepare yourselves.

146
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:24,587
Yai.

147
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,787
Please don't leave us.

148
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,756
You have to wake up.

149
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:31,662
Please, stay with us.

150
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:39,840
I'd like to ask everyone
to keep this matter confidential for now.

151
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,116
Siamraphe's situation is already unstable.

152
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:46,689
If word gets out,
it'll only make things worse.

153
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:50,733
Yes.

154
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,013
I have good news.

155
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:12,364
Ms. Yai is in a coma.

156
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:14,022
Near death.

157
00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:18,142
And I have good news too.

158
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:20,276
My source says,

159
00:11:20,276 --> 00:11:23,520
the court is about to
lift the temporary injunction.

160
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,836
You can prepare to sell Siamraphe.

161
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:30,840
What are you doing, Father?

162
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:35,898
Dernthap.

163
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:40,258
Even though Siamraphe is ours,

164
00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:43,240
I want you to break up with Seenam.

165
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:49,289
But she's the mother of my child.

166
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:52,947
Seenam isn't fit
to be anyone's wife or mother.

167
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:56,116
I don't want a daughter-in-law I can't trust.

168
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,693
Think about it.

169
00:11:57,693 --> 00:12:00,964
If she could betray her own family,

170
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:03,751
what makes you think
she wouldn't betray ours?

171
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:04,920
Fine.

172
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:07,613
If you don't approve of her,

173
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:11,720
after we get married, I'll move with Seenam
and our child to Germany with Mom.

174
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,080
No. You must stay here in Thailand.
I need your help.

175
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,618
I understand you.

176
00:12:19,618 --> 00:12:22,062
I really understand.

177
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:24,893
I really do. You love your child.

178
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:27,160
Just like I love you.

179
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,027
Okay, here's what you'll do.

180
00:12:30,027 --> 00:12:33,951
Once Seenam gives birth,
you'll take the child and raise it yourself.

181
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:36,213
Then find a new wife.

182
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,782
There are plenty of women
who are beautiful, smart,

183
00:12:38,782 --> 00:12:40,556
and capable, just like her.

184
00:12:40,556 --> 00:12:43,320
Build a proper family.

185
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:56,076
- Is it confirmed?
- Lawyer Wit checked with the court.

186
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,529
The temporary injunction
was officially lifted this morning.

187
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,982
And suddenly, news broke that

188
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:02,124
Ms. Nam has already signed the deal
to sell Siamraphe.

189
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:03,240
What?

190
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,831
Where is Aunt Nam now?

191
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,564
She's at the 58th Anniversary event,
in the conference hall.

192
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:13,027
Thaleh!

193
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:18,120
Thaleh!

194
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:20,111
Hey...

195
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:25,511
You really sold Siamraphe, didn't you?

196
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:27,667
You make it sound so dramatic, Thaleh.

197
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:30,809
All we did was open the door
for a partner company to join our management.

198
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,502
So that our business can grow further.

199
00:13:34,284 --> 00:13:36,040
Who did you sell it to?

200
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:41,244
You'll find out soon enough.
At the 58th Anniversary celebration.

201
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:44,689
Anything else?
I'd like to continue the meeting.

202
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:50,351
Thaleh!

203
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:51,827
Let her go.

204
00:13:53,982 --> 00:13:55,596
Thaleh!

205
00:13:55,596 --> 00:13:57,084

Thaleh.

209
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:24,364
I know you're angry, son.
I want to deal with Seenam too.

210
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,556
But not today.

211
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:27,969
But she's already sold Siamraphe, Mom.

212
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:30,618
Can we really get it back?

213
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,578
We will. I believe we can.

214
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:35,747
But you have to be patient.

215
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:41,320
Once we have all the evidence,
we'll reclaim Siamraphe.

216
00:14:46,413 --> 00:14:48,818
Thaleh, what are you planning to do?

217
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:51,889
I can't just stand by
and let her take Siamraphe.

218
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,298
The new owner of Siamraphe is your father,
isn't it?

219
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:14,351
I think so.

220
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:17,991
But I'll tell you this.
I don't agree with his methods.

221
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:20,871
Then that means you still want to play fair.

222
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:23,996
On Siamraphe's 58th Anniversary,

223
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:26,133
I'll help you expose Nam and my father.

224
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,022
You'd really send your own father
and your lover to prison?

225
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:30,156
I have to.

226
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:31,511
Why?

227
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:33,316
You don't need to know that.

228
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:35,160
Just know that I'll help you.

229
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,333
But I have one condition.

230
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,782
Don't hurt Nam.

231
00:15:39,782 --> 00:15:41,987
You're still defending her?

232
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,213
That criminal you're mentioning...
She's my wife...

233
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:48,973
And I'll protect her, no matter what.

234
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:03,040
Fine. Then everything will go by the law.

235
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:19,987
The 58th Anniversary celebration
will be held at Siamraphe Hall.

236
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:22,489
There'll be food stalls
surrounding the venue.

237
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:27,449
Aunt Nam will probably be sitting in front,
next to the new owner.

238
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:33,022
How do you know the son of Jaruek
would actually turn on his father?

239
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:38,120
I don't know how, but I believe he will.

240
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:42,276
Still, we can't rely only on him.

241
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:44,804
We need to prepare everything we have.

242
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:49,258
Sin, don't forget to prepare your men too.

243
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,822
Don't worry.

244
00:16:50,822 --> 00:16:53,773
Force is my specialty.

245
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:59,396
I believe that If we work together,

246
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:01,724
we'll take Nam down for sure.

247
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:31,778
Pour me a glass.

58 years.

249
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:47,498
You think Grandpa would be angry at us?

250
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,400
Then he should've started yelling
when I went to jail.

251
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,764
Do you think

252
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:58,880
this will all end with our generation,
like how Jaruek always said about Aunt Yai?

253
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,702
You scared?

254
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,440
Don't mess with me.

255
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:14,733
I'm not giving up.

256
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:18,702
By the end of this,
both of them will rot in jail.

257
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,920
What about your case?

258
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,569
You think I'll run away again?

259
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,120
Don't tease me.

260
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:38,071
I'll fight to the end.

261
00:18:39,324 --> 00:18:41,684
But if I do end up in prison,

262
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:43,622
I'm leaving Siamraphe in your hands for now.

263
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:48,351
You're giving me Siamraphe?

264
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,467
I said leaving it in your care.

265
00:18:54,204 --> 00:18:55,942
Then come back soon.

58th Anniversary celebration of Siamraphe.

The atmosphere is filled with
high-profile guests from every industry,

including celebrities, socialites, artists,

272

and top influencers from across Thailand,
all gathered here tonight

273

to witness a historic new chapter
for Siamraphe.

274

Most importantly,
everyone is waiting for the answer.

275
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,240
Has Siamraphe truly changed hands?

276

Mr. Jaruek! Mr. Jaruek!

Your presence here at Siamraphe's event,

279
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:09,840
is it related to the rumor
that the company has changed ownership?

280
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,227
Let's just say there'll be a surprise
for everyone tonight.

Let me go.

I don't want my child to grow up
in the kind of world you and Nam have built.

302
00:22:55,369 --> 00:23:00,298
So I was wrong to let you grow up
with your mother then, huh?

That's why you've never thought like me.
Not once!

Why?

Don't you see? Everything I've done will
one day be yours. Yours and your child's!

I don't want it if it comes this way, Dad.

359
00:26:05,956 --> 00:26:07,907
Let's see if you can last.

360
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:11,080
Here's a tip.

361
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:16,391
You'll be next.

362
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:35,797
Hey, this route didn't work.

363
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:38,685
I'll handle it myself.

364
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:40,396
Drive straight into the event.

365
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:22,280
Where's Thap?

366
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:27,169
Something urgent came up,
so he went back to the office first.

367
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:42,485
Welcome, everyone,

368
00:27:42,485 --> 00:27:45,262
to the 58th Anniversary Celebration
of Siamraphe.

369
00:27:45,262 --> 00:27:47,996
For more than five decades,
we've stood strong.

370
00:27:47,996 --> 00:27:51,378
Siamraphe isn't just a shopping mall,

371
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:56,080
but a piece of history,
a place filled with people's memories.

372
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,507
Now, please welcome the acting Chairwoman,
Ms. Seenam Raphethada.

373
00:28:15,124 --> 00:28:19,124
Thank you, everyone, for being here today.

374
00:28:19,124 --> 00:28:22,720
Thank you for loving Siamraphe.

375
00:28:24,658 --> 00:28:29,347
I still remember
the first day I stepped in here.

376
00:28:29,347 --> 00:28:30,924
This place...

377
00:28:32,236 --> 00:28:33,800
has built lives,

378
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,320
brought smiles, and created memories.

379
00:28:40,227 --> 00:28:42,902
We've been through so much together.

380
00:28:42,902 --> 00:28:47,511
Economic crises, global changes...

381
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:49,996
and yet, we've survived.

382
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:56,044
Today marks a new chapter
in Siamraphe's history.

383
00:28:56,044 --> 00:28:58,133
We won't stay stagnant.

384
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,458
And for the mall to have a better future,

385
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:03,853
I must do what no one else
has dared to do before.

386
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,160
I hereby transfer management rights,

387
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,956
opening the way for a new investor
to lead Siamraphe

388
00:29:44,956 --> 00:29:47,236
into its next legendary era.

389
00:29:47,236 --> 00:29:52,542
Please welcome the new Chairman of Siamraphe,

390
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:56,191
Mr. Jaruek Techametheesakul.

391
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:57,600
Please, come on stage.

392
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,396
[Raphe Heaven Plaza]

393
00:31:07,413 --> 00:31:11,018
From the bottom of my heart,
I never imagined

394
00:31:11,018 --> 00:31:17,747
that one day, the man once standing outside
looking into Siamraphe

395
00:31:17,747 --> 00:31:22,027
would now stand here as its full owner.

396
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:25,516
Alright, I'll try not to talk about the past.

397
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:31,289
It wouldn't be polite to those
who've been here a long time

398
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:34,267
and who will soon be leaving.

399
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,271
But I promise you this.

400
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:46,018
Under my leadership,
Siamraphe will not be the same.

401
00:31:46,018 --> 00:31:49,018
It will be better.

402
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,769
If you want to sell Siamraphe,

403
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:00,191
the first thing you need is a buyer,

404
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:02,716
and a price that satisfies everyone.

405
00:32:02,716 --> 00:32:05,036
I'll take care of that.

406
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:08,964
But you need to make sure
the board votes to approve the sale.

407
00:32:08,964 --> 00:32:11,360
Of course. It'll pass.

408
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,916
I have my people on the board.

409
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:16,147
And I'll handle the legal
and financial advisors.

410
00:32:16,147 --> 00:32:18,520
Once the contract is ready,
we'll sign immediately.

411
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,320
[Control Room]

412
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,538
- You can't go in here.
- Get out of my way!

413
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,218
Where did he go?

414
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:39,493
The sale only becomes official once the money
and ownership are legally transferred.

415
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:44,422
We must sell Siamraphe before Ms. Yai
wakes up and tells everyone the truth.

416
00:32:54,413 --> 00:32:57,307
- Ms. Yai.
- Ms. Yai.

417
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,891
Nice speech.

418
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:15,745
But it's too late, because I'm back.

419
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,871
What the...

420
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:36,004
Get the reporters out!

421
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:37,471
Take them out!

422
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:57,018
I think everyone here recognizes that voice.

423
00:33:57,018 --> 00:34:02,916
These two are the ones
behind all the chaos at Siamraphe.

424
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:06,249
And Seenam is the one
who pushed me down the stairs!

425
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:18,796
You called the police on me?

426
00:34:18,796 --> 00:34:21,400
I should've had you locked up
a long time ago.

427
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,702
After everything I've done,
I'm not going to prison!

428
00:34:24,702 --> 00:34:26,996
- Let go!
- Give that to me!

429
00:34:26,996 --> 00:34:28,898
No. Let go!

430
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:31,756
Give it!

431
00:34:39,464 --> 00:34:42,335
Give me those documents!

432
00:34:59,956 --> 00:35:02,960
They stole the evidence
I was going to use against them

433
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,102
and forged documents
to appoint themselves CEO.

434
00:35:07,102 --> 00:35:13,102
Therefore, any transaction Seenam made as CEO
is legally void.

435
00:35:14,396 --> 00:35:15,511
Is that true, Mr. Jaruek?

436
00:35:15,511 --> 00:35:16,987
Ms. Seenam, why did you do this?

437
00:35:16,987 --> 00:35:20,098
- How long have you two been planning this?
- Hey, no filming!

438
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:24,560
Please answer! Please!

439
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,240
Where are you rushing off to?

440
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,880
The event isn't over yet.

441
00:35:34,093 --> 00:35:36,151
When did Ms. Yai wake up?

442
00:35:38,147 --> 00:35:39,920
Surprised?

443
00:35:56,462 --> 00:35:58,591
I turned myself in, just like Aunt Yai asked.

444
00:35:59,516 --> 00:36:01,658
I won't run anymore.

445
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:04,311
I'll make sure the people
who destroyed our family

446
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:06,284
are removed from Siamraphe.

447
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,827
Aunt Yai.

448
00:36:23,827 --> 00:36:26,409
- Aunt Yai.
- Yai.

449
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:28,204
I'll get the doctor!

450
00:36:39,538 --> 00:36:42,960
Overall, Khun Yai's condition
has improved significantly.

451
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,662
Her body is responding well.

452
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:49,720
Blood pressure and breathing
are nearly back to normal.

453
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,960
It's a very good sign.

454
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:57,649
How long until she can speak again?

455
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:00,453
If recovery continues this fast,

456
00:37:00,453 --> 00:37:03,151
she should be able to talk
in two or three days.

457
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:06,693
Thank you.

458
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,200
Do you need anything?

459
00:37:37,613 --> 00:37:39,120
What was that?

460
00:37:44,502 --> 00:37:46,213
Wait, Aunt Yai.

461
00:37:50,462 --> 00:37:52,387
Alright, type it out for me.

462
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,324
[Wooden flash drive in Jenga at home]

463
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,613
What is it, Mut?

464
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:34,982
I know where Aunt Yai
hid the evidence about Mr. Pat.

465
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:36,164
She told you?

466
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:40,378
Yeah. It's in a wooden flash drive
hidden inside a Jenga set at her house.

467
00:38:40,378 --> 00:38:43,578
Aunt Nam probably hasn't reached it yet,
so I'll go first.

468
00:38:43,578 --> 00:38:44,720
Got it.

469
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,689
Aunt Yai has several Jenga sets.

470
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:03,124
We'll need to split up and look.

471
00:39:03,124 --> 00:39:05,258
You two search her bedroom.

472
00:39:05,258 --> 00:39:06,853
I'll check the office.

473
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:24,844
Nothing in her room.

474
00:40:24,844 --> 00:40:26,138
Nothing in the office either.

475
00:40:26,138 --> 00:40:28,982
Where does she usually play Jenga?

476
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,383
Hurry.

477
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:27,889
Found it!

478
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:41,920
Tawan, get ready.

479
00:41:51,834 --> 00:41:53,707
Why did you go to Ms. Yai's house?

480
00:41:53,707 --> 00:41:55,502
She still hasn't woken up,

481
00:41:55,502 --> 00:41:57,596
so we went to get a sacred amulet for her.

482
00:41:57,596 --> 00:41:58,773
An amulet?

483
00:42:04,218 --> 00:42:06,569
Anything else you're curious about, Aunt Nam?

484
00:42:06,569 --> 00:42:08,493
We are heading to see Aunt Yai now.

485
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,289
Ms. Yai.

486
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:15,062
Is she getting worse?

487
00:42:15,062 --> 00:42:18,271
Yes. Mom's really worried.

488
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:32,751
Good thing you told me
to bring the amulet.

489
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:35,089
I was afraid we'd run into
Aunt Nam like this.

490
00:42:46,591 --> 00:42:49,316
A mistake this small...
how could you miss it? So stupid.

491
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,769
You're even dumber for trusting me.
