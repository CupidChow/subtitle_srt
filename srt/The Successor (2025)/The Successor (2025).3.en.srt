- It's not that...
- Then that means you're glad, right?

00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,413
And the downside?

180
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:09,682
It's expensive.

181
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:11,322
Budget is extremely high,

182
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:14,802
and we'll constantly need to update
with the latest trends.

183
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,089
Most importantly...

184
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,916
it can be copied easily.

185
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:24,156
And once it's copied, the uniqueness is gone.

186
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:32,722
If Siamraphe is to become
a magnet destination, in my view...

187
00:18:32,722 --> 00:18:34,776
it'll be exhausting.

188
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:37,031
And what about Thaleh's project?

189
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:39,133
He's done his homework well.

190
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:43,809
Hard to believe he was away for three years
and still kept up with the world.

191
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:46,707
Of course, the budget is also high,

192
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:49,578
and payback will take time.

193
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:52,507
But the clear difference is...

194
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:57,070
Thaleh's plan can increase efficiency
and reduce long-term costs.

195
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,236
That's a major strength.

196
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:01,671
I'm concerned about the food court.

197
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:03,364
If it's revamped this much,

198
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:06,471
both tenants and customers
may struggle to keep up.

199
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:11,342
And the heavier the reliance on technology,
if a problem ever arises,

200
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:13,960
it'll be a huge issue.

201
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:18,480
If you're worried,
would you like me to support both of them?

202
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,129
Thank you.

203
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:31,307
Please keep an eye on those two.

204
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:35,284
Siamraphe's future will depend on them.

205
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:38,669
Gladly.

206
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:48,547
Non, are you sure there's no mistake?

207
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:49,916
I'm sure.

208
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,524
The leasing company said Klang's usual plane
had mechanical issues,

209
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:55,480
so it was suddenly replaced.

210
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,502
And the replacement model
didn't have a black box.

211
00:19:58,502 --> 00:20:01,382
That's why we still don't know
the cause of the crash.

212
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:04,951
And Rin never knew?

213
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:08,711
Not at all. If anything had happened,
he would have told her.

214
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:11,813
But neither she nor Jom knew anything.

215
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:14,400
That's why I wanted to talk to
the air traffic controller...

216
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,720
the last person to speak with the pilot.

217
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,618
He said when the plane went down,
there was no contact from the pilot at all.

218
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:23,778
Something's strange.
That's why I asked you to come with me.

219
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:25,858
AED! AED!

220
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,649
- Is AED here? Hurry up, AED!
- Where is it?

221
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:30,000
Hurry!

222
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,840
Sek! Sek!

223
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,209
Sek!

224
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,609
- Quick, quick!
- Turn it on!

225
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:39,324
Sek, wake up!

226
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:40,627
Sek!

227
00:20:40,627 --> 00:20:41,787
What happened?

228
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:45,360
I don't know, he was just sitting there
and suddenly had a seizure and collapsed.

229
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,236
Sek, wake up!

230
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:49,067
Sek!

231
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:50,529
Sek, wake up!

232
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:51,800
Sek!

233
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,164
Hey!

234
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:54,924
He has no pulse!

235
00:20:56,093 --> 00:20:58,458
- Call an ambulance... fast!
- I'll get them!

236
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,818
Hurry!

237
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:03,804
Sek, wake up!

238
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,760
Who is he, Non?

239
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,498
Sekson, the ATC officer
we were supposed to meet.

240
00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:15,511
Sek, don't go still on me! Wake up!

241
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:18,618
Sek, wake up!

242
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:22,791
Hello, Ms. Yai.

243
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,960
The abbot is returning now.
I've prepared the offerings.

244
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,720
Please, this way.

245
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:39,702
Hello, Ms. Yai.

246
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:41,471
Here to make merit?

247
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:45,133
I came here for my father.

248
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:47,480
I came to bring him good news.

249
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:51,569
- Alright then, I'll wait downstairs.
- No need.

250
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:53,422
I've finished my rituals.

251
00:21:53,422 --> 00:21:55,058
I'll wait here with you.

252
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,480
I wanted to tell you,
I'm sorry about Lady Amorn.

253
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,022
The land you wanted from her,
to build Asia's biggest complex...

254
00:22:06,022 --> 00:22:10,667
What I wanted to tell you is...

255
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,404
I'll be the one doing it.

256
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:17,480
She sold the land to you?

257
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,458
Signed just yesterday.

258
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:23,004
Amazing how nothing in this world is certain.

259
00:22:23,004 --> 00:22:25,111
Surely you're used to that by now.

260
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:29,093
Probably.
Just like you're used to your little tricks.

261
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:32,707
Hey, hey, calm down... don't be angry.

262
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,204
I only used the same method
your father used against mine.

263
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:49,187
Think what you will.

264
00:22:49,187 --> 00:22:53,778
But to me, it's the way of losers

265
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:56,884
always blaming the winners.

266
00:22:57,516 --> 00:22:59,373
Go ahead.

267
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:01,556
I agree.

268
00:23:01,556 --> 00:23:03,756
I want you to win.

269
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:07,938
But do you know what I see
when I look at Siamraphe?

270
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:14,284
I see a sick old man.

271
00:23:15,044 --> 00:23:19,929
I see a foolish woman.

272
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:26,400
I see a useless child being
pushed up as heir.

273
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:30,804
And in the end,

274
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:38,142
I see Siamraphe collapsing in your era.

275
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:03,947
Next time you run, invite me too.

276
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:09,520
You okay?

277
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,729
Yeah. Just thinking how
you probably won't wake up.

278
00:24:12,729 --> 00:24:15,222
Back then, even Chon couldn't get you up.

279
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:18,444
Guess I'm used to it now.

280
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:21,013
In there, I had to wake up at 5 AM.

281
00:24:21,013 --> 00:24:24,004
And at the temple, 4 AM.

282
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:29,413
Aunt Yai has approved my plan
to revamp the mall.

283
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:32,324
I'll start with the Food Court.

284
00:24:32,324 --> 00:24:34,018
How are you going to change it?

285
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,865
- Hey...
- If you want to know,

286
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:38,058
then catch me first!

287
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:41,058
Thaleh, give it back!

288
00:24:41,058 --> 00:24:42,400
Come on, hurry!

289
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,502
- Thaleh!
- Catch me.

290
00:24:44,502 --> 00:24:47,209
Give it back!

291
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:48,707
Give it back!

292
00:24:48,707 --> 00:24:50,178
Follow me!

293
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,822
Hold him, Auntie Nam!

294
00:24:53,822 --> 00:24:54,853
Morning, Auntie Nam.

295
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:56,711
What are you up to now, Thaleh?

296
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:58,844
Give it back!

297
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:00,333
Catch me then!

298
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:02,364
Ouch!

299
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:05,812
Dao!

300
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,338
Are you okay?

301
00:25:12,142 --> 00:25:15,649
Alright, fine. I'll make it more modern.

302
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:21,689
Okay.

303
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:26,448
If you want the details,
I'll send them later.

304
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,098
Anyway, your shop isn't
in the Food Court, Dao.

305
00:25:29,098 --> 00:25:30,933
It won't be affected.

306
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:34,040
Dao.

307
00:25:40,013 --> 00:25:41,564
Cyanide?

308
00:25:41,564 --> 00:25:42,853
Yes.

309
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:46,124
The doctor confirmed
Mr. Sek died from cyanide poisoning.

310
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:50,347
His coworkers found a bottle
and a suicide note in his desk drawer.

311
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:53,204
So it was suicide?

312
00:25:53,204 --> 00:25:55,364
That's the preliminary assumption.

313
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:57,587
But I think it's suspicious.

314
00:25:57,587 --> 00:25:59,509
I'll dig deeper.

315
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:02,853
The sudden plane switch...

316
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:06,867
and now an ATC officer's death.

317
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:09,422
Do you think they're connected?

318
00:26:09,422 --> 00:26:11,391
I don't want to stress you out,

319
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:14,902
but it's starting to look like
this wasn't just an accident.

320
00:26:14,902 --> 00:26:19,516
I'll gather as much evidence as I can
and report back soon.

321
00:26:19,516 --> 00:26:23,591
Thank you, Non. Keep me updated.

322
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:25,036
Yes, Rin.

323
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:31,711
Everyone has received the email
about the Food Court renovation.

324
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:36,987
As stated,
it will be renovated within one month.

325
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:39,791
So we need to renegotiate all contracts.

326
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:45,884
I'm Pancheeva from My Fav Burger.

327
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:49,840
The email says we have to rebuild our shop,
redecorate to look modern,

328
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,951
introduce QR codes and manage food waste.

329
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:58,200
Small shops like ours can't afford that.

330
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:02,476
The email did mention
if anyone's not okay with the conditions,

331
00:27:02,476 --> 00:27:04,502
we also offered a food truck area
behind the mall.

332
00:27:04,502 --> 00:27:07,987
But it's far, hot, and has no bathrooms.

333
00:27:07,987 --> 00:27:10,560
What customers would go there?

334
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,187
This is basically pushing us out.

335
00:27:13,187 --> 00:27:18,489
But I support it.
I've wanted renovations for years.

336
00:27:30,902 --> 00:27:33,382
We need to move quickly.

337
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:37,596
I want answers by the end of today.

338
00:27:37,596 --> 00:27:42,556
If you're still not okay,
we'll pay compensation.

339
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:44,258
How much?

340
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:50,240
You're My Fav Burger, right?

341
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,902
You have one year left on your lease.

342
00:27:52,902 --> 00:27:56,960
By contract,
compensation is three times the rent.

343
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,600
I'll pay you 150,000 baht.

344
00:28:19,227 --> 00:28:21,569
Tawan!

345
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,271
Tawan!

346
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:24,773
Tawan!

347
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,044
Look, the mall is trending again.

348
00:28:29,044 --> 00:28:30,262
Where?

349
00:28:30,262 --> 00:28:32,706
Small shops matter.
Poor people deserve to live.

350
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:34,747
Siamraphe bullies the poor.

351
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:35,982
What?

352
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:37,676
They're even attacking your shop, Dao.

353
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:39,151
What?

354
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:42,556
"Kicking out others
but keeping their relative's shop".

355
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:46,702
"Bad food, overpriced, yet still here".

356
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,440
They even posted a picture of my shop!

357
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:54,587
"One toast costs as much as
three rice meals".

358
00:28:54,587 --> 00:28:56,578
Hey! That's not fair.

359
00:28:56,578 --> 00:28:59,418
Thaleh said my shop wouldn't be affected.

360
00:28:59,418 --> 00:29:01,791
Dao, stop reading.

361
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:03,582
Dao, don't type!

362
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:05,662
[Then go buy rice.]
Why are you typing this?

363
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:08,040
Why not? I'm not guilty.

364
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,840
- My shop has nothing to do with this.
- Yes, you're not guilty, but if you type,

365
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,209
- Go away! Stop, Tawan.
- you'll make yourself guilty.

366
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,484
- Stop!
- Dao, enough.

367
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:16,622
Stop! Stop!

368
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:19,956
Dao, Tawan, what are you two fighting about?

369
00:29:19,956 --> 00:29:24,671
Thaleh, your Food Court plan is
causing people to attack my shop online!

370
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:27,400
They're angry because they don't understand.

371
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,120
I'll handle it.

372
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,411
You don't need to respond.

373
00:29:30,411 --> 00:29:33,080
If we stay quiet, it'll blow over.

374
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,935
Are you really going to stop, Mom?

375
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:37,147

How many times have I told you...
why won't you listen?

379
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,302
Delete it right now.

380
00:29:52,604 --> 00:29:55,831
Delete it, Dao!

381
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,267
It's too late, Mom.

382
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:04,107
Everyone's already screenshot it.

383
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:28,756
150,000 isn't enough.

384
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:31,840
We've worked here for years.

385
00:30:33,227 --> 00:30:38,058
What's am I supposed to do now?
They still see us as just tenants in the end.

386
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:42,560
And what about the stock we ordered?

387
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,858
Where are we supposed to sell
if we don't have a shop?

388
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:49,542
And then we'll be evicted from our home too.

389
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:51,960
God, what is happening?

390
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,080
Auntie!

391
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:06,653
What are you doing?

392
00:31:06,653 --> 00:31:09,116
This country only moves
when people call out injustice.

393
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:12,942
They need to see
they can't just bully the poor.

394
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:18,911
Then live stream somewhere else!
Why here, in front of Pong?

395
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:24,360
Why? Because people need to see
who gets hurt by this.

396
00:31:25,956 --> 00:31:28,969
Didn't you say you'd only live stream
to sell snacks?

397
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:30,938
And what then?

398
00:31:30,938 --> 00:31:33,280
If your shop gets evicted,

399
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,267
how are you going to pay
for Pong's treatment?

400
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:37,978
Move aside.

401
00:31:37,978 --> 00:31:39,484
Move!

402
00:31:46,044 --> 00:31:47,378
Auntie!

403
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:49,107
Auntie!

404
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,409
Quiet.

00:31:59,938 --> 00:32:04,880
I don't know why life
keeps throwing things at me.

407
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,458
I don't know what I did to deserve this.

408
00:32:08,173 --> 00:32:11,636
We've lived in this house
for over twenty years.

409
00:32:11,636 --> 00:32:14,142
And suddenly we're being evicted.

410
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,862
As if that's not enough,
we can't even find a new home.

411
00:32:16,862 --> 00:32:18,782
And Cheeva...

412
00:32:18,782 --> 00:32:25,369
her burger shop
is being forced out of the mall too.

413
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:28,516
The poor don't have many choices.

414
00:32:28,516 --> 00:32:35,644
Now, my only income is selling snacks
in these live streams.

415
00:32:35,644 --> 00:32:41,698
So if anyone wants to help...
if you want to support Pong's treatment,

416
00:32:41,698 --> 00:32:44,684
please order.

417
00:32:44,684 --> 00:32:46,124
The mall's name?

418
00:32:46,124 --> 00:32:51,769
I can't say it...
otherwise Cheeva will be in trouble.

You money-hungry bastards!

How can you do this to us?

Are you okay?

437
00:35:45,147 --> 00:35:48,036
We won't stand for this!

438
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:54,053
We're here in front of Siamraphe Mall,
now at the center of an online firestorm.

439
00:35:54,053 --> 00:36:00,493
Reports say the mall
plans to evict small shop owners

440
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:02,147
in order to renovate.

441
00:36:02,147 --> 00:36:06,124
The order came from
Mr. Thalehluang Raphethada.

442
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:08,747
My mom's sold here
since the mall was first built.

443
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:11,524
Have some respect before changing everything.

444
00:36:11,524 --> 00:36:12,858
What about you?

445
00:36:12,858 --> 00:36:16,107
I've worked here for years.

446
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:19,031
When Mr. Natee was in charge,
he was never this cruel.

447
00:36:19,031 --> 00:36:21,818
We're not rich,
we don't have money for a new shop.

448
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:24,013
If they force us out,
what are we supposed to do?

449
00:36:24,013 --> 00:36:29,920
So the compensation the mall offered
wasn't enough?

450
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,991
Of course not!

451
00:36:31,991 --> 00:36:34,044
- And the new spot they're offering us?
- Yes?

452
00:36:34,044 --> 00:36:36,373
Who knows if customers will even come.

453
00:36:37,644 --> 00:36:40,129

454
00:36:40,129 --> 00:36:42,587
Yeah, Auntie's live stream flipped the world.

455
00:36:42,587 --> 00:36:47,342
Forget 150,000...
who knows if they'll throw us out today.

are you the owner of My Fav Burger,

00:37:24,387 --> 00:37:26,120
Okay.

Karn won't stop tearing into our mall
in the news.

464
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:43,916
I'm sure she's on someone's payroll.

465
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:47,733
And because of your daughter,
the mall is flooded with criticism,

466
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:49,364
and Mut got attacked.

467
00:37:49,364 --> 00:37:55,364
I even pushed the Siamraphe Lucky Day
campaign earlier to boost our image,

468
00:37:55,364 --> 00:37:57,378
but it's ruined because of you.

469
00:37:58,996 --> 00:38:01,831
Reporters are calling nonstop for interviews.

470
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:04,871
The protesters outside refuse to leave.

471
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:09,951
I'm afraid if we don't act,
even more people will show up.

472
00:38:09,951 --> 00:38:12,756
Thaleh, what did you tell the tenants?

473
00:38:12,756 --> 00:38:14,640
Why did it turn out like this?

474
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,573
I told them everything.

475
00:38:16,573 --> 00:38:19,973
They're angry because they think
the new zone we offered won't work.

476
00:38:19,973 --> 00:38:22,156
That's what happens
when you think in shallow, stupid ways.

477
00:38:22,156 --> 00:38:24,169
People end up suffering because of you.

478
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:28,462
I think it was more of a communication error.

479
00:38:28,462 --> 00:38:30,422
Then it's an error for both of them.

480
00:38:30,422 --> 00:38:34,156
Dao retweeted insults instead of
caring about the mall's image.

481
00:38:34,156 --> 00:38:35,924
She only cared about her own shop.

482
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:38,098
That's the kind of tenant we should kick out.

483
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:39,769
Kicking her out might actually help.

484
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:42,093
People would see us as fair and unbiased.

485
00:38:42,093 --> 00:38:43,129
But Dao's shop isn't involved.

486
00:38:43,129 --> 00:38:46,142

to send the protesters home quickly.

You're sure?

496
00:39:46,311 --> 00:39:48,538
Since Klang and Chon are gone,

your family too.

499
00:39:55,587 --> 00:39:59,649
I think she should be sent abroad
for a master's.

500
00:40:05,049 --> 00:40:09,653
I don't mind if Dao studies abroad.

501
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:12,849
But if it's for this reason,

502
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:15,689
she won't agree.

503
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:21,778
If we force her, things will only get worse.

504
00:40:21,778 --> 00:40:26,689
She needs to see the world,
to think differently.

505
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:36,880
Then let me talk to her first.
