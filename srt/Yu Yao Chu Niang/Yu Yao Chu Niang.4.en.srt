1
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,600
Why are you trying to blackmail me?

2
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,040
Master.

3
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,240
I feel so bad.

4
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,360
To be honest,

5
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,320
he's more handsome than his ex.

6
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,240
and a little clingy.

7
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,720
Whatever.

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,360
Run!

9
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,920
Master.

10
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,320
Can you hear me out?

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,920
You talk too much.

12
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:06,880
Tell me.

13
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,680
Actually, there's another reason

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,280
for another reason.

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,920
Since I met you,

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,280
as long as I leave you,

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,680
my heart hurts like a knife.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,560
I just want to be with you.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,320
I'm dying.

20
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:20,600
Miss.

21
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,200
Go now.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,760
He is

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,000
considering me.

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,640
Why is it so hot?

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:38,920
Could it be...

26
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,759
the demon is possessed?

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,840
Master.

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,560
Help!

29
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,479
Who are you?

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,880
We were supposed to be the Three Beasts of Snow God.

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Until one day,

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,040
the snow of ten thousand years.

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
She's coming

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,479
She dances brightly.

35
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,759
Falling beautifully

36
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,440
As the God of Snow Mountain,

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,240
I've never seen her so passionate.

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,120
At that moment,

39
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,040
I thought

40
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,880
I saw the whole world that never belonged to me.

41
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,160
You're just a snowmonster.

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,200
How dare you ignore the flames!

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
If you take one more step,

44
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,280
I'll eat you alive.

45
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,000
Miss.

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,160
Fate brought us together.

47
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,079
I'll give you

48
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,040
a flower from my hometown.

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,280
Nice to meet you.

50
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,480
Is it so perfunctory?

51
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,280
Ao Xue and Han Mei match so well.

52
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,720
Then,

53
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,080
I couldn't control my heart.

54
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,160
Try it.

55
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,360
This is a specialty from my hometown.

56
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,400
Let me take you to the top of the snow mountain

57
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,240
to watch the sunrise.

58
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,600
Let's change.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Then be my wife.

60
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,079
Let's watch the sunrise.

61
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,079
Okay.

62
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,680
I can't help getting close to her.

63
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,560
and took her to the top of the mountain to watch the snow.

64
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,800
I want to be with her forever.

65
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,520
even if

66
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,200
sacrifice my life,

67
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,920
As long as I can be with her.

68
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,320
Third Brother.

69
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:40,880
Zhi Xiang!

70
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,560
No!

71
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't do anything stupid, Zhi Xiang.

72
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,760
I'm leaving.

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,160
Forget me.

74
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,800
Why can't you stop for me?

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,240
or take me with you?

76
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,720
You're good.

77
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,080
But we're not the same.

78
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,200
Goodbye.

79
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,200
We crossed the fire gate.

80
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,560
and reversed the real body.

81
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't have much time left.

82
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,800
I just want an answer.

83
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,720
From then on,

84
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,360
when we meet a couple,

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,800
we'll kill a pair of mandarin ducks.

86
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,560
I saw you just now.

87
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
a demon hunter.

88
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,040
So...

89
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,600
please save us.

90
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,920
No.

91
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,880
But...

92
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,280
your problem is simple.

93
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,720
Let go of your obsession.

94
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,760
It's not sweet to force it.

95
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,640
Love with sacrifice

96
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,000
will never end well.

97
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,920
If sacrifice can make her happy,

98
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,680
I will.

99
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,920
What if she's a scumbag?

100
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,080
There are a lot of fish tanks.

101
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,840
You're just a little brother.

102
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,960
What is a scumbag?

103
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,880
I don't know.

104
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
It's a lie.

105
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,480
For example,

106
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,480
You're good.

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,200
It's just a baby or something.

108
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,120
But why did she lie to me?

109
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
I just want to know

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,120
if the fire woman has ever fallen in love with me.

111
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,600
Even a little.

112
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,640
for a moment,

113
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,800
when I see you,

114
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
I feel like I've seen the old me.

115
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Wake up.

116
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,720
Love brain.

117
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,840
If you can't give us an answer,

118
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,360
don't blame us for being ruthless.

119
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,760
We'll get mad at each other.

120
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,640
Watch me put out the fire.

121
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,240
To the God of Kitchen.

122
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,040
All tastes listen.

123
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,440
Snow flying in the sky.

124
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,560
Don't hurt her.

125
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,480
No matter when,

126
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,080
I will

127
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,320
protect you.

128
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

129
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,920
I'll grant your wish.

130
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,080
I can give you an answer.

131
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,600
Fire Phantom.

132
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,440
The one who made you like this today...

133
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,440
I don't think it's Fire Witch.

134
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,680
but your own obsession.

135
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,680
What do you mean?

136
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,520
I heard the Fire Spirit of Snow Mountain

137
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,960
can be seen once in a while.

138
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,200
Burn it to your heart's content

139
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,120
the stem will disappear.

140
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,560
Maybe the fire girl

141
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,280
might not have abandoned you.

142
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
This is the first time

143
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,320
someone gave me a gift.

144
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,440
He might not know what I like.

145
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,240
Try it.

146
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,440
This is a specialty from my hometown.

147
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,400
And I don't know

148
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,560
his world

149
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,480
can never be shared with me.

150
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,680
Let me take you to the top of the snow mountain

151
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,680
to watch the sunrise.

152
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,960
Let's change.

153
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Be my wife then.

154
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,720
It's extremely cold on the top of the mountain.

155
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,320
If I go,

156
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,000
I won't be able to return.

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,680
Consider it

158
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,160
as compensation for his love.

159
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,840
Let's watch the sunrise.

160
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,720
Okay.

161
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,480
Bye.

162
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,760
I shouldn't have entered the extreme cold for too long.

163
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,240
I just wanted to see

164
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,680
what your world

165
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,920
is like.

166
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,320
Instead of killing you,

167
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,880
than make you suffer.

168
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,680
Actually,

169
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,840
Why?

170
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,360
You know it better than anyone.

171
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,320
Why?

172
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,760
Only by becoming her

173
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,760
is the only way to protect her last flame.

174
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,720
It seems

175
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,080
you already

176
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,560
in your heart, right?

177
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,080
The second Section of Love

178
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,160
Stop being obsessed

179
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,800
Don't be blindly judged.

180
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,160
I agree with you.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,480
Miss.

182
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't know about your past.

183
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,000
Although I'm alone,

184
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,960
I know there's someone to be with

185
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
No matter what the ending is

186
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,320
I think

187
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,799
it's a blessing in life.

188
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,760
I didn't expect him to look so innocent

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,440
he's quite pure inside.

190
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,880
Wipe the blood on your mouth.

191
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,360
Bye.

192
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,200
Miss.

193
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,960
Are you willing to be my master?

194
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,240
I have no choice.

195
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,400
I signed the contract.

196
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,440
Miss.

197
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,800
What contract are you talking about?

198
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,960
Take it.

199
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,840
Master.

200
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,560
Wait for me!

201
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,960
Boss.

202
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,080
Another one failed.

203
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,560
Who is this demon hunter?

204
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,680
Have you found him?

205
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,680
Not yet.

206
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,880
But according to reliable sources,

207
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,360
she won't be here for long.

208
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,160
Within a month,

209
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,080
One month is too long.

210
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,040
We only fight for the future.

211
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,280
I want to see

212
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,280
how long she can live.
