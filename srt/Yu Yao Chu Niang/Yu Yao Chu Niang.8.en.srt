1
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,880
Today

2
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,880
I'll give you two

3
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,360
to the west.

4
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,880
Little demon hunter.

5
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,800
I didn't expect

6
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,400
to fall into your hands.

7
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm a persimmon.

8
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,120
I don't charge money to fight demons.

9
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,319
Little demon, take your life!

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,840
Wow!

11
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,400
The first top orange dress.

12
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,880
It's worth it.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,520
The third warning of love

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,520
Don't indulge in temptation

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,680
Don't be greedy

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,760
Be brave to refuse in love

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Never force

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,720
and bid farewell to the wrong

19
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,440
to meet the right one.

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,360
Master.

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,760
I have a question.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,840
You can only ask one question.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,759
Have you made up your mind?

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,160
Okay.

25
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,280
Let me change the question.

26
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,479
Why are there so many dishes?

27
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,000
Only this fried pork

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,039
can subdue her.

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,080
Because

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,000
She's Northeast Silver.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,280
She's the God of Steamed Pork.

32
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,200
to protect every northeast child.

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,039
Le Xibai.

34
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,320
You actually have someone you like.

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
Before you met me?

36
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,160
Master.

37
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,720
You must be tired

38
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,800
Thank you.

39
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,240
Hurry up.

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,320
Wait for me!

41
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,039
Great!

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,200
There is no strange city in the world.

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,240
There's another peaceful town.

44
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,120
I agree.

45
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:21,760
Hey.

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,560
Master

47
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,320
Master!

48
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,240
Aren't you the landlady?

49
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,280
It's me.

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,360
These

51
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,040
a little something from all of us.

52
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,760
Thank you.

53
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,920
Thanks to you.

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,280
If it weren't for you,

55
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,440
we

56
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,400
we can't go back to our warm life.

57
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,440
That's right.

58
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,079
But money is always cold.

59
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,240
It doesn't mean happiness.

60
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,440
Everyone.

61
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,680
Farewell.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,360
Hey.

63
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,600
Silver is like a dream.

64
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,240
They were blinded by money and beauty.

65
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,280
and lost themselves.

66
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,040
But luckily,

67
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm back to my real life now.

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,040
Congratulations.

69
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,880
And you and I successfully subdue the demons

70
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,600
and safe.

71
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:32,640
I think

72
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,560
this is the happiness you said.

73
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,440
Huh?

74
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,200
It looks the same.

75
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,160
Why does it feel

76
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,480
so different?

77
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,320
Master.

78
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,400
I want to ask you a question.

79
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,440
Do you have a lover?

80
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,160
If you do,

81
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,680
it'll be bad.

82
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,520
Why?

83
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,280
Because if there is,

84
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,080
you have to ask me if I agree.

85
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,320
You punk.

86
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,839
You have someone you like.

87
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,040
Why didn't you ask me?

88
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,200
Master.

89
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:22,920
Master.

90
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,240
What's inside?

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,840
It's so heavy.

92
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,240
Open it

93
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,360
Oh.

94
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,880
Quality: Silver

95
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:38,400
It's practical.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,520
Gosh.

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,520
Oh.

98
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,480
What's wrong?

99
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,080
Are you okay?

100
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,680
Master.

101
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,840
My old injury has relapsed.

102
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,400
What old injury?

103
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,640
I haven't heard about it before.

104
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,120
Let me see.

105
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,920
What are you doing?

106
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,000
Master.

107
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,960
You...

108
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,520
I'm angry.

109
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,680
Master.

110
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,600
Let me get you some wild food.

111
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,840
What's going on?

112
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,360
Why is my heart beating so fast?

113
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,240
Master.

114
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Your wine is so strong.

115
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,520
It’s much stronger than Eun’s wine.

116
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,200
What?

117
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,800
Your wine is good.

118
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,960
My wine doesn't taste good.

119
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,720
She gave it to you.

120
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,560
Why don't you drink more?

121
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,400
Drink it.

122
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,280
Master.

123
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,400
Your wine

124
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,000
is a bit strong.

125
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,600
I feel dizzy.

126
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,880
You can't hold your liquor.

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,880
Can you stop acting tough next time?

128
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,840
Master.

129
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,120
You haven't

130
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,920
answer my question.

131
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,280
Do you have someone you like?

132
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,560
Yes.

133
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,960
But that was in the past.

134
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,160
I have one too.

135
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,200
I know.

136
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,240
No.

137
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,120
You don't know.

138
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,560
What's going on?

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,040
I can't believe

140
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,440
