1
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,440
The advantage of the game

2
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,800
There's a way.

3
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,000
One mistake.

4
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,800
Where does it turn?

5
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,840
It turns out to be a dream.

6
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
You are...

7
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:17,920
I'm fine.

8
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,760
Stay here.

9
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,800
I'm leaving.

10
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,960
Hey.

11
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,960
Wait.

12
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,000
Contract.

13
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,480
Hey.

14
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,479
Master.

15
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,160
You must be hungry.

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,520
Yes.

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,640
Let's exchange some money first.

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,720
Buy something to eat.

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,520
Master.

20
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,080
What are you doing?

21
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,360
Nothing.

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,400
Go to sleep.

23
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,360
You won't be hungry after sleeping.

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,479
Master.

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,720
Come closer.

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll replenish your energy.

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,040
Le Xibai.

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,320
Take your head away.

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,800
We have a contract.

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,000
It can't be helped.

31
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,840
You're bullying me again.

32
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,840
Alas.

33
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,480
Forget it.

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,560
Let's go east.

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,040
We might find something over there.

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,240
Master,

37
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,800
Wait for me here.

38
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,280
I'll get you something to eat.

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,360
Oh no!

40
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
I almost forgot about the contract distance.

41
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,360
Ra Hee Baek.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,520
I'm going to die because of him.

43
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
You little...

44
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,560
Where did he go?

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,720
Master.

46
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,680
The meal is ready.

47
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,640
But there's only some leftovers.

48
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,640
That's it?

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,760
Forget it.

50
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,720
Leave it to me.

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,200
Wow.

52
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,720
He never likes my cooking.

53
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,880
Who is it?

54
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,680
Nobody.

55
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,520
Master.

56
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,360
In the past,

57
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,280
saved our lives.

58
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,600
Now we are master and disciple.

59
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,880
Now I believe you are my master.

60
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,640
I'll do whatever you say.

61
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,800
I don't want you to believe it.

62
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,800
As long as you are my master,

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,200
I'm willing to die.

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,560
You licker.

65
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,440
This is for you.

66
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,040
Your new mask.

67
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,760
Thank you, Master.

68
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,680
Forget it.

69
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,159
How about this?

70
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,920
From now on,

71
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,640
I'll be your mask.

72
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,120
I'll protect you.

73
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,040
Let's go.

74
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,000
Le Xibai.

75
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,159
What are you looking at?

76
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,480
Master.

77
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,760
This city looks a little strange.

78
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,000
The demon hunter is well equipped.

79
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,200
We'll see.

80
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,920
Let's go.

81
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,720
Okay.

82
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,200
Hey!

83
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,360
Watch where you're going!

84
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
Don’t disturb me.

85
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,320
Silver Sister.

86
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,320
What sister?

87
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,440
What is it?

88
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,120
The cloud wants clothes, flowers want faces.

89
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,640
Silver Girl’s Star Designated Red.

90
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,160
Please pay attention to your artist.

91
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,120
The annual selection of the Oiran will be held on time.

92
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,080
Please support us.

93
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,120
Thank you.

94
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,360
Gin Girl's subordinate.

95
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,800
This is the support banner.

96
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,000
The support banner.

97
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,120
Master.

98
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,240
What are you talking about?

99
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,280
Silver Glory

100
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,560
to protect your glory.

101
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,760
Silver Glory

102
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,920
to protect your glory.

103
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,360
Silver Glory

104
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,520
to protect your glory.

105
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
Let's take a look.

106
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,560
Okay.

107
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,360
Silver Glory

108
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,200
to protect your glory.

109
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Silver Glory

110
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,800
to protect your glory.

111
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
Silver Glory.

112
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,400
Look at these fans.

113
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,520
They might be the brainless poison.

114
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Silver Glory

115
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,800
to protect your glory.

116
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,080
Maid Inn?

117
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,960
I don't remember writing such a story.

118
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,480
What is a maid?

119
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,680
It's

120
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,600
a good place.

121
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,600
The long hair

122
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,400
Like a dream.

123
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,680
Isn't this the person in the painting?

124
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,720
No.

125
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,000
You are not satisfied

126
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,400
I have

127
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,640
There are many more.

128
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,840
Pick one yourself.

129
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,520
Hotel.

130
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,160
Smimemarcel.

131
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,480
Wadashiva.

132
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,560
I believe you.

133
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
Hajimi Majida.

134
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Do you want to stay?

135
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,159
Follow me.

136
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,840
One room for each.

137
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,920
Let me see if there's anything wrong in the room.

138
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,880
Le Xibai.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,040
Why are you following me?

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,320
The city is so strange.

141
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,600
I have to protect my master.

142
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,600
What?

143
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,360
Oh.

144
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
I need my master to protect me.

145
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,360
The kitchen in the room.

146
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,440
Food ready

147
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,840
I'll go around.

148
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,760
What are you looking at?

149
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,400
Nothing.

150
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,160
But

151
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,720
the beauty in the face is shining.

152
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,799
She has a good temperament.

153
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,240
It's hard to say.

154
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,280
That's all.

155
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,360
My master is more like that.

156
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,240
Mrs. Su.

157
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,440
I want to ask you about someone.

158
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,960
Who is this pretty lady?

159
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,760
What?

160
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,320
Who doesn’t know Eun?

161
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,240
Come on.

162
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,480
I recommend you to eat.

163
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,640
Silver is the one who has the most pressure in this competition.

164
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,000
This is the campaign site.

165
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,840
You can call me Silver.

166
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,200
It’s the highest honor of my family.
