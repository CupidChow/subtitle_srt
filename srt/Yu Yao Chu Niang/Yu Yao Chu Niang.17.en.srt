1
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,840
There's demon aura.

2
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,280
Oh no.

3
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,200
Le Xibai.

4
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:54,920
Humph.

5
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,880
Thank you all

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,440
for coming to my humble house.

7
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,840
I

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,320
to invite an extraordinary flute at a high price.

9
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,840
Choose

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,920
who is best at flute

11
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,920
Meet friends with the heavenly music.

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
Please enjoy the song and compose the song together.

13
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,920
Come.

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,800
Let's drink this.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,160
You're a great man.

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,640
You're indeed a scholar.

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,760
Why

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,760
so much foam?

19
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,200
The banquet is already the third day.

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,920
The song is joy.

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,360
We can observe the wind.

22
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,440
It can calm your mind.

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,040
Sure.

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
You're a ghost.

25
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
I wonder

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,360
to hear the musicians play a good song

27
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,800
to express my feelings?

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,039
I'm so lucky.

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,360
Shang

30
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,680
Shang

31
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
Meat.

32
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,360
What's going on?

33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,200
There's a demon here.

34
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,320
Who could it be?

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,200
Not bad.

36
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,440
My disciple has made progress.

37
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,760
Why are you here?

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
I was afraid you would lose your life.

39
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,960
Well...

40
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,680
Where's MeNanzi?

41
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
He's waiting outside.

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,360
Do you remember

43
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,000
Do you remember?

44
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
What?

45
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,160
The music is music.

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,079
[It's like a ghost.]

47
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:47,800
Hush.

48
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,520
Listen carefully.

49
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,640
The answer is in the song.

50
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,320
I am an immortal.

51
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,720
Bamboo Fairy on the mountain.

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,960
and my tie was chopped.

53
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:58,720
and

54
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,520
I'm speechless.

55
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,800
The flute is a trap.

56
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,480
Half right.

57
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,760
It's not a bamboo flute.

58
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,279
not a bamboo flute.

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,480
Sign language.

60
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,000
He's too tired to cultivate himself.

61
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,400
What is he doing?

62
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,280
Le Xibai.

63
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,240
Prepare for war.

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,080
Oh.

65
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:49,600
Look.

66
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,680
The world is vast.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,240
Do you really think you can see anything?

68
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,320
You're not a demon.

69
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,800
What are you talking about?

70
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,320
I'm an immortal.

71
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,120
I don't care.

72
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:16,880
Tell me.

73
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,800
What's your purpose?

74
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,040
Please make me a meal.

75
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,560
Young man.

76
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,520
I know your intention.

77
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,600
I think

78
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,600
why don't you

79
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,920
to see

80
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,159
on the table.

81
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,840
That's the answer you want.

82
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,000
You mean

83
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,720
love comes from heart.

84
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,480
but also the heart.

85
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,080
Since we have different paths,

86
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,240
between life and death,

87
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,960
between life and death.

88
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,080
On the contrary,

89
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,600
I am a deity.

90
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,880
The bamboo fairy on the mountain

91
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,400
were chopped.

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,080
I'm speechless.

93
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,920
This forest is really nice.

94
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,400
Honey.

95
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,200
Hurry up.

96
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,640
Wait for me.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,800
Honey.

98
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,840
Suzhen!

99
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,840
Did you hear that?

100
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,120
The end of this song

101
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,320
This song is full of words of begging.

102
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,520
What I heard was "You can't get what you want."

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,960
Longing for you

104
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
I don't think

105
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,200
you can't do that either.

106
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
This is the answer.

107
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,520
Don't ever try to suppress your lover's ability.

108
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,520
You can feel pain.

109
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,120
That's also a kind of luck.

110
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,480
It's to stop disturbance

111
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,360
Open your heart and accept it

112
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,440
Miss.

113
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Can you

114
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,000
Can you cook for me?

115
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
