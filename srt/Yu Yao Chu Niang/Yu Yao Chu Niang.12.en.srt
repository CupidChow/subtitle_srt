1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,320
It's...

2
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,440
What is this?

3
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,280
To run for the brightest moon

4
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,000
To come, to run for

5
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,480
the ranking of demon hunters.

6
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,040
I’m in the top ten.

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm still a diamond exorcist.

8
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,640
Master.

9
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
Of course.

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,760
This is

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
I made for you.

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,640
Ah...

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,000
How about

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,039
eat more?

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,400
You've been too tired lately.

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,160
I'm not tired.

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:17,880
Master.

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:18,920
Eat it.

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,600
I'll make you delicious food every day.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,840
No need.

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,920
I have to be responsible for you.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,120
For what?

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,160
We just kissed and hugged.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
Nothing.

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,280
Master.

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,200
Don't talk nonsense.

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,840
But...

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,440
you have to

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,640
really think so?

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,759
It's not impossible.

31
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:37,360
How about this?

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,280
Let's

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,080
pick a day to get married.

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,520
I'll find an auspicious day.

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,800
How can we get married?

36
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,759
Why not?

37
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,320
Because...

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,080
Because

39
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,080
Because we're from two different worlds.

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,240
Idiot.

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,200
Master.

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,640
I just don't want to be like Liu Xian.

43
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,759
You have someone in your heart,

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,520
but I missed it.

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,520
Unless

46
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,960
you don't like me.

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,200
No.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,560
I...

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Master.

50
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:11,920
What's wrong?

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,760
I think

52
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,560
a little dizzy.

53
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,920
Hey.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,600
Are you okay?

55
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,400
What's going on?

56
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,160
Could it be...

57
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,920
as long as he's with me,

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,360
he'll become weaker.

59
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,800
until your life runs out.

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,160
I'm not a demon.

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,120
I'm not a demon.

62
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,840
Oh.

63
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,360
It's hopeless.

64
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,120
It must be a demon.

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,840
Yes.

66
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,760
Yes.

67
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,120
Look.

68
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,960
I'm not a demon.

69
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,120
Le Xibai.

70
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,280
Are you okay?

71
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,040
Ah.

72
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm fine, master.

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,079
I just

74
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,880
too tired.

75
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,560
Then

76
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,040
have some tea first.

77
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,320
Master.

78
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,520
This is...

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,040
the tea you made for me.

80
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,560
Stop calling me master.

81
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I said,

82
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,880
don't call me master anymore.

83
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,680
I won't call you master.

84
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,920
What should I call you?

85
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,079
Could it be...

86
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,320
Call me madam.

87
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,519
Greasy.

88
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,760
Just call me persimmon.

89
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:24,960
Right.

90
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,480
About what we said before...

91
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,080
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,280
It's okay.

93
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,640
It's just my wishful thinking.

94
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,000
I think

95
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,840
our relationship

96
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,480
is quite good.

97
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,159
Master.

98
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,720
You made dessert?

99
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,760
Oh.

100
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,440
Try it.

101
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:46,920
Okay.

102
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,600
It's not cooked yet.

103
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,400
This is sugar cream.

104
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,920
This bun

105
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,840
called?

106
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,480
Interesting.

107
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,960
Men are reliable.

108
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,560
Ah

109
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,360
Sow can climb trees

110
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,640
This is a sow.

111
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,080
You've taken Liu Xin's tea.

112
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,480
Our contract has been terminated.

113
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,880
We have nothing to do with each other.

114
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,760
Le Xibai.

115
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,240
I'm such a loser.

116
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
I can't say goodbye in person.

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,080
In the end,

118
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,000
from two different worlds.

119
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,880
I will protect you

120
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,880
I'll protect you.

121
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,680
I thought I was hurt once.

122
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,640
I could be sober and independent.

123
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
but I still can't control myself.

124
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,960
Goodbye.

125
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,000
Le Xibai.

126
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,000
Take good care of yourself.

127
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,000
May you find your destination soon.

128
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,080

130
