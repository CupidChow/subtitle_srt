00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,480
Sister Eun!

00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,240
♪Love you♪

3
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,440
Look at you

4
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,960
This doesn't look like a Oiran.

5
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,160
It's like a ceremony.

6
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,520
Eun-joo.

7
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,280
Silver, I love you.

8
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,240
I love you, Eun.

9
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:26,840
Look at me. Look at me.

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,200
Wake up.

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,760
Let's go! Let's go!

12
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,760
I love you! I love you!

13
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,000
Eun-joo.

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,960
I want to take a picture of you like this with your phone.

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,479
and see how you'll end up like this.

16
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,360
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,800
Oh my god!

18
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,400
I want to spend money on the charts

19
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,360
to help you.

20
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,120
It's like this

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,880
What a strong demon aura.

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,280
Silver! Silver!

23
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,280
Wow, so much money!

24
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,039
Wow

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,960
So much money

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,760
Sure.

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,960
Others spend money on fangirling.

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,360
I'm here to make money.

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,480
Thank you for your support.

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,800
Next, I'll choose a lucky audience

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,280
to interact with me on the stage.

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,120
Pick me.

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,760
Look at me.

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,600
I can do it.

35
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,240
Silver, pick me.

36
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,560
Me.

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,360
I love you.

38
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,520
Choose me.

39
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,480
Me. Me.

40
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,120
It's you.

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,360
Come on.

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,760
No, no, no.

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,440
No, no, no.

44
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,160
I'm not interested in singing.

45
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,760
Go ahead.

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
Just do it.

47
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
...and you'll be able to do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

48
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,160
Let's go. Let's go.

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,960
Yes.

50
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,480
Just do it.

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,440
Why are you so ungrateful?

52
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,079
Just do as Silver said.

53
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,920
Go.

54
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,160
Let's go! Let's go!

55
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
Go

56
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
Hurry up.

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,680
Please introduce yourself.

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
Come on. Come on. Come on.

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,960
Come on. Come on.

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,240
I'm the devil of AKTV.

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,760
Now it's my live show.

62
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,040
Look at the moonlight

63
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,800
Is it also your night?

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,360
♪Come on, come on♪

65
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,280
♪Look at the stars♪ ♪Look at the stars♪

66
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,600
Look into the sky

67
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,840
Look, look, look

68
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,360
You come to me

69
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,840
You appear in front of me

70
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,000
A little bit.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,640
Look at it. Look at it.

72
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,360
What is this?

73
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,480
Let's go home.

74
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm so bored.

75
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,280
Come on. Come on.

76
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,079
Why are you showing off on the stage?

77
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,040
It's a lot of money

78
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,000
A lot of silver

79
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,360
Silver

80
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,000
Be careful

81
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,760
Get lost!

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,360
Don't ruin Eun's stage.

83
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,480
Move! Move! Move!

84
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,640
It's here. It's here.

85
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,360
Let's go.

86
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,040
Move! Move! Move!

87
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,680
Yin.

[It's like this.] [It's like this.]

90
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,000
These poisons are hopeless.

91
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,880
Master.

92
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,560
Although you're a little angry,

93
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,360
I want to know

94
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,440
what does this poison mean?

95
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,760
Forget it.

96
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,960
I have a plan to find out the truth.

97
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,480
Look, look, look, look

98
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,960
Master.

99
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,800
I'm not interested in her.

100
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,760
Someone just shouted “Eun Girl, I love you”.

101
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,880
I was tricked.

102
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,400
Besides, my condition is not good.

103
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,960
Not really.

104
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,360
You look like a girl. You look like a girl.

105
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,240
Including you?

106
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,159
Let's change the subject.

107
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,960
Oh.

108
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,840
If I really go,

109
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,760
Come on, come on.

110
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,000
Come on. Come on. Come on.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,480
Come on. Come on. Come on.

112
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,360
Come on. Come on. Come on.

113
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,600
Master.

114
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,640
Why did I dream of her?

115
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,600
Let's go. Let's go.

116
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,440
Could it be...

117
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,080
[she's...]

118
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,880
What?

119
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,560
It's like this

120
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,080
Her face is fake too.

121
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,560
You're all cheated

122
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,040
Your money is fake.

123
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,159
Come on, come on, come on

124
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,960
Come on. Come on.

125
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,440
It's true. It's true.

126
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,120
Look at this. Look at this.

127
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,760
Come on, come on

128
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,440
It's fake! It's fake!

129
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,200
Come on, come on, come on

130
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,360
Let's go. Let's go.

131
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,480
Look for her! Look for her!

132
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,880
This is a frame-up!

133
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,880
Be careful. Be careful.

134
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,880
Trust her.

135
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,280
Eun is the best in the world.

136
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,640
It's like this

137
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,760
Be careful. Be careful.

138
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,560
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

139
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,680
Come on. Come on.

140
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,000
Tonight,

141
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,840
call him to my room.

142
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,360
You have to trust Eun.

143
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,720
It's a frame-up! It's a frame-up!

144
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,600
She's framed! She's framed!

145
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,480
Come on, come on, come on

146
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,200
Look, look, look

147
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
Take a look.

148
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,960
Please take a look.

149
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,800
It's a pleasure to meet you.

150
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,680
Master.

151
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,760
What does the lip mark on the invitation mean?

152
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,159
It's beautiful

153
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,680
Hey.

154
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:40,840
[It's called...] It's called...

155
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
It's like this. It's like this.

156
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,360
It's like this.

157
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,880
Come on. Come on.

158
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,120
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look

159
