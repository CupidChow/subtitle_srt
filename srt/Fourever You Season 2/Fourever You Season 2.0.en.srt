1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,108
Today, I’m going to introduce everyone to us.

2
00:00:03,124 --> 00:00:05,522
So P’New asked like…

3
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:08,487
“If Bever played the role, would he be interested?”

4
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,721
He’s really talented in acting.

5
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:12,460
Like, he’s totally made for this.

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,359
There was a time…

7
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:16,039
I used to be completely by myself.

8
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:17,760
Did nothing at all.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
I remembered that feeling…

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,760
and put it into Typhoon.

11
00:00:29,722 --> 00:00:34,062
Typhoon! Long time no see. How have you been?

12
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:36,958
I thought I wouldn’t get to see you again.

13
00:00:37,182 --> 00:00:40,524
If we didn’t meet here, we probably would’ve never met again, right?

14
00:00:40,657 --> 00:00:44,685
Didn’t I tell you—if you got lost, I’d come find you myself.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,170
So, Tonfah–Typhoon is a drama series.

16
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,380
It’s about the relationship between two brothers.

17
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,240
They were very close…

18
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:05,022
because their houses were next to each other when they were young.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,244
The story begins when Tonfah feels like…

20
00:01:10,318 --> 00:01:11,780
Typhoon seems really troubled.

21
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,050
Like he always has something weighing on his mind.

22
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,877
So Tonfah wants to take care of him as best as he can.

23
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,500
As they grow up,

24
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,459
Tonfah moves to Chiang Mai.

25
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:22,819
And I felt like…

26
00:01:23,268 --> 00:01:26,810
I really wanted to see him, because he’s…

27
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,819
the person who understands me the most.

28
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:32,340
So Typhoon chooses to follow him to Chiang Mai.

29
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,925
And when they meet again…

30
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:39,500
At first, Tonfah feels like he’s making up for lost time.

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,540
Even during the time apart, Tonfah always thought about Typhoon.

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,299
Still wanted to take care of him.

33
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:46,180
And when they reunite as growing up

34
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,333
he wants to look after him just like before.

35
00:01:49,345 --> 00:01:54,228
But then one day, Typhoon suddenly starts avoiding him…

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,746
and Tonfah has no idea what he did wrong.

37
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,352
So he wants to find out what’s really going on with Typhoon.

38
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:01,859
“You like him, that’s why.”

39
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:04,988
“I figured out how to make you talk to P’Fah.”

40
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:07,174
Let’s go, let’s go.

41
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:11,333
P’Fah, please enjoy the food.

42
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:13,031
I just want to stay by P’Fah’s side.

43
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,142
– And you don’t know who it is?
– No idea.

44
00:02:15,225 --> 00:02:18,202
Seeing how he sent it through someone else, he probably doesn’t want me to know.

45
00:02:18,253 --> 00:02:25,580
What if one day he realizes someone closer is easier to reach than someone who writes letters and then he just disappears.

46
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:27,357
You have no right to go after him.

47
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,921
You like him this much, and you’re really gonna let things stay like this?

48
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:52,819
Hello, I’m Bever.

49
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:59,419
I play Tonfah in Beside the Sky: Tonfah–Typhoon, part of Forever You Part 2.

50
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,620
Hello, I’m Tonliew Methaphat.

51
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,419
I play Typhoon in Beside the Sky: Tonfah–Typhoon.

52
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,422
Learning to be happy in the rain?

53
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:29,232
I’ll stay with you.
If you’re scared, you can hold my hand.

54
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,604
You’ll stay until I fall asleep, right?

55
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,902
You're not alone anymore.

56
00:03:33,094 --> 00:03:34,630
Some burdens you carry…

57
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:36,869
you can share them with me.

58
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,164
Today, I’ll help everyone get to know us,
me and Typhoon, or Tonliew.

59
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:47,875
What we’re like, and how we personally feel about our characters.

60
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,265
Let’s introduce the characters.

61
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:58,903
Typhoon is Tonfah’s neighbor.

62
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:01,548
We’ve been close since we were kids.

63
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:06,157
And Tonfah feels Typhoon is a kid who needs to be looked after.

64
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,640
Like he has some emotional wounds…
that even Tonfah doesn’t fully understand.

65
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,048
So he’s wanted to look after him since childhood.

66
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:23,320
But then Tonfah had to move to Chiang Mai.

67
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:26,365
So they didn’t get to see each other.

68
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:30,470
Typhoon is someone who…

69
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,391
doesn’t like telling others how he feels.

70
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:36,191
He keeps everything to himself.

71
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:38,811
He doesn’t open up easily…

72
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,431
only to people he feels close to,

73
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:44,891
people he trusts.

74
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:47,905
“You little brat.”

75
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:51,250
“You shouldn’t have been born! Don’t ever show your face again!”

76
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:57,980
He keeps everything inside…

77
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:01,837
because of his family issues since he was young.

78
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:05,503
So he doesn’t open up to anyone…

79
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,906
because he’s scared.

80
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:13,986
Scared he’ll be rejected just like how his parents rejected him.

81
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:15,071
You brat.

82
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,311
You useless kid.

83
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:17,531
Worthless.

84
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:24,250
You shouldn’t have been born— hey, wait!

85
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:36,251
The person who was his safe zone was Torfun.

86
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:50,241
This is Torfun.

87
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:52,774
Say hi to the camera.

88
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:55,034
My name is Tontoei.

89
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,828
I’m Torfun.

90
00:05:58,077 --> 00:06:02,151
This is Tontoei, this is Tonliew, and this is Tonfah.

91
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:03,117
Three Tons.

92
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:05,251
Do we look alike?

93
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:09,983
– Try smiling. Same smile!
- Really? Yay!

94
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:23,771
After everything that happened in his family, Tonfah became his safe zone when he was young.

95
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:33,271
Typhoon…

96
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:35,171
Typhoon likes P’Fah because…

97
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,594
P’Fah has always been good to him.

98
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,571
So he’s liked him since he was a kid.

99
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:44,088
But because of his family issues…

100
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:50,419
Typhoon tries to avoid Tonfah.

101
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:56,106
There are some things he just can’t tell him.

102
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:13,330
When Tonfah grows up, he moves to Chiang Mai.

103
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:22,641
Such a pity.

104
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:26,730
Then who’s going to tutor Fun and Typhoon?

105
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:29,715
Typhoon is already smart.

106
00:07:30,662 --> 00:07:40,662
So I wanted to find him again because he’s the only thing that could heal me from certain things.

107
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:48,794
First year?

108
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,031
Do I need to sign in?

109
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,801
First year?

110
00:07:56,817 --> 00:08:00,093
Moved camp, same number—
I mean new camp, same number.

111
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:01,644
New camp, same number.

112
00:08:01,657 --> 00:08:04,365
Old place, new time.

113
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,045
Tonfah is kind, warm.

114
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:11,888
He may look strong on the outside…

115
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:14,462
but actually,

116
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:17,242
he pressures himself a lot.

117
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:21,082
He carries so much inside.

118
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:23,542
Because he’s someone who cares for others deeply.

119
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:26,582
So he takes on others’ stress…

120
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:28,802
and their problems.

121
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:32,102
When you see him zoning out, you get worried.

122
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,100
“Is something wrong?”

123
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,287
"I just worry about him."

124
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,100
He likes taking care of others…

125
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,602
so much that sometimes he overwhelms himself.

126
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:43,602
he overwhelms himself.

127
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,600
“I’m fine.”

128
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:47,600
“Don’t worry.”

129
00:08:55,754 --> 00:09:01,800
For me, Tonfah is the warm, gentle older brother…

130
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:07,842
and I feel like no matter what problems I have,
I can always rely on him.

131
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,776
Then he’s the one who always finds me whenever I get lost
Because I always get lost.

132
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:39,271
Whenever I’m lost, he always manages to find me.

133
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:42,534
I thought I would never see you again, Typhoon.

134
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:46,111
If we didn’t meet here, we probably wouldn’t meet ever again, right?

135
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:50,182
What did I tell you? If you get lost, I’ll come find you myself

136
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:52,622
Well… getting lost, you can still find me.

137
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:54,302
But if I’m lost in you, what do I do?

138
00:09:54,382 --> 00:09:57,262
Aww, I love that so much.

139
00:09:59,502 --> 00:10:01,542
Let’s wait and see where you get lost next.

140
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:08,994
Honestly, the reason I wanted to study in Chiang Mai
was because I wanted to follow my sister’s dream too.

141
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:13,487
I'm going to study hard, get into med school,
and become a doctor with you.

142
00:10:13,527 --> 00:10:15,007
Let’s become doctors together someday.

143
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,632
And then I’d get to meet you there too.

144
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:27,614
Because I knew he was there,
I felt like I needed a place to rely on—
somewhere for my own feelings.

145
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:31,250
And I wanted to follow my sister’s dream as well.

146
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:38,253
So I tried to put myself in that place
so that my life could be a little happier.

147
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,524
This morning at the Faculty of Veterinary Science—

148
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,552
- I’m here to drop out.
- Hey!

149
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,611
- Calm down.
- I mean it, I’m dropping out to study Fine Arts.

150
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:48,653
Why?

151
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:50,074
I’m tired.

152
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:53,634
How? What’s so tiring about vet school?

153
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:56,634
It’s just tiring.

154
00:10:57,594 --> 00:11:00,134
I want to study Fine Arts, so I’m dropping out to do that.

155
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,614
Because you like photography?

156
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:02,894
Yes.

157
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:04,594
Are you practicing to take photos of someone?

158
00:11:06,613 --> 00:11:10,613
No… just the sky.

159
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:13,354
For Tonfah, Typhoon is

160
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:14,533
probably a safe zone.

161
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,813
Just being close is enough

162
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:18,754
to make him feel at ease.

163
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:20,754
No matter what problems he’s facing,

164
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,154
once he steps into that safe zone—

165
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:24,793
a space where it’s just the two of them—

166
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:28,033
he feels calm,

167
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:30,494
and the problems seem to disappear.

168
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:41,894
Typhoon’s happiness is simply

169
00:11:41,894 --> 00:11:44,894
having someone who listens to his problems

170
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:48,894
and all the things he keeps inside.

171
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:53,890
He just wants to talk, to be comforted—

172
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:55,894
anything that makes him feel

173
00:11:56,284 --> 00:11:58,890
like he really has someone to rely on.

174
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:04,390
In the story, we don’t know what he thinks of us.

175
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:06,494
I’ve always seen him as my good little brother.

176
00:12:06,494 --> 00:12:13,074
But when we met again as adults,
I realized he felt something more.

177
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:18,694
At first Typhoon didn’t know
what Tonfah felt about him.

178
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:20,234
He probably thought he was just a big brother.

179
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:26,913
But actually, Tonfah also had
a small place in his heart reserved for Typhoon.

180
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,514
He just didn’t realize it yet.

181
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:33,874
And there seems to be a problem
he’s hiding from me.

182
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:39,033
So we have to find out what that problem is.

183
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:41,474
Well, please look forward to it.

184
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:01,272
You lied to me, didn’t you?

185
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:03,748
- No, I didn’t.
- I know about Fun already.

186
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,682
I didn’t kill Fun. I didn’t mean to.

187
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,955
It’s really awful both what you did,
and the fact that you lied to me.

188
00:13:11,712 --> 00:13:14,524
Everyone loved Fun.
I’m just cursed.

189
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,650
Nothing I do ever turns out right.

190
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:19,973
You probably hate me now, Tonfah.

191
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:23,037
Goodbye.

192
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:44,299
Typhoon.

193
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:46,340
It’s been so long. How have you been?

194
00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:47,949
Are you doing well?

195
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:51,038
I really thought I wouldn’t see you again, Typhoon.

196
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:55,562
If we didn’t meet here, we probably wouldn’t meet at all, right?

197
00:13:57,976 --> 00:14:00,943
How did you end up joining this project?

198
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,420
I’ve known Bever for about two years.

199
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,000
Since Absolute Zero and then Fourever You Part 1.

200
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,419
Back then we played friends—

201
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:13,919
always bickering and fighting and stuff.

202
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:18,619
We met during Absolute Zero.

203
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,119
That was kind of like the stepping stone that led me to becoming Tonfah.

204
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,320
that led me to becoming Tonfah.

205
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,519
So yeah, around two years.

206
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,419
Ever since we heard that Fourever You was coming,

207
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:35,419
P’New asked, like

208
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:39,120
“If Bever plays this role, would you be interested?”

209
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,519
And I was like sure, since we’ve worked together before,
and I felt like…

210
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,200
there’s something about him

211
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,440
that made me feel he would be a great Tonfah.

212
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,159
We both know very well that—
this one,

213
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,440
we have to be serious.

214
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,560
And I know he has his serious side too.

215
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,720
And I have mine as well.

216
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:17,120
We sort of understood between us
that this story needed us to give everything.

217
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,120
And when we actually filmed,
it really turned out that way.
He did his homework so well.

218
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
And I prepared myself a lot too.

219
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,928
After that, love wasn’t something I'm searching for.

220
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,062
There wasn’t much we needed to prepare,
not much we needed to talk about.

221
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:50,536
That’s why I said we already understood the flow
of working together.

222
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:57,435
Like Bever said, we didn’t talk that much—
we just focused on our jobs, did our best,
and met halfway.

223
00:15:57,462 --> 00:16:00,894
And everything just linked naturally.
I don’t know—there’s something about it.

224
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:03,448
We didn’t have to say much,
but when we actually worked,

225
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:05,500
it clicked right away.

226
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:18,977
The power went out.

227
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:24,328
Good thing the security guard came to help, otherwise…

228
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:31,536
It was confusing, right? The power went out,
but honestly, you could’ve opened the door yourself.

229
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:36,170
He just wanted us to come see him.

230
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:37,508
It was scary.

231
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,444
Bever is the one who studies the role really hard too.

232
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:48,961
I could see he was stressed,
but when filming started,
his flow was so good.

233
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:55,219
I’m similar to Tonfah—I overthink a lot
and put pressure on myself.

234
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,011
Because the first part was done so well—

235
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,303
P’Johan, P’Maxky, and Pond.

236
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:05,469
And since we’re Part 2, the opening story,
I felt like—

237
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:10,345
“Hey, how do we make this even better?”
So I took care of everything I could,

238
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:12,099
my body,

239
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:26,567
my skin, mindset, everything.

240
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:29,891
I tried to get myself into a good place,
so everything else would be good too.

241
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:33,893
Tried to reduce the pressure on myself
and prepare.

242
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:37,638
I read the script, did workshops—everything, to make it the best.

243
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:44,337
There was a time before filming Tonfah–Typhoon started…

244
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:52,280
I stayed by myself, doing nothing.
I wanted to know what it feels like when someone doesn’t know what to do.

245
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:58,045
At that time I felt lost. And then—

246
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:04,602
I understood what it’s like to look around and feel like you don’t want to do anything at all.

247
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:20,328
Cut.

248
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:25,379
And I brought that feeling into Typhoon.

249
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:29,377
At first, since I hadn’t filmed in a long time—

250
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:32,903
I had this camera shyness.

251
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:36,527
If I act without a camera, it’s fine.

252
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:40,737
But once the camera rolls, the atmosphere changes, so many staff around—

253
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,714
At first I couldn’t adjust fast enough. For me, at least.

254
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,285
I think I get nervous easily.

255
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:50,979
I would…

256
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:54,146
I practiced this line for hours yesterday.

257
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:55,466
I will put our effort in.

258
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:07,080
There’s this fear of not keeping up, of not performing as fully as we rehearsed.

259
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:10,460
Like if I practiced at 100, maybe I could only perform at 70.

260
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,555
There’s always that missing 30%.

261
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:15,410
But this can be fixed with experience.

262
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:20,020
The more I filmed, the more I reviewed what I missed.

263
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:23,322
And I adjusted automatically.

264
00:19:23,518 --> 00:19:27,798
Now that many shooting days have passed, I feel like—

265
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:30,031
I’m getting better and better.

266
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,352
Don’t hold me—like that.

267
00:19:35,146 --> 00:19:36,521
Just follow the feeling, yeah.

268
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:41,041
P’Fah… I'm sorry.

269
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,042
– Let go.
– P’Fah…

270
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:47,423
P’Fah, please don’t leave me.

271
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:51,035
In Part 1 I was totally chill. It felt like just coming to eat.

272
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,272
Eat, chat with friends.

273
00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:59,699
Because one shoot day I’d only have like one or two or three scenes.

274
00:19:59,728 --> 00:20:00,960
and usually in the afternoon.

275
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:03,231
So I had plenty of relaxing time.

276
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:07,488
But in Part 2—it's heavy.

277
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:10,583
Shooting from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m.

278
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:14,454
Hello, this is shooting Q9 for Tonfah–Typhoon.

279
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,354
We’re filming in Chiang Mai.

280
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,494
I’m very excited today. It’s a full-day scene, really long.
The script is super long.

281
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:29,320
– What time did we start?
– 7:30. We started at 7:30. Now it’s…

282
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:31,964
Oh, the watch’s broken.

283
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:35,834
For preparation, like I said—

284
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:41,374
Rest, exercise, memorize the script, do the homework.

285
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:45,530
Because if we memorize well, the work goes fast, it flows.

286
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,928
I prepared myself. I feel like I handled this well.

287
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:52,694
I feel like I can do it.

288
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,568
On set—Bever has his own private side.

289
00:20:56,785 --> 00:21:02,320
When filming, he works.
When resting, he stays in his own corner.

290
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:06,782
He sits and looks at his phone alone. He doesn’t socialize much.

291
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,838
But if P’Ngern, P’Maxky, or Bas come, he’ll play with them.

292
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:18,878
But when it’s just the two of us, Tonliew stays in one corner and he stays in another.
We just keep to ourselves.

293
00:21:19,368 --> 00:21:20,899
There are many moods, many vibes.

294
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:28,752
Maybe because the role is stressful for him,
so he looks for a corner where he won’t feel stressed or overthink.

295
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:37,585
You can tell—some scenes or shooting days,
he seems to pressure himself a bit.

296
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:40,173
But working together feels very flowy.

297
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,294
It’s like he knows exactly what he has to do.

298
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:46,251
Being a good partner means knowing what you need to do—

299
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:50,842
so when we actually work together, everything flows.

300
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,232
He has that. And that’s something I really admire.

301
00:21:58,028 --> 00:21:59,179
P’Bever turns to look at him.

302
00:22:11,137 --> 00:22:16,685
When acting with someone who really prepares,

303
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,688
I feel like he’s already talented, and it makes everything flow.

304
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:24,397
Me and Liew barely need many takes.

305
00:22:24,438 --> 00:22:27,582
Just a few, depending on the surroundings.

306
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:30,687
Mainly, I think we respond to each other well.

307
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,040
Tonfah–Typhoon—

308
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:38,838
What are they like as a pair?
From my perspective, I think they match extremely well.

309
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:47,693
In real life or in character, I believe they’ve synced.

310
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:52,601
Even if they were confused at first—

311
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:55,382
now they’re totally in sync.

312
00:22:55,466 --> 00:23:00,262
Another thing is their work discipline is perfect.

313
00:23:00,644 --> 00:23:04,194
Whether it’s memorizing the script or punctuality, they're very precise.

314
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:09,602
He’s really talented in acting.
It feels like this path is truly his.

315
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,056
His emotional acting feels natural.

316
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,225
I’m impressed because I like people who are natural.

317
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:20,308
Drama scenes—he does them well.

318
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:24,604
I have a weakness with crying. I can’t cry at all.

319
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:27,465
But for him, it’s like he can summon tears on command.

320
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:29,432
Whenever he wants.

321
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,284
Even with a mask and glasses on, he can still cry.

322
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:34,275
How does he even do that?

323
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:35,462
So good.

324
00:23:38,573 --> 00:23:42,336
Someone came to watch? Came to support?

325
00:23:42,924 --> 00:23:45,114
I heard he cried again.

326
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:51,413
Ah, he can still smile.

327
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:52,608
Keep going.

328
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:14,739
A full day of drama.

329
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:15,708
Yeah.

330
00:24:16,111 --> 00:24:17,524
This is Aunt Nuann.

331
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:20,765
– The person Typhoon loves most at home.
– How was it acting together?

332
00:24:20,874 --> 00:24:25,712
His face is sad. His eyes look swollen even before we start.

333
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,388
Right?

334
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:33,554
Actually, in most crying scenes, Liew doesn’t really cry with me.

335
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,675
He cries alone in a room.

336
00:24:36,845 --> 00:24:40,023
And I’m behind the camera.

337
00:24:54,413 --> 00:24:56,728
Amazing—one take and he passed.

338
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,560
So good. He cried—
And this isn’t even the first take he cried today.

339
00:25:01,588 --> 00:25:05,626
He’s been crying since morning. Now it’s afternoon.

340
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:06,918
Still crying.

341
00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:07,847
So good.

342
00:25:07,968 --> 00:25:09,496
– Tears on command?
– Yes.

343
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,536
There was a scene we did together—
His left tear fell, drop by drop.

344
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:19,712
I was like, wow, amazing, how does he do that?

345
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:24,247
So I just kept wiping it.

346
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,552
- Here he goes again, wipe.
- Actually, Tonliew secretly presses a button.

347
00:25:27,837 --> 00:25:31,102
Where’s the button? I’ve been looking for it.

348
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:52,060
I'm actually good at drama.

349
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:55,352
Because the roles I usually get are dramatic.

350
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,266
Maybe I used to crying.

351
00:25:58,342 --> 00:26:05,934
Maybe it’s easier for me to cry—
or maybe some things relate to my real life.

352
00:26:06,025 --> 00:26:12,792
I mixe all of that together,
and that becomes the Typhoon everyone sees.

353
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:57,557
Go, go.

354
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,817
P’Fah, enjoy your meal.

355
00:27:03,907 --> 00:27:11,117
In case one day he realizes someone close is more real than someone in letters — and disappears.

356
00:27:11,347 --> 00:27:13,637
You wouldn’t have the right to chase after him.

357
00:27:15,837 --> 00:27:19,047
Let's talk about friends.

358
00:27:20,797 --> 00:27:28,657
Tonfah, in the series, is the one Arthit consults the most.

359
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:37,817
Because Tonfah,

360
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:40,767
he’s probably the kindest person in the group.

361
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:45,277
And Arthit feels at ease around him.

362
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:48,027
Because he’s quite

363
00:27:48,637 --> 00:27:50,557
easy to talk to about anything.

364
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:54,627
Basically, if there’s a problem, he can fix it for you.

365
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:56,127
Always.

366
00:28:02,257 --> 00:28:03,707
How is it? Got it?

367
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:07,077
That’s the dynamic of Tonfah–Arthit.

368
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,007
Different from Johan—

369
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:13,147
who’s more of the action, rough-and-tough friend.

370
00:28:13,227 --> 00:28:16,567
And today I met P’Maxky too.

371
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:21,897
I normally remember my lines fine after a full day of shooting.

372
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:26,277
But the moment I saw P’Max’s face—

373
00:28:27,797 --> 00:28:31,157
the voice in my head… you know the feeling? It just changes.

374
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:33,877
His real self and his character are totally different.

375
00:28:33,937 --> 00:28:35,907
Behind the scenes, P’Maxky is so funny.

376
00:28:35,977 --> 00:28:38,747
And Dr. Hill is the type who’s—

377
00:28:39,247 --> 00:28:41,597
pretty precise.

378
00:28:42,257 --> 00:28:44,497
A bit of a perfectionist.

379
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:49,827
Actually, I know now who the troublemaker is.

380
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:50,747
Who?

381
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:53,927
That scene earlier, one small line and we couldn’t finish.

382
00:28:54,187 --> 00:28:56,497
When those two left, we wrapped instantly.

383
00:28:56,857 --> 00:29:00,537
- Oops.
- No more cracking up. No one disturbing our focus.

384
00:29:01,937 --> 00:29:04,097
Good thing he doesn't say “annoying.”

385
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:10,047
Let’s go study.

386
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,847
But anyway—they’re all good people.

387
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:19,537
With the Four Minis—

388
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:24,267
it’s always like this. When Typhoon’s alone, it’s like the back of a hand.

389
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:25,737
Dark everywhere.

390
00:29:32,407 --> 00:29:35,597
But with the Four Minis, he flips into another person.

391
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:42,297
He opens up to them completely—problems, everything.

392
00:29:42,387 --> 00:29:44,687
He’s really open.

393
00:29:44,857 --> 00:29:46,417
He tells them everything—feelings and all.

394
00:29:47,637 --> 00:29:48,807
And then you sit up.

395
00:29:54,637 --> 00:29:56,847
Because the Four Minis—

396
00:29:57,117 --> 00:29:59,747
they’re the friends he can rely on, who always help.

397
00:30:00,697 --> 00:30:06,137
They make Typhoon so bright.

398
00:30:15,227 --> 00:30:17,207
And in real life—

399
00:30:18,227 --> 00:30:20,547
we’re already cheerful. And like—

400
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:23,357
we talk about everything just like Typhoon does.

401
00:30:23,477 --> 00:30:25,187
Anything—any topic.

402
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:30,897
Everyone listens no matter what we want to consult about.

403
00:30:31,557 --> 00:30:33,207
We can talk about anything.

404
00:30:34,657 --> 00:30:36,197
May I ask something?

405
00:30:36,507 --> 00:30:40,257
You used to be handsome like Stefan—so if you’re beautiful, what kind of beauty is it?

406
00:30:40,377 --> 00:30:41,937
Me.

407
00:30:42,477 --> 00:30:44,357
- Iconic.
- Beauty like me.

408
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,917
How’s the atmosphere on set?

409
00:30:53,097 --> 00:30:58,237
Tonfah and Typhoon always bring the rain. Wherever we shoot—it rains.

410
00:30:58,267 --> 00:31:03,127
Storms all the time. Sometimes we’re racing against the weather.

411
00:31:06,507 --> 00:31:08,327
It’s raining, guys.

412
00:31:08,637 --> 00:31:09,977
Let’s take shelter.

413
00:31:10,277 --> 00:31:11,977
I’m scared of rain.

414
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:14,297
Go under the roof—why stand in it?

415
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:18,687
On rainy days, is there someone taking care of you?

416
00:31:18,757 --> 00:31:20,427
One’s afraid of rain, one loves it.

417
00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:21,557
Because I still remember—

418
00:31:22,457 --> 00:31:24,037
Stop, copyright!

419
00:31:24,857 --> 00:31:27,557
It was really tough.

420
00:31:27,607 --> 00:31:32,867
Every scene—romantic scenes, beautiful skies—

421
00:31:33,247 --> 00:31:35,307
all came after rain.

422
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:39,057
We always had to hope it would stop.

423
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:45,307
But I feel like the heavens allowed us to film because—

424
00:31:45,517 --> 00:31:50,757
for example, in the confession scene—at first it was raining, sky dark.

425
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:56,667
But we waited, hoping it would stop even just for 20 minutes.

426
00:31:57,007 --> 00:32:00,497
And suddenly it stopped raining.

427
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:02,487
And the sun came out.

428
00:32:03,157 --> 00:32:05,447
We were like, “Okay, shoot now!”

429
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:13,767
It happened so often, especially romantic scenes.

430
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:17,655
Heaven let us shoot every beautiful background scene.

431
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,976
So thank you so much, really.

432
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:24,941
The set atmosphere was super fun.

433
00:32:31,806 --> 00:32:35,995
Do you get that today is rehearsal day?

434
00:32:36,795 --> 00:32:38,477
Rehearsal.

435
00:32:38,477 --> 00:32:41,246
And the real day is? I can't imagine.

436
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,067
Pretty much—

437
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,718
Nothing to gossip about.

438
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:51,720
They don’t prank each other much.

439
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:54,061
But P’Tonliew does.

440
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,838
A lot—he loves teasing people on set.

441
00:33:03,216 --> 00:33:04,779
Are you teasing him again?

442
00:33:56,596 --> 00:33:59,845
Back then, whenever I looked at the sky, I always asked myself.

443
00:34:00,153 --> 00:34:01,652
But today, I finally got the answer.

444
00:34:06,342 --> 00:34:09,156
Do you have anything you'd like to say about this series?

445
00:34:11,203 --> 00:34:13,077
There are mainly two things.

446
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:19,505
The relationship—like you've probably seen from the trailer or read in the novel.

447
00:34:19,536 --> 00:34:23,668
It’s a relationship where both of them are afraid.

448
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:26,590
Afraid of expressing their true feelings.

449
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:29,062
And the second part is about family.

450
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:30,671
Which is all connected.

451
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,754
Because everything begins at the root.

452
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:38,846
I mean, with Typhoon growing up in his kind of family and Tonfah in his.

453
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:43,605
Everything shaped them differently.

454
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,726
So they each have things that aren’t the same.

455
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:50,689
But at the same time, feelings can still connect.

456
00:34:50,975 --> 00:34:55,636
We'll have to see how they connect these two characters emotionally.

457
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:59,034
I want everyone to understand Typhoon that, actually…

458
00:34:59,095 --> 00:35:04,729
he's just a kid who feels like he has no one to rely on, no matter what problems he’s facing.

459
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:08,862
He feels like there’s no solution or no way out at all.

460
00:35:08,979 --> 00:35:15,093
I just want everyone to give him a hug and encourage him a lot.

461
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:22,344
Because this is the only thing he really needs — encouragement, warmth, and kindness.

462
00:35:22,563 --> 00:35:23,402
That's all.

463
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:30,267
I want everyone to imagine that all of you probably have someone…

464
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:34,209
whom you feel you’re willing to give everything to.

465
00:35:34,492 --> 00:35:36,172
In everyone's life. So…

466
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:39,147
I want everyone to see Tonfah as that kind of person.

467
00:35:39,228 --> 00:35:46,705
Because since they were young, he's always seen his brother as someone he wants to take care of the best he can.

468
00:35:46,756 --> 00:35:47,987
As much as possible.

469
00:35:48,073 --> 00:35:54,585
So the way he expresses things… I don’t know if some people might think, “Why does he care *that* much?”

470
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:57,719
But I want you to know that it's really a pure kind of love.

471
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,087
The love he has for his brother.

472
00:35:59,163 --> 00:36:01,326
No matter what form it takes.

473
00:36:01,446 --> 00:36:06,722
What Tonfah wishes for Typhoon is just for him to be happy and smile every day.

474
00:36:07,437 --> 00:36:11,450
Regarding the family issue, I want…

475
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:16,816
everyone to really understand this kid.

476
00:36:17,056 --> 00:36:25,473
I want parents to let their kids have the right to choose — not to direct or force them to be a certain way.

477
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:28,513
I want people…

478
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,047
to be able to make their own decisions.

479
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:36,756
Without someone pointing the way.

480
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,353
Or controlling them.

481
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,630
Because it's not what he wants to do.

482
00:36:42,062 --> 00:36:46,532
As for this part of the story, it's the one year I've been waiting.

483
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:52,717
But if we talk about my whole life in the entertainment industry since I started…

484
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:56,302
I've been waiting for about…

485
00:36:56,662 --> 00:37:00,028
seven or eight years, I think — since I entered the industry.

486
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:04,145
Even though we've gone through things…

487
00:37:04,676 --> 00:37:08,606
I never had a leading role or a series this long.

488
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,544
Never. This is my first time.

489
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,301
So it feels like… I've finally reached this point.

490
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:22,846
I’m really happy. I waited for so long. So having this moment makes me really, really happy.

491
00:37:23,012 --> 00:37:27,114
I’m excited, but I’m trying to stay calm.

492
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:29,416
We don’t know how it’ll turn out once it airs.

493
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:34,390
But I feel like if we watch it and feel fulfilled and happy…

494
00:37:34,556 --> 00:37:38,347
then that means this is the best we could do at this moment.

495
00:37:38,468 --> 00:37:41,046
And that’s okay.

496
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:45,779
I truly believe you'll do really well.

497
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:48,110
From what I've seen while working with you…

498
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:51,172
I feel like you’ll definitely go far.

499
00:37:51,261 --> 00:37:55,224
If you ever feel troubled, you can always come talk to me.

500
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:58,487
You can talk, you can share — no need to be scared.

501
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,859
And anything weighing on your mind…

502
00:38:03,311 --> 00:38:07,385
he’s the type to bottle things up like Typhoon — he doesn’t talk much.

503
00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:11,419
Sometimes I know, but I don’t know how to bring it up.

504
00:38:11,726 --> 00:38:18,487
Because he won’t say it. So yeah — if there’s anything, just share it with me.

505
00:38:19,104 --> 00:38:21,662
If you're upset with me, tell me — because I won’t know.

506
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:25,517
I’m not someone who easily knows how others feel.

507
00:38:25,898 --> 00:38:27,702
So feel free to share. And…

508
00:38:28,913 --> 00:38:31,385
let's keep going together. We still have a lot ahead of us.

509
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:35,339
And let’s take on this series together.

510
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:42,871
So please support us.

511
00:38:42,985 --> 00:38:45,308
*Beside The Sky* — Tonfah and Typhoon.

512
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:48,941
Some people may think it's a drama genre, right?

513
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:56,837
Which is true — it’s a drama. But we also wanted to add some fun and romance.

514
00:38:56,987 --> 00:38:59,485
And it really is like that.

515
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:07,151
From the actors' perspective, we can say this — if you watch it, you won’t be depressed all week.

516
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,815
You’ll get all the flavors — whether it’s

517
00:39:09,935 --> 00:39:12,496
drama, romance, or comedy.

518
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,779
All emotions are packed in there.

519
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:17,003
And the visuals are stunning.

520
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:18,396
I checked every single shot.

521
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:22,033
I guarantee everyone will love it.

522
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:25,741
And we all worked really hard on it.

523
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
The whole team put their heart into it.

524
00:39:28,252 --> 00:39:35,605
We really want everyone to watch it. We’re confident you'll find happiness watching this series.

525
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:38,839
Please give Typhoon lots of love.

526
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,085
Thank you.

527
00:39:40,902 --> 00:39:44,445
Please support our series, Beside The Sky — Tonfah and Typhoon.

528
00:39:44,593 --> 00:39:47,196
The first episode will air on December 18th.

529
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,205
And you can also come watch it together with us at the cinema.

530
00:39:50,585 --> 00:39:56,594
Please don't forget to support us.
Come watch it with us!

531
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:02,071
And don’t forget — you can watch the uncut version exclusively on the WeTV app.

532
00:40:07,975 --> 00:40:11,378
The sea doesn’t look nice today.

533
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:15,723
But whether the sea is beautiful or not doesn’t really matter.

534
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:18,682
You little brat. You damn kid.

535
00:40:18,693 --> 00:40:22,179
You shouldn’t have been born as my kid. Don’t ever show your face to me again.

536
00:40:22,285 --> 00:40:25,442
- No one wants you. Not even me.
- Because to me,

537
00:40:26,082 --> 00:40:27,439
it’s the same every day.

538
00:40:30,855 --> 00:40:32,402
Kids, let’s take a picture.

539
00:40:33,104 --> 00:40:34,351
1 2 3

540
00:40:34,996 --> 00:40:36,800
Switch places.

541
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,966
I'm going to study hard, get into med school, and become a doctor with you.

542
00:40:42,095 --> 00:40:43,618
Let’s be doctors together.

543
00:40:44,462 --> 00:40:46,276
It’ll be a long time before we see each other again.

544
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:47,719
Take care of yourself, okay?

545
00:40:49,126 --> 00:40:49,948
Yeah.

546
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:52,843
The sky changes every second.

547
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:08,530
Typhoon.

548
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:10,886
It’s been so long. How have you been?

549
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,957
Are you doing well?

550
00:41:11,996 --> 00:41:14,913
I thought I wouldn’t get to see you ever again.

551
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:18,529
If we didn’t meet here today, we probably would’ve never met again, right?

552
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:22,473
Didn’t I tell you? If you ever get lost, I’ll come find you myself.

553
00:41:28,594 --> 00:41:30,247
But to me, he’s still the same person.

554
00:41:30,994 --> 00:41:32,578
Why do you like taking pictures of the sky?

555
00:41:32,613 --> 00:41:34,256
Because it looks beautiful.

556
00:41:34,413 --> 00:41:37,976
But when it rains, the sky isn’t beautiful. No one wants to look at it.

557
00:41:38,047 --> 00:41:41,114
But some people learn to be happy even in the rain.

558
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:44,101
Learn to be happy in the rain?

559
00:41:44,895 --> 00:41:47,499
Looks like the power’s going out again. I’ll stay with you.

560
00:41:47,602 --> 00:41:49,987
If you’re scared, you can hold my hand.

561
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:52,559
You’ll stay with me until I fall asleep, right?

562
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:57,972
You’re not alone anymore.
Some of the things that are too heavy for you—share them with me.

563
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:00,833
The chaotic mission begins.

564
00:42:00,843 --> 00:42:03,554
So this is why you like taking pictures of the sky.

565
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:04,890
Because you like P’Fah.

566
00:42:05,532 --> 00:42:08,727
We figured out a way to help you talk to him.

567
00:42:08,923 --> 00:42:10,376
Let’s go.

568
00:42:12,273 --> 00:42:14,545
P’Fah, enjoy your meal.

569
00:42:14,914 --> 00:42:16,302
I just want to be by his side.

570
00:42:16,726 --> 00:42:18,573
- Do you know who it is?
- No idea.

571
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:21,430
From how they had someone else give it to me, they probably don’t want me to know.

572
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:27,662
Someday they’ll realize that someone close to them is more real than someone in a letter.

573
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:29,157
And they can disappear just like that.

574
00:42:29,267 --> 00:42:30,751
And you won’t have the right to follow them.

575
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:35,425
You like him this much. Are you really going to let things between you two be like this?

576
00:42:43,345 --> 00:42:45,077
And the truth waits to be revealed.

577
00:42:45,236 --> 00:42:46,766
- You lied to me, didn’t you?
- No, I didn’t.

578
00:42:46,805 --> 00:42:48,530
I know about Fun already.

579
00:42:50,373 --> 00:42:52,773
I didn’t kill Fun. I didn’t mean to.

580
00:42:52,944 --> 00:42:56,085
It’s really bad. What you did—and that you lied to me.

581
00:42:56,876 --> 00:42:59,687
Everyone loved Fun. I was the unlucky one.

582
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:02,730
Nothing I ever do turns out right.

583
00:43:02,945 --> 00:43:05,065
You probably hate me now.

584
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:07,922
Goodbye.

585
00:43:08,756 --> 00:43:10,245
Bever Patsapon

586
00:43:12,664 --> 00:43:13,828
Tonliew Methaphat

587
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:18,105
Back then, whenever I looked at the sky, I always asked myself—

588
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:19,876
But today, I found the answer.
