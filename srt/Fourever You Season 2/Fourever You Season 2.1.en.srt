1
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:17,917
The sea doesn’t look beautiful today.

2
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:21,619
But whether the sea is beautiful or not doesn’t really matter.

3
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:24,062
Because for me,

4
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,157
it’s the same every single day.

5
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:34,112
But the sky—

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,671
it’s never the same even for one day.

7
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:39,866
Yet it’s still just as mesmerizing.

8
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:43,808
I wonder if you’re looking at the same sky too.

9
00:00:54,952 --> 00:00:57,854
When I was a kid, whenever something upset me,

10
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:00,308
I always came here to hide.

11
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:04,814
This place was our secret base.

12
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:18,703
Phoon… Phoon.

13
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:19,961
Phoon.

14
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:22,657
Fah is here now.

15
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:27,724
He was the only one I wished would find me.

16
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:35,241
Phoon.

17
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:38,047
Fah is here.

18
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:40,863
P'Fah.

19
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,837
And he always managed to find me.

20
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,297
- It’s okay, Phoon.
- P'Fah.

21
00:01:47,518 --> 00:01:49,602
It’s okay. I'm right here.

22
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:53,100
- P'Fah.
- You don’t have to be scared, Phoon.

23
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:56,262
P'Fah.

24
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,282
Where have you been? Are you hurt anywhere?

25
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:34,562
Mom and Dad aren’t back yet.

26
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:35,854
Don’t be scared.

27
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:37,462
I won’t tell Mom and Dad.

28
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:39,773
that you sneaked out to play.

29
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,330
- Really?
- Of course.

30
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:45,650
Thank you, Fah, for bringing Phoon home.

31
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:47,274
Then I’ll head back now.

32
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:50,020
Otherwise Mom and Dad will know we snuck out late.

33
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,871
- I’ll get scolded again.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

34
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:55,949
Come on. Go inside.

35
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:26,856
I thought we’d get to attend the same high school again.

36
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:28,613
What a shame.

37
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:31,216
Then who’s going to tutor me and Phoon?

38
00:03:31,785 --> 00:03:33,684
Fun and Phoon are already good students.

39
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,854
I will study hard.

40
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:37,515
I’ll get into medical school.

41
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:39,278
And become a doctor like you, Fah.

42
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,835
I’ll work hard too.

43
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,368
Let’s become doctors together.

44
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:45,407
Don’t forget us once you have new neighbors, okay?

45
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,435
Aww. I won’t forget you.

46
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,441
Phoon.

47
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:55,567
We probably won’t see each other for a long time.

48
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:57,016
Take good care of yourself.

49
00:03:59,019 --> 00:03:59,524
Yes.

50
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,201
Alright, kids. Come take a photo.

51
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,100
Come on, stand a bit closer.

52
00:04:16,054 --> 00:04:19,225
Alright then. One, two, three.

53
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:21,017
Switch places.

54
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,210
Switch left and right, quickly.

55
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:28,805
One, two, three.

56
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,520
One, two, three.

57
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,465
Ms. Theerapa Chaowakornkul
Born: 13 September 1996
Died: 10 October 2013

58
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:04,675
Phoon came to say goodbye.

59
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:10,038
Goodbye, Fun.

60
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:30,225
Yes, Uncle Kong.

61
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:32,148
Why are you leaving so early?

62
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:34,074
Isn’t your flight this afternoon?

63
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:36,878
I stopped by to see Fun first.

64
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:38,152
Why didn’t you tell me?

65
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,374
I could’ve taken you to the airport.

66
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:41,589
Don’t you have to help my dad with work, Uncle?

67
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:43,503
I didn’t want to bother you.

68
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,413
Bother me? Not at all.

69
00:05:46,004 --> 00:05:48,576
Are you sure you can go to the airport by yourself?

70
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:51,186
Yes, I can.

71
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:55,299
I’ll send the rest of your things after you later.

72
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,980
If you need anything, let me know.

73
00:05:57,194 --> 00:06:01,531
You’re going all the way to Chiang Mai alone. I can’t help but worry.

74
00:06:04,837 --> 00:06:05,912
Thank you.

75
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:08,143
Have a safe trip.

76
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:10,632
Yes.

77
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,557
Fun.

78
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:23,666
Phoon is about to go see P'Fah now.

79
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:51,841
To: Torfun

80
00:09:52,863 --> 00:09:54,662
I’ve arrived in Chiang Mai.

81
00:09:55,016 --> 00:09:56,453
I just got to the dorm.

82
00:09:56,837 --> 00:09:58,745
The semester is about to start.

83
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:01,336
I really feel guilty toward you, Fun.

84
00:10:01,671 --> 00:10:05,542
For failing the medical school entrance exam, even though I tried so hard.

85
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:07,721
I wanted to become a doctor for you.

86
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:10,065
But next year, I’ll definitely make it.

87
00:10:20,343 --> 00:10:21,951
The weather is nice today.

88
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:26,914
I’m thinking of going out to take some photos.
Please wish me luck so I don’t get lost again.

89
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:46,305
Lost again?

90
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:55,426
Excuse me.

91
00:10:57,971 --> 00:10:59,884
How do I get back to the university?

92
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,921
I’m not going that way.

93
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:03,346
That’s a different direction.

94
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:05,700
Then where are you going?

95
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:08,234
I’m heading to Tha Phae Walking Street. Someone called me to pick them up.

96
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,823
The walking street?

97
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:14,783
Yes.

98
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:16,506
Then hop in.

99
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:17,754
Oops.

100
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,207
Sorry.

101
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:27,749
Phoon.

102
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:31,564
Do you remember me, Fah?

103
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:38,970
Yes.

104
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:44,241
It’s been so long. Almost four years, right?

105
00:12:44,736 --> 00:12:46,795
How have you been, Phoon? Are you doing okay?

106
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:50,848
I’m doing fine.

107
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:52,351
Really?

108
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:53,998
What are you doing here all by yourself?

109
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:00,881
Oh—Tonfah. It’s been a long time.

110
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:03,429
I’m doing well. How about you?

111
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:06,389
We’re doing fine too. Are you here alone?

112
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:08,894
Yeah, but I’m heading back soon.

113
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:16,920
Phoon. Phoon.

114
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:19,798
Phoon. Phoon.

115
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:21,933
Phoon.

116
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,757
P'Fah.

117
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:43,546
I saw this little guy running around in the rain by the roadside,

118
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:46,887
so you followed it and ended up getting lost here, right?

119
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:53,210
Yes.

120
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,195
I’m sorry for causing you trouble again, P'Fah.

121
00:13:58,346 --> 00:13:59,576
It’s not a problem.

122
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:05,010
What did I tell you?

123
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,117
If you get lost, just sit and wait.

124
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,211
I’ll come find you myself.

125
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:24,425
I found you.

126
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:47,407
So you’re actually studying here?

127
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:49,485
I thought you were just here on vacation.

128
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:52,339
The semester doesn’t even start for another two months.

129
00:14:54,964 --> 00:14:57,035
I just wanted to try living here first.

130
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:00,240
There’s still a lot I need to adjust to.

131
00:15:01,404 --> 00:15:04,662
What made you decide to come study so far away by yourself?

132
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:06,795
Well…

133
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:08,968
I just wanted to give it a try.

134
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:13,211
What faculty are you in?

135
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:15,521
Veterinary Medicine.

136
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:20,891
I thought you wouldn’t like that field.

137
00:15:22,157 --> 00:15:25,164
No, I actually like it quite a bit.

138
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:28,531
And…

139
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:30,450
You’re studying medicine, right?

140
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:31,922
Yeah.

141
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:38,682
Thank you.

142
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,354
I really thought I’d never see you again, Phoon.

143
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:50,628
Yeah…

144
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:54,408
Oh—

145
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:56,044
So you came here alone?

146
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:57,370
Did you come with any friends?

147
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:00,122
I came by myself.

148
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:01,445
Really?

149
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:02,776
That’s impressive.

150
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:12,280
You haven’t changed much at all, Phoon.

151
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,748
You look just the same.

152
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,945
It really brings back memories of when we were kids.

153
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:19,182
Back then,

154
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:21,357
we were always together.

155
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,509
You, me, and Fun too.

156
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,389
By the way, how’s your dad doing?

157
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:36,158
I haven’t heard anything since you moved out.

158
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:41,322
He’s doing fine.

159
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:44,408
- Mm.
- My mom...

160
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:48,853
I don’t really know how she’s doing.

161
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:53,874
What do you mean?

162
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,814
My parents divorced.

163
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:02,106
My mom moved out after that.

164
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,619
I’m sorry, Phoon.

165
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,081
Are you okay?

166
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,438
How’s Fun doing?

167
00:17:24,537 --> 00:17:26,151
Fun’s doing fine.

168
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:10,767
Thanks for driving me back.

169
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:12,805
Drive safely.

170
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,592
Okay. See you.

171
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:15,622
Yeah.

172
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:15,727
To: Torfun

173
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:47,142
Dear Torfun,

174
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,481
I ran into P'Fah today by chance.

175
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,152
I was really shocked.

176
00:19:52,697 --> 00:19:54,106
I didn’t know what to do.

177
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,216
There were so many things I wanted to say to him,

178
00:19:57,386 --> 00:20:00,554
but when it came down to it, I could barely speak.

179
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:03,462
He looked happy to see me.

180
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:05,945
He even asked about you.

181
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:07,924
And I ended up lying,

182
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:10,875
saying you were doing fine.

183
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,693
I’m sorry I lied to him like that.

184
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:38,051
I was afraid that if he knew the truth,

185
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:40,848
he’d be disappointed in me.

186
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:46,314
He might get angry, just like Mom and Dad did.

187
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:49,229
You’re not here anymore,

188
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:52,271
and if P'Fah isn’t by my side either,

189
00:20:52,928 --> 00:20:54,586
who would I have left?

190
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:28,512
You lied to me, didn’t you?

191
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:32,408
- No, I didn’t.
- I already know about Fun.

192
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:36,922
This is really bad—what you did, and lying to me too.

193
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:40,349
Is there anything else you’re lying to me about?

194
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:42,431
Huh?

195
00:21:46,354 --> 00:21:48,373
I’m seriously disappointed in you, Phoon.

196
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,524
You hurt everyone, especially Fun.

197
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,441
If you hadn’t done that back then, Fun wouldn’t have died.

198
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:57,413
Do you even realize you’re the one at fault?

199
00:21:58,447 --> 00:21:59,136
Yes.

200
00:22:02,435 --> 00:22:03,565
Another thing—

201
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:05,951
I hate liars.

202
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:09,496
And I can’t forgive people who keep hurting others.

203
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,454
It’d be better if we never see each other again.

204
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:16,527
P'Fah, I’m sorry.

205
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,528
- Let go.
- P'Fah.

206
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:20,823
P'Fah, I’m sorry.

207
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:22,721
P'Fah.

208
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:25,419
P'Fah, I’m sorry.

209
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:31,120
P'Fah, please don’t leave me.

210
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,653
Please don’t leave me, P'Fah.

211
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:49,946
Thank you.

212
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,226
Two pork skewers and one sticky rice, please.

213
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:05,611
Alright, dear. Why are you eating so little?

214
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:09,728
Are you feeling sick?

215
00:23:10,192 --> 00:23:11,727
You look a bit pale.

216
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,334
No.

217
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:16,493
Here you go.

218
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:18,373
- How much is it?
- 20 baht.

219
00:23:21,622 --> 00:23:22,564
Thank you.

220
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:18,640
My battery’s about to die.

221
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:42,690
- Come here. Now.
- Ow!

222
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:44,257
I told you to come here!

223
00:26:44,714 --> 00:26:46,539
Get in. Go inside.

224
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:48,623
Do you even know what you’ve done?

225
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,011
How many times have I told you not to go into my office?

226
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:57,588
Do you know that the vase you broke is worth more than your life?

227
00:26:57,797 --> 00:26:59,142
Get that through your head.

228
00:26:59,336 --> 00:27:01,602
Stay in here. Don’t go anywhere.

229
00:27:02,794 --> 00:27:04,336
Dad… Dad…

230
00:27:04,377 --> 00:27:06,413
- Stop crying.
- Dad, I’m sorry.

231
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,509
Dad, I’m sorry. I won’t do it again.

232
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:12,354
- Don’t call me.
- Dad…

233
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,312
You little bastard. Shut up.

234
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:18,816
P'Fah! Fun! Someone, please help me!

235
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,142
- Phoon, are you inside?
- P'Fah, please help me.

236
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,451
It’s so dark. I’m scared, P'Fah.

237
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,237
Easy, Phoon.

238
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:29,441
It’s really dark in there.

239
00:27:30,242 --> 00:27:31,654
Reach your hand out.

240
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:36,740
Don’t be scared. I’ll stay with you until Uncle Kong comes back.

241
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:39,459
Don’t go anywhere, P'Fah.

242
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,257
Hello, P'Fah. Is this a good time to talk?

243
00:28:01,925 --> 00:28:03,167
Is something wrong?

244
00:28:04,874 --> 00:28:07,282
Uh… it’s just that at my dorm—

245
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:08,887
the power went out.

246
00:28:09,697 --> 00:28:11,512
My phone battery’s almost dead too.

247
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,345
Are you still afraid of the dark?

248
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:19,050
I am.

249
00:28:20,924 --> 00:28:22,309
What room are you in?

250
00:28:24,887 --> 00:28:26,731
Room 302.

251
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:31,890
I’ll get there before your phone dies,
so don’t hang up until we meet, okay?

252
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:34,240
Okay.

253
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:03,771
Phoon?

254
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:07,678
Phoon, are you okay?

255
00:29:13,757 --> 00:29:18,779
I asked the security guard downstairs.
He said the power will likely be out until morning.

256
00:29:22,656 --> 00:29:25,429
Then why don’t you stay over at my place tonight?

257
00:29:29,795 --> 00:29:31,170
Would that be okay?

258
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:34,087
There’s no other choice.

259
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:35,622
You don’t have to feel awkward about it.

260
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,223
Let’s go.

261
00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:45,727
Careful.

262
00:30:21,505 --> 00:30:22,435
Let’s go.

263
00:30:41,887 --> 00:30:44,602
It’s not as dark here. Do you feel better?

264
00:30:46,838 --> 00:30:47,574
Yes.

265
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:55,248
Do you want to wipe your sweat?

266
00:30:57,263 --> 00:31:00,060
Thank you.

267
00:31:34,045 --> 00:31:35,081
Make yourself at home.

268
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:37,250
Okay.

269
00:31:38,602 --> 00:31:40,285
Are you sleepy? Want to go to bed now?

270
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:43,588
I can sleep now.

271
00:31:44,983 --> 00:31:46,518
Then go sleep in the bedroom.

272
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:49,696
Um… I can sleep on the couch.

273
00:31:50,028 --> 00:31:51,198
You should sleep in the bedroom.

274
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:52,737
I’ll sleep outside.

275
00:31:55,142 --> 00:31:55,771
Come on.

276
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:12,416
Here.

277
00:32:12,783 --> 00:32:15,401
I’m not sure if it’ll fit you, though.

278
00:32:15,555 --> 00:32:16,512
Try it on.

279
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,728
Thank you.

280
00:32:21,097 --> 00:32:23,419
If you need anything, just call me.

281
00:32:25,822 --> 00:32:27,162
Actually—

282
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:29,462
I really can sleep on the couch.

283
00:32:31,103 --> 00:32:32,377
I don’t want to bother you.

284
00:32:35,502 --> 00:32:38,137
It’s fine. The bed’s more comfortable.

285
00:32:39,811 --> 00:32:41,290
Then—

286
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:46,936
We could sleep in the same room.

287
00:32:48,185 --> 00:32:49,237
It’s okay.

288
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:51,097
You sleeping there is better.

289
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:54,931
Good night.

290
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:56,284
Um—

291
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:57,968
Good night.

292
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:00,672
- P'Fah.
- Yeah?

293
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,580
Thank you.

294
00:33:04,493 --> 00:33:05,214
Yeah.

295
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:46,287
Sorry. I was just grabbing a book.

296
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:47,807
I ended up waking you.

297
00:33:53,802 --> 00:33:55,681
It’s okay. I wasn’t asleep yet.

298
00:33:56,457 --> 00:33:57,844
Is the bed uncomfortable?

299
00:33:58,761 --> 00:33:59,640
No.

300
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,120
Sleeping with the light on makes it harder to sleep deeply.

301
00:34:08,536 --> 00:34:09,755
Want to try turning it off?

302
00:34:11,022 --> 00:34:12,105
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

303
00:34:12,445 --> 00:34:13,422
Why not?

304
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:17,508
Maybe it’ll help your fear of the dark too.

305
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:21,130
I’ve tried before, but—

306
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,859
I really can’t.

307
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,829
Then I’ll stay with you. Try your best.

308
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:34,518
If you’re scared—

309
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,226
you can hold my hand

310
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:06,557
You’ll stay with me until I fall asleep, right?

311
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:08,214
Yes.

312
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:11,562
Once you’re asleep, I’ll go sleep outside.

313
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:16,740
- P'Fah.
- Yes?

314
00:35:18,336 --> 00:35:19,597
Good night.

315
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,428
Good night.

316
00:36:12,288 --> 00:36:13,429
You’re awake?

317
00:36:15,745 --> 00:36:17,428
Sorry I woke up late.

318
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:19,425
It’s okay.

319
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:24,720
Mm.

320
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:28,103
Go shower and get dressed. We’ll grab something to eat.

321
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,331
Thank you.

322
00:36:34,284 --> 00:36:35,616
Hey, Phoon.

323
00:36:37,388 --> 00:36:39,155
Can I get Fun’s LINE ID?

324
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,068
We haven’t talked in a long time. I want to know how she’s doing.

325
00:36:47,613 --> 00:36:48,761
Uh—

326
00:36:49,226 --> 00:36:50,280
Wait a sec.

327
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:51,718
I’ll send it to you.

328
00:36:52,774 --> 00:36:53,607
Okay.

329
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,965
So Fun’s studying medicine near home?

330
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:33,122
Yeah.

331
00:37:34,345 --> 00:37:37,805
That’s surprising. Why did Fun let you study here alone?

332
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,125
I insisted on coming by myself.

333
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:49,445
She didn’t even come to drop you off?

334
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:52,456
Did something happen while I was away?

335
00:37:53,066 --> 00:37:54,379
Did you fight?

336
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,379
No, nothing like that.

337
00:37:58,272 --> 00:38:00,648
She thinks I’m grown up now, so—

338
00:38:00,902 --> 00:38:02,213
she doesn’t worry as much anymore.

339
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:03,114
I see.

340
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,272
Yeah.

341
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:12,682
P'Fah.

342
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:13,765
Yeah?

343
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:17,134
You haven’t heard anything from my family?

344
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,060
No.

345
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:21,040
Why do you ask?

346
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:25,485
Nothing.

347
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:26,696
- Oh.
- I thought—

348
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,918
your mom and dad were still in touch with my dad.

349
00:38:30,882 --> 00:38:33,398
My parents hardly ever talk about your dad.

350
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,081
It’s like he disappeared.

351
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,268
So I thought—

352
00:38:38,438 --> 00:38:40,222
I’d never see you or Fun again.

353
00:38:46,568 --> 00:38:49,160
Will you ever go back to Phuket?

354
00:38:49,982 --> 00:38:51,077
Probably not.

355
00:38:51,282 --> 00:38:52,954
The old house was sold.

356
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,109
If we hadn’t met here—

357
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:02,493
we might never have met again, right?

358
00:39:03,948 --> 00:39:05,522
But we did meet.

359
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:06,752
What a coincidence.

360
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:08,669
Out of so many universities—

361
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:09,800
you—

362
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:11,765
ended up choosing the same one as me.

363
00:39:13,749 --> 00:39:14,746
Yeah, I guess so.

364
00:40:00,423 --> 00:40:02,554
Fun, it’s Fah.

365
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,401
I ran into Phoon today. He’s studying at the same university as me.

366
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,188
Really?

367
00:40:25,808 --> 00:40:27,605
Is something going on at home?

368
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:33,583
Why would you ask that?

369
00:40:39,352 --> 00:40:41,797
Phoon seems different. Different enough to worry me.

370
00:40:41,924 --> 00:40:44,998
Maybe I’m just overthinking it.

371
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,562
No. He’s still the same Phoon.

372
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:12,571
Are you free tomorrow? Let’s go out.

373
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,629
You look tired.

374
00:41:41,853 --> 00:41:43,103
Did you have trouble sleeping again?

375
00:41:44,971 --> 00:41:46,254
Well—

376
00:41:47,401 --> 00:41:48,051
yeah.

377
00:41:51,939 --> 00:41:54,780
Did you sleep well the night you stayed over?

378
00:41:56,497 --> 00:41:57,865
I did.

379
00:41:58,671 --> 00:41:59,472
Then—

380
00:41:59,743 --> 00:42:00,961
if you can’t sleep again,

381
00:42:01,324 --> 00:42:02,831
you can stay over again.

382
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,971
How long has the insomnia been going on?

383
00:42:15,207 --> 00:42:16,411
For a long time.

384
00:42:18,062 --> 00:42:19,294
Have you seen a doctor?

385
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,694
I have.

386
00:42:23,065 --> 00:42:24,348
Did it help at all?

387
00:42:26,951 --> 00:42:28,106
Not really.

388
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:33,607
Have you talked to anyone about your fear of the dark or enclosed spaces?

389
00:42:33,811 --> 00:42:35,266
I think they might be related.

390
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:38,299
No, I haven’t.

391
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:41,419
Then let’s go. I’ll take you.

392
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:43,988
It’s okay.

393
00:42:49,743 --> 00:42:52,020
Have you eaten yet?

394
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:55,690
I have.

395
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,432
Don’t lie to me.

396
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,893
You haven’t eaten, right?

397
00:43:08,201 --> 00:43:08,893
Right.

398
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,272
Do you usually eat this little?

399
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:31,474
Are you sick?

400
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:34,491
No.

401
00:43:38,128 --> 00:43:40,195
I think we should make a deal.

402
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:45,277
You finish your meal, and I’ll take you out.

403
00:43:45,435 --> 00:43:46,047
Deal?

404
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:47,382
Why?

405
00:43:47,671 --> 00:43:49,752
To fix a kid’s bad habit of not eating properly.

406
00:43:51,151 --> 00:43:54,161
- But—
- I’m not taking you out for free.

407
00:43:54,254 --> 00:43:55,625
Let’s call it a fair exchange.

408
00:43:55,776 --> 00:43:57,392
Then you don’t get anything out of it.

409
00:43:57,967 --> 00:43:59,645
So, do we have a deal?

410
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,257
Alright.

411
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,986
Finish it quickly so we can go out.

412
00:44:34,164 --> 00:44:35,764
Why are you making that face?

413
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:37,853
I’m full.

414
00:44:39,962 --> 00:44:41,733
The view here is really beautiful.

415
00:44:42,074 --> 00:44:44,604
Totally worth finishing your meal.

416
00:44:50,004 --> 00:44:51,877
Let’s go pay respect at the Buddha first.

417
00:44:52,653 --> 00:44:53,328
Shall we?

418
00:45:36,939 --> 00:45:38,776
Why do you like taking photos of the sky?

419
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:42,257
Because it’s beautiful.

420
00:45:42,962 --> 00:45:44,162
Hmm?

421
00:45:58,037 --> 00:45:58,951
P'Fah.

422
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,134
Wanna play a game?

423
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:03,505
What kind of game?

424
00:46:05,903 --> 00:46:09,320
We take turns asking one question each.

425
00:46:09,882 --> 00:46:11,783
And if it’s a question you don’t want to answer?

426
00:46:13,444 --> 00:46:14,521
Well—

427
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:16,965
Well—

428
00:46:17,348 --> 00:46:19,091
Then you don’t have to answer.

429
00:46:19,364 --> 00:46:20,451
Just kidding.

430
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,231
Sure. Who goes first?

431
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:24,774
Me.

432
00:46:25,173 --> 00:46:25,859
Mm.

433
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:29,401
I want to ask you something, P'Fah.

434
00:46:33,628 --> 00:46:36,285
While we weren’t seeing each other,

435
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:39,782
how have you been?

436
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:43,506
That’s more ordinary than I expected.

437
00:46:45,325 --> 00:46:47,645
I’ve been fine.

438
00:46:47,918 --> 00:46:49,625
Nothing special.

439
00:46:50,189 --> 00:46:53,091
Going to classes, reading,

440
00:46:53,597 --> 00:46:55,109
and tutoring on the side.

441
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:57,448
What about you, Phoon?

442
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:04,045
Me too.

443
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,989
Nothing special.

444
00:47:07,582 --> 00:47:08,149
Really.

445
00:47:10,554 --> 00:47:12,675
How were your high school friends?

446
00:47:13,379 --> 00:47:15,008
We were close, like normal.

447
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:18,715
Studied together, hung out sometimes.

448
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,266
Nothing out of the ordinary.

449
00:47:20,742 --> 00:47:22,345
And how about you?

450
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,179
I’m doing okay.

451
00:47:28,435 --> 00:47:29,379
Mm.

452
00:47:32,905 --> 00:47:35,398
What about your friends now?

453
00:47:36,149 --> 00:47:37,983
My friends now…

454
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,994
They’re all kind of weird.

455
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:46,552
But it’s fun being with them.

456
00:47:48,364 --> 00:47:50,173
You don’t have friends here yet, right?

457
00:47:56,968 --> 00:47:58,349
How’s Sri Thong?

458
00:48:01,515 --> 00:48:03,511
Did you get lost?

459
00:48:04,906 --> 00:48:05,872
P'Fah.

460
00:48:06,585 --> 00:48:08,080
Can we keep it?

461
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:12,189
I think

462
00:48:12,371 --> 00:48:14,460
we should find someone else to adopt it.

463
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:16,968
But I want to keep it.

464
00:48:18,951 --> 00:48:20,530
It must be really lonely.

465
00:48:21,194 --> 00:48:22,776
If it stays with us, it won’t be.

466
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:25,765
Are you lonely, Phoon?

467
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,654
You have everyone.

468
00:48:28,893 --> 00:48:30,459
My parents aren’t with me,

469
00:48:31,562 --> 00:48:33,419
and P'Fah and Fun are both busy.

470
00:48:34,226 --> 00:48:35,158
I think

471
00:48:35,715 --> 00:48:37,568
your dad wouldn’t allow it.

472
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:43,703
Then I’ll take care of it.

473
00:48:43,853 --> 00:48:46,007
And you can come play with it often, okay?

474
00:48:46,442 --> 00:48:47,287
Really?

475
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,478
Thank you.

476
00:48:52,248 --> 00:48:53,860
What do you want to name it?

477
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,949
How about “Sri Thong”?

478
00:49:01,337 --> 00:49:02,968
Mm, that’s nice.

479
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:06,416
Sri Thong.

480
00:49:23,288 --> 00:49:25,060
Sri Thong.

481
00:49:30,645 --> 00:49:31,597
Oh no.

482
00:49:39,951 --> 00:49:40,979
I’m sorry.

483
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:43,426
Even though you took such good care of it,

484
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:44,853
but when it was with me—

485
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,642
You don’t have to apologize.

486
00:49:46,888 --> 00:49:49,177
I believe you did your best.

487
00:49:55,724 --> 00:49:57,168
Now it’s my turn to ask.

488
00:50:03,588 --> 00:50:04,973
May I ask

489
00:50:05,573 --> 00:50:07,743
something personal?

490
00:50:08,235 --> 00:50:08,974
Sure.

491
00:50:15,771 --> 00:50:17,917
Right now,

492
00:50:18,823 --> 00:50:21,360
are you dating anyone?

493
00:50:23,468 --> 00:50:24,971
No, I’m not.

494
00:50:27,287 --> 00:50:28,170
That’s strange.

495
00:50:28,703 --> 00:50:30,688
- What about someone you’re talking to?
- No.

496
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:34,902
Oh.

497
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:37,804
Is that strange?

498
00:50:38,456 --> 00:50:39,878
For me?

499
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:42,174
Love feels very distant to me.

500
00:50:45,035 --> 00:50:46,035
Why?

501
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:52,047
I dated someone back in high school.

502
00:50:53,256 --> 00:50:55,302
After a while, I realized

503
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,514
love is complicated.

504
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:02,648
And I felt like I couldn’t really handle it.

505
00:51:05,282 --> 00:51:06,988
So we broke up.

506
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,768
After that,

507
00:51:10,174 --> 00:51:12,635
love wasn’t something I was looking for anymore.

508
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:17,305
I see.

509
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:23,900
They even said

510
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:28,051
that I were like their sky.

511
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:31,921
I never wanted to be that.

512
00:51:37,121 --> 00:51:38,142
When it rains,

513
00:51:38,917 --> 00:51:40,600
the sky isn’t beautiful.

514
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:42,696
No one wants to look at it.

515
00:51:45,417 --> 00:51:48,041
But people expect the sky to be beautiful every day.

516
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:53,484
I

517
00:51:54,263 --> 00:51:55,921
can’t be anyone’s sky.

518
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:03,005
Can’t you be

519
00:52:03,951 --> 00:52:05,321
my sky?

520
00:52:27,653 --> 00:52:29,968
A friend? What’s his name?

521
00:52:31,374 --> 00:52:32,568
Johan.

522
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,954
- Interested?
- No.

523
00:52:35,365 --> 00:52:36,580
I’m taking the medical exam.

524
00:52:36,607 --> 00:52:40,915
Could you tutor me, Fah?

525
00:52:41,334 --> 00:52:46,854
In Mawsynram, India, rainfall reaches over 10,800 millimeters a year—
about nine times more than here.

526
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,478
The sky looks beautiful today.

527
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:51,717
It’s nice that the sky can make you smile this much.

528
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:53,595
Phoon,

529
00:52:54,065 --> 00:52:55,391
keep smiling, okay?
