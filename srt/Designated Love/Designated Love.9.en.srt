=Episode 9=

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,420
(Does being jealous mean I like him?)

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,940
(Is it wrong to be possessive?)

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,020
(Can humans date an NPC?
No result)

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:18,980
This won't do.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,180
You are a normal girl.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,780
You are not the type
that's addicted to the internet.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,900
So of course
I can't spend too much time with an NPC.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,460
You often drink instant coffee.

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,860
Is it good?

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,220
I want to have some, too.

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,060
I had lunch with Jiang Han.

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,020
Congrats.

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,980
No need.

16
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,820
Jiang Jue was also there.

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,140
If it weren't for him,

18
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,780
Jiang Han wouldn't have come for lunch.

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,540
What do you want to say?

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,340
Do you know what childhood sweethearts

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,740
mean?

22
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,140
We know each other well.

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,300
Our parents go way back.

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,780
We know everything about each other

25
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,140
since we were kids.

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,500
He can never give up on our friends,

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,180
parents,

28
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,540
and old memories.

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,340
This is not a simple choice to make.

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,980
If you represent four years,

31
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,940
then what I represent

32
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,260
is everything he can't lose.

33
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,500
I won't lose.

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,420
So why isn't he with you right now?

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,060
We need time.

36
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,460
But he is still pursuing me.

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,780
I said, we need time.

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,380
Do you know
what you're doing now is making you look bad?

39
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,980
If you are really that confident,

40
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,140
you won't be here trying to brag.

41
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:15,020
(A little something to help with comfort.
From Han)

42
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,100
What's wrong?

43
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,980
Don't you like it?

44
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,140
Do you know what it feels like

45
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,300
to be pursued by an ex?

46
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,260
It's more disgusting

47
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,020
than having gum under my feet.

48
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,460
This can't be right.

49
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,900
The gifts I select never go wrong.

50
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,260
(Game begins)

51
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,380
Now that you have a girlfriend,

52
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,020
you need to work on your photography skills.

53
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,300
He knew that I couldn't wake up on time,

54
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,900
so he'd always wait for me downstairs
when we were still students.

55
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,500
At times he would wait for an hour.

56
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,460
Jiang Han

57
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,820
is mine and I won't let you have him.

58
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,660
This is not a simple choice to make.

59
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,660
If you represent four years,

60
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,660
what I represent

61
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,220
is everything he can't lose.

62
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,500
I won't lose.

72

Xi.

78
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,300
I'm going on a business trip tomorrow.

79
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,140
Will you miss me?

80
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,300
No.

81
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,140
How disappointing.

82
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:07,900
Right?

83
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,780
Han?

84
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,820
Is there something you want, Mr. Jiang?

85
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,340
Come with me to see a client at noon.

86
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,940
It's about the cards of Yesterday's Promise

87
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,380
and the design ideas of the background.

88
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,420
We need a designer there.

89
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,700
I can go.

90
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,940
Xi is about to leave soon.

91
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,340
And I also participated in the cards design.

92
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,380
The client will also attend the launch event.

93
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:27,980
It's very important.

94
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:33,700
I got it.

95
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,140
Did you change your phone?

96
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,180
Isn't the client coming?

97
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,700
He should be here soon.

98
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,780
I am not experienced

99
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,700
in dating someone.
