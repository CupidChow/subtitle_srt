=Episode 13=

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:05,980
No way.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,460
Is Director Qin really planning on
being Mr. Jiang's sister-in-law?

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,420
Are you dumb?

6
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,100
I knew something
was going on between them a long time ago.

7
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,100
The two were being so sneaky.

8
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,020
And they were having so much fun together.

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,900
If you tell me that
nothing was going on between them,

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,580
I would not trust it.

11
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,460
True.

12
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,220
But,

13
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,500
no matter if it's Jiang Han or Jiang Jue,

14
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,540
it's better than some online relationship.

15
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,800
Tell me about it.

16
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,180
Who do you think Director Qin will choose?

17
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,700
The ex-boyfriend Mr. Jiang,

18
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,420
the older brother of her ex-boyfriend,
Jiang Jue,

19
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,340
or the mysterious online boyfriend?

20
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,080
It has to be Jiang Jue.

21
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,860
Mr. Jiang has been out of the picture
for a long time.

22
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,860
- You can tell by how Xi's been acting lately.
- Right.

23
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,300
As for that online boyfriend,

24
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,820
he might be likable,

25
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,840
but he can't beat reality.

26
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,300
Trust me,

27
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,740
I've been through it all.

28
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,740
Xi.

29
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,300
Ah.

30
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,020
Carry on.

31
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,460
Carry on.

32
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,890
What are you doing?

33
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,340
You guys have been really friendly
with each other lately.

34
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,780
It's a private matter.

35
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,500
I have nothing to tell you.

36
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,140
Since we will be a family soon,

37
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,860
I will also be honest with you.

38
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,540
Recently,

39
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:05,860
I have been pursuing Xi.

40
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:07,860
Rest assured.

41
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,780
I have broken up with all my girlfriends,

42
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,500
local and abroad.

43
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,180
Now,

44
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,660
the only person in my mind is Xi.

45
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,740
Didn't you already like someone?

46
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,460
Right.

47
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,980
But it's over.

48
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,700
What do you mean?

49
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,660
I mean it literally.

50
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,740
When I was at my saddest moment,

51
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,340
Jiang Jue was there for me.

52
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,340
Thank you.

53
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:26,860
I'm glad

54
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,620
I was there for you.

55
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,380
Lady first.

56
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,340
What are you doing?

57
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,540
(Prank Your Ex-boyfriend)
Please enter the advertisement

58
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,980
(Send)
you want Ms. Qing to see in the game.

59
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,900
(Had fun fooling me, Jiang Xiaohan?)

60
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,340
Who wants to go out with you?

61
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,420
Dream on.

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,700
It's fine.

63
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,140
If you don't leave with me,

64
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,560
I can come with you.

65
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,780
(Had fun fooling me, Jiang Xiaohan?)

66
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,620
When did you find out?

67
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,180
Watching me getting heartbroken twice
over the same person.

68
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,340
Did you have fun?

69
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,460
Was it fun?

70
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,820
I never wanted to fool you.

71
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,980
I ordered this game three years ago.

72
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,020
Three years ago?

73
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,100
My god.

74
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,180
You planned all this three years ago?

75
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,300
I didn't know you cared so much
about Shen Jingjing.

76
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,220
I only knew that after being with me,

77
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,260
you smiled less and less.

78
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,700
I also found it difficult to understand you.

79
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,580
But I didn't know
how to talk to you about it.

80
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,300
I was afraid that
you'd break up with me if I brought it up.

81
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,460
I couldn't let you go.

82
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,060
At that time,

83
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,240
I saw the ad for this custom game.

84
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,020
Are you saying

85
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,340
this game was completely made up by you.

86
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,100
No.

87
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,860
I only told them my needs.

88
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,260
They were the ones
that came up with the plan.

89
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
I also found out that it was a prank game

90
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,500
just before entering the game.

91
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,260
What about Shen Jingjing?

92
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,500
Why was she also in it?

93
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,420
I don't know, either.

94
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,620
I signed a power of attorney.

95
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,220
How did you log into this game?

96
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,700
Right here.

97
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,500
Oh my god.

98
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,740
What limited my imagination?

99
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,980
So you knew when I logged into the game?

100
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,660
I never thought you'd do something like this.

101
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,540
Jiang Han.

102
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,060
Stop wasting your time on me.

103
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,060
It's really exhausting to be with you.

104
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,400
I tried to tell you the truth,

105
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:15,820
but...

106
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,420
But I also told you to never lie to me.

107
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,500
Right?

108
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,580
I'm sorry.

109
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,380
Stop saying you're sorry.

110
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,060
It was my fault
for not knowing who you really are.

111
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,940
I made the same mistake twice.

112
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,420
So there won't be a third time.

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,060
Are you giving up on me?

114
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,360
All I want is a normal boyfriend

115
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,620
and a normal relationship.

116
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,220
I can't deal with someone like you.

117
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,260
Actually our current situation

118
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,660
is also partly my fault.

119
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,380
I know you don't talk much

120
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,580
and you hide everything in your heart.

121
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,500
But I also did the same thing
and said nothing.

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,620
Jiang Jue is different.

123
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,900
Even if I don't say anything,

124
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:02,900
he'll know

125
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,820
when I am happy

126
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,940
and when I am sad.

127
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,940
Are you really going out with Jiang Jue?

128
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,100
Yeah.

129
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,760
I was really upset at that time

130
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,300
and I didn't know how to

131
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,260
deal with you.

132
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,380
You and Jiang Xiaohan didn't notice it,
right?

133
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,580
But he did.

134
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,380
He was the one that got me out of it.

135
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,940
Next week is the launch event.

136
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,380
It should go well.

137
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,540
I will leave in a couple of days.

138
