(iDream Start-up)

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:10,860
Morning.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,100
Director Qin.

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,420
You are in a good mood.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:14,980
I am.

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,180
Is it related to Mr. Jiang?

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,520
Not at all.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,020
Xi.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,780
What?

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,820
I'm coming to
hand in my resignation letter today.

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,940
Hope you'd find a better company.

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,300
What if I told you that

15
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,500
I have some regrets?

16
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:38,860
Will you believe me?

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:43,860
Of course I will.

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,720
You threw away your dignity for a guy,

19
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,260
but got nothing in return.

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,100
You should have regrets.

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,340
No.

22
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,740
You should forever remember this lesson.

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,380
You should not waste your prime years

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,660
on anyone else but yourself.

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,840
How bitter.

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,380
So

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,500
isn't it nice to date an expert of love?

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,940
I can make you happy

29
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,020
and laugh.

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,140
Not many men can do that.

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,200
Am I right, Xi?

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,740
Don't call me that.

33
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,820
We haven't seen each other for days.

34
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,100
Do you miss me?

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,740
Not at all.

36
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,260
How upsetting.

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,200
I have been thinking about you
the whole time.

38
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,580
Xi.

39
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,260
Hey...

40
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,300
You look better recently.

41
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,420
I can tell

42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,780
from the look on your face

43
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,980
that you're dating someone.

44
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,660
Are you blind?

45
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,060
I'm basing it on my experience.

46
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,420
Look,

47
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,300
from your head

48
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,780
to your feet,

49
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,540
from your inside to your outside.

50
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,500
And even

51
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,660
every hair of yours...

52
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,780
Can you quiet down?

53
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,100
It's working hours.

54
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,620
Haven't you noticed

55
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,380
that there is one person
missing in the office today?

56
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,060
He took the day off.

57
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,980
He has been busy with the launch event

58
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,980
and fell sick.

59
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,500
It's none of my business now.

60
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,260
What a heartless person.

61
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,500
Xi,

62
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,620
I'll be going now.

63
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,500
You shouldn't work until too late either.

64
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,580
Be safe.

65
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,060
OK.

66
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,820
What are you doing here?

67
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,340
Oh.

68
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,020
There is work to do.

69
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,420
You are still ill, right?

70
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,100
Did Jiang Jue tell you about it?

71
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,820
Can't you do it tomorrow?

72
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,180
No.

73
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,900
It has to be done today.

74
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,900
Are you caring for me?

75
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,420
No.

76
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,140
Hello?

77
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,220
Are you here?

78
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,500
Yes.

79
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,780
I'll come down now.

80
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,100
Hello?

81
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:07,780
Jiang Jue.

82
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,620
Yes.

83
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,260
He's in the company.

84
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,500
Hurry up.

85
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,540
Let go.

86
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,060
Why are you mad again?

87
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,420
How about punching me a few more times
to vent your anger?

88
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,300
How about punching me a few more times
to vent your anger?

89
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,460
What did you say?
