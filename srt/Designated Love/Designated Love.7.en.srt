3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Why do you like him

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,800
when he treats you like that?

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,880
Because...

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,200
he is really kind of silly.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,200
Tang Tang, listen to me.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,800
Right foot.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,200
- Right.
- Right foot.

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,920
Left foot.

11
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,440
Left.

12
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,440
Right foot.

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,320
Careful!

14
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:28,890
Careful.

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,020
Are you alright?

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,400
Are you alright?

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,240
I'm terribly sorry.

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,680
I didn't know the brakes didn't work.

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,440
Are you hurt?

20
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,360
I'll take you to the hospital.

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,360
I'm fine.

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,000
Are you sure?

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,720
Are you really fine?

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,960
You should maintain your bike regularly

25
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,880
so you don't cause any more accidents.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,400
It's fine.

27
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,120
Come on.

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,800
I found it strange at that time.

29
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,080
Other people would've burst out in anger.

30
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,480
But he remained calm.

31
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,760
But I didn't know if he was really calm

32
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,560
or just playing it cool out of embarrassment.

33
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,300
After that, for some reason,

34
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,640
I kept bumping into him.

35
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,960
Be it the cafeteria, classrooms,

36
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,380
or library.

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
But I didn't know which faculty he was in.

38
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,700
Until one day
when he transferred to our class

39
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,440
and that was when
I learnt that he was studying photography.

40
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,100
When did you guys
started talking to each other?

41
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,180
We didn't talk much.

42
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,180
But...

43
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,420
But I had been secretly
paying attention to him.

44
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,020
Then I realized that he was really silly.

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,160
Someone poured hot soup on him
in the cafeteria

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,800
and he didn't get mad.

47
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,360
Even when he lost all his work
after his computer crashed,

48
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,680
he didn't get mad.

49
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,160
He joined the roller-skating club

50
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,480
and they yelled at him all day,

51
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,300
but he never got upset.

52
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,240
He's just...

53
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,760
They all said

54
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,440
he was a very cold person.

55
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
But

56
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,640
I thought he was a super nice person.

57
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,720
So later

58
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
when he confessed his love to me,

59
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
I immediately said yes.

60
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
I think

61
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,800
I probably had feelings for him too.

62
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,480
Why else would I pay attention to him
for half a year.

63
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,960
If he really was that good of a person,

64
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,240
why did he upset you?

65
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe...

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,600
we are not a good match.

67
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,580
Tell me.

68
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,600
If he really didn't like me,

69
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,480
why did he confess his love to me
in the first place?

70
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,160
I don't know.

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,760
I'm not Jiang Han.

72
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,560
I know you are not him.

73
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,360
Can we buy all the flowers?

74
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,960
Of course.

75
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,640
Thanks.

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,560
Let's go.

77
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,000
We have money for dinner now.

78
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Are you happy with today's date?

79
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,120
Did it make up for your regrets?

80
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,720
Yes.

81
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,240
But the regret it made up

82
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,680
is not the one between Jiang Han and I,

83
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,880
but the one that I never had a proper date.

84
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,800
I know the one that
spent the whole day with me is you, Jiang...

85
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,640
Let's not call you Jiang Han anymore.

86
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,640
How about...

87
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,160
Jiang Xiaohan?

88
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,360
Thank you.

89
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,160
I'm glad that I went on my first date

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,560
with you.

♪I can't remember that day♪

92
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,000

Ah!

98
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,600
Qin Xi, you were kissed by an NPC!

99
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,200
Help me.

100
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,240
The most important part is

101
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,840
that you logged out
in the middle of the kiss?

102
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,160
Qin Xi, you are such a coward!

103
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,320
My dignity

104
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,280
is all gone.

105

(iDream Start-up)

107
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,000
Jiang Han, do you want some breakfast?

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,920
No, thanks.

109
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,300
OK.

110
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:30,780
(iDream Start-up)

111
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,680
Mr. Jiang.

112
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,930
Oh.

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,960
Are you free tonight?

114
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,120
Is something the matter, Mr. Jiang?

115
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,240
I want to ask you out for dinner.

116
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,360
That's not nice, Jiang Han.

117
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,440
You just told me that
you had something important tonight.

118
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,680
Having dinner with Qin Xi

119
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,960
is the most important thing.

120
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,800
Even if you are asking me
in front of so many people,

121
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
I will still say no.

122
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,080
This is very embarrassing for a boss.

123
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,000
I know.

124
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,440
But I also want everyone here to know

125
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,920
that I am trying to win your heart again.

126
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,400
And I will ask you out every day.

127
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,960
Even after you have left the company,

128
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,880
I will also go to your place
when you get back from work

129
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,680
and ask you out to have dinner with me.

130
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
No, my dear brother.

131
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,320
Don't you think
you're being a little too aggressive?

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,120
I can guarantee that within one week

133
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,120
she will call the police on you.

134
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,280
I can call the police right now.

135
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,260
Let's go, Xi. I'll send you home.

136
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:31,740
No need.

137
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,080
It's late so it's not safe.

138
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,600
Jiang Han,

139
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,160
do you know what matters the most
when you pursuing someone?

140
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,820
Working hard.

141
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,260
No.

142
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,720
It's the sense of space.

143
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,360
Do you know

144
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,880
that your clingy way of pursuing me

145
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,140
is really irritating?

146
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,800
Fine.

147
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,880
I'll ask you tomorrow.

148
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,680
Jiang Han!

149
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,880
Why don't you give me a ride then?

150
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We live close by anyway.

151
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,600
I've moved. Ask Jiang Jue.

152
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,000
Now he says he wants to pursue me.

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,280
What was he doing earlier?

154
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,200
Men will only

155
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,520
want what they don't have.

156
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,960
So cheap.

157
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,680
Yeah.

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,600
Men are really cheap.

159
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,240
Tang Tang, something is going on with you?

160
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,000
What?

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,760
You used to tell me

162
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,960
that I shouldn't judge everyone
based on the actions of an individual.

163
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,040
Now...

164
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,400
Are you dating someone?

165
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,560
I've just been
spending a lot of time on Weibo.

166
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,320
Let's not talk about me.

167
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,200
Let's talk about you.

168
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,320
You said that
Jiang Han wants to get back with you.

169
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,240
So?

170
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,880
What do you feel about it?
