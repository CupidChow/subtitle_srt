=Episode 8=

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,180
You said
Jiang Han wants to get back with you.

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,100
So?

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,740
What do you feel about it?

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,660
Nothing.

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,500
Did you have a change of heart?

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,980
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,700
Am I someone that looks for
the next lover as soon as I break up?

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,020
Isn't that just like cheating?

11
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,580
True.

12
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,100
If you like someone,

13
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,980
how long will it take?

14
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,420
For me,

15
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,260
just one second.

16
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,660
So you're the love-at-first-sight type?

17
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,980
I don't mean the second I meet the guy,

18
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,460
but the second
I develop feelings for the guy.

19
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,820
Maybe it's something he does,

20
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,580
or something he says...

21
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,820
You came.

22
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,660
Most likely it would be
because of physical contact...

23
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,220
Hey.

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,380
What are you thinking about?

25
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,900
Nothing.

26
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,140
I have one more question.

27
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,740
Say it.

28
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,980
What if

29
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,060
when you are about to kiss,

30
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,220
that person runs away?

31
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,060
Runs away?

32
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,340
Run where?

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
Just...

34
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,700
Runs away.

35
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,660
Will you get mad?

36
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,660
I won't get mad.

37
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,660
Because in my mind,

38
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,100
he is already dead.

39
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,100
I have to face him sooner or later.

40
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,060
(Game begins)

41
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,700
This is for you.

42
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,220
What do I need this for?

43
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,780
You suddenly left last time

44
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,940
and disappeared for days.

45
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,180
I figured you must be very angry.

46
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,380
You can stab me with it.

47
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,580
I won't get hurt or die anyway.

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:51,930
Yeah...

49
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,580
Jiang Xiaohan, you are really...

50
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,860
Really what?

51
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,860
What's so funny?

52
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,180
Isn't this enough for you to vent your anger?

53
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,820
I'm not some psycho killer.

54
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,620
This is...

55
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,420
Alright.

56
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,180
I'm not mad.

57
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,820
Really?

58
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,580
But,

59
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,620
you can't do that next time.

60
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,780
You must respect women.

61
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,580
Do you get it?

62
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah.

63
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,660
Next time when I want to kiss you,

64
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,020
I will ask for your permission first.

65
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,180
So...

66
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,380
Can I ask for your permission now?

67
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,580
Jiang Han. Xi.

68
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,700
What a coincidence.

69
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,620
Let's play together.

70
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,020
Is she also an NPC?

71
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,140
She is not sentient.

72
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,780
The system just got updated.

73
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,500
Not only are there new maps,

74
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,020
what's more, when you reach
a certain level of friendship level,

75
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,900
the game will
unlock special characters and storylines.

76
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,500
The creators of this game must be crazy!

77
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,180
Purposefully creating
this person to cause trouble!

78
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,940
Or maybe they think their playerbase is huge

79
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,820
and doesn't care
about their customers' satisfaction!

80
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,140
Were you the one that created her?

81
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,940
You are the only one in the game
that knows about my hatred for Shen Jingjing.

82
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,940
It's not me.

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,980
The game must have designed it
according to the players background.

84
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,660
I will never do anything to upset you.

85
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,980
It really wasn't me.

86
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,560
What can I do to make you believe me?

87
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,540
Forget it.

88
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,260
She is here already.

89
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,860
I don't think I'll come here often.

90
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,100
I don't want to be bullied

91
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,860
in both worlds.

92
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,620
What about me?

93
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,900
Are you leaving me?

94
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,620
I'll still come,

95
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,900
just less often.

96
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,300
Don't worry.

97
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,980
Don't give up on me

98
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,900
just because of her existence, okay?

99
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,860
She is just a character
forcibly added in by the system

100
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,820
while I am self-aware.

101
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,140
I know one thing for sure.

102
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,500
I don't care if she's Shen Jingjing,

103
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,700
Chen Jingjing, or Wang Jingjing.

104
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,820
I see no difference.

105
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,620
All I can see is you.

106
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,460
Why are the NPCs in this game

107
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,700
so good at flirting.

108
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,260
He says everything without feeling ashamed.

109
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,220
What are you guys talking about?

110
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,140
Let's talk together.

111
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,540
What's with you guys?

112
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,540
Tell me.

113
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,860
It makes me sick

114
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,980
when I hear the word 'together'.

115
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,900
You guys have fun chatting.

116
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,540
I need to go.

117
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,660
Don't go.

118
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,020
I don't care what storyline
the system has implanted in her mind.

119
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,060
In my eyes she is just a stranger.

120
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,260
Besides,

121
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,180
I'm not Jiang Han.

122
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,220
I'm Jiang Xiaohan.

123
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,420
Why aren't you guys holding my hands, too?

124
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,420
Let's hold hands together.

125
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,780
What did you do?

126
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,340
A game item I just got.

127
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,300
Sedative spray.

128
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,000
What do you think?

129
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,180
You didn't expect me

130
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,980
to use it on my kind, right?

131
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,220
Did what I do

132
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,500
make you believe me?

133
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,180
Not bad.

134
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,420
Ah...

135
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,460
I forgot.

136
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,900
This is a prank game.

137
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,980
If you don't get punched,

138
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,100
you won't get your salary.

139
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,140
In order to improve your survival abilities,

140
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,020
I've made up my mind.

141
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,660
I'll slap you every time I enter the game.

142
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,820
Am I good to you or not?

143
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,780
Just now...

144
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,180
I shouldn't have let her hit on me, right?

145
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
What do you think?

146
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,340
(Does being jealous mean I like him?)

147
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,220
(Is it wrong to be possessive?)

148
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,940
(Can humans date an NPC?)
