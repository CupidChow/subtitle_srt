3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,460
You have been working on
this launch event for a month.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,020
Are you not going to attend it?

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,980
You ladies can watch it for me.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,820
Xi,

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,180
we will miss you.

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,540
Don't worry.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,900
I will take care of Xi for you.

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,020
We're leaving.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,540
I don't care.

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,560
In the launch event today,

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,180
I must find several hot dates.

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,540
Several?

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,740
You are ambitious.

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:41,540
Well.

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,620
You should care about a man's

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,980
quality

19
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:44,780
and not quantity.

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,020
Jiang Jue.

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,740
Xiaonan.

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,380
You should watch out.

23
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,460
Didn't you go traveling with Xi?

24
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,060
We broke up.

25
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,020
Is it weird?

26
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,180
In the adult world,

27
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,460
breakups always happen.

28
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,820
(iDream Start-up)
It isn't a big deal, is it?

29
00:00:59,380 --> 00:00:59,780
I was...

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,980
My dear brother,

31
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,140
instead of wasting your time punching me,

32
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,900
you should take care of your ex-girlfriend.

33
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,460
She's probably

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,980
at home crying now.

35
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,060
Mr. Jiang,

36
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,620
the launch event is this afternoon!

37
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,460
I will host the launch event.

38
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,060
What are you looking at?

39
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,700
There's nothing makeup can't do.

40
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,700
Don't worry.

41
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,140
Mr. Jiang won't come back.

42
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,540
Who is it?

43
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,900
Who is it?

44
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,820
Can you not be with other people?

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,910
♪I can't remember that day♪

46
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,710
♪There is only an empty room left♪

47
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,180
Does it hurt?

48
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,300
Do you really think you are an NPC?

49
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,660
Does it really not hurt?

50
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,580
I'm fine as long as I'm looking at you.

51
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,580
How did you end up like this?

52
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,020
Is it that hot outside?

53
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,180
The elevator broke down.

54
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,220
It broke down?

55
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,780
Did you climb the stairs up here?

56
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,540
We're at the 36th floor.

57
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,180
I know.

58
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,380
You could've just called me.

59
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,100
But you blocked my number.

60
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,260
You could've contacted the building manager

61
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,100
to call me.

62
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,460
I wanted to see you sooner.

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:36,900
What day is it?

64
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,140
The launch event is about to start!

65
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,140
Why did you come here?

66
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,500
Let's go now!

67
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,580
It doesn't matter.

68
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,820
What doesn't matter?

69
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,780
Please don't ever push me away.

70
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,840
I can only think about our past

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,500
♪Which is the most beautiful moment♪

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,720
♪You once loved♪

73
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,500
♪You once hated♪

74
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,390
♪You once left♪

75
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,020
♪And you once came back♪

76
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,380
♪Our love travels through time♪

77
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,390
♪Isn't it worth to be lingered about♪

78
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,320
♪There is no sense of exhaustion♪

79
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,130
♪Luckily, we didn't come to the happy ending♪

80
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,660
♪So that we are here now today♪

81
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,260
(Jiang Jue: Did you move in together? Does my
silly little brother know about the truth?)

82
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,700
(Yo.)

83
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,540
(Jiang Jue)
(Did you move in together?)

84
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,940
(Does my silly little brother
know about the truth?)

85
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,140
(If you haven't told him about it,)

86
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,780
(then don't ever tell him the truth.)

87
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,540
(Xi)
(What truth?)

88
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,260
(Jue)
(You're Jiang Han.)

89
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,080
(Hey.)

90
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,620
(You should learn
how to get information from others.)

91
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,220
(My silly brother.)

92
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,380
Let's eat.

93
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,900
What truth?

94
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,100
Well...

95
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,580
He was messing around.

96
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,820
If I tell you,

97
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,740
don't be mad at me.

98
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,140
Tell me about it first.

99
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,060
Actually,

100
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,260
Jiang Jue and I

101
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,460
were not really together.

102
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,340
Are you sure

103
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,580
that my brother came up with this game?

104
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,340
I'm very certain.

105
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,460
How can it be such a coincidence?

106
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,100
The day I broke up with him,

107
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,460
the game changed
its name from Pranking Your Boyfriend

108
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,940
to Pranking Your Ex-boyfriend.

109
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,060
And the in-game NPC
looks exactly like Jiang Han.

110
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,420
There is even a character
called Shen Jingjing.

111
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,820
It was as if the game

112
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,020
was built just for me.

113
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,500
Looks like

114
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,740
you already have a plan.

115
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,580
Of course.

116
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,620
I dated him for four years

117
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,140
and never made him suffer.

118
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,420
How dare he fool me!

119
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,020
I will torture him.

120
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,620
How?

121
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,720
First,

122
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,120
we'll use our colleagues appropriately.

123
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,380
In front of them,

124
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,300
I will mention my online boyfriend.

125
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,220
How nice!

126
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,300
A friend of mine is getting married.

127
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,380
When will it be my turn?

128
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,140
Isn't Mr. Jiang pursuing you?

129
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,100
Him?

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,540
Forget it.

131
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,660
I'm not the type to go back to my exes.

132
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,820
Besides,

133
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,740
there is already someone I like.

134
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,900
It's just that,

135
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,940
it's an online relationship.

136
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:35,980
Online relationship?

137
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,640
The second step is to shut him up.

138
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,420
I just confessed my feelings to him.

139
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,180
According to his personality,

140
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,180
he must be thinking

141
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,980
that it won't last long

142
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,540
dating me as Jiang Xiaohan.

143
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,340
So,

144
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,780
he will find an opportunity

145
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,500
to tell me the truth.

146
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,460
Xi,

147
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,340
I have something important to tell you.

148
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:54,860
Hold on.

149
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,940
I want to ask you a question first.

150
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,380
But if he told me the truth,

151
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,620
it'd make me look stupid!

152
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,860
How embarrassing!

153
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,500
You want to stop him from telling the truth?

154
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,060
That's right.

155
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:06,980
Not only that,

156
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,860
I want to make him feel even more guilty.

157
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,300
Can you promise me to never lie to me?

158
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,620
What's next?

159
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,980
The third step.

160
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,160
See him less often in the game.

161
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,540
(Our last meeting)

162
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,020
(Pranking Your Ex-boyfriend)
(was 48 hours ago.)

163
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,220
(Do you miss me?)

164
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,100
(Shocking.)

165
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,700
(How could my girlfriend do
this to me during our honeymoon phase!)

166
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,020
(What does it feel like)

167
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,100
(having a clingy boyfriend?)

168
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,060
(Come and play.)

169
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,980
(This is the so-called clingy guy.)

170
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,460
Jiang Han is very sensitive,

171
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,620
so he will soon find out that
I'm trying to stay away from him.

172
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,420
But we can't give him time
