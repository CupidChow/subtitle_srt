3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,860
I want to invite you

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,820
to go on a date with me.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:10,980
A date?

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,460
Didn't you tell me yesterday

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,180
that you've never had a proper date?

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,340
Will you go out with me?

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,160
What...

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,700
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,260
You are an NPC.

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,060
You can't come out to the real world.

13
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,820
Besides,

14
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,740
I've come here many times

15
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,620
and I don't see anywhere interesting to go.

16
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,820
You gave me a beating yesterday.

17
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,300
Don't tell me
your friendship level has increased.

18
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,300
It's more than that.

19
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,300
You've even unlocked a new map.

20
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,140
What map?

21
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,140
Come to the date with me and you'll know.

22
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,820
So, will you go out with me?

23
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,700
Am I going insane?

24
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,500
Why did I agree to go on a date with an NPC?

25
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,100
If I say no...

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,220
Morning.

27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,140
Morning.

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,380
I won't quit.

29
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,420
Okay.

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,260
I did nothing detrimental to the company.

31
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,060
If Jiang Han fires me,

32
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,420
I will sue.

33
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,780
You are

34
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,220
tougher than I thought.

35
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,660
The launch event is just around the corner.

36
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,180
He won't allow the company to get bad press.

37
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,260
I never thought

38
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,060
I could become someone like this.

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,500
Work hard then.

40
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,700
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,060
I owe you an apology.

42
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,380
You can believe me or not, it's up to you.

43
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,060
It was never my intention
to come between you two.

44
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,180
I do regret something.

45
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,140
I regret not realizing

46
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,540
my feelings for Jiang Han earlier.

47
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,740
It was only after you appeared did I...

48
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,660
Anyway.

49
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,060
I'm very sorry.

50
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,980
What do you want by saying this to me now?

51
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,660
Do you want to me understand you?

52
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,300
No.

53
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,340
I'm here to declare war.

54
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,420
I've done such embarrassing things.

55
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,780
I don't care what other people
might say about me behind my back.

56
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,300
Jiang Han

57
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,180
is mine and I won't let you have him.

58
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,500
Since you guys have ended your relationship,

59
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,660
then let's compete fairly.

60
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,340
I think you really misunderstood one thing.

61
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,460
Fairness

62
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,980
is based on the fact
that we both have the same goal.

63
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,420
I can tell you again if you don't remember.

64
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,220
What you cherish

65
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,500
is something I don't want anymore.

66
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,340
Go ahead and win his heart,

67
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,900
but don't see me as an enemy!

68
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,300
(Pranking Your Ex-boyfriend)
Do you remember our date?

69
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,460
Oh no.

70
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,820
The date is tomorrow.

71
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,740
Our date starts now.

72
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,540
This is for you.

73
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,620
Thanks.

74
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,220
You...

75
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:58,900
What is it?

76
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,740
Do I look ugly?

77
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,340
No.

78
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,100
You look great.

79
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,540
Alright.

80
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,540
Let's go have fun.

81
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,500
Or else there will be a long queue

82
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,940
and we'll have to wait forever.

83
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,740
Come on.

Can I pay with my phone?

95
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,620
We have our own currency in this world.

96
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,660
You can't pay with your phone.

97
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,300
It's fine.

98
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,460
We can make some money now.

99
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,020
Now?

100
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,060
Even if you punch me now,

101
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,980
I won't get my salary until next month.

102
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,140
That's not what I mean.

103
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,620
We have these, don't we?

104
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,420
(10 Yuan for one flower)

105
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,980
Do you really plan on selling them?

106
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,060
Yes.

107
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,780
They will eventually wither away.

108
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,540
So we might as well sell them now

109
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,620
to earn some money for dinner.

110
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,420
Besides,

111
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,500
look.

112
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
I have captured it
in its most beautiful state.

113
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,220
Selling flowers in a playground

114
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,700
is also the most special kind of date, right?

115
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,580
It is special.

116
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,220
But it's sad that
I can't take this out of this game world.

117
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,100
If I can,

118
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,820
I wish to bring all these pictures with me.

119
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,300
I'll keep them for you.

120
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,900
I'll show them to you whenever you want.

121
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,580
Why are you looking at me

122
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,420
in every picture?

123
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,780
Because you have a beautiful smile.

124
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,660
Don't you feel ashamed saying such things?

125
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,940
I'm just being honest.

126
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,260
Don't you like it
when I say nice things about you?

127
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,540
It's not like that.

128
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,860
Everyone likes

129
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,700
to be praised.

130
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,940
Then I'll say something nice
about you every day.

131
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,980
I guarantee
I will be sincere and nonrepetitive.

132
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,660
Which one do you like the most?
I'll pay extra attention to save it.

133
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:05,940
This one.

134
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,100
This picture

135
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,020
kind of makes up for one of my regrets.

136
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,340
Hey,

137
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:09,980
Jiang Han.

138
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,860
Come closer.

139
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,540
Come on.

140
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,900
One, two three.

141
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,900
- I dated Jiang Han for a long time.
- Cheese!

142
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,260
And this picture is
the only picture of us together.

143
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,860
Shen Jingjing even took it for herself.

144
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,980
But it's also a good thing.

145
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,660
I won't have to look at it and get upset.

146
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,860
Why do you like him

147
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,620
when he treats you like that?

148
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,780
Because...

149
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,300
he is really kind of silly.
