3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,700
Jiang Han is very sensitive,

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,860
so he will soon find out that
I'm trying to stay away from him.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,660
But we can't give him time
to really think about it.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,540
That is when

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,100
you need to give me a hand.

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,040
How?

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,540
Be yourself and be flirtatious.

10
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,900
Make Weiwei and Xiaonan think that

11
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,420
you are pursuing me.

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,420
I do know a lot of pretty women.

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,860
But inner beauty is more important.

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,740
Your Director Qin

15
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,540
is a really good example.

16
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,700
Jiang Jue.

17
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,340
You have been so nice to Xi recently.

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,540
I'm pursuing her.

19
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,900
Of course I'd be nice to her.

20
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,620
Jiang Han will definitely find it strange.

21
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,740
Why are we suddenly

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,020
so close.

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,380
(BUYU Game)

24
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,780
I know Weiwei and Xiaonan.

25
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,140
On that night,

26
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,100
they will talk about us.

27
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,660
But what's important is next day.

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,340
Jiang Han normally
gets to the company at 8 in the morning.

29
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,460
I will ask Weiwei and Xiaonan
to arrive there at the same time.

30
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,580
When they meet,

31
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,420
they will surely go to the break room

32
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,580
to gossip about us again.

33
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,500
No way.

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,020
Is Director Qin really
planning on being Mr. Jiang's sister-in-law?

35
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,980
Are you dumb?

36
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,620
I knew something
was going on between them a long time ago.

37
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,540
The two were being so sneaky.

38
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,540
And they were having so much fun together.

39
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,180
If you tell me there is nothing between them,
I won't trust it.

40
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,620
At then,

41
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,980
we'd make our grand entrance.

42
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,540
Jiang Han will definitely lose his mind

43
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,980
and ask me in person.

44
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,580
But before that,

45
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,260
I hope you can find some indirect evidence

46
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,780
that proves that Jiang Han is Jiang Xiaohan.

47
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,340
I want to show him

48
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,700
that my change of heart

49
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,860
is because he lied to me.

50
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,940
How do I find the evidence?

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,400
Well.

52
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,300
As long as
it's something out of the ordinary.

53
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,540
Something that
makes you wonder why he did it.

54
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,940
All of that you can show me.

55
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,020
Because

56
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,740
it'll basically be what Jiang Xiaohan did.

57
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,580
What do you think?

58
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,540
Is it useful?

59
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,900
Super useful.

60
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,580
And then

61
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,900
I will tell him

62
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,580
why I have been keeping my distance from him.

63
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,340
That is because

64
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,220
I knew about his lies long ago.

65
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,300
Then I will naturally bring up the fact that

66
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,220
I like you

67
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,420
and hope that he can let me go.

68
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,260
Do you really want him to let you go

69
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,340
or are you acting?

70
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,580
Of course I'm acting.

71
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,780
I still like him.

72
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,460
It's just...

73
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,740
I can't just forgive him

74
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,780
for fooling me.

75
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,660
What if he really gives up?

76
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,780
Then I guess it means that

77
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,500
he is not that into me.

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,080
Em...

79
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,560
I have two questions.

80
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,380
One,

81
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,540
why are you going through so much trouble

82
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,780
to make him think that
you have changed your mind?

83
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,940
You can just make him think that

84
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,140
you were disappointed and left him

85
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,620
because he lied to you.

86
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,540
Wouldn't that also make him sad?

87
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,420
Wrong.

88
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,940
If he really thought that
I left because I was disappointed,

89
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,460
he will still try to get me back.

90
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,100
After all, he thinks that
a disappointed heart can be fixed.

91
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,900
But what I want to teach him

92
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,180
the consequences fooling me.

93
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,020
The fact that
I will fall in love with someone else

94
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,740
after he disappoints me,

95
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,780
and that disappointment
is the end of our love

96
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,380
but the start of my love with someone else.

97
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,180
Only by completely losing me

98
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,100
can he really learn his lesson.

99
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,060
I guess it's true.

100
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,820
Women are the most vicious.

101
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,700
And...

102
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,060
Two,

103
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,340
why me?

104
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,780
You know that I really want to see

105
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,740
the launch event fail, right?

106
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,820
Because after several days of observation,

107
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,540
I've come to the conclusion that
you are not interested in the company at all.

108
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,700
The reason why you have been
wandering around in the company

109
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,500
is because

110
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,260
you want to have control over your brother.

111
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,100
That's

112
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,300
how it went.

113
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,260
But we made a deal

114
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,700
to tell you the truth

115
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,860
right after the launch event.

116
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,500
Then on the day of the launch event.

117
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,140
Was it also part of the plan

118
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,940
to have Jiang Jue
tell me that he broke up with you?

119
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,820
Of course not!

120
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,740
I know how important the launch event

121
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,580
was to you.

122
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:14,980
It's just that...

123
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,820
I missed one thing.

124
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,140
Jiang Jue.

125
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,140
I've brought the plan forward.

126
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,060
I'm curious,
which one is more important to Han.

127
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,020
You or the launch event?

128
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,580
I didn't expect to get an extra surprise.

129
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,380
It's my first time seeing
my silly brother punch me out of anger.

130
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,560
Hahahahaha.

131
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,900
The biggest winner in this is Jiang Jue.

132
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,660
He invited your parents to the launch event

133
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,140
and hosted it with a bruised face

134
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,660
that even makeup couldn't cover.

135
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,540
In the end, he convinced your parents
to give up on the idea

136
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,300
of passing the company to him.

137
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,540
He also bought the key phrase

138
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,580
'The most miserable host of Yesterday's Promise'

139
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,060
and it became the trending topic.

140
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,020
The game even became
the most downloaded mobile game.

141
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,780
And he also unlocked

142
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,100
your first time to show the anger.

143
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,300
You two are really...

144
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,700
Please don't be mad.

145
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,300
It was my fault after all.

146
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,540
So I deserve this little revenge

147
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,740
of yours.

148
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,180
Do you really like me that much?

149
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,340
Of course.

150
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,580
Why?

151
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,280
Hey.

152
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,020
I don't think I've ever asked you

153
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,420
why you liked me.

154
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,800
Tang Tang, listen to me.

155
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,300
Right foot. Left foot. Right foot. Left foot.

156
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,780
Right, left, right foot.

157
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,740
Hold on to me.

158
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:57,780
Come on.

159
00:05:59,460 --> 00:05:59,980
Slowly now.

160
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,100
Come on.

161
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,020
Slowly now.

162
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,840
One, two.

163
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,500
Teacher, I want to apply for the art faculty.

164
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,340
Are you sure?

165
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,780
Yes.
