3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,340
I think I have a solution for this.

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,780
The carrot and stick approach.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:11,860
Xi.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,380
Check out the resumes of the interns

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,060
and tell me if you want to interview anyone.

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,020
Thanks, Xin.

(Job Resume)

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,620
I need to reward them?

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,740
I am cleaning up their mess every day

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,980
and worrying about so many things.

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,100
Besides, I'll be leaving the company soon.

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,300
Forget it.

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,820
Even if you find a new job,

16
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,620
you might still become a manager.

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,420
Of course.

18
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,380
Then

19
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,900
how will you deal
with the employees under you?

20
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,660
Why do I have to care about them?

21
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,460
Isn't it more important
that everyone in the company

22
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,260
do their jobs properly?

23
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,540
If you are a normal employee,

24
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,540
doing your job is indeed important.

25
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,740
But as a department manager,

26
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,540
you need to think about
making each one of them

27
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,780
work as a whole.

28
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,540
There is no manager
that likes seeing their employees

29
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,140
fight against each other.

30
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,700
You do have a point.

31
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,700
Since you have recently shown them the stick,

32
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,780
then you need to give them
a reward to maintain the balance.

33
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,460
Practice it now

34
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,140
so that you'll have a better start
at the new company.

35
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,740
You sound like a PUA.

36
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,460
You ladies also have the right
to choose your future colleagues.

37
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,060
What is with her?

38
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,580
Is that really her?

39
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,820
You guys can go home now.

40
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,900
Send me the original files.
I'll do the editing.

41
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,860
Come on.

42
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,700
You can leave first.

43
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,850
Jingjing.

44
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,500
Jingjing.

45
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,620
Let's go.

46
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,800
Okay.

47
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,340
We are leaving then.

48
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,380
You can also go home now.

49
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,380
In the meeting next week,

50
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,780
I will prove to everyone

51
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,580
that I am capable.

52
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,380
Xi,

53
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,940
I shouldn't have sent the files
to the boss without your permission.

54
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,020
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,580
Don't do it again.

56
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,220
Okay.

57
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,140
(BUYU Game)

58
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,580
The programming department
should keep optimizing the game.

59
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,180
We must reduce the frequency of crashes.

60
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,580
Let's listen to the art department now.

61
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,580
What's your problem?

62
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,820
I wouldn't dare to share my opinion.

63
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,100
You are not here just to listen, are you?

64
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,100
If you have any suggestions
for our department,

65
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,620
feel free to speak your mind.

66
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,380
You won't get angry if I say it, right?

67
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,540
We are having a meeting now, Jiang Jue.

68
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:23,700
Ugly.

69
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,340
That is my opinion.

70
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,420
It's a card game for female players.

71
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,500
How you people are able to design
such ugly characters is beyond me.

72
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,820
No one would want
to download something like this.

73
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,620
What exactly do you mean
by "ugly", Mr. Jiang?

74
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,580
The designs of the characters,

75
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,500
the filling of the details,

76
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,700
or the color combination?

77
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,940
I just think it's ugly.

78
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,820
What an amateur.

79
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,620
Han.

80
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,660
Have you figured out your target audience?

81
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,420
Do you have to be a professional
to play a game?

82
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,460
No.

83
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,340
The design on all of our cards

84
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,660
was not decided
by an individual's preferences.

85
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,820
Rather, it is the result of countless surveys
done by our data analysts.

86
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,260
With that as our basis,

87
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,340
we deliberated carefully
before making a decision.

88
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,340
So please give us professional
and constructive suggestions

89
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,220
while keeping
the target audience in mind, Mr. Jiang.

90
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,100
Do not judge the cards
out of your own preferences.

91
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,380
As the art director,

92
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,420
I am very pleased with the card designs.

93
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,700
And I also appreciate
all the hard work from our designers.

94
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,780
I do want to point out, Mr. Jiang.

95
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,060
I don't know why

96
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,140
you allowed an outsider
to sit in on our internal meeting

97
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,060
while giving us some random opinions.

98
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,260
His childish and random comments

99
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,620
are an insult to the designers

100
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,580
and an attack

101
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,300
on the company's confidence in the game.

102
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,060
Please only allow professionals
into the meeting, Mr. Jiang,

103
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,220
and don't just let anybody in.

104
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,220
Did you have to shame me in that meeting?

105
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,740
I am just being honest.

106
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,140
You know I won't reprimand you.

107
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,420
Is that so?

108
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,980
Have you forgotten
how you reprimanded me in the last meeting?

109
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,420
Last time?

110
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,780
Why don't I buy everyone milk tea

111
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,540
and we chat over some tea?

112
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,540
Are you the cheerleader here?

113
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,580
Qin Xi.

114
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,300
We are in a meeting.

115
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,140
Watch your tongue.

116
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,540
I just wanted you to speak nicely.

117
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,420
I was being nice.

118
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,220
You have changed a lot recently.

119
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,900
That's because I've been
putting on a front for too long.

120
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,260
I pretended to be generous, gentle,

121
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,620
and that I liked Shen Jingjing.

122
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,460
I pretended to not care
about how you two acted,

123
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,180
and to not have any bad feelings towards you.

124
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,100
Well?

125
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,980
Are you disappointed

126
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,140
to see my true self?

127
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,180
No.

128
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,900
I like you this way.

129
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,580
You are crazy.

130
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,340
I'll be going if there is nothing else.

131
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,700
I'm having dinner with Shen Jingjing tonight.

132
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,220
I will also make it clear with her...

133
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,900
You don't need to tell me anything!

134
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,460
I also have a date tonight.

135
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,220
A date?

136
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,660
With whom?

137
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,300
I don't have to tell you this.

138
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,340
What a coincidence. I was just coming in.

139
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,220
Thank you for opening the door for me.

140
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,260
Jiang Jue.

141
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,620
Do you remember our date tonight?

142
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,260
Of course!
