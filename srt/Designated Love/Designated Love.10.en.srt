3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,780
Isn't the client coming?

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,220
He should be here soon.

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,700
I am not experienced

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,540
in dating someone.

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,020
I'm not good at expressing myself

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,420
and has caused

9
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,740
many misunderstandings.

10
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,500
The other day,

11
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,660
I didn't understand why

12
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,700
you didn't believe me

13
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,820
when I said I didn't like Shen Jingjing.

14
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,780
Now that I think about it,

15
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,380
it's all because
I didn't give you a sense of security.

16
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,540
That's is why you doubt everything I say.

17
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,420
It's my bad.

18
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,700
I have wronged you.

19
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,860
I should've told you this sooner.

20
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,260
I should've told you every day that I like you

21
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,540
and that I only like you.

22
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,780
I know what Shen Jingjing told you.

23
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,500
But you should still
listen to my side of the story.

24
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,860
Why are you looking at me like that?

25
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,860
I'm just being honest.

26
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,820
Why did she break up with me that day?

27
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,220
Why are you asking me?

28
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,500
You should ask her.

29
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,380
Seeing that we grew up together,

30
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,620
I'll ignore

31
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,260
what has happened.

32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,100
You...

33
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,060
So you really...

34
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,220
Don't ever contact me again.

35
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,100
I should've made something clear
with you sooner.

36
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,420
Even though we are childhood sweethearts,

37
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,620
it means nothing to me.

38
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,580
I let you get between Qin Xi and I

39
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,100
only because
I thought you two were good friends.

40
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,460
That is the biggest mistake I've ever made.

41
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,740
If you don't want to leave the company,

42
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,060
I will call your parents.

43
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,300
You have jeopardized my life.

44
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,180
Letting you leave on your own
is my way of letting you save face.

45
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,620
Xi,

46
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,900
can you give me a chance to start over?

47
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,620
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,100
You still don't want to forgive me?

49
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,580
I accept your apology.

50
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,420
But there is already someone I like.

51
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,060
Who is it?

52
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,940
We are not meeting any client today,

53
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:52,780
is it?

54
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,220
I'll be going then.

55
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,580
See you tomorrow.

56
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,420
Jiang Han.

57
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,500
(There has been a scale in my mind.)

58
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,420
(On one side is Jiang Han
and on the other is Jiang Xiaohan.)

59
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,980
(I always thought that I cared)

60
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,820
(iDream Start-up)
(if Jiang Han loved me.)

61
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,140
(But I was wrong.)

62
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,060
(What I cared about)

63
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,060
(is whether or not we were in love.)

64
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,740
(You are so cringy, Qin Xi.)

65
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,530
(You look only to the past)

66
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,580
(and keep holding on to the past.)

67
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,580
(Now)

68
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,700
(you should run forward.)

69
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,220
(The scale can get lost!)

70
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,420
Hurry up.

71
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,380
(Game begins)

72
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,140
Jiang Xiaohan.

73
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,020
You came.

74
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,660
I thought you left me for good.

75
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,900
I thought about it.

76
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,980
But I that's not what I want now.

77
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,820
I only want to see you now.

78
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,620
The thing about Shen Jingjing...

79
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,260
You don't need to explain yourself.

80
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,140
You only need to let me know

81
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,780
that I matter more than her.

82
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,940
No one matters more than you.

83
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,900
Why is the weather

84
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,020
like this today?

85
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,540
The system must be undergoing maintenance.

86
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,740
You should leave. It's not safe here.

87
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,300
What about you?

88
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:53,980
Don't worry.

89
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,580
I'm an NPC in the game.

90
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,300
I will be fine.

91
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,220
Jiang Han.

92
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,100
Xi.

93
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,100
Tell me,

94
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,460
what will happen if a real person like me

95
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,100
dies in a game world?

96
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,060
Will I also become an NPC?

97
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,940
Don't be silly.

98
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,860
I won't let anything happen to you.

99
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,500
I like you.

100
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,660
Will you be my boyfriend?

101
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,980
You're confessing your love right now?

102
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,380
It's special,

103
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,140
isn't it?

104
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,620
It is special.

105
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,300
I will remember today forever.

106
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,160
This...

107
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,980
Is this also a bug in the game?

108
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,980
Actually in this game,

109
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,260
there is only one way to make her disappear.

110
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,220
What is it?

111
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,540
When you fall in love with me.
