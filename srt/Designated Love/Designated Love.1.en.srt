3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm breaking up with Jiang Han!

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,740
Is it because of Jiang Han's
stupid childhood sweetheart again?

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,020
Who else can it be?

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,540
Shen

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,860
Jingjing!

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,820
Since I'm here, how about I join you guys?

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,860
What a coincidence!
Don't mind if I join you guys.

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,260
Are you guys planning a ski trip? I'm in.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,340
Are you guys going home?
How about giving me a ride?

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,100
Even if she's Jiang Han's childhood friend,
her actions are totally unacceptable!

13
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,500
She's like a shadow
constantly following you two.

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,020
Did she plant a tracker on one of you?

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,300
Or is she just a stalker?

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,020
Besides, how long has this
been going on already?

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,420
I think you should just break up with him.

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,100
Geez!

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,780
Who is trying to message you?
It's so annoying!

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,260
Is it Jiang Han?

(Pranking Your Boyfriend)

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,100
Are you unhappy with your boyfriend?

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,380
Do you want to punch him as hard as you can?

24
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,260
Satisfaction guaranteed!

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,980
You...

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,220
What illegal websites
have you been visiting at night?

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,020
What are you talking about?

28
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,060
I've been seeing this stupid advertisement
for half a month now.

29
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,130
(Pranking Your Boyfriend)
And I can't delete them all at once.

30
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,580
I can only delete them one by one.

31
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,580
It's so annoying!

32
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,060

Did you guys come here together?

37
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,780
Of course not.

38
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,700
She came to visit you,

39
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,940
while I'm here to break up with you

40
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,020
and resign from this company.

41
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,500
I'll do the handover tomorrow.

42
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,900
After all, working for my ex is not my thing.

Yes.

How did this game make him
look exactly like that cheater?

69

How did you guys gather your face database?

70

I'm sorry,

72
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,860
your question is beyond my list of answers.

73

Please ask me something else.

74
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,220
What questions can you answer then?

75

It's pointless to expect
a string of codes to answer my questions.

I can choose more than one method, right?

It's all in the past.

98
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,540
I came here today to tell you

99
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,220
that I have submitted my resignation letter.

100
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,620
Please make sure to sign it.

101
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,460
I hope you can handle the paperwork today,

102
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,900
so that we can end things amicably.

103
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:18,860
Hold on!

104
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,980
According to company rules,

105
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,500
you must submit your resignation letter
one month in advance.

106
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,820
I won't make an exception for you.

107
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,660
Actually...

108
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,540
Mr. Jiang, you're right.

109
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,300
That was an error on my part.

110
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,460
I will leave after a month.

111
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,620
Yes. I sent it to her ages ago.

112
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,700
We're better off sending it to Mr. Jiang

113
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,860
- than to send it to her.
- Now you are being impartial.

Today was the worst.

116
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,540
The metro was super crowded

117
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,060
and I had to wait for a long time
before getting into one.

118
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,660
Why don't you ask Mr. Jiang
to give you a ride.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,500
You two live close to each other.

120
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,820
He knows that I can't get up early.

121
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,340
Back in our schooldays,
he would always wait for me at my place.

122
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,940
At times he would wait for an hour.

123
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,020
I'm so jealous
of you two childhood sweethearts.

124
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:04,860
Oh...

125
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,500
Director Qin.

126
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,460
Why didn't you ask Mr. Jiang
to give you a ride?

127
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,100
Right.

128
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,620
Why?

129
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,820
Maybe because we have broken up.

130
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,460
Xi.

131
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,420
I happen to get
an extra portion of breakfast.

132
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,300
How about we share it?

133
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:22,620
No need.

134
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,940
Why are you being so polite?

135
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,220
I wish we could be polite with each other.

136
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,820
After all, not everything can be shared.

137
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,780
I can have it,
if Director Qin doesn't want it.

138
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,940
I am not filled with anger.

139
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,780
I have room for food.

140
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,180
Fine.

141
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,620
You can have it.

142
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,820
Is this the design
your art department submitted?

143

Qin Xi.

144
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,260
Give me an explanation.

145
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,420
I did not approve this draft.

146
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,340
(Designer: Weiwei)
How did it end up with Mr. Jiang?

147
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,100
You are the art director.

148
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,740
You must fulfill your responsibilities.

149
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,020
If you can't manage your staff

150
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,060
or control the quality of the work,

151
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,940
then just quit.

152
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,820
What do you mean?

153
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,660
The press conference of our new game,
Yesterday's Promise, is in next month.

154
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,700
The characters are the most important part.

155
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,100
Those who are not contributing can leave now.

156
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,980
That includes the art director.

157
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,060
If you can't manage the project as a whole,

158
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,460
I don't mind approving

159
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,260
your resignation letter today.

160
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:11,940
Are you...

161
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,460
questioning my abilities?
