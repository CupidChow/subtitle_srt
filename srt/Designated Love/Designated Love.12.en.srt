3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,780
Why are you mad again?

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,180
How about punching me a few more times
to vent your anger?

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,940
How about punching me a few more times
to vent your anger?

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,220
What did you say?

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,940
It's too similar.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,900
Jiang Han has never said anything
like this before.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,540
Jiang Han is sick.

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,780
And the game is under maintenance.

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,400
Was I tricked?

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,280
What are you thinking about?

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,300
Nothing.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,740
Thank you for yesterday.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,500
If it weren't for you,

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,420
I wouldn't have known that my sick brother

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,380
had snuck out in the middle of the night
to go back to work.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,780
He is not coming today, is he?

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,820
Rest assured.

20
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,220
Today,

21
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,620
I arranged the nanny to guard the door.

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,820
And I tied my stupid brother to the bed.

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,940
Do you know Jiang Han well?

24
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,160
No one knows him like I do.

25
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,100
Does he play games?

26
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,100
Never.

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,060
What's wrong?

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,180
He has never shown any interest for games?

29
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,100
The only thing
he is interested in is studying.

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,100
Help me out with something, will you?

31
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,300
Tell me first.

32
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,500
Steal Jiang Han's phone for me.

33
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,700
And his passwords.

34
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,740
Cut it out already.

35
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,020
- Oh.
- Sorry.

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,860
I couldn't accept your crazy

37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,260
and magical love story right away.

38
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:49,980
So...

39
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,420
What do you think?

40
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,220
I think

41
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,060
Jiang Han and Jiang Xiaohan

42
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,820
are the same person.

43
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,580
Earlier,

44
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,260
I asked Jiang Jue
to steal Jiang Han's cellphone.

45
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:00,780
Right.

46
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,300
Right.

47
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,260
What about it?

48
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,140
Did you find the game?

49
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,300
I can't find it.

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,740
To check if someone is cheating...

51
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,300
Of course you should
look through the text messages,

52
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,060
WeChat,

53
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,380
online shopping history

54
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,540
and hotel bookings.

55
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,620
What can you get from the homepage?

56
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,820
This can't be.

57
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,220
No way.

58
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,820
Perhaps he has another phone.

59
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,380
Jiang Jue said he even looked under his bed.

60
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,740
But he couldn't even find 10 yuan,

61
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,740
let alone another cellphone.

62
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,140
Do you believe in what Jiang Jue said?

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,980
After all, he is Jiang Han's older brother.

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,940
Family members help out each other.

65
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,540
Family?

66
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,780
Ever since I was little,

67
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,220
the thing I enjoyed the most
was taking things from Jiang Han.

68
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,140
Do you sound like
I treat him like a family member?

69
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,580
Weird brothers are still brothers.

70
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,540
You were with my brother for four years,

71
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,900
so you should know

72
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,060
that he is someone...

73
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,260
How do I put this?

74
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,660
He doesn't show his feelings.

75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,580
Nothing can affect his mood.

76
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,540
By the way,

77
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,060
my parents thought
he had face paralysis when he was young

78
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,640
and they took him to see the doctors.

79
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,180
Your family sure had it hard.

80
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,700
That's why

81
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,140
my parents

82
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,820
paid more attention to my younger brother.

83
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,060
I,

84
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,140
as the eldest son,

85
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,860
of course had to share my parents' worries.

86
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,460
In order to prove that
there was nothing wrong with him,

87
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,780
since we were kids,

88
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,860
I would take his favorite things.

89
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,020
What a pervert.

90
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,460
And he also told me

91
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,400
that if there was any way
to mess with Jiang Han,

92
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,220
to upset him,

93
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,020
to trouble him,

94
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,700
or to embarrass him,
I should tell him about it

95
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,020
so that he could join in on the fun.

96
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,340
He even wants to record it.

97
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,140
That's why

98
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,060
I don't think he'd lie to me.

99
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:46,900
Tell me,

100
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,220
if they really are the same person,

101
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,940
does this I am cheating?

102
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,900
I think,

103
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,220
you are not.

104
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,340
The person you like is him, isn't it?

105
00:03:59,180 --> 00:03:59,660
Then,

106
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,180
what if they are different people?

107
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,900
Then you have nothing to worry about.

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,660
The one you like is Jiang Xiaohan, isn't it?

109
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,500
If you are still unsure,

110
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,740
it means
you still have feelings for Jiang Han.

111
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,420
I think you've become more logical.

112
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,100
Of course.

113
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,460
I can't be the only person in this world

114
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,300
that has fallen in love with two men
at the same time, right?

115
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,980
My god, sister.

116
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,260
Don't be so dramatic.

117
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:22,900
In my opinion,

118
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,180
it'd be better if they were two people.

119
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,540
You can date Jiang Xiaohan

120
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,700
and rekindle your relationship
with Jiang Han.

121
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,980
Men these days are also like this.

122
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,940
They have a girlfriend in real life

123
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,020
and a wife

124
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,900
or a partner in games.

125
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,740
If Jiang Han asks you about it,
you can tell him

126
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,580
that it is just a game
and that he shouldn't take it seriously.

127
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,860
Besides, Jiang Han looks exactly like him.

128
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,380
So at the end of the day,
you are still dating him.

129
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,860
But, the Qin Xi I know

130
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,500
would not get herself
into a situation like this.

131
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,420
I think you know

132
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,700
whether they are the same person, right?

133
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,260
(Game begins)

134
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,780
I put a lot of thought
into picking this place for our date.

135
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,220
Do you like it?

136
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,980
There is somewhere new every time.

137
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,700
Are you that free?

138
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,060
I just want you to see something different

139
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,300
every time you come here.

140
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:31,940
Xi,

141
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,340
I have something important to tell you.

142
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:33,700
Hold on,

143
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,900
I want to ask you a question first.

144
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,340
What is it?

145
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,740
I realize

146
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,860
that you've never asked me

147
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,380
if I mind the fact that you are an NPC.

148
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,980
Others would worry

149
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,500
if it is appropriate
for different species to be together.

150
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,220
But you don't seem
to care about this problem.

151
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,420
Do you mind who I am?

152
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,780
As long as you are that Jiang Han

153
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,260
that always cares about me

154
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,380
and is sincere to me,

155
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,980
I won't mind.

156
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,540
Can you promise me that
you will never lie to me?

157
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,460
Yes.

158
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,340
I promise.

159
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,820
If you ever lie to me,

160
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,820
I will leave you forever.

161
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:07,980
Okay.
