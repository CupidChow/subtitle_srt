3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,700
I dumped him.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,100
Airing your grievance
in front of the main character.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,100
How brave.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,620
Hello. I'm Jiang Jue.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,140
I'm Han's older brother.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,100
Qin Xi.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,340
I've heard a lot about you.

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,740
Since you have broken up with him,

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,140
why don't you have dinner with me tonight?

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,620
She doesn't have time.

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,940
I was asking her, not you.

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,980
She still doesn't have time.

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,820
Of course I don't have time.

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,460
However, Mr. Jiang.

17
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,380
If you try to make decisions for me again,

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,780
not only will I be your ex-girlfriend

19
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,020
but also I wouldn't mind
becoming your sister-in-law.

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,700
You think you're some big shot CEO?

21
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,420
You want to impress me
by trapping me against the wall?

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,660
I think you've watching too many dramas.

23
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,380
Can you be more gentle next time?

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,860
There won't be a next time.

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,420
Can you also behave
like a decent ex-boyfriend?

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,060
Hold your breath as soon as I show up

27
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,140
and make yourself disappear.

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,140
Why won't you listen to my explanations?

29
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,380
There is nothing between Shen Jingjing and I.

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,660
You've been saying that the whole time.

31
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,100
I don't even want to listen
to your stupid excuses anymore.

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,660
Do you hate Shen Jingjing?

33
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,100
No, I like her.

34
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,940
I like her so much that I'd be her bridesmaid

35
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,060
when she gets married.

36
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,700
I see.

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,700
You're being sarcastic.

38
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,980
I will ask Shen Jingjing to resign.

39
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,980
I will keep my distance from her.

40
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,660
Jiang Han.

41
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,420
What's the point of us acting like this?

42
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,300
You and Shen Jingjing are family.

43
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,940
She also knows
that you have an older brother.

44
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,980
We were together for so many years,

45
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,660
but I never knew you had an older brother.

46
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,140
That's because he's always abroad.

47
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,820
He came back very recently.

48
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,660
I didn't think it was necessary
to mention him.

49
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,100
Indeed.

50
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,860
But Shen Jingjing knew about it.

51
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,140
Xi.

52
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,140
Stay away from Jiang Jue.

53
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,060
It's none of your business.

54
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,940
Ever since we were little,
he would take away what I liked.

55
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,780
You...

56
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,300
Mr. Jiang, you are saying this
to the wrong person.

57
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,300
Miss Shen is inside.

58
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,500
Furthermore,

59
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,060
please refrain
from doing anything inappropriate.

60
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,620
Please respect
your employee's personal space.

61
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,500
Also,

62
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,140
I'm going to the ladies room.
Are you also coming along, Mr. Jiang?

63
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,980
I will ask Shen Jingjing to resign.

64
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,540
I will also keep my distance from her.

65
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,020
Who cares.

66
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,660
(Pranking Your Ex-boyfriend)
Your ex-boyfriend is ready for you to punch.

67
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,940
Are you not coming?

68
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,700
I'll feel abnormal
if I don't get a beating today.

69
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,180
There's no need to care for his feelings.

70
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,500
Come and torture him.

71
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,140
(Game begins)

72
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,020
Please select how you want to prank me.

73
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,940
I don't want to hit you.

74
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,020
I respect Master's decision.

75
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,180
Who came up with
the game's promotional material?

76
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:10,820
I'm sorry,

77
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,820
your question is beyond my list of answers.

78
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,940
Please ask me something else.

79
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,780
Did you change back to your previous version?

80
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,380
I'm sorry,

81
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,380
your question is beyond my list of answers.

82
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,220
Please ask me something else.

83
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,420
It's nice though.

84
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,180
Being an emotionless NPC

85
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,740
is not a bad thing.

86
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,980
At least you won't ever feel sad.

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,700
♪It somehow feels so sad♪

88
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,580
♪Remembering that smiling face♪

89
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,720
♪We used to have romance♪

90

♪We used to comfort each other's sadness♪

♪Love travels through time♪

93

You haven't forgotten
about the wager with your old man, have you?

94
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,620
On the release day

95
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,820
of the game, Yesterday's promise,

96
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,020
the downloads must exceed five million.

97
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,460
If not,

98
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,180
I will take this company.

99
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,780
The game will be released next month.

100
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,580
That's why

101
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,700
I'm doing this now.

102
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,100
If

103
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,340
I can affect your tempo

104
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,220
and ruin your press conference,

105
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,340
won't it be fun?

106
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,740
For example,

107
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,300
I can make Qin Xi my girlfriend.

108
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,940
Don't touch her.

109
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,700
Who would've known my stolid little brother

110
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,860
was able to make such facial expressions?

111
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,820
I am

112
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,900
getting more and more interested in her.

113
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,380
Fine.

114
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,380
I won't bully you anymore.

115
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,420
I'll come by more frequently
these couple of days

116
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,580
to really familiarize
myself with the company.

117
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,660
I wouldn't want to screw up
when I eventually take over the company.

118
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,260
Alright.

119
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,140
Bye now.

120
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,300
See you next time.

121
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,220
I am not coming back.

122
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,860
I am ready to let go.

123
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,100
There's no point wallowing in my sorrows.

124
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,500
By the way,

125
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,740
this game feels very realistic.

126
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,580
And my experience here
has been very positive.

127
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,100
Text me if you have any surveys.

128
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,980
I will give you a five-star review.

129
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,740
I thought you'd come here often

130
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,820
if I went back to my default self.

131
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,780
You didn't reset yourself?

132
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,060
The system rejected my application.

133
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,500
I could only pretend.

134
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,580
Are you really deleting this game?

135
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,100
Yes.

136
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,140
Once you delete the game,

137
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,380
I will vanish.

138
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,660
What do you mean?

139
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,820
I am who I am

140
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,580
because you created me.

141
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,380
Once you delete the game

142
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,580
and other players log in to the game,

143
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,020
even if their NPC become sentient,

144
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,540
it won't be me.

145
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,340
You...

146
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,900
You make it sound so bad.

147
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,580
I am just deleting a game.

148
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,700
It's not like I'm murdering someone.

149
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,660
It's not just like that.

150
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,540
I want to punch you as soon
as I see your face.

151
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,620
But the more I punch you,

152
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,420
the harder it is for me to move on.

153
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,140
So why should I come here regularly?

154
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,380
What did Jiang Han do to you

155
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,220
to make you hate him so much?

156
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:49,940
Too many things.

157
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,700
For example?

158
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,820
For example...

159
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,460
He caused others to despise me
in the company.

160
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,700
I'll be working in your company tomorrow,

161
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,420
so remember to act like you don't know me.

162
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,140
Why?

163
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,980
I got hired for my ability.

164
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,340
If your colleagues

165
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,980
find out that I am your girlfriend,

166
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,860
they'll think I got hired because of that.

167
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,340
OK.

168
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,140
I got it.

169
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,660
(Chinese Restaurant)

170
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,500
Tang Tang says
you've been having stomach pains lately.

171
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,780
I will buy you breakfast for you from now on.

172
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:13,900
Go back to your work.

173
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,180
As a result, everyone knew
about our relationship that day.

174
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,660
They all thought I got in because of him.

175
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,220
Only the director who interviewed me
knew that I got hired for my abilities.

176
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,180
But that director left the company

177
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,900
and recommended that
I become the new director.

178
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,100
However, those foolish colleagues of mine

179
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,900
thought that it was
because of Jiang Han again.

180
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,620
I got the position because I was capable!

181
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,340
I see.

182
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,020
I agree he has done wrong.

183
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,620
But why didn't you tell him about it?

184
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,860
How do I tell him about it?

185
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,300
Tell him to warn every employee

186
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,660
to not bully his girlfriend?

187
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,180
That would only make the rumors seem true.

188
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,580
I think I have a solution for this.

189
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,460
What solution?

190
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,060
Only if you promise me
not to delete the game.

191
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,940
I don't want to hear about it anyway.

192
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,690
Fine, I'll tell you!

193
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,900
The carrot and stick approach.
