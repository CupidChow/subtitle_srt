3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,320
I didn't think we could have dinner together.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,760
It's just a meal. We are not sleeping together.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,920
Besides, you should know

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,960
why I asked you out.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,240
As long as it upset my dear brother,

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,200
I wouldn't mind being used.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,360
It's more than that.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,040
Why are you

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,400
wandering around in the company every day?

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,720
That I can't tell you.

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,040
You just need to know

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,440
that this press conference is crucial.

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,520
The game, Yesterday's Promise,
has been hyped up for half a year.

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,280
The ads are everywhere.

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,960
Everyone in the business is paying close attention to it.

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,840
The players will interact directly with
the finished game in the press conference,

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,360
which will affect the downloads of the day.

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,480
You want the company?

21
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,120
Did you tell them to come here?

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,560
Waiter.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,920
We want to sit with them.

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,000
It's such a coincidence meeting you guys here.

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,720
It's not a coincidence.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,720
Right, Han?

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,440
Shen Jingjing.

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,360
I have something to say to you.

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,160
Right now?

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,080
I hope you can leave the company in one week.

31
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,600
Why?

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,240
Did I do something wrong?

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,080
It's due to my personal reasons.

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
I also hope that we can contact each other less often.

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,440
It would be even better

36
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,840
if we didn't contact each other at all.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,640
Did you ask Jiang Han to do this?

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,960
This has nothing to do with me.

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,800
I am the one that thinks that
we should stay away from each other.

40
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,280
Why?

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,600
We grew up together.

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,800
Look at Jiang Jue. He never told me to stay away.

43
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,280
Don't drag me into this.

44
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,600
The one you like is Jiang Han, not me.

45
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,080
-Do you like me?
-I...

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,920
You weren't aware of it?

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,120
Yet you claim you have an IQ of 120.

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,520
Did you cheat in the test?

49
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
I knew it.

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,200
You asked Jiang Han to do it.

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
It's none of her business.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,880
Jingjing.

53
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,240
You should not fall for me.

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,800
I only see you as a friend.

55
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,040
Rejecting a girl in front of so many people,

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,000
Han,

57
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,440
you are not a gentleman.

58
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,620
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,400
Keep your love dilemma to yourselves.

60
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,160
I'm not interested. I'll be leaving now.

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,120
Xi.

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:29,960
I'll give you a ride home.

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,920
Mr. Jiang.

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,080
This is a complicated relationship problem

65
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,280
caused by your low IQ and EQ.

66
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,320
Do you think the matter would be resolved

67
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,760
by simply saying "I only see you as a friend"?

68
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,120
There's no way he didn't know about her feelings for him.

69
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,160
In fact,

70
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,320
most men know what women want,

71
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,040
they just don't want to

72
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,200
push the women away.

73
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,840
Now you tell her you just want to be friends.

74
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,160
Does he take me as a fool or Shen Jingjing as a fool?

75
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,460
(Game begins)

76
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,440
You are here.

77
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,520
Were you waiting for me?

78
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,160
Yes.

79
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,480
After becoming sentient,

80
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
do you retain your five senses

81
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,360
including pain?

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,720
This is a prank game.

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,440
They don't store pain related data of the NPC.

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,400
Good.

85
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,080
What do you mean?

86
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,960
Didn't you say you can't feel pain?

87
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,600
I can't

88
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,840
but it looks painful.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But it's also quite fun.

90
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,960
How could you say that when your face is that swollen?

91
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,040
As long as you're happy.

92
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,520
I'm here to make you happy and let you vent your anger.

93
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,720
You are such a weird NPC.

94
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,800
How so?

95
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,240
You acted like you knew me

96
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,560
when we first met.

97
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,880
You're not Jiang Han, are you?

98
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,720
And you created this game to mess with me,

99
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,040
right?

100
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,520
N-No...

101
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,960
My name is Jiang Han, yes.

102
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,720
But you were the one that gave me this name.

103
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,760
I seem to be close to you
because you are the only person I know.

104
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,680
Am I the only person you know?

105
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,040
When I first opened my eyes,

106
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,000
you were the first person I saw.

107
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,520
I also became sentient because you.

108
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,920
That's why the only thing I can do is to make you happy.

109
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,640
If only the real Jiang Han

110
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,000
was just like you.

111
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,360
He...

112
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,200
Does he treat you badly?

113
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,200
Horribly.

114
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,240
He never says anything sweet to me.

115
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,640
He only calls me by my name.

116
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,720
Not even my nickname.

117
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,640
When we were still students,

118
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,100
every date of ours included Shen Jingjing.

119
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,260
He'd either take me to the library

120
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,260
or to the classes.

121
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,560
When the three of us go out together,

122
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,600
he would be very good at juggling the situation.

123
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,480
Shen Jingjing would have everything I got from him.

124
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,720
I could never feel the uniqueness

125
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,760
of being his girlfriend.

126
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,240
I felt like I had dated a zombie for 4 years.

127
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,200
I've wasted all of my youth on him.

128
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,200
How about punching me
a few more times to vent your anger?

129
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,860
(Sandwich)

130
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,880
Did you buy this?

131
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,660
(Sandwich)

132
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,920
It's expired.

133
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,400
Are you trying to poison me?

134
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,080
No way! I just bought it!

135
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,040
I need to get back to work.

136
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,260
Thank you for defending us in the meeting today, Xi.

137
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,260
(Sandwich)

138
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,880
Jiang Han.

139
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,180
(Game begins)

140
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,400
Bring it on. How do you want to punch me?

141
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,600
Am I such a violent person?

142
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,520
No.

143
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
You look happy today.

144
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,600
Listen,

145
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,160
your method was very useful.

146
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,680
The other day,

147
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,360
I defended them in a meeting.

148
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,360
I guess that's my reward for them.

149
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,400
And today they got me some bread.

150
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,000
When you were helping them,

151
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,720
did you think it was a reward?

152
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,520
Not really.

153
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,440
After all, I'm the manager.

154
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,680
I was the one that approved their designs.

155
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
Scolding them is like scolding myself.

156
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,840
Besides,

157
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,800
I know how hardworking they have been.

158
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,760
See?

159
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,480
Your colleagues just needed a chance to get to know you.

160
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,640
I got this hairstyle done this morning.

161
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,600
I'll beat you up if you mess it up.

162
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,120
What were you reading?

163
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,520
Show me.

164
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,320
It's nothing.

165
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,560
Why are you nervous then?

166
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,000
Give it to me.

167
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,080
I want to invite you

168
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
to go on a date with me.
