3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,860
If you can't manage the project as a whole,

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,020
I don't mind
approving your resignation letter today.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,260
Are you...

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,900
questioning my abilities?

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,300
(Designer: Weiwei)

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,860
Let's each take a step back

9
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,940
and calm down.

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,260
How about I treat everyone to some milk tea?

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,020
We can chat over tea.

12
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,300
Are you the cheerleader here?

13
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,460
Qin Xi.

14
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,420
We are in a meeting.

15
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,740
Watch your tongue.

16
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,860
Right.

17
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,940
Who am I to yell
at your childhood sweetheart?

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,700
(Game begins)

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,700
Jiang Han, I'll give you a good beating!

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,060
How can you bully me?

21
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,300
You are such a horrible person!

22
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,020
Go to hell!

23
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,140
Go to hell!

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,260
You...

25
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,820
Back so soon?

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,740
It's not even 24 hours yet.

27
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,100
You can communicate now?

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,180
Did you cry?

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,660
Don't touch me.

30
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,020
Fine. I won't touch you.

31
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,020
Don't be scared. I'm not some bad guy.

32
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,020
I have to thank you.

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,100
What do you mean?

34
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,620
If it weren't for your beating yesterday,

35
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,060
my in-game friendship level
wouldn't have improved this fast

36
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,140
and I wouldn't have
become sentient so easily.

37
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,860
Friendship level and becoming sentient?

38
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,660
You mean beating you up
improves the friendship level?

39
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,380
(Friendship level increased by 48)
This mechanic is hidden by default.

40
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,220
After you left yesterday,

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,700
the system notified me
that I am level-one sentient.

42
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,620
I am now completely free from control.

43
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,260
How can the game
and the NPC be so disgusting?

44
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,660
It's almost like
there's elements of sadomasochism.

45
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,220
Maybe a little.

46
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,820
You look the same,

47
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,540
but something seems off.

48
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,700
What do you mean?

49
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,060
He never smiles,

50
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,420
at least not to me.

51
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,340
I have his face and name,

52
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,460
but I am still myself.

53
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,940
Now that I am sentient,

54
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,420
my appearance and my name are pointless.

55
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,380
You can see me as
a completely different person.

56
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,140
Can you turn back to how you were?

57
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,180
Like how I was yesterday?

58
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,130
May I know why?

59
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,860
I hate your face.

60
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,620
And I hate it even more when you smile at me.

61
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,620
Wasn't yesterday nice?

62
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,220
This is a game about pranks.

63
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,780
An NPC should be cold and emotionless

64
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,260
so that I wouldn't feel bad beating them up.

65
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,260
Am I right?

66
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,380
If that is your wish,

67
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,700
I will do it.

68
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,060
Thanks.

69
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,300
I'll come back when you go back
to your default settings.

70
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,580
(Xiaonan  One new message)
Director Qin, are you alright?

71
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,140
(Xi)
Xin, I want to take the afternoon off.

72
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,100
Since you don't care,

73
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,380
why did you run?

74
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,340
I was sick.

75
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,460
You still have feelings for me.

76
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,460
How conceited of you!

77
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,460
Why did you go to him then?

78
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,700
I'm not you.

79
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,860
You are an NPC conceptualized by Qin Xi.

80
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,940
Her mind thought about me

81
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,300
and created you.

82
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,100
Yes.

83
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,260
I want you to die.

84
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,360
Hatred is also an emotion.

85
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,900
If you didn't care,

86
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,140
you wouldn't have entered the game.

87
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,100
What about you?

88
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,180
Who do you like?

89
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,620
Wasn't his attitude toward me today

90
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,100
obvious enough?

91
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,580
Why did you confess your love to me then?

92
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,940
Because I liked you, of course.

93
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,940
Don't be fooled by him.

94
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,420
He has been protecting Shen Jingjing.

95
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,860
I've known Jingjing for 20 years.

96
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,380
Of course I have to protect her.

97
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,380
What am I to you then?

98
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,020
A third party in this relationship?

99
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,060
Don't listen to him.

100
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,260
Shen Jingjing is the third party here.

101
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:06,900
She is not.

102
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,380
Can you say she's not the reason we broke up?

103
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,220
Perhaps we weren't meant for each other.

104
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,940
If that's the case, then why did
you waste four years of Xi's life?

105
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,180
These four years proved

106
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,260
that our beginning was a mistake.

107
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,740
The one who is not loved
is the real third party here.

108
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,580
You were too slow

109
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,700
to realize the truth.

110
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,420
Stop struggling.

111
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,020
Let us be together

112
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,100
and let yourself go.

113
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,460
The one who is not loved
is the real third party here.

114
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,140
Perhaphs we weren't meant for each other.

115
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,500
You were too slow

116
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,620
to realize the truth.

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,540
Let us be together

118
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,180
and let yourself go.

119
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,980
So I am the one that needs to leave, right?

120
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,420
Don't listen to him or look at him!

121
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,460
You did nothing wrong.

122
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,220
You should not leave.

123
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,260
You are Jiang Han. I don't believe you.

124
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,020
I'm not.

125
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,420
At least I'm not the Jiang Han that you know.

126
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,340
Jiang Han.

127
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,540
Have you ever had feelings for me?

128
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,460
Qin Xi.

129
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,020
You did nothing wrong.

130
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,660
Don't run away.

131
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,940
And don't lose.

132
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,700
I heard

133
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,900
that Mr. Jiang went to the airport today
with Jingjing.

134
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,300
Why did he go with Jingjing but not Qin Xi?

135
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,900
You know why.

136
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,380
Jingjing knows

137
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,340
Mr. Jiang's brother.

138
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,980
There's nothing strange about them
going to the airport together to pick him up.

139
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,860
Somehow I think something like this
should be reserved for the girlfriend.

140
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,300
She'll become his girlfriend eventually.

141
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,140
If I were Mr. Jiang,
I would also choose Jingjing.

142
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,060
I mean, she's always smiling.

143
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,860
Unlike Qin Xi,

144
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,740
showing her displeasure all the time.

145
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,860
I wonder why she is always so unhappy?

146
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,180
Unhappy at you, of course.

147
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,500
I heard you ladies were very interested

148
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,900
in my relationship with Mr. Jiang.

149
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,180
We were just chit-chatting.

150
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,940
We're done eating. See you.

151
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,620
Since

152
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,140
you ladies are so interested,

153
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,580
I will explain the whole matter.

154
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,980
I broke up with Jiang Han because...

155
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,860
Firstly,

156
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,620
because your Mr. Jiang
is a cheater and horrible person.

157
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,780
Even though he already has a girlfriend,

158
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,580
he still flirts
with his childhood sweetheart.

159
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,180
Secondly,

160
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,140
Shen Jingjing.

161
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,220
I can't control it if you want
to be good friends with a mistress.

162
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,460
After all, she might marry

163
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,420
the boss of this company in the near future.

164
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,460
But in order to stop you two
from spreading rumors about me

165
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,100
crying my eyes out every day,

166
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,940
I think it is necessary for me
to clear things up now.

167
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,700
As of now,

168
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,340
I don't have any feelings

169
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,940
