1
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,359
Wenhu

2
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,399
You are General Hu’s daughter

3
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,759
I'm not just his daughter

4
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,559
I also use my own hands

5
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,559
The love letter between him and my mother

6
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,639
Gave it to Lu Cheng

7
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,999
Lu Cheng was jealous

8
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,119
By the hand of the traitor

9
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,599
In one fell swoop, General Hu, a political enemy, was eradicated.

10
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,239
Jianghu

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,239
The mastermind who killed your bad brother

12
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,559
That's Lu Cheng

13
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,199
The reason is to force you to surrender to him

14
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,359
The person you have hated your whole life

15
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,999
With him

16
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,679
me too

17
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,879
Lao Bai

18
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,319
Don't be seduced by that witch

19
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,279
She wants you to lose your fighting spirit

20
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,959
Regrets from the past

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,919
Indeed my life

22
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,879
The knot that cannot be erased

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,959
But then I understood

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,839
Even if life or death

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,399
Regret is irreversible

26
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,839
every day from now on

27
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,999
Can't live up to it

28
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,719
every knife

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,039
Don't kill by mistake

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,119
every best friend

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,719
Not allowed to be lost

32
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,919
Lao Bai

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,519
you finally let go

34
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,119
Then I can feel at ease

35
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,679
You let it go

36
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,159
I don't

37
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,239
careful

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:25,959
night rain

39
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,799
Jianghu

40
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,639
I'm not afraid of dying by your sword

41
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,159
But

42
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,839
I won't make it easy for you either

43
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,479
Ji Niang beside you

44
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,719
I personally rewarded Wei Nantian with my own hands

45
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,599
Wei Nantian has so many tricks up his sleeve

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,078
Broken hand bones

47
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,039
Many people enjoy flower viewing

48
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,759
bone-drawing piano

49
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,999
I really envy Ji Niang

50
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,959
How much fun will you have before you die?

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,679
you

52
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,959
Not worthy of being a human being

53
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,199
Jianghu

54
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,959
When you were

55
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,319
leave me alone

56
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,399
Yomi Road

57
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,639
You accompany me

58
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,839
OK

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,679
How about it

60
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,799
I'll take you to find the medicine jar

61
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,239
It's dawn

62
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,199
Walk

63
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,919
night rain

64
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,119
Come, let me carry you

65
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,479
Lao Bai

66
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,719
I'm a little tired

67
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,279
Can't walk anymore

68
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,359
It's snowing

69
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,359
What a nice view

70
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,079
If I hadn't encountered all this

71
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,519
Can I be like this too?

72
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,559
Immaculately white

73
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,199
You are the same now

74
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,039
Lao Bai

75
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,479
do you know

76
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,319
in my short life

77
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,519
only you

78
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,839
Are you willing to treat me, a person with blood on my hands?

79
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,039
Show true feelings

80
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,559
Okay, stop talking.

81
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,519
let's go home

82
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,679
The medicine jar can definitely save you

83
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,799
Lao Bai

84
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,399
I can't go back

85
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,919
sorry

86
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,599
I don't want to say goodbye

87
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,879
but

88
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,759
you are poisoned

89
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,159
What happened when?

90
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,359
careful

91
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,158
Poison needle

92
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,519
You draw out the worms for me

93
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,639
He also blocked the poisonous needle for me

94
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,839
Why

95
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,319
In this world of chaos

96
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,119
It's you who light up my way forward

97
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,439
You told me back then

98
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,239
good

99
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,799
live well

100
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,319
I always remember this sentence

101
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,719
Now

102
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,199
I'll give it back to you

103
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,799
Let this flute accompany you on my behalf

104
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,999
Accompany you to see the prosperity of the world

105
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,239
Towards the top of Lingyun

106
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,239
Lao Bai

107
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,079
Stop crying, Lao Bai

108
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,599
I I want to hear you call my name for the last time

109
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,399
Cong Ningqi

110
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,239
East

111
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,879
Junmu Bowei

112
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,599
Jun Jiebo

113
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,639
Xiang Nihui Ao Yaozhen
