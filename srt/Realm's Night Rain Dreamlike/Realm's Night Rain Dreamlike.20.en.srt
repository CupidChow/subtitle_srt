00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,239
Wen

2
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,679
Zhan'er

3
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,399
My war son

4
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,319
war

5
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,239
brother

6
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,799
How can you bear to leave us?

7
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,639
You are the invincible big brother

8
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,239
Didn't you and I, brothers, have an agreement?

9
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,639
So many big things at home are undecided

10
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,959
We agreed to work together to revive the Lu family

11
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,679
After you leave

12
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,879
You let your brother live in this world

13
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,479
What should I do from now on?

14
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,559
The sky has no eyes

15
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,079
Father

16
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,119
So far

17
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,639
Sorry

18
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,639
You and your brother should have worked together.

19
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,839
advance and retreat together

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,799
But what about you?

21
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,639
Why did you let your brother go to suppress the bandits alone?

22
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,279
Don't think I don't know

23
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,719
You were deliberately provoking me before

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,119
Otherwise Zhan'er

25
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,759
How could he go there in person with his identity?

26
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,079
I was going to be with my brother

27
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,799
Dao went to hunt down the evil thief

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,639
But brother doesn’t trust me

29
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,039
Not only did it hurt my arm

30
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,079
And they forced me to stay in the house

31
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,999
Father

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,999
I am also your biological son

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,279
from now on

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,959
You only have one son: me.

35
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,359
finally arrived

36
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,839
Let's go first tonight

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,079
An inn run by bad guys

38
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,679
have a night's rest

39
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,319
I listen to you

40
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,159
Lao Bai

41
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,919
This life is too short

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,479
Can't you adjust what people drink?

43
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,799
drank it

44
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,999
Your life will no longer be miserable

45
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,679
Don't drink

46
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,719
This girl feeds me wine for fun

47
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,239
You grown man feed me medicine

48
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,279
It's life-saving

49
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,359
Just drink it

50
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,919
I don’t feel at ease if you hold it

51
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,519
This thing is really not for people to drink.

52
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,279
I know there's something

53
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,839
Better than this medicine

54
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,479
Just one sip will make me feel good all over

55
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,359
I have plenty of wine

56
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,599
But you have to drink the medicine first

57
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,839
I'll do it myself

58
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,399
It's getting cold

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,759
It's time to put on more clothes

60
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,279
I'll ask the shopkeeper here

61
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,599
I went to buy you some new clothes.

62
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,879
Will be able to put it on soon

63
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,119
No need to waste it

64
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,679
perhaps

65
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,959
I can't survive the next winter either

66
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,959
Don't talk nonsense

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,119
I'd better do it

68
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,039
What about warming wine?

69
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,039
I'm better at

70
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,319
You used to warm the wine for me

71
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,319
I'll do it later

72
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,279
It's New Year's Eve soon

73
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,399
It's a day of reunion

74
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,399
yes

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,799
before leaving

76
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,599
I promised Medicine Jar and Ronger

77
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,559
I want to take you back for reunion

78
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,039
Laozi

79
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,039
This time we are in a life and death situation

80
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,119
Are you still thinking about going back?

81
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,239
Is it true that you risk your life to join the game?

82
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,359
but hope

83
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,199
Not false either

84
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,559
I have promised Ronger

85
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,799
It must be done

86
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,159
Although I can't go back

87
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,119
But you must live well

88
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,439
