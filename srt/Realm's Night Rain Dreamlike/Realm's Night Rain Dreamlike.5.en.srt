1
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,239
What’s wrong with you

2
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,079
what is this

3
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,119
don't touch me

4
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,599
what happened to you

5
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,359
I don't know

6
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,959
But when I was young, you gave me warmth

7
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,759
now i

8
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,159
I will also stay by your side

9
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,679
It's cold outside

10
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,679
It's so warm in the room

11
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,159
uninvited

12
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,519
The introduction was not finished last time

13
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,039
Lao Bai

14
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,959
If you don't like to call me Ye Yu

15
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,199
You can call me by my nickname

16
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,799
Ayu

17
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,199
Not interested

18
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,159
Once you hear it, you'll get used to it.

19
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,119
Just like when I call you Lao Bai

20
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,159
You seem to be able to accept it too

21
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,559
Lao Bai

22
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,319
What about you?

23
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,839
Although it looks indifferent

24
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,839
But my thoughts are heavier than anyone else’s

25
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,319
If I really have ill intentions towards you

26
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,559
How could you let me get close to you?

27
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,159
And I

28
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,999
I clearly know your weaknesses

29
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,479
But I didn't take the opportunity to hurt you

30
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,279
to be replaced by someone else

31
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,519
I've already disabled his limbs

32
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,199
and then in my own way

33
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,199
Tied to my side

34
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,399
Then you must have that ability

35
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,919
Right

36
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,439
The proprietress of Yichun Tower

37
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,279
I don't have a normal relationship with you, right?

38
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,799
Is she important to you?

39
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,479
If you dare to hurt her

40
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,919
I will kill you

41
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,119
Then you really think too much

42
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,519
The people I want to kill are the people from Lingui Pavilion

43
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,679
As for a woman who is powerless

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,159
I'm not interested

45
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,479
Unless she blocks my way

46
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,719
you want to kill

47
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,959
I want to save

48
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,559
We don't agree with each other

49
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,999
Do you want to save the people targeted by Lingui Pavilion?

50
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,319
Just kill people

51
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,919
You are Jianghu

52
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,639
The bad handsome man who was once famous all over the world

53
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,719
How many people have you killed

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,479
Should know better than anyone else

55
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,479
I'm no longer the bad handsome guy I used to be

56
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,559
In the past, it was not something you could just throw away.

57
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,879
Jianghu

58
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,719
Something has been imprinted on you

59
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,319
Can't get rid of it

60
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,439
who are you

61
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,799
have we met before

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,239
I'm Ayu

63
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,239
other

64
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,959
None of it matters

65
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,039
If there is any grudge between you and me

66
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,439
come at me

67
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,119
No tricks

68
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,719
hurt innocent people

69
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,599
Lao Bai

70
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,159
You really wronged me

71
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,319
It's rare to do a good thing

72
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,479
On the contrary, I did something wrong

73
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,079
rest assured

74
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,359
Can you help me catch the bait from Lingui Pavilion?

75
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,399
Not only do I not want to kill you

76
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,439
I need to protect you even more

77
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,599
Have you stayed enough?

78
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,039
Get out now

79
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,319
Sent to you

80
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,799
remember

81
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,039
Ayu

82
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,879
You still refuse to say

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,839
Where is Ji Niang?

84
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,519
You asked me a thousand times

85
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,319
I still say the same thing

86
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,999
I have no idea

87
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,559
Bastard

88
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,239
Keep playing

89
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,039
yes

90
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,559
elder sister

91
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,999
I'm afraid that this time Ru Niang

92
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,719
I can't stay with you anymore

93
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,759
Ronger is so good

94
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,319
What's going on

95
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,519
Always feel uneasy

96
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,559
Ru Niang has been gone for a while too

97
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,559
Why haven't you come back yet?

98
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,199
Could it be

99
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,399
what happened

100
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,039
elder sister

101
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,879
Are you thinking about Sister Ru Niang too?

102
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,079
Yes Ronger

103
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,839
How about my sister go and bring Sister Ru Niang back?

104
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,799
Ronger also wants to go together

105
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,279
Rong'er won't go

106
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,599
Ronger eats first

107
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,559
Then wait for Uncle Jianghu to come back from cutting firewood

108
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,079
You tell Uncle Jianghu

109
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,759
There is medicinal food for him in the pot

110
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,839
You must drink it while watching him

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,679
Do you know

112
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,719
knew

113
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,599
elder sister

114
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,639
You must come back soon

115
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,239
Sister knows

116
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,199
Ronger is waiting for her sister at home.

117
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,519
have you heard

118
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,679
That's what happened two days ago

119
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,919
I heard that those girls in Yichun Tower

120
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,439
They were all caught by Lingui Pavilion

121
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,439
I heard about it too

122
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,599
It is said that the people in Lingui Pavilion are very vicious

123
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,639
It seems that they cannot escape death.

124
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,599
yes

125
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,159
What a bad thing

126
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,119
This bait

127
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,679
Found it

128
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,879
Isn’t this sister Ji Niang’s?

129
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,039
Why are you here?

130
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,039
Uncle Jiang

131
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,879
Uncle Jiang, you are back

132
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,559
Where is Ji Niang?

133
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,239
She said she went to see Sister Ru Niang

134
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,559
Let me wait for you at home

135
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,879
Eat first

136
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,039
Wait for me at home

137
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,039
Various masks

138
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,879
guest officer

139
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,719
Lao Bai

140
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,039
What a coincidence

141
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,319
Are you here to get some information?

142
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,119
Do you want me to help you?

143
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,079
Do we know each other well?

144
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,959
I told you my nickname

145
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,079
We are not familiar with each other yet

146
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,519
Heretical things

147
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,959
I'm better at it

148
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,719
For example, the person you want to inquire about

149
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,279
Whose hands does it fall into?

150
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,879
And Lingui Pavilion

151
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,279
Why don't we help each other?

152
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,679
you have a way

153
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,839
There are many

154
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,439
Learn more

155
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,519
