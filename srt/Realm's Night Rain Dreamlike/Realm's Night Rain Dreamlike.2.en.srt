1
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,519
constant

2
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,999
This is what your father asked me to send back.

3
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,879
Put it away

4
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,039
Uncle, where is my father?

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,519
where has he gone

6
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,279
he is dead

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,159
die

8
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,199
Just like your mother

9
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,599
Close your eyes forever

10
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,879
Can't wake up

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,319
Dad, Mom, Dad

12
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,759
Never wake up again

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,479
These parents died in troubled times

14
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,279
I'm afraid this child won't survive either.

15
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,239
unless

16
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,599
Dad, Mom, Dad

17
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,559
don't leave me

18
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,319
Dad, Mom, Dad

19
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,639
don't leave me

20
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,039
please

21
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,719
Help me get the letter from home

22
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,559
send home

23
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,959
please

24
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,639
help me deliver it

25
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,399
Come down

26
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,959
how

27
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,759
bored at night

28
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,239
Want to find someone to chat with?

29
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,159
Although I'm not used to talking too much to living people

30
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,079
But exceptions can be made

31
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,119
why follow me

32
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,439
There is Buddha in my heart

33
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,959
Everyone you see is a Buddha

34
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,279
No self in mind

35
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,759
How did you know I was with you all the way?

36
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,279
Just say it

37
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,239
What is your purpose?

38
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,359
You don't understand amorous feelings at all

39
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,439
never mind

40
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,119
Then I'll tell you straight

41
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,679
Do you know Lingui Pavilion?

42
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,719
Lingui Pavilion

43
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,919
Lingui Pavilion’s bully occupying the Eastern Capital

44
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,599
Doing all kinds of evil for money and power

45
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,279
Burning, killing, looting and doing all kinds of bad things

46
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,679
It’s hard to write on bamboo

47
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,359
The master of the pavilion suddenly summoned

48
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,039
What's going on?

49
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,719
Just to kill Xu Kui's wife and daughter

50
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,999
He actually broke the coffin ghost

51
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,439
Can't even beat a woman

52
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,879
This Lingui Pavilion

53
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,959
It’s really a vain name.

54
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,159
matter

55
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,079
I just learned about it too

56
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,239
The spies sent out came to report

57
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,999
There is a madman with white hair

58
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,559
Killed the coffin ghost and his party

59
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,119
He also took Xu Kui’s daughter away

60
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,039
What

61
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,559
The coffin ghost is dead

62
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,159
this is impossible

63
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,519
He is our Lingui Pavilion

64
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,439
The hall master who ranks third in martial arts

65
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,679
That madman has great martial arts skills

66
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,199
Very skilled

67
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,919
someone said

68
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,999
He is the former number one in the world

69
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:40,879
Jianghu

70
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,639
Think about those days

71
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,279
He said he hated the smell of blood the most

72
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,399
Who would have thought

73
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,999
What I want to smell most now

74
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,199
It's his blood

75
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,799
Pavilion Master

76
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,479
This is asking us to kill him

77
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,839
Who asked you to kill him?

78
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,199
He doesn't like it

79
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,879
Protect others?

80
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,719
Then let him

81
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,919
one person

82
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,919
Can't protect it either

83
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,919
catch him

84
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,559
Even with the most cruel means

85
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,399
Kill everyone around him

86
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,839
But I want to see him alive

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,519
yes

88
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,559
Lin ghosts appear and no grass grows

89
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,399
Those who want to kill must be eradicated.

90
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,799
Jianghu

91
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,839
five years

92
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,119
Unexpectedly

93
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,279
you are still alive

94
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,679
Good show

95
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,359
It's started

96
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,439
Lin ghosts appear and no grass grows

97
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,519
Those who want to kill must be eradicated.

98
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,039
Lingui Pavilion is within Dongji

99
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,479
largest underground organization

100
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,279
Eyes and ears all over the Central Plains

101
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,679
Running various illegal businesses

102
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,079
Act ruthlessly and do all kinds of evil

103
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,239
It can be said

104
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,119
From the moment you are targeted by Lingui Pavilion

105
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,639
You are already a dead person

106
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,799
What does this have to do with you

107
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,519
I have a grudge against Lingui Pavilion

108
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,999
It's a pity

109
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,799
They are elusive

110
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,479
I was unable to discover the location of its lair

111
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,719
As for the ghost pavilion master

112
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,359
No one has ever seen her true face

113
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,799
Since you are not afraid of death

114
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,839
Then be my bait

115
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,719
have a look

116
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,439
Your face is like a crown jewel

117
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,279
Looks lovable

118
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,439
be my bait

119
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,519
Couldn't be more suitable

120
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,479
I'm serious

121
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,959
You bring people out

122
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,559
I'm here to take the ghost head. It's a perfect match.

123
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,399
I'm not interested

124
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,839
You killed the person I wanted to kill

125
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,359
I should have given my life back

126
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,719
absurd

127
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,839
Go quickly

128
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,159
don't follow me

129
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,359
you

130
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,879
Guest officer please come inside

131
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,079
Come

132
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,399
You came so early

133
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,079
in a hurry

134
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,119
Then what do you want to eat?

135
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,359
Two bowls of noodles

136
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,799
Okay, wait a moment

137
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,119
thank you uncle

138
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,679
Waiter

139
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,479
Have a plate of signature meat dishes

140
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,559
OK

141
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,239
What a coincidence, we meet again

142
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,039
Sir, your face

143
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,639
Although I don’t like making friends

144
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,479
But I prefer people who challenge themselves

145
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,359
you

146
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,799
Just fits my eyes

147
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,679
Guest, your meat dishes

148
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,599
Small

149
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,319
Bring all the good wine and food in your store

150
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,039
Served them all

151
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,159
OK

152
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,159
No

153
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,399
What are you going to do?

154
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,719
Treating guests to dinner

155
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,039
What about me?

156
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,199
Although not all kinds

157
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,399
But there are only two

158
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,399
Too many people on hand

159
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,799
Lots of money in pockets

160
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,919
Eat more, kid

161
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,119
Long body

162
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,359
Uncle eats it too

163
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,519
uncle

164
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,759
Am I that old?

165
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,119
call brother

166
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,879
Eat quickly and have to go on the road

167
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,759
Uncle Jiang

168
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,759
I'll eat more

169
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,599
Can I become as powerful as you?

170
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,119
He's better than us

171
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,479
Why are you staring at me?

172
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,439
Have a meal

173
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,479
I just think brother

174
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,959
You look like the handsome man in the storybook

175
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,599
full

176
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,279
Let's go

177
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,439
Uncle Jiang

178
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,999
That uncle doesn't look like a bad guy

179
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,159
That uncle helped us kill the bad guys last night

180
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,159
He must be a good man

181
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,079
Kill bad guys

182
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,799
Not necessarily a good person

183
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,679
Then Uncle Jiang, please teach me Kung Fu.

184
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,359
I also want to become as powerful as you

185
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,879
live well

186
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,279
Uncle Jiang

187
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,439
So where should we go next?

188
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,599
Dongdu

189
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,999
live well

190
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,239
Cong Ning Pin Min Duan Qide
