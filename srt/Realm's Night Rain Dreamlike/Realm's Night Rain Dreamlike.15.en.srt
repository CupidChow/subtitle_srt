1
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,319
Wen

2
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,439
Lao Bai

3
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,919
You are too uninteresting, right?

4
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,039
We have fought side by side for so long

5
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,679
He can be considered a confidant, right?

6
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,959
This trip is my business

7
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,159
Just leave it alone

8
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,359
Let me get it for you

9
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,199
night rain

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,999
Your business is my business

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,839
Of course I have to take care of my business

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,959
this is my rule

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,119
i know what you are thinking

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,519
are you thinking

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,759
The three-dimensional Gu worm in your body

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,399
Attacks are becoming more frequent

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,439
Don't want to drag me to die with you

18
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,439
Then I have to take care of it even more

19
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,599
I have to collect the body for you.

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,519
Lao Bai

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,199
I don’t need the night rain

22
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:51,039
Ayu

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,839
You have so many rules

24
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,879
Recently I found a marriage for you

25
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,639
Find an auspicious day in the month

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,759
Just marry into Liu Yushi's family.

27
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,159
The clumsy and stupid son of Liu Yushi’s family

28
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,319
I don't want to marry

29
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,239
I want to stay here

30
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,279
stay with father

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,119
Father

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,959
Your mother was pregnant back then

33
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,519
Marry into our Lu family

34
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,279
Hidden from me for eight whole years

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,479
these eight years

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,439
I made you the most distinguished eldest lady of the Lu family

37
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,479
I didn’t expect you to be the flesh and blood of my enemy.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,999
If I hadn't had a trace of family affection

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,999
I have kicked you out of the Lu family a long time ago

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,519
Let you fend for yourself

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,959
But father

42
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,599
Didn’t he also send me to Lingui Pavilion?

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,399
That's a place that eats people without spitting out their bones.

44
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,199
die

45
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,279
It's the easiest thing

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,919
Do you dare to mention Lingui Pavilion?

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,999
How much business does our Lu family have privately?

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,679
Lingui Pavilion is required to operate

49
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,919
As a result, they were slaughtered overnight

50
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,439
Do you dare to say

51
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,239
This is really not your revenge

52
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,919
Everything about my daughter

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,719
All given by father

54
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,719
How dare you give birth to

55
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,399
rebellious mind

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,879
five years ago

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,879
You were defiled

58
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,519
Causing uproar in the city

59
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,119
If it weren't for Liu Yushijia

60
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,959
For the sake of our Lu family,

61
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,159
Who do you think dares to want you?

62
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,839
Please continue this marriage honestly.

63
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,599
Don't cause any more trouble

64
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,879
yes

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,239
My daughter knows

66
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,359
This rain won't stop for a while

67
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,279
Fortunately, we arrived at the right time

68
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,399
Find a temple to hide from the rain

69
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,519
But also soaked

70
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,159
What's going on?

71
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,559
It seems like your side is more popular.

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,639
Warm wine over low heat

73
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,799
You are really not interesting at all

74
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,319
I'm not doing this to make you look more carefully.

75
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,639
It'll help relieve your alcohol addiction

76
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,559
Looking at the plum blossoms can't quench my thirst

77
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,919
Have some

78
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,239
Not good for injuries

79
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,959
Don't drink either

80
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,039
Who doesn’t have any old or new injuries?

81
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,039
Too pretentious

82
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,599
There is wine today. I am drunk today.

83
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,999
Worry about tomorrow, worry about tomorrow

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,079
We are the kind of people

85
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,239
Tomorrow is a fluke

86
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,839
Someone to accompany you in pain and drunkenness

87
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,319
Accompany life and death

88
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,959
It’s the greatest luck among flukes

89
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,199
Before the wound hurts

90
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,879
Take a sip to ward off the cold

91
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,399
How about it

92
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,679
It’s just a little short of fun

93
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,919
Still the same

94
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,359
half per person

95
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,839
Walked together for so long

96
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,799
You are always a mystery

97
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,679
Lao Bai

98
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,639
You want to know my story

99
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,399
Just ask

100
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,039
I will tell you all

101
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,719
No need to force

102
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,399
Won't

103
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,879
Actually, I also want to tell Laozi

104
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,479
my past story

105
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,839
What is your connection with the Lu family?

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,279
Why do you know them so well?

107
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,359
besides

108
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,319
Between you and Lingui Pavilion

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,919
What's the grudge?

110
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,879
good question

111
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,159
Mom, I’m hungry

112
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,439
Come

113
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,599
Yu'er eat quickly

114
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,279
Don't be discovered

115
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,439
What about you?

116
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,959
Mom, if you’re not hungry, you eat first.

117
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,559
There are steamed buns

118
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,439
what are you doing

119
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,439
There are actually steamed buns here

120
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,719
Brothers, come and grab it

121
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,519
don't hurt my child

122
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,559
Walk

123
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,399
for you

124
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,679
Mom, are you okay?

125
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,399
Sorry Yu'er

126
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,239
It’s all useless as a mother

127
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,959
Yu'er, remember

128
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,839
You must hide it well on weekdays

129
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,879
Don't be discovered by people from Lu Mansion

130
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,799
Otherwise you will be in danger

131
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,999
Do you understand?

132
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,679
come over

133
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,119
did you see a woman

134
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,879
Brought a little boy

135
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,439
Looks like seven or eight years old

136
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,079
No no

137
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:15,999
Search for me

138
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,599
yes

139
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,759
newspaper

140
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,079
Mr. Lu

141
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,079
Have searched inside and outside

142
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,919
The mother and son were not found

143
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,119
Then keep looking

144
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,479
My Lu family spent a lot of money to buy the head.

145
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,199
You all give me some snacks

146
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,479
An ordinary mother and son

147
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,159
Why did the Lu family spend so much money?

148
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,799
Shut up

149
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,359
Are you teaching me how to do things?

150
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,679
The villain dare not

151
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,079
That kid is a bastard

152
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,239
Anyone who annoys our Lu family

153
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,279
must die

154
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:17,959
yes

155
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,119
stand up

156
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,599
You divide your troops into three groups

157
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,559
It's fifty miles around here

158
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,759
Even if it turns upside down

159
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,559
I also need to find the mother and son for me.

160
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,799
Did you hear that?

161
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,519
yes

162
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,119
Yu'er is not afraid of her mother's presence

163
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,279
Not afraid of rain

164
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,439
Yu'er

165
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,079
How about we live here from now on?

166
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,639
Yu'er eats

167
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,799
Mother

168
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,999
Why doesn't dad want us?

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,319
They even sent people to hunt us down.

170
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,959
rain

171
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,199
It's all my mother's fault

172
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,199
It's my mother

173
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,079
It's your mother who has caused you trouble

174
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,759
Sorry Yu'er

175
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,559
Yu'er

176
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,479
It's fine

177
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,159
It would be nice if I had a mother

178
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,479
Yu'er

179
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,199
Yu'er, study hard

180
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,519
I will serve the imperial court well in the future.

181
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,359
OK

182
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,399
I know mother

183
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,199
It turns out your childhood

184
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,919
So wandering and helpless

185
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,119
Sun Fan Zengqi

186
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,119
Ze

187
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,239
He Qi Qian Cong Ning Qikai

188
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,559
Huaining Army Sun Jian Xiao Yan Tao Bohao 1.

189
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:01,799
Taoning Junjiebo

190
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,319
Gao Lugou Xing Zhao Gao Feng Xiaoling Chen Shunwei

191
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,559
Lingchen Shunxiao
