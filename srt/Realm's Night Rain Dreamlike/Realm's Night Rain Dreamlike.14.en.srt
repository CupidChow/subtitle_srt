00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,439
Wenhu

2
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,519
Pharmacies are busy recently

3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,319
Ru Niang is busy at the drug store

4
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:02,879
bring it on

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,799
Try the craftsmanship of Chef Can

6
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,559
Come

7
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,199
Ronger eats a chicken leg

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:09,999
Come

9
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,279
Thanks

10
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,199
I never thought you were pretty good at making medicine jars.

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,599
Of course

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,479
I remember when we were outside the Great Wall

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,959
Come

14
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,879
eat vegetables eat vegetables

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,679
Come

16
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,119
Lai Ronger

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,799
Eat more

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,519
Thank you brother

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,519
Forget it, Jiang Shuai

20
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,759
bring it on

21
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,839
Eat vegetables

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,559
have a look

23
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,999
This is your wanted order

24
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,879
There's been a lot of noise recently

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,999
During this time

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,519
You have to stay out of the limelight

27
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,919
Congratulations

28
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,039
Lao Bai

29
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,239
Your current price per head

30
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,199
Keep pace with me

31
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,039
I don't have much time left

32
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,799
medicine jar

33
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,959
What I asked you to check

34
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,799
How's the check going?

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,199
The man behind Lingui Pavilion

36
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,079
Who is it?

37
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,919
Jiang Shuai

38
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,799
Ji Niang, she definitely doesn’t want to see you

39
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,519
Go to death for her

40
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,439
Otherwise, let’s forget it.

41
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,159
Uncle Jiang

42
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,159
Uncle Medicine Jar is right

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,839
Sister Ji Niang definitely doesn’t want anything to happen to you again

44
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,039
Ronger also doesn’t want you to

45
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,439
Revenge for me

46
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,519
Ronger just wants you to live well

47
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,959
Ronger is good

48
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,199
This matter is not just about Ji Niang

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,439
and your loved ones

50
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,959
And those

51
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,039
People who died in vain at the sword of Lingui Pavilion

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,999
That's right

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,959
No matter life or death

54
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,479
I will go with you

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,239
medicine jar

56
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,319
Did you find anything?

57
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,359
medicine jar

58
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,119
Do you want to see more people?

59
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,039
Are you implicated?

60
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,079
Say it quickly

61
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,959
It's the Lu family

62
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,559
Kyoto family

63
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,199
Family of relatives

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,159
power

65
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,679
National money and people's ointment

66
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,599
All in private

67
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,439
Storyteller

68
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,359
Walk around and listen

69
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,199
Dear guests

70
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,439
little old man

71
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,519
I see there are many unfamiliar faces today

72
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,199
I'm afraid he's a distinguished guest who just arrived in Kyoto.

73
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:16,799
yes

74
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,719
Where are we today?

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,559
Let’s not talk about this book review first.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,999
Let’s talk about the three big figures in Kyoto

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,919
Worry about ghosts

78
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,559
night cry

79
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,759
White temples

80
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,999
Everyone, listen up

81
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,919
You have to pay attention to these three people.

82
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,519
Let’s start by saying that this ghost is worried

83
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,519
He is Lu Cheng, the head of the Lu family

84
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,279
Rumors

85
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,319
This person is moody

86
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,839
Very domineering

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,799
Everyone in Kyoto saw him

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,399
They all treat him as their ancestor.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,199
That means the king of hell saw him

90
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,879
But I still have to worry

91
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,719
Hello

92
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,359
hello lord

93
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:09,919
Hello

94
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,519
Lord

95
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,839
This bird is the Taipusi Shaoqing who was just imprisoned.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,039
Sent by his wife

97
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,119
Also comes with a pastry

98
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,119
There are also hundreds of taels of silver placed underneath.

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,239
Said it was all their belongings

100
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,639
They probably want you to spare them

101
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,879
a bird

102
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,999
I want to buy a life for a few hundred taels of silver

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,079
cheaper

104
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,399
yes yes yes

105
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,799
I will reject them immediately

106
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,479
You dare to fool me with a dead bird

107
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,039
Audacious

108
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,719
It seems

109
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,519
These few hundred taels of silver

110
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,399
It's the funeral money for Taipusi Shaoqing.

111
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,439
Are there other people with such evil reputations?

112
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,279
There's more

113
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,039
Say it quickly, say it quickly

114
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,359
yes

115
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,599
Tell me quickly

116
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,719
Yes, is there any more?

117
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,959
We are eager to hear it

118
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,759
Let’s talk about the night without hoofs next.

119
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,479
He is the eldest son of Lu

120
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,919
Captain of Kyoto

121
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,599
This person has a reputation of being fierce

122
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,039
What are the rumors of cruelty and murderousness?

123
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,359
his name

124
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,399
Can you stop the crying children in the middle of the night?

125
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,439
Remembered

126
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,759
If you don't cry this night, you will be the captain of Kyoto.

127
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,079
Lu Zhan

128
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,039
Let’s finally talk about those white temples

129
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,639
He is Lu Qi, the second son of the Lu family

130
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,679
This person likes merchants and is good at strategy

131
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,559
But the methods are cruel

132
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,719
As long as anyone is targeted by him

133
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,879
This will make your temples all gray.

134
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,159
What a miserable end.

135
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,959
This person is too cruel

136
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,719
Too bad

137
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,199
yes

138
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,559
How could you do this to someone?

139
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,079
If you encounter these three living Yamas,

140
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,399
walk around

141
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,519
Stay away

142
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,359
yes yes yes

143
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,639
Then you have to hide, everyone

144
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,639
Is there anyone else in the Lu family?

145
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,599
The Lu family also has a third son.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,839
But this person never leaves home

147
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,999
No one has seen it

148
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,079
newspaper

149
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:56,959
master

150
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,159
There is an old storyteller in the square outside.

151
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,679
I'm arranging the arrangements for you and the young master.

152
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,519
It's so ugly to say

153
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,599
Asshole

154
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,599
Do we still need to report such things?

155
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,239
Bring someone to arrest immediately

156
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,319
Kill the market with sticks

157
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,599
to imitate

158
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,919
Brother, you are still impulsive.

159
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,199
How ugly is it that you were killed with a cane on the street?

160
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,759
Better to find a dark place

161
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,279
Without knowing it

162
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,399
Wouldn't it be better

163
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,159
The second brother is just thinking about these ghost deeds

164
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,639
How different is the style of the Lu family, the largest family in the capital?

165
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,199
Go and do as I say

166
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,799
yes

167
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,719
No need to bother

168
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,039
Master, please forgive me.

169
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,159
For these ants

170
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,559
Make a special trip

171
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,079
Wouldn’t it damage the face of our Lu family?

172
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,239
It just so happens that I came from Dongdu

173
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,719
I didn't bring anything with me

174
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,719
Take this as

175
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,879
It’s a meeting ceremony for our family reunion

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,839
what are you going to do

177
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,359
master

178
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,519
Father

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,599
Lu Qin is back

180
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,119
Uncle Jiang

181
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,479
Ronger, slow down

182
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,319
I want to go to Beijing

183
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,959
can't take you

184
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,519
what do you want to eat

185
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,039
I'll bring it back to you

186
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,519
For fun

187
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,119
Don't be afraid

188
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,479
i will be back

189
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,279
No matter what

190
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,239
I will come back

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,119
Mother said

192
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,559
Ronger will wait

193
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,839
Take her back to the house

194
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,079
Jiang Shuai

195
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,279
