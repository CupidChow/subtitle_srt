1
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,359
Wen

2
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,079
It turns out your childhood

3
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,839
So wandering and helpless

4
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,159
And you

5
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,599
Where are your family?

6
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,519
Don't know life or death

7
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,599
I have been an orphan for as long as I can remember.

8
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,399
Eating hundreds of meals

9
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,799
See all kinds of things in the world

10
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,479
It turns out you are an orphan too

11
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,639
Then you regret it

12
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,039
Do you want to take a walk in this world?

13
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,399
bad brother

14
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,199
Mistress

15
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,919
medicine jar

16
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,519
Now I still have you as my brother

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,559
Ronger

18
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,119
How can I regret it?

19
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,759
But I regret

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,119
I regret

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,879
Didn't learn to kill earlier

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,959
What happened later?

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,559
Later, my mother and I escaped that disaster

24
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,559
Spent six years peacefully

25
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,919
I thought I could live a peaceful life

26
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,039
But until I was twelve years old

27
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,959
Yu'er

28
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,839
quick

29
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,759
Come on, come on, come on!

30
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,999
wake up wake up wake up

31
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,599
Put on your shoes quickly

32
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,919
Let's get out of here right away

33
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,399
The rain is coming

34
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,359
put on clothes

35
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,479
Here comes the belt

36
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,479
What's wrong with mother?

37
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,959
Someone is hunting us

38
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,439
Hurry up

39
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,119
Walk

40
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,279
quick

41
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,999
Too late

42
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,959
Yu'er's side

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,999
Yu'er remember

44
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,679
Whatever happens later

45
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,959
Don't make any sound

46
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,599
Do you know

47
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,319
Go in

48
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,879
Mom, what about you?

49
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,519
Mom is fine

50
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,439
Mom, you don’t need to worry about it

51
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:07,999
Go in

52
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,639
daughter

53
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,359
Go in

54
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,799
daughter

55
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,999
You must take good care of yourself in the future

56
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,759
daughter

57
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,879
You stinky bitch can run pretty well.

58
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,039
Do you think you can escape from our grasp?

59
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,839
Don't come here

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,039
If you kill me

61
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,639
Mr. Lu will never let you go.

62
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,599
The secret flower that kills you

63
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,839
It was bought by Mr. Lu with money

64
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,839
How dare you mention Mr. Lu?

65
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,599
explain

66
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,399
Where is the boy?

67
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,479
It's impossible for you to find Yu'er

68
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,559
he has gone

69
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,119
You can't find it

70
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,399
Don't talk nonsense

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,119
Say or not

72
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,279
explain

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,479
Wu Heng’s torture is useless

74
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,279
The bed is still hot

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,159
Chase

76
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,239
Xuansi

77
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,199
Why do you teach me how to do things?

78
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,279
It's too late to catch up

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,639
before leaving

80
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,479
kill her

81
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:43,199
daughter

82
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,159
I will definitely take revenge for you

83
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,119
Hero

84
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,639
please

85
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,199
Let me go

86
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,479
Hero

87
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,639
I'm not a hero

88
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,079
Neither a monk nor a Taoist

89
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,159
ragged clothes and poisonous face

90
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,879
you you you

91
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,439
You are the legendary killer

92
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,839
Shen Ming Taoist

93
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,759
you know me

94
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,999
Then we are our own people

95
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,279
To one's own people

96
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,039
so

97
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,879
I'll pay fifty thousand taels of silver to buy my life

98
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,759
What do you think?

99
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,679
Fifty thousand taels

100
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,599
Then I'll get rich

101
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,759
No way

102
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,559
Someone gave me one hundred thousand taels

103
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,679
I want to buy you this

104
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,479
Ninety-seven people from three villages were killed by horse bandits.

105
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,519
What to do

106
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,359
Then I will kill you

107
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,399
I really can’t help but hit you

108
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,079
save me

109
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,039
I give you the money

110
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,719
baby

111
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,519
Face was smashed

112
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,679
You have to pay for it

113
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,959
I want to learn to kill

114
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,999
kill

115
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,679
Killing is fun and interesting

116
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,679
Killing is good

117
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,879
That

118
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,158
Walk

119
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,279
follow me

120
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,039
good

121
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,359
You want to be my apprentice

122
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,959
Nana

123
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,359
Then you have to abide by my rules.

124
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,999
starting from today

125
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,679
You are my substitute

126
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,879
I want to kill a hundred people for me

127
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,759
Only in exchange for your freedom

128
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,639
What a pity

129
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,239
All my disciples

130
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,799
Even this goal has not been achieved.

131
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,239
But you have to remember

132
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,679
If there is a breach of contract

133
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,039
You have to pay for it with your life.

134
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,879
I agree to any conditions

135
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,399
I want to learn to kill

136
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,079
kill

137
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,639
fun

138
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,999
Killing is fun Killing is fun

139
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,159
Then killing is the easiest thing

140
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,879
I am proficient in all kinds of hidden weapons

141
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,239
Dozens of martial arts

142
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,359
Everything can kill

143
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,319
select

144
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,559
interesting

145
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,359
Then I'll take your baby

146
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,879
luck to god

147
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,359
Hidden sword

148
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,439
accept the truth

149
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,039
Kill God to Death

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,799
This is my formula for using a sword

151
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,039
You have to remember it

152
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,519
master

153
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,399
It's time to fulfill your promise

154
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,799
These are the people you want to kill

155
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,639
start from the first

156
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,839
Take it

157
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,359
daughter

158
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,959
these people

159
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,479
I will send them to hell one by one with my own hands

160
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,519
You are actually Lu Cheng’s illegitimate child

161
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,519
right

162
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,519
He Qi Qian Cong Ning Qikai

163
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,439
Ze

164
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,719
great

165
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,639
Huai Boyu

166
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:37,919
Jun Jiebo

167
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,559
Xiaoyanglingchen Gu Wei

168
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:56,799
Zhao Gao Xiaoling Chenshun
