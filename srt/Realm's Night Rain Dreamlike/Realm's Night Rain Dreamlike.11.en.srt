1
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,319
Wenhu Yuli

2
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,879
Jianghu

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,959
you can't kill me

4
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,239
You want to kill me behind my back

5
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,359
The power behind me

6
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,519
I won't let you go

7
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,919
The forces behind

8
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,599
That's right

9
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,399
They are powerful

10
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,999
It's definitely not something you can afford to offend

11
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,079
if you let me go

12
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,239
I will definitely protect your life

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,919
let you go

14
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,279
How to be worthy of those who died

15
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,119
These limbs were all cut off for Ji Niang

16
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,319
This knife is not just for her

17
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,959
For those more

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,759
People who were ruthlessly harmed by Lingui Pavilion

19
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,999
Xuansi

20
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,839
Xuan, he will avenge me

21
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,639
Uncle Medicine Jar

22
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,159
It's almost dark

23
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,959
Uncle Jiang and Brother Yeyu

24
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,999
Why haven't they come back yet?

25
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,239
Don't cry

26
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,759
Why are you crying?

27
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,799
Sister Ru Niang, don’t cry

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,479
Jiang Daxia and the others are looking for me

29
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,119
After drawing the map

30
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,479
He left without returning

31
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,079
He must be going to Lingui Pavilion

32
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,679
Went to save Ji Niang

33
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,319
This dangerous time

34
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,319
If they have any shortcomings

35
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,319
How can I be worthy

36
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,599
Don't think so

37
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,039
Jiang Shuai's martial arts is the best in the world

38
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,639
Although there are poisonous insects in the body

39
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,759
That's extraordinary

40
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,519
What's more, Ye Yu

41
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,639
He is now the number one killer in the world

42
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,999
The two of them join forces

43
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,799
I will definitely bring Ji Niang back safely

44
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,359
we have to believe them

45
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,999
Ronger is good

46
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,279
Your Uncle Jiang and your brother Ye Yu

47
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,159
Will definitely come back

48
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,999
Jianghu

49
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,079
right

50
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,319
Kill this monster

51
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,959
Things that harm people

52
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,559
stop

53
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,199
silver

54
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,759
take the money

55
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,199
quick

56
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,679
roll

57
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,199
Quick, quick, quick

58
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,399
why not resist

59
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,519
Can't speak

60
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,239
I can

61
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,879
you need to know

62
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,399
in this world

63
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,039
Power is everything

64
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,879
strength

65
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,399
come with me

66
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,239
I'll find someone to take you to practice martial arts

67
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,279
Jiangnan specialty

68
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,199
your favorite sweets

69
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,879
you remember

70
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,679
Of course

71
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,039
Try it quickly

72
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,399
no one ever

73
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,999
like you to me

74
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,679
so good

75
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,039
you save me

76
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,239
teach me to speak

77
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,319
And encouraged me to practice martial arts

78
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,999
yes

79
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,159
who would have thought

80
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,599
You are really a martial arts wizard

81
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,999
Don't worry

82
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,399
we will always be together

83
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,319
Regardless of the ends of the earth

84
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,479
you will always be my brother

85
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,959
Do you dare to touch him?

86
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,079
I will cut you into pieces

87
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,279
never forgive

88
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,599
suffer death

89
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,799
Than the hatred in my heart

90
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,999
You can't beat me

91
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,079
Jianghu

92
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,839
let's go home

93
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,999
Uncle Medicine Jar

94
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,239
Uncle Jiang and Brother Yeyu

95
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,119
And sister Ji Niang

96
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,279
when will they come back

97
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,719
they will be back soon

98
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,959
What about Sister Ru Niang?

99
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,679
Your sister Ru Niang

100
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,799
I cried all night yesterday

101
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,799
I gave her a prescription to soothe the nerves.

102
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,919
She just fell asleep

103
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,239
Uncle Medicine Jar, look

104
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,519
they are back

105
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,359
Uncle Jiang

106
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,599
Brother Ye Yu

107
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,199
Sister Ji Niang

108
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,079
Juan Huifanhan

109
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:44,999
Yu Junsun Zeng Miaoqi

110
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,479
Miao Qi

111
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,879
Ze Qikai

112
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,999
Weize

113
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,279
Li Xuejiao
