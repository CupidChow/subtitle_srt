2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,079
My name is Jianghu

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,039
Was a bad guy

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,719
After several changes

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,519
Wandering in the world

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,479
When I almost starved to death

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,559
Wen Huyu

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,399
Give me a blood bun

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,719
I promised him to help him return his letters home

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,799
So return to my hometown

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,239
stop

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,999
This is Yichun Tower

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,439
This is not some ronin inn.

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,759
Optimistic

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,639
I have wine worth thousands of dollars here

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,839
Yichunlou will definitely accept it

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,719
Wine that has only been brewed for five years

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,959
What good wine could it be?

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,279
Jianghu

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,239
You are the only one with the face to sell it to me.

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,159
Since you have put the wine in front of the cabinet

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,159
Maybe some customer who is not discerning

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,399
I'm really willing to spend a lot of money on it.

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,439
You

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,959
Haven't seen each other for five years

26
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,439
This meeting

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,679
Why do you want to meddle in other people's business?

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,199
A meal is also a favor

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,639
If you are a favor, you must repay it

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,799
I have to thank you

31
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,479
Help me find out Xu Kui's home address

32
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,519
It’s just that the current situation is turbulent

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,959
The Xu family mother and daughter you are looking for

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,639
I'm afraid I'm no longer alive

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,599
The wine in your fish basket

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,079
Someone really fell in love with it

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,399
If this wine doesn’t have a name

38
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,719
Just call it longevity

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,639
Young Master

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,239
Why give me a handful of gold leaves for such a terrible wine?

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,279
Pig City

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,759
You are a wild boar and cannot eat fine chaff.

43
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,079
This is medicinal wine

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,359
This is a healing wine

45
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,039
You think it tastes bad

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,319
It's because the wine has a taste of longevity grass added to it

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,759
Also known as the independent medicinal herb

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,319
This is not something you can buy in ordinary pharmacies.

49
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,439
It must have been collected painstakingly by the brewer.

50
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,439
Just to cure his hidden illness

51
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,679
This taste of living alone outside the world

52
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,799
In addition to dispelling wind and dehumidifying

53
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,999
Some people also use it to clear the kidney meridian

54
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,079
Presumably this brewer

55
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,839
He must be in his seventies or eighties

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,439
Can't walk, can't move my legs

57
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,919
The old pervert who wants to sleep with a girl again

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,719
I didn’t expect this wine to have such effects.

59
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,679
Jianghu

60
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,439
you are still alive

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,119
Young Master

62
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,199
Maybe what the brewers really want

63
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,159
by combining different drugs

64
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,719
Resolve pain in the body

65
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,879
Could it be that the young master knows the brewer?

66
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,319
It sounds like you are an old acquaintance

67
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,239
How could it be

68
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,799
Do what we do

69
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,119
Everyone is dead

70
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,839
Soon your old friend will die too

71
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,399
The coffin ghost that the villain and the young master are looking for

72
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,959
We did have some friendship

73
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,719
But after he entered Lingui Pavilion,

74
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,879
We have no contact anymore

75
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,039
He is even more unpredictable

76
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,599
But I have found out his recent movements.

77
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,799
He is going to find a man named Xu Kui

78
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,959
Just tonight

79
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,159
Same reason

80
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,399
The coffin ghost's old friend

81
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,719
He should also be a dead person

82
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:42,719
Mother

83
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,239
who

84
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,599
Who is here to die?

85
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,079
Give your name

86
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,919
It doesn't matter who I am

87
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,839
Let me ask you

88
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,439
The person in the coffin is Xu Kui’s daughter

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,399
Do you know Xu Kui?

90
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,119
Not acquaintance

91
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,999
Then do you know where he is?

92
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,199
Since his wife and daughter

93
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,639
Refusing to disclose his whereabouts

94
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,999
Then it's up to you to tell me

95
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,999
Where is this traitor from Lingui Pavilion hiding?

96
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,439
how

97
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,159
There is no one alive under the coffin ghost knife

98
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,359
Lingui carries the coffin to scatter the souls of the dead

99
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,319
So can only

100
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,599
It's time to seal the knife

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,159
Seal your knife

102
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,759
nice stick

103
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,519
pity

104
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,639
Fall into the hands of a person without inner strength

105
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,039
Wait until I kill you

106
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,959
Let it change hands

107
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,799
Talk too much

108
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,319
This person is mine

109
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,319
who are you

110
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,439
Most people in the world hear my name

111
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,439
But few people see me

112
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,119
Just because you have seen me and know me

113
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,239
and people who are still alive

114
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,239
Very few

115
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,999
I am the only disciple of Taoist Shenming

116
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,879
night rain

117
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,719
Ranked No. 1 on the Dark Flower List

118
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,359
The one whose head is worth three thousand taels

119
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,319
A bit knowledgeable

120
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,239
You are also here to kill Xu Kui

121
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,679
No

122
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,519
I'm here to kill you

123
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,319
You steal my head from me

124
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,319
Those who do no evil

125
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,359
Kill it, kill it

126
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,039
The person I want to kill

127
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,879
Must be left to me to kill

128
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,799
The person who stole my head

129
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,599
Everyone must pay with their lives

130
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,399
Your grudges have nothing to do with me

131
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,239
I only know

132
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,479
He deserves to die

133
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,759
But you kill the person I want to kill

134
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,599
How to repay this debt?

135
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,559
No need to fear life or death

136
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,359
Have the ability

137
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,719
Come and get it

138
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:30,839
