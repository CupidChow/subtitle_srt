1
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,279
Tiger

2
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,519
constant

3
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,439
Come out and ask for news

4
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,199
Of course you have to drink and eat

5
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,959
The last one of your store’s signature drinks and dishes

6
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,039
OK

7
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,799
Inquire about information

8
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,279
Look kinder

9
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,799
You look so cold

10
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,079
What can I ask?

11
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,559
You can still ask

12
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,879
Two guest officers

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,079
Your food and drinks are here

14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,399
Two guest officers

15
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,279
Are you satisfied with these?

16
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,239
Your business is not very good

17
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,799
We didn't do this here before

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,559
It all happened to Yichun Tower earlier.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,079
Affect our store

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,639
There's no one on the street anymore

21
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,679
It’s been a few days

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,559
Someone else is making trouble

23
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,599
I can't say

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,839
It's taboo to say this

25
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,839
etc.

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,479
We are just businessmen passing by

27
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,719
New here

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,559
I was afraid of violating taboos so I asked a few more questions.

29
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,799
Tell me everything you know

30
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,559
The gold is yours

31
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,959
good

32
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,599
This is Yichun Tower

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,039
Provoked Lingui Pavilion

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,959
heard

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,079
All the girls inside were arrested

36
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,759
Thank you, guest

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,479
This thing is making a big fuss

38
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,959
I'm afraid Xuan Shi from Lingui Pavilion is about to take action.

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,879
Xuansi

40
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,199
Didn't I mention it to you before?

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,759
Xuan is the strongest martial artist in Lingui Pavilion

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,359
Proficient in Japanese secret arts

43
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,279
Good at catching absconding people

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,439
Once caught by him

45
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,879
Not long to die

46
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,559
I've been hunting them for so many years

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,839
I'm the only one who knows these things

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,359
Then you still don’t know where Lingui Pavilion is?

49
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,559
You're really bad at words

50
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,119
It suits my taste

51
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,839
etc.

52
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,519
Why did you leave?

53
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,159
I haven’t eaten this meal yet

54
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,199
I haven’t drunk the wine yet

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,599
Walking in such a hurry

56
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,719
You really think my money was blown by the wind

57
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,279
How to calculate this account?

58
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,159
I didn't move my chopsticks

59
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,599
Just sit down

60
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,959
OK

61
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,879
I still

62
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,239
Remember you owe me a meal

63
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,359
Mistress

64
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,399
What a beauty

65
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,479
Who are you

66
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,039
I don't know you

67
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,159
I sent someone specifically to check you out

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,759
It is rumored

69
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,079
Your relationship with the world

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,119
Not ordinary

71
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,559
But is it a relationship between lovers?

72
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,239
He is heartless and unjust

73
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,599
You can't even think of threatening him with me

74
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,679
There is no weakness in Jianghu

75
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,479
Is it a weakness?

76
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:17,039
You have to try it to know

77
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,759
For a heartless man

78
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,719
Put yourself in

79
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,279
Is it worth it?

80
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,079
you also know

81
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,119
He is a ruthless man

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,039
How could he show up for a woman like me?

83
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,959
You really are

84
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,959
I won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin

85
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,279
What a pity

86
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,839
I don’t even want to say that.

87
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,519
So what if you don’t say it

88
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,359
worst outcome

89
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,199
But you killed me

90
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,159
Stop it

91
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,399
before killing you

92
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,759
There's still a lot to do

93
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,799
This woman is not to my liking

94
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,439
Rewarded to you

95
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,279
don't want

96
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,359
And this is a good thing

97
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,959
don't want

98
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,559
It smells so good

99
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,959
let me go

100
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,959
Call

101
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,799
don't want

102
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,799
Come on

103
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,439
The more you call me, the more excited I become

104
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,479
don't want

105
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,559
stop

106
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,439
where to run

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,839
Stop for me

108
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,759
save me

109
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,759
Please stop, please

110
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,479
save me

111
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,879
you bitch

112
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,239
Where are you going?

113
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,519
Offended bad guy

114
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,559
sin sin

115
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,079
This is a new chick just released from prison.

116
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,079
Don't understand the rules

117
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,959
blocking your way

118
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,759
You sir don't remember the faults of villains

119
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,639
Don't make trouble here

120
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,999
Understand, understand

121
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,919
I'll take her away right now

122
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,439
come over

123
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,319
save me

124
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,359
Walk

125
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,239
save me

126
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,919
etc.

127
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,239
redeem her

128
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,439
How much money is needed

129
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,759
Place this lantern here again

130
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,639
It's a little crooked

131
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,559
How about this

132
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,399
Can

133
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,599
Ji Niang, what do you think?

134
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,079
I think it should be a little further over there.

135
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,119
What do you think?

136
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,039
Then move it a little bit

137
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,559
Yes, yes, a little further over there

138
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,799
A little further

139
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,799
What are you

140
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,959
I use the money you gave me

141
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,399
Plus the savings my dad hid back then

142
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,879
I bought this restaurant

143
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,559
Didn't you say

144
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,158
let me live first

145
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,119
Find your own way to survive

146
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,439
this is my choice

147
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,919
I want to stay in Dongdu

148
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,719
no matter what method

149
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,559
Why do you want to stay in Dongdu?

150
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,959
because

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,199
You are here

152
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,839
I hope you don’t have to worry about me for the rest of your life

153
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,999
Remove the burden from your heart

154
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,479
live wantonly

155
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,119
Are you looking for me?

156
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,919
Where is Ji Niang?

157
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,879
Cut with one sword

158
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,279
This martial arts is so strong

159
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,359
master

160
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,559
Long time no see

161
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,119
Nan Tian, ​​he is right

162
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,279
this world

163
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,679
Power is everything

164
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,479
your power

165
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,519
I really like it

166
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,799
Didn't say that

167
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,479
You and I join hands

168
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,639
Yulu Dongpu Yuwei

169
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,039
Weiyu Yuhao Dongpu

170
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,279
Zhan Hao Jianbo

171
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,479
see small

172
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:05,839
Lingchen Shunwei Xiaowenjie

173
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,319
Qiao Xuejiao Gao Xiaojiao Yaozhen
