1
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,399
Wen

2
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,879
What kind of show is this going on?

3
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,119
Look

4
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,359
Your only son is here

5
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,719
my son

6
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,039
yes

7
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,919
he is the one

8
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,119
I have been hunted by you for many years

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,959
The missing son at the end

10
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,679
Lu Yeyu

11
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,199
how

12
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,439
Are you here to kill him too?

13
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,359
yes

14
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,039
This old man's life

15
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,359
I want to make a decision

16
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,319
The person I want to kill

17
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,759
Must be left to me to kill

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,119
Anyone who steals my head must pay with his life

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,079
Such a deep hatred

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,879
That's right

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,039
This old man was

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,599
But I will drive you mother and son to death.

23
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,999
Lu Yeyu

24
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:07,999
No

25
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,719
Yu'er

26
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,079
you don't understand

27
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,359
I married into the Lu family

28
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,079
It feels uncomfortable to be controlled by others

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,439
If I didn't kill you back then

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,439
they are going to kill me

31
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,599
child

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,999
After all, we are father and son

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,119
so many years

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,799
I've always felt guilty

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,919
I feel guilty

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,599
Why can't I be nicer to you?

37
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,919
Now

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,479
This is my last chance

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,359
Yu'er

40
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,839
save me

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,679
Yu'er save me

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,479
We, father and son, revived the Lu family

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,959
Turns out the one who looks most like me

44
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,959
it's you

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,599
Didn't I just say that?

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,079
Anyone who steals my head must pay with his life

47
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,879
That depends on you too

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,559
Do you have this ability?

49
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,719
night rain

50
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,039
Lao Bai

51
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,599
how are you

52
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,879
She can't do anything to me

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,719
It's you

54
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,799
Why did you cause these injuries?

55
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,479
Worried about your situation

56
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,079
Killing in a hurry

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,919
Jianghu

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,719
we meet again

59
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,759
Jianghu

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,239
I am the one who reunites with you

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,799
why don't you look at me

62
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,079
Who are you

63
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:31,799
I

64
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,399
She is Lu Cheng’s youngest daughter

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,959
Lu Qin

66
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,719
I'm asking him

67
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,639
Why do you need to talk so much?

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,919
court death

69
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,359
night rain

70
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,959
You can't use your inner strength anymore

71
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,479
I'm fine

72
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,239
I will fight quickly

73
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,239
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

74
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,959
There is a shadow of Xuan in your moves

75
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,279
What is your relationship with him?

76
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,519
You finally discovered that I'm different

77
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,519
Not just Xuanshi

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,319
The secret tricks of all the masters in Lingui Pavilion

79
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,599
I will not only

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,839
And use it better than them

81
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,679
It's a pity

82
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,519
Gotta let them die

83
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,079
Under your blade

84
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,199
So you are

85
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,279
You are the master of Lingui Pavilion

86
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,679
Accounting for the tiger

87
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,279
To be killed

88
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,119
Jianghu

89
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,359
How could you forget

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,759
then

91
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,399
You are the one who stands up for me

92
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,039
me back then

93
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,839
I hate blood as much as you do

94
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,519
you really

95
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,839
Have you forgotten?

96
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,159
The dignified eldest lady of the Lu family

97
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,719
What's wrong

98
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,159
Afraid of blood

99
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,719
I see

100
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,479
your mean mother

101
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,759
How he looked when he died

102
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,919
Remember?

103
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,159
She also fell into a pool of blood like this

104
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,119
skin torn

105
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,239
I'm afraid

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,559
don't want

107
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,799
you two

108
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,919
Push her in for me

109
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,359
yes

110
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,719
Press until breath stops

111
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,239
I don’t want second brother

112
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,399
The Lu family doesn’t need waste

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,399
We don’t need any useless young lady.

114
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,319
Dad won't care about you

115
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,079
Jianghu

116
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,879
a running dog

117
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,959
Why are you meddling in my young master’s business?

118
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,599
idle time boring

119
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,679
good

120
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,879
Then I'll take a closer look

121
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,319
Let's see how long you can take care of this business.

122
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:02,999
Walk

123
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,239
It's okay

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,479
Let's go

125
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,839
why help me

126
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,439
you hate blood

127
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,639
Me too

128
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,639
Jianghu

129
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,479
It was you who took the initiative to break into my dark life

130
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,359
It was you who tore my fear into pieces with your own hands

131
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,399
I thought I finally met

132
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,319
Someone who can stand up for me.

133
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,679
But why

134
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,279
When I call Tiantian no answer

135
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,999
You left me again

136
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,759
People in the mansion said he was back

137
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,599
I must talk to him this time

138
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,599
Jianghu

139
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,679
What are you going to do?

140
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,959
No

141
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,559
Still thinking about your bad handsomeness

142
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,879
I really thought he had a way to take you away from here.

143
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,719
My father did it because of the family’s reputation.

144
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,359
That’s why I left you, a bastard, here.

145
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,319
You mother and daughter should be grateful

146
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,839
But shameless

147
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,479
Jianghu

148
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,439
One hundred taels of silver per person

149
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,319
Just don't kill her to death

150
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,879
Don't don't

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,759
bring it on

152
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,039
You go away

153
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,039
don't want

154
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,799
taste you

155
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,799
Help

156
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,159
don't do this to me

157
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,199
Jianghu

158
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,039
Call

159
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,719
let me go

160
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,559
Jianghu

161
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,639
I beg you

162
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,319
Take me away

163
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,519
I beg you

164
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,119
Can you take me away?

165
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,679
I am a dying person

166
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,359
We have different paths

167
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,999
Mistress

168
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,359
I'll pick you up in Jianghu

169
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:44,959
River

170
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,719
Let's go back

171
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,839
But you

172
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,959
Would rather choose a woman with fireworks

173
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,319
He won't take me away either

174
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,279
to see you

175
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,079
I changed out of my bloody dress

176
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,359
Use the dirt on the ground to cover the bruises on your face

177
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,319
I tried my best

178
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,199
Don't let you see the pain of being insulted

179
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,279
just want you

180
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,439
Take me away from this cannibalistic place

181
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,439
If you can't protect me for life

182
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,279
Why did you bother me back then?

183
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,799
If you hadn't stood up for me

184
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,479
Lu Qi, how could he want to take revenge on you?

185
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,599
And looking for someone to ruin my innocence

186
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,879
Jianghu

187
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,479
You have the most powerful knife in the world

188
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,039
But you don’t even have a person around you

189
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,439
You can't even protect me

190
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,399
Shut up

191
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,479
These are not excuses for you to do all kinds of evil

192
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,359
I didn't know what happened to you back then

193
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,759
But this cannot be

194
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,879
Your reason for killing innocent people

195
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,279
Human nature is evil

196
