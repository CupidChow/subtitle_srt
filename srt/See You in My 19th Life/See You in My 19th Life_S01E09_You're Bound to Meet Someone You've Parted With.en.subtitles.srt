1
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,970
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

2
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,683
MY 6TH LIFE

3
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:03,396
There was a time when I lived
in a serene and beautiful place.

4
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,780
"Would I ever meet others
who can remember their past lives?"

5
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:12,739
Rather…

6
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:17,702
"Would I ever meet anyone
who would believe me?"

7
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,207
I often thought
as I stared into the night sky.

8
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,287
How do you

9
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,498
know that piece?

10
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,753
Because I'm the one…

11
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,339
who composed it.

12
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,219
Play it when you miss someone.

13
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,139
You'll feel much better.

14
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,058
Ju-won said that, right?

15
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,395
How do you know that?

16
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,650
Because I was Yoon Ju-won.

17
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,577
I know it's hard to believe.

18
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,746
But that's just the truth.

19
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,419
I get that you want to comfort me.

20
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,632
But I'll pretend you never said that.

21
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,509
So please leave.

22
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,511
Director Mun.

23
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,848
What I'm trying to say

24
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,641
has to do with a miracle.

25
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,355
The miracle that
the Yoon Ju-won of the past

26
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,857
still exists

27
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,068
and will exist in the future as well.

28
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,578
Do you remember
The Moon and the West Witch's Forest?

29
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,756
It was 12-year-old Ju-won's favorite book.

30
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,011
What are you reading?

31
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,181
The Moon and the West Witch's Forest.

32
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,684
What's it about?

33
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:51,356
It's a story about an immortal witch
who finds true love.

34
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,233
Why is she immortal?

35
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,734
She doesn't know either.

36
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,819
And that pains her.

37
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,446
Why would that be painful?

38
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,490
Wouldn't being immortal be great?

39
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,037
Not necessarily.

40
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,917
It wasn't that the witch was immortal.

41
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,543
She just

42
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,047
remembered her past lives
whenever she was born again.

43
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,006
Past lives?

44
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,093
What are you talking about?

45
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,095
You'll know soon enough.

46
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,058
The key to the jewelry box
that Ju-won gave Seo-ha for his birthday

47
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,060
is in that book.

48
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,442
When you find the key and open the box,

49
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,404
read this note.

50
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,787
Don't get the order wrong.

51
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,039
Open the jewelry box first,

52
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,708
then read the note last.

53
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,294
Okay?

54
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,276
I'll be waiting, Seo-ha.

55
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,721
How do I open this?

56
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,222
I hid the key.

57
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,308
At the amusement park?

58
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,518
I didn't put in that much work.

59
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,606
I'll tell you where it is
if you're a good boy today.

60
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,941
You always do this.

61
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,075
Don't get the order wrong.

62
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,328
Open the jewelry box first,

63
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,954
then read the note last.

64
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,157
Knock, knock.

65
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,035
Oh, you got here quick.

66
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,078
You're not done yet?

67
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,538
No, I'm done.

68
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,206
Let's sit here.

69
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,333
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

70
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,004
So what's the matter?

71
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,884
I revealed to Seo-ha

72
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,302
that I was Ju-won.

73
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,346
Really?

74
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,223
Did he believe you?

75
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,768
He'll need some time.

76
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,355
What if he never believes you?

77
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,236
Then perhaps he might leave me.

78
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,240
I hope he comes around to the truth.

79
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,118
But I'm prepared for the worst.

80
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,536
But why all of a sudden?

81
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,996
Didn't you want to hide it?

82
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,540
I have something I want to say to Seo-ha.

83
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,001
Not as Ban Ji-eum

84
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,627
but as Yoon Ju-won.

85
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,132
Well, I'm glad you came back.

86
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,429
But how does it feel
to remember your past lives?

87
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,020
Across my many lives,

88
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,398
I've experienced many things
and met a lot of people.

89
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,861
Mom! It's me, Hae-wol!

90
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,029
Mom!

91
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,618
I've lost a lot of people as well.

92
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,954
Seo-ha.

93
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,873
For me,

94
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,251
every day is a birthday
or a death anniversary

95
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,629
of someone I loved in the past.

96
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,383
I can see that.

97
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,845
It must've been tough for you.

98
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,061
You get numb to it
when it happens often enough.

99
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,313
At some point,

100
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,357
I stopped hoping for things.

101
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,611
I would think,
"This life will pass as well."

102
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,281
"I guess I died and was born again."

103
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,408
That's how I'd feel.

104
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,211
One thing saddened me though.

105
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,590
It was that I had no one to share

106
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,510
my good or bad memories with.

107
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,097
Everyone either died or disappeared,

108
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,432
and no one recognized me.

109
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,814
But today,

110
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,400
I feel better because of you.

111
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,531
You crybaby.

112
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,700
No, I'm not.

113
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:09,377
YOU'RE BOUND TO MEET
SOMEONE YOU'VE PARTED WITH

114
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,425
It wasn't that the witch was immortal.

115
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,510
She just

116
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,389
remembered her past lives
whenever she was born again.

117
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,393
This isn't my first go at life.

118
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,732
Because I was Yoon Ju-won.

119
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:32,650
Ms. Ban.

120
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,528
Seo-ha.

121
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:45,830
I'm sorry.

122
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,290
Seo-ha.

123
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,877
Are any of your debtors truck drivers?

124
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,172
Seo-ha.

125
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,424
Ju-won.

126
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,724
What did she say?

127
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,334
Someone died

128
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,462
and Director Mun was present at the scene.

129
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,007
A slight misstep here,

130
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,385
and news of that accident will come out.

131
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,387
That's enough of this from you.

132
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,973
Seo-ha's been asking around everywhere,

133
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,393
leaving Director Lee quite anxious.

134
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,770
He might be overtaken with guilt

135
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,898
and confess to Seo-ha that it was him.

136
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,068
This is a crisis for you, Chairman Mun.

137
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,737
Which makes it an opportunity for me.

138
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,574
As always,

139
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,660
I'll take care of it.

140
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,836
You and I…

141
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,925
see eye to eye on these matters.

142
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,070
My goodness.

143
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,907
Why is that here?

144
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,746
Are you serious, Mr. Kang?

145
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,081
You left something in my room.

146
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,749
Oh, that.

147
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,085
"Oh, that"?

148
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,255
I almost had a heart attack because of it.

149
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,133
Did you touch it?

150
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,267
I almost did.

151
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,109
You were so desperate to touch it before.

152
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,239
Aren't you curious

153
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,700
about your first life?

154
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,910
Well…

155
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,244
I was curious.

156
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,204
Not so much now.

157
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,126
What's the matter?

158
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,420
Is something more pressing?

159
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,422
No, there's something more precious.

160
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,965
I'm going to focus on that.

161
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,762
My first life
means nothing to me right now.

162
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,681
It's not important at all.

163
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,729
I see.

164
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,523
Then Mr. Kang Min-gi,

165
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,317
good night.

166
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,284
So it means nothing.

167
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,709
Do you know what past lives are?

168
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,627
This isn't my first go at life.

169
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,964
"The Moon and the West Witch's Forest."

170
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,300
"The Moon…"

171
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,012
My childhood books

172
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,182
were probably moved up there.

173
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,356
THE MOON AND THE WEST WITCH'S FOREST

174
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,899
There it is.

175
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,632
There really is a key.

176
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:04,601
The key to the jewelry box
that Ju-won gave Seo-ha for his birthday

177
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,936
is in that book.

178
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,026
Welcome, sir.

179
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,820
The chairman is waiting for you.

180
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,613
Thank you. Is he on the second floor?

181
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,448
Yes, this way.

182
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,075
It's okay. I'll be fine on my own.

183
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,085
Seo-ha.

184
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,474
What brings you back home?

185
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,060
Did your father call for you?

186
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,395
No.

187
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,814
I had to check on something.

188
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,401
You didn't answer my call yesterday.

189
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,361
So I assumed you were busy.

190
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,738
You punk.

191
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,990
Did you meet your father?

192
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,368
Why don't we all have a meal together?

193
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,662
I have to go to work.

194
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:08,957
I see.

195
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,002
Your face doesn't look so good.

196
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,004
You're not sick, are you?

197
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,091
Let me know right away

198
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,509
when you're not feeling well.

199
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,471
I've cared for your mother for so long

200
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,515
that I'm basically a doctor.

201
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,492
Why are you just standing there?

202
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,453
Well, I saw that Seo-ha was here.

203
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,705
So I was about to
invite him to eat with us.

204
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,506
Do you guys have anything
you need to tell me?

205
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,226
Is this about the company?

206
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,188
I don't think so.

207
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,775
-Then leave.
-Father.

208
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,528
-Seo-ha.
-Stay out of this.

209
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,769
We need to talk.

210
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,734
Ms. Ban.

211
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,572
Ms. Yoon.

212
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,326
You've prepared so much.

213
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,411
Were you up all night doing this?

214
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,121
Can you tell?

215
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,623
Just a bit.

216
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,834
Where's Seo-ha?

217
00:22:59,127 --> 00:22:59,961
He's not here yet.

218
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,422
He didn't even come to work today.

219
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,342
It'll take him some time to accept it.

220
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,262
Are you nervous?

221
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,140
Can you tell?

222
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,266
Just a bit.

223
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,376
Hey, Do-jin.

224
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,003
-Do-jin!
-What?

225
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,008
-Did they all leave without you?
-I don't know.

226
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,011
Get up.

227
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,307
Oh, come on.

228
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,476
Hurry and get up.

229
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,646
Stand up straight.

230
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,817
My legs won't cooperate.
They're moving on their own.

231
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,111
Why do you have to be so big?

232
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,363
Get it together.

233
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,413
Get it together, Do-jin.

234
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,004
When did you become so small?

235
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,798
When I worked my butt off
taking care of you.

236
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,264
Do-yun.

237
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,641
I want ice cream!

238
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,768
-Hey.
-Buy me ice cream!

239
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,812
-Be quiet.
-Buy me some.

240
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,105
I will if you quiet down.

241
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,192
-Come on, buy me some.
-Hey.

242
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,027
-Buy me ice cream!
-Let go.

243
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,029
-Come on.
-You're dead if you don't let go.

244
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,615
-I want some.
-Hey.

245
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,451
-Buy me some!
-Why you…

246
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,952
-Stop it. Hey.
-I want some.

247
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,996
-Buy me some!
-I'm warning you.

248
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,748
-Please buy me ice cream.
-You…

249
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,124
-Let go first.
-Come on!

250
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,459
Let go of him!

251
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,835
Hey you!

252
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,295
Let go of him!

253
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,963
I said let go!

254
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,174
Hold on for a minute.

255
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,343
Are you okay?

256
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,636
Who is this guy?

257
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,640
-He's my brother.
-What?

258
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,517
Oh, my. Your brother?

259
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,353
Oh, my goodness.

260
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,520
I'm so sorry.

261
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,814
That must have hurt.
I thought he was a drunkard.

262
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:25,815
It's all right.

263
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,568
I would have hit him anyway.

264
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,542
Who are you anyway?

265
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,921
I work with Mr. Ha at--

266
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:48,964
Hey, get up.

267
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,049
I don't want to!

268
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,842
Give me a piggyback ride then!

269
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,140
You two are nothing alike.

270
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,311
I guess you have similar eyes.

271
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,653
What if he really was a drunkard?

272
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,738
Why would you do that for me?

273
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,782
I just can't help myself.

274
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,201
You're blinded by love.

275
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,119
I know.

276
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,791
I guess you didn't drink a lot
at that work dinner you mentioned earlier.

277
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,293
I held back today.

278
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,754
Did you just worry about me?

279
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,138
Ms. Yoon.

280
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,599
We have to stop talking about that.

281
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,770
-But Mr. Ha…
-As I've told you before,

282
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:50,483
I have absolutely no intention
of being in a relationship with you.

283
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,444
But you like me, don't you?

284
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,362
Not everyone who likes each other dates.

285
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,907
But I will apologize.

286
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,161
I acted in a way that confused you

287
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,787
and kept your hopes up.

288
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,831
I sincerely apologize.

289
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,666
I know what you're worried about.

290
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,543
I really do.

291
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,003
But we can overcome it.

292
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,761
Do you know who people gossip about more
whenever I'm with Seo-ha?

293
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,013
Me.

294
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,808
They gossip about
how much they have compared to me

295
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,019
and drag me down like I'm nothing.

296
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,146
I'm used to it.

297
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,900
But that doesn't mean I'm fine with it.

298
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,985
I endure it because I chose this.

299
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,281
You said we could overcome it.

300
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,910
I know you're an independent
and open-minded person.

301
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,662
But I don't want to do that.

302
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,376
I don't have the leisure
to even think about that.

303
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,848
This is why I didn't want to tell you.

304
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,893
I was afraid

305
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,771
we would both be hurt.

306
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,526
So…

307
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,653
let's stop doing this.

308
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,948
Please.

309
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:56,312
Do you want to go to the amusement park
with me on your birthday?

310
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,359
I brought Mom too.

311
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,990
Let's have fun together, the three of us.

312
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:07,907
Okay.

313
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,410
What do you want to ride first?

314
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,745
The merry-go-round.

315
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,663
What about you?

316
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,084
The haunted house?

317
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,750
Sorry.

318
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,078
I should call it a day.

319
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,872
Good night, Seo-ha.

320
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,096
Seo-ha.

321
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,141
Seo-ha.

322
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,355
Seo-ha.

323
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,763
Seo-ha.

324
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,514
You called me a witch.

325
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,809
Well, this is a story about a witch…

326
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,687
No, a story about a person.

327
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,273
Did Ju-won write this?

328
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:34,739
There is a person who vividly remembers
all their past lives.

329
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,618
Their first memory was of sounds.

330
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,037
The sound of the waves,

331
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,830
the sound of the wind,

332
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,582
and the sound of bells.

333
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,044
Their second memory was of their mother.

334
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,797
Her fragrant smell,

335
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,256
her soft touch,

336
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,218
and her warm embrace.

337
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,679
The person was born again

338
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,099
and went back to their mother
from their memory,

339
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,851
but no one understood them.

340
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,979
They realized then.

341
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,651
That they would never be welcome anywhere.

342
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,909
In one life, they were a dancer
and wrote songs.

343
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,666
In one life, they lost a lover.

344
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,502
In another, they lost a child.

345
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,092
They remembered everything
but had no one to confide in.

346
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,302
Several lives passed that way.

347
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:45,017
Countless people from past relationships
were afraid of the person.

348
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,271
And that person was tired of being hurt.

349
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,067
Every time the next life came,

350
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,111
then the next,

351
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,992
it felt like more and more rocks
weighed her heart down.

352
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,166
"Next life"?

353
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,128
Seo-ha.

354
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,130
Ju-won.

355
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,757
-In my next life.
-"In my next life."

356
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,178
I want to remember you

357
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,097
in my next life.

358
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,475
I'll…

359
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,313
come back to see you.

360
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,287
The protagonist of this book
is Yoon Ju-won,

361
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,372
now known as Ban Ji-eum.

362
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,708
Yoon Ju-won?

363
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,961
Ban Ji-eum?

364
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,756
If you believe what you've read,

365
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:00,176
come to the place we couldn't go
on the day I gave you the jewelry box.

366
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,970
I'll be waiting for you there.

367
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,507
DIRECTOR MUN SEO-HA

368
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,969
Come check for yourself, Seo-ha.

369
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,474
The number you have dialed--

370
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,778
Wasn't she here yesterday too?

371
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,988
She was.

372
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,489
Is she waiting for someone?

373
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,204
When their 18th life began,

374
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,872
the person met a kid.

375
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,874
It was strange.

376
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,045
When they were with him,

377
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,799
it felt as if the rocks weighing
on their heart were lifted.

378
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,553
There was nothing special about him.

379
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,180
So how did he lighten their heart so much?

380
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,058
Help!

381
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:39,692
The person forgot
their past lives for a moment

382
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,445
and enjoyed life like a 12-year-old.

383
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,783
Would that person
who remembers their 18 lives

384
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,037
be able to enjoy life
together with the kid?

385
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,999
Do you like me?

386
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,173
I'll answer that on your birthday.

387
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:29,885
You see,

388
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,555
being confessed to on one's birthday
is a memorable event.

389
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,140
I like you.

390
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,892
I'll be by your side

391
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,894
whenever you need help.

392
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,190
Everything's all right.

393
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,576
I'll stay by your side.

394
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,996
Because that's why I was reborn this time.

395
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,583
Am I really that strange?

396
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,377
What part of that person
did you like so much?

397
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,589
You're my first love.

398
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,550
This is something that I've decided

399
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,552
after years of pondering.

400
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,181
What I'm trying to say

401
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,266
has to do with a miracle.

402
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,686
The miracle that
the Yoon Ju-won of the past

403
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,188
still exists

404
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,231
and will exist in the future as well.

405
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,110
You're here.

406
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,202
You should have picked up
if you were here.

407
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,119
I didn't know that…

408
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,662
You went to the haunted house, didn't you?

409
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,503
This is what Seo-ha wanted to ride,
so you should have come straight here.

410
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,550
What if I hadn't seen your note?

411
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,762
If not today, then tomorrow.

412
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,140
And even if not tomorrow,
I would have kept waiting.

413
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,060
I could've thrown your note away.

414
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,563
But you didn't.

415
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,319
Are you really Ju-won?

416
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,332
I wanted to see you again.

417
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,589
Every time I died
I used to say the same prayer.

418
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,677
I prayed that I wouldn't remember anything
in the next life.

419
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:38,889
But that time,

420
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,851
I didn't want that.

421
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,777
I'm sorry.

422
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,366
I'm sorry.

423
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,036
It was all because of me.

424
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,122
Don't cry.

425
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:07,126
I wish you would be happy, Seo-ha.

426
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,173
I have to tell you this.

427
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,304
Yoon Ju-won and Ban Ji-eum…

428
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,767
both wish that you would be very happy.

429
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:26,937
Okay?

430
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:23,994
Seo-ha and Ju-won…

431
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,622
They're more deeply in love
than we thought.

432
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:35,964
At this rate,

433
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,842
Seo-ha will also have problems.

434
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:44,014
You know that the problem will only end
if we become normal.

435
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,476
They should know before it's too late.

436
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,813
Let's each do what we can…

437
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,066
while there's still a chance.

438
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,450
So…

439
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,120
what do I call you now?

440
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,081
I'll keep calling you Director Mun.

441
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,543
And yet you're speaking casually to me.

442
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,670
You're right.

443
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,422
Even just now.

444
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,051
Let's just speak to each other naturally
without overthinking it.

445
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,595
Sure, sounds good.

446
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,391
It's so pretty.

447
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,107
I was afraid that if I told you,

448
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,401
I wouldn't be able to see you again.

449
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,073
You said it yourself.

450
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,118
That you wouldn't see Ju-won
if she came back.

451
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,164
She met an unfortunate end while with me.

452
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:53,876
So I was anxious.

453
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,588
Even now?

454
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,219
It's all right.

455
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,305
I was in the past,

456
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,807
I'm in the present,
and I'll be in the future as well.

457
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,142
Okay?

458
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,166
When did you have the time
to make bean paste stew?

459
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,376
You're such a great brother.

460
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,128
Thank you for the food.

461
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:44,843
Are you okay?

462
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,637
Is it bland?

463
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,679
It's too salty.

464
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,474
You haven't lost your sense of taste
or something, have you?

465
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,229
You're right.

466
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,024
Hold on. I'll pour some water in.

467
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:25,676
Hello?

468
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,261
Why won't you answer your phone?

469
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,679
What is it now?

470
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,514
You're coming to the gathering, right?

471
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,058
They're disappointed you keep bailing.

472
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,269
Well, I'm a bit busy.

473
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,396
Ga-hui's handing out wedding invitations.

474
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,313
Make sure to come.

475
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,526
Wedding invitations?

476
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,365
Ae-gyeong, I'm off to work.

477
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,491
Uncle.

478
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,118
Come here before you leave.

479
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,245
-Why?
-Just come.

480
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,375
Ta-da!

481
00:47:58,875 --> 00:47:59,918
Goodness, what's this?

482
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,297
I was so happy
with the clothes you bought me,

483
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,631
so I got one too.

484
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,508
-Yours?
-No, yours.

485
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,926
-Mine?
-Yes.

486
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,137
Look at you, Ae-gyeong.

487
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,972
Everything's good with Seo-ha, right?

488
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,850
I bought this to celebrate that too.

489
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,102
-Shall I open it?
-Yes.

490
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,151
The color's so beautiful.

491
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,861
Is it? Try it on.

492
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,488
-Oh, it's so soft.
-Gosh.

493
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,115
Let me try it on.

494
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,783
Go on.

495
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,827
Here we go.

496
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,540
My goodness, it looks better on you
than on the mannequin.

497
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,334
With this on,

498
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,085
only good things will happen to you.

499
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,587
Right.

500
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,130
Everything will come up roses

501
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,840
with Seo-ha, Cho-won,

502
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,508
and you.

503
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,428
Oh, my goodness.

504
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,138
I'm happy just imagining it.

505
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,557
Thank you, Ae-gyeong.

506
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,101
Just a moment.

507
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,357
Yes, ma'am?

508
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,737
Sure.

509
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,416
Working up a sweat has made me thirsty.
I'd like a cold drink.

510
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,468
What is it today?

511
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,845
After accusing the innocent of murder,

512
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,014
what nonsense will you spout now?

513
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,934
Can you even afford a lawyer if I sue you?

514
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:42,020
Have a cold drink on me.
Drink it and get lost.

515
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,021
Give her one too.

516
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,359
Yeon-ok.

517
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,613
You've aged so much.

518
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,324
"Yeon-ok"?

519
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,536
You've gone mad.

520
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,289
You were so youthful
when you were my tutor.

521
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,378
Did you have fun with my husband?

522
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,547
Do you enjoy

523
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,173
running my hotel?

524
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,218
When Sang-hyuck brought you in

525
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,221
and I first saw you,

526
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,931
you were so bright and intelligent.

527
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,397
You really should have done better
with what you stole from me.

528
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:28,108
Look what happened to you.

529
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,861
You've got nothing to your name,

530
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,406
neither my husband nor the company.

531
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,365
What are you doing?

532
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,411
You shouldn't have used my son
in your blackmailing at the very least.

533
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,538
You're a mom too.

534
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,000
Who are you?

535
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,420
Ms. Lee Sang-a asked me
to deliver this message.

536
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,718
She wandered the netherworld angry at you

537
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,429
and missed her time to leave.

538
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,307
She's been watching you all along.

539
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,227
She's probably watching now as well.

540
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,148
Ms. Jang,

541
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,983
apologize to Director Mun sincerely.

542
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,069
Then I'll try to change Ms. Lee's mind.

543
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,405
If you don't,

544
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,032
she said she would

545
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,534
haunt you forever.

546
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:20,994
All right?

547
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,832
How pitiful.

548
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,281
Was that satisfying enough?

549
00:51:58,865 --> 00:51:59,699
A bit.

550
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,452
Seo-ha will do the rest.

551
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,538
That's right.

552
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,331
It's time for me to go now.

553
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:08,333
I'll keep in touch, ma'am.

554
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:09,876
No.

555
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,127
I'll be busy.

556
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,463
I have a very important thing to do.

557
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:17,676
Ju-won.

558
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,763
I hope you can cross over
safely on your own,

559
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,308
from here to there.

560
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,105
What do you mean?

561
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,107
People like us are fortunate

562
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,943
to have been able to get along
with people from past lives.

563
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:35,861
But still…

564
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,989
when you're born again,

565
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,325
you should forge new relationships.

566
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,291
You'll come to understand.

567
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:54,629
I trust you'll make a wise choice then.

568
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,904
KANG MIN-GI

569
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,280
Is this the place

570
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,699
with the pond and fireworks
you were talking about?

571
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:27,746
MUJINJEONG POND WATER FIREWORKS

572
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,418
It really exists.

573
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,096
Why didn't I know about this place?

574
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,016
You're here early.

575
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,603
Why are you alone? Where's Director Mun?

576
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:54,147
He's stopping by his family house
to see the chairman.

577
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,589
Seo-ha.

578
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,343
You were here.

579
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,179
I was about to go and see you.

580
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,056
Where's Father?

581
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,354
He said he had an early meeting,

582
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,231
so he left.

583
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,318
Why did you do it?

584
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,489
I just can't fathom why.

585
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,123
Why did you try to kill me?

586
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,836
I don't know if you'll ever believe me,

587
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,589
but I was never trying to kill you.
It was a mistake.

588
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,176
I had no idea
you would be in that car that day.

589
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,094
Then…

590
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,848
were you trying to kill Father?

591
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,604
But why?

592
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,454
I had gone mad.

593
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,415
What do you mean?

594
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,336
What are you talking about?

595
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:44,591
I hated…

596
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,597
seeing Yeon-ok so close to your father.

597
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,561
I hated your father

598
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,815
for neglecting your mother
and only caring about the company.

599
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,692
I also couldn't bear to see…

600
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,156
Yeon-ok still wanting
to stick with your father.

601
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,041
But I never wanted to kill him, Seo-ha.

602
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,167
Please believe me.

603
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,168
It was a mistake.

604
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,463
It was an accident.

605
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,061
The car accident from 24 years ago

606
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,356
and the incident
with Mr. Bang of Wonjo Capital…

607
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,443
Turn yourself in and confess to it all.

608
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,864
I won't allow you much time.

609
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,367
If you don't act…

610
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,497
I will.

611
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,497
Director Lee of MI Group
has turned himself in to the police.

612
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:43,042
His past criminal activities
have caused significant impacts.

613
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,836
In 1998,

614
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:47,255
Director Lee had instigated
Wonjo Capital's Mr. Bang

615
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:50,592
and ordered a hit-and-run
on one of Chairman Mun's vehicles.

616
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:54,387
Chairman Mun's only son
and Director Lee's nephew,

617
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:57,724
Managing Director Mun of MI Hotel,
was heavily injured in the accident.

618
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,809
Meanwhile, Ms. Yoon,
a 12-year-old passenger,

619
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,936
and the driver, Mr. Ha, had passed away.

620
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,398
In a shocking turn of events,
the recently discovered body in Hasan-ri

621
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,692
was found to be a victim
of Director Lee's attempt

622
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:11,779
to cover up his past criminal activities.

623
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:14,657
With the criminal motives
still in question,

624
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:18,536
MI Group has put a gag order
regarding the case.

625
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,371
As a prominent company in the country,

626
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:24,125
it seems that MI Group will be stunned
by this hit to its reputation.

627
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,436
You were worried about me again,
weren't you?

628
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,231
No, why would I be?

629
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,983
You got your head in the game
and finished the race.

630
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,820
I'm waiting so I can hug you

631
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,365
and tell you, "Well done, Seo-ha."

632
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,408
"Thank you, Seo-ha."

633
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:01,663
Hello?

634
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:02,664
Director Mun?

635
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,792
Seo-ha?

636
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,377
I'm all right.

637
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,003
You don't have to worry about me.

638
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:11,256
See you at the office.

639
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,553
He sounds a bit down.

640
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,722
I'll have to cheer him up.

641
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,099
How will you do that?

642
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,228
You startled me.

643
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,647
Are you going to
hold my hand and run again?

644
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,731
No.

645
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:34,696
I was a flamenco dancer
in one of my past lives.

646
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,325
So that was a different past life?

647
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,161
Everyone has past lives.

648
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,454
They just don't remember.

649
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,291
You have a past life too.

650
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,626
How would you know that?

651
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,253
I saw it.

652
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,296
My past life?

653
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,590
No way.

654
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,174
Are you trying to be funny?

655
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,175
Do you want to check?

656
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,469
I was about to head somewhere.

657
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:01,097
Do you want to come with me
on an overnight trip?

658
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,018
Sure.

659
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,331
I think that's the place.

660
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,669
So what you're saying is,

661
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:35,590
this was a place from your past life
a thousand years ago?

662
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:36,883
I only found out recently.

663
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,053
I only remember
bits and pieces of my first life,

664
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,971
mostly from seeing visions in my dreams.

665
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,266
Could I ask what you saw?

666
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,186
I saw a man walking toward me

667
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:49,562
through exploding fireworks.

668
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,230
A man?

669
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,942
What kind of man?

670
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,405
Are you jealous of a man
from a thousand years ago?

671
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,784
No, I'm not.

672
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:03,868
I was just…

673
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,162
asking about him because I was curious.

674
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:08,247
I don't know who he is yet either.

675
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,375
But since I still remember him,

676
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,210
he must have been quite special to me.

677
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,757
It's not something cheesy like
"love that lasts a thousand years," is it?

678
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,677
That sounds so good.

679
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:24,806
I'm going to be so excited
if I ever see him.

680
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,433
Come on.

681
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,628
MUJINJEONG POND WATER FIREWORKS

682
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,578
It was somewhere around here.

683
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:17,270
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

684
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,313
I'm older than you.

685
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,025
Are you really the man
from a thousand years ago?

686
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,987
So this place can show me my past life?

687
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,656
All right then.
Let's go see your past life.

688
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,032
I suddenly didn't like the fact…

689
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:31,993
Mr. Ha.

690
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:33,202
…that I was there.

691
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,413
I never trampled on your mom.

692
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,373
You just coveted
what she had and stole it.

693
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,667
You were a coward
who stole from someone who was sick.

694
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:42,503
People from your past
whom you've reconnected with.

695
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,672
Those people

696
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,216
will meet the same fate as Ms. Kim.

697
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,218
Who are you?

698
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:56,183
