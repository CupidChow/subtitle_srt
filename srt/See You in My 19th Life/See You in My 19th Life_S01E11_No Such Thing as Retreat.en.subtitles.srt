1
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,970
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

2
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:03,229
NO SUCH THING AS RETREAT

3
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,961
MY 1ST LIFE

4
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,014
Hello, Master Cheon-un.

5
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,441
How are things coming along?

6
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,320
Materials from the spiritual mountain
were used to create this dye,

7
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,738
so you may rest easy.

8
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,742
These cloths will form the knot
of the sacred shaman bells.

9
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,621
Make sure they are flawless
as they will be used for the ritual.

10
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,165
I am putting my utmost care into them.

11
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,043
They should be done in fifteen days.

12
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,339
Let us go.

13
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,657
Such nagging.

14
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,244
It is to be expected
since it is an important task.

15
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,620
Calm your temper.

16
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,539
I at least need to have a temper

17
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,166
since you're too kind and gentle.

18
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,002
Oh, you.

19
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,963
I told you to rest. Are you all right?

20
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,506
I'm fine.

21
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,469
No, you're not. Let's get you inside.

22
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,597
Seol.

23
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,058
Seol, let's get inside.

24
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,852
Come on.

25
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,687
Seol.

26
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,362
Seol is much too frail.

27
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,658
This is the last resort I have for her.

28
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:40,845
Su!

29
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,556
Su!

30
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,600
Sir?

31
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,644
Su.

32
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,482
Medicine reserved for the royals
in Seorabeol Palace

33
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,984
may save Seol's life.

34
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,945
Is that true?

35
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,113
Thank you.

36
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,281
Thank you, sir.

37
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,116
But…

38
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,160
it will not be easy to obtain.

39
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,037
Money is of no concern.

40
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,580
It is not a matter of money.

41
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,210
What's the matter, sir?

42
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,712
I need to save her.

43
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,423
I must save her.

44
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:38,736
Follow me.

45
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,375
I have brought the dyed cloths
for the shaman bells' knot.

46
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,512
Why are you not handing them over?

47
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,973
Here they are, sir.

48
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,570
The colors are beautiful.

49
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:24,991
Well done.

50
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,088
A prayer must be offered
before I tie these cloths to the bells.

51
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,008
I must be alone.

52
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,093
Empty the shrine

53
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,303
and let no one in.

54
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,805
Did you say the shrine's shaman bells?

55
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:57,685
Seorabeol is currently
suffering through a severe drought.

56
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:01,564
So the palace is gathering spiritual items
that could bring about rain.

57
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,941
Those shaman bells

58
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,319
could be exchanged for the rare medicine.

59
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,739
Are you certain

60
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,824
that Seol can be saved?

61
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,535
But, Su…

62
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,746
It's too dangerous.

63
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,124
If you dare to steal from the shrine,

64
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,959
you may anger the gods.

65
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,988
Su, where are we going?

66
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,575
Just hold on for a bit.
You have to trust me.

67
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,043
Stop right there!

68
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,754
Run, Seol!

69
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,295
What's all this about, sir?

70
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,338
Hand over the shaman bells.

71
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,048
Shaman bells?

72
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,550
What do you mean?

73
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:02,893
Su!

74
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,647
I've committed a grave sin.

75
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,400
But my sister is dying.

76
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,819
What could be more important
to me than that?

77
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,362
Master Cheon-un.

78
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,032
I can save her
if I take these bells to Seorabeol.

79
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,827
Please grant us mercy
and let us go on our way.

80
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,538
I may be of lowly birth,

81
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,499
but I shall dedicate the rest of my life
to serve the heavens.

82
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,044
A human life lasts 100 years at most,

83
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,047
while the heavens span
hundreds and thousands of years.

84
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,798
How could you ever serve enough?

85
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,095
Seol!

86
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,723
Please, I beg you!

87
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,184
These bells…

88
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,937
These bells can easily be made again.

89
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,149
But my sister will die
if not treated at the right time.

90
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,152
So I beg you, sir.

91
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,404
I will gladly submit
to the anger of the heavens--

92
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,406
There is also a right time
for the rituals!

93
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,827
A person is dying before you!

94
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,081
So how could the heavens
or rituals be more important?

95
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,876
What kind of gods do you serve?

96
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,589
Are they unable to have mercy
on us helpless human beings?

97
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,676
What use are the heavens

98
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,971
if there are no people to worship them?

99
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,056
Ji-eum.

100
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,396
Are you okay?

101
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,163
Seol…

102
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,377
Seol, look at me.

103
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,671
Please, just hold on.

104
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,550
It'll be all right.

105
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,343
It's okay.

106
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,637
Please hold on.

107
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,721
Please.

108
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,140
Su…

109
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,687
Thank you for everything.

110
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,784
Seol.

111
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,245
Seol.

112
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,581
-Seol.
-Seol.

113
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,665
Seol.

114
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,625
Oh, no. Seol!

115
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,424
Seol!

116
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,650
Seol.

117
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:01,280
-What do I do…
-You're okay.

118
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,449
-You're okay, Ji-eum.
-No…

119
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,368
Seol!

120
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,870
Seol!

121
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,011
I'll kill you.

122
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,515
I'll kill you.

123
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,266
I'll kill you.

124
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,603
I'll kill you.

125
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,189
I'll kill you.

126
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,900
I'll kill you.

127
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,365
I'll kill you.

128
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,284
I'll kill you!

129
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,745
I'll kill you!

130
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,497
I'll kill you!

131
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,458
I'll kill you!

132
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,338
I'll kill you!

133
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,917
I'll kill you!

134
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,961
-I'll kill you.
-Please.

135
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,130
-I'll kill you.
-Ji-eum.

136
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,591
I'll kill you.

137
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,508
Ji-eum.

138
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,969
It's me, Ji-eum.

139
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,431
It's Seo-ha.

140
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,399
Seo…

141
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,986
Seo-ha.

142
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,744
What happened?

143
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,495
Ji-eum,

144
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,872
what happened?

145
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,001
I saw my first life.

146
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,421
My sister died.

147
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,385
My sister died.

148
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,722
My sister died.

149
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,226
My sister died.

150
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,312
He killed her.

151
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,814
My sister died.

152
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,317
-It's okay.
-Seol…

153
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,234
Ji-eum.

154
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,242
Han-ya.

155
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:54,954
Han-ya.

156
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,623
You killed her.

157
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,669
You killed my sister.

158
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,212
Ji-eum.

159
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,673
I'm Seo-ha.

160
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,676
I'm Seo-ha.

161
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,927
Look at me.

162
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,096
I'm Seo-ha.

163
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,560
Oh, my goodness.

164
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,817
I just choked you…

165
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,486
How could I…

166
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,445
No, it's all right.

167
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,949
It's all right.

168
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,124
It's all right.

169
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,214
It's all right.

170
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,342
It's all right.

171
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,729
I'm so sorry.

172
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:05,983
I…

173
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,527
I think I need to be alone right now.

174
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,281
Don't come near me.

175
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,076
I can't leave you like this.

176
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,327
Please.

177
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,288
I need to be alone.

178
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,625
Ji-eum.

179
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,296
I'm sorry.

180
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,798
Please just go.

181
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,106
Give me a call.

182
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,776
I'll be waiting.

183
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,105
Hello?

184
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,090
WEBTOON ORIGINAL SERIES
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE CREATED BY LEE HEY

185
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,847
I thought you might not come.

186
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,808
Do you also know about past lives?

187
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,935
I also remember my past lives

188
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,479
just like Ms. Ban.

189
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,985
I'm in Ms. Ban's first life…

190
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,113
that she saw.

191
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,450
And so are you.

192
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,123
Ji-eum is in a bad state.

193
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:27,958
I'd do anything--

194
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,793
There's nothing you can do.

195
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,795
You have no idea…

196
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,258
what it's like to remember past lives.

197
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:44,766
I know it's more than simply having
a lot of memories of the past.

198
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,809
Do you have…

199
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,607
any memories that are painful
just to think about?

200
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,318
I do.

201
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,652
She has 19 memories

202
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,488
just like that.

203
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,326
She can never forget them

204
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,203
or share them with anyone.

205
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,581
It's beyond your imagination.

206
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,042
That just means I should try harder.

207
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,170
Ji-eum did the same for me.

208
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,631
When I was struggling,

209
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,466
she never left me alone.

210
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,136
I'm going to do what she did.

211
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,389
I was going to ask you for advice,

212
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,725
but it seems you don't have any,
so I'll just do it my way.

213
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,061
I do have one piece of advice.

214
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,863
Please help Ms. Ban

215
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,407
become normal.

216
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,619
Only you

217
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,163
can convince Ms. Ban.

218
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:05,264
In bad times, remember the happy moments.

219
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,766
I'm by your side.

220
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,437
When your past trauma haunts you

221
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,022
and you feel like you're sinking,

222
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,566
think of these flowers.

223
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,861
Then the emotions you feel right now

224
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,864
may motivate you to keep going.

225
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,537
Think of these flowers.

226
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,434
It's Seo-ha.

227
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,477
Can you even say

228
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,688
that this life is a new life for you?

229
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,525
Aren't you just clinging onto
your past relationships?

230
00:21:59,026 --> 00:21:59,901
It's all right.

231
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,778
Reconnecting with those from the past
will only cause problems.

232
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,157
And normally, the ones who suffer
are not us who remember our past lives,

233
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,035
but them.

234
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,088
I told you to keep your neck warm
so you don't get a cold.

235
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,674
-It's so suffocating.
-It's not.

236
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,844
You used to get colds all the time
and have a runny nose.

237
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,972
-Goodness. You never listened to me once.
-Ji-eum.

238
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,062
How did such a good kid like you…

239
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,149
come to me?

240
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,278
You have no idea

241
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,740
how happy I was raising you.

242
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,995
Thank you for coming to me, Ji-eum.

243
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,017
Ms. Kim's not the only one, is she?

244
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,394
People from your past
whom you've reconnected with.

245
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,359
Those people

246
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,112
will meet the same fate as Ms. Kim.

247
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,955
The rest of the pots
will take two more days.

248
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,957
I love them so much.

249
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,291
Thank you.

250
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,418
It was nothing. Goodbye.

251
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,587
Your bag.

252
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,173
Thank you. I'll be off.

253
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,678
Ice cream.

254
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,265
Hello, I'm Ha Do-jin.

255
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:01,857
To be honest,

256
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,693
I unintentionally
overheard you two that night.

257
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,363
You two like each other,

258
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,283
but Do-yun turned you away
because of family background issues.

259
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,284
Am I right?

260
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,453
Yes.

261
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,666
My brother

262
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,420
had to grow up quickly
when our father passed.

263
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,922
He had to raise me by himself.

264
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,634
He faked his age since middle school

265
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,970
to work part-time while studying.

266
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,472
He barely slept two hours a day.

267
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,808
But I was too young to know that.

268
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,437
I'd ask him when he'd go to work
so he could buy me snacks.

269
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,982
I guess I really knew nothing

270
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,109
about Mr. Ha.

271
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,158
After you left that night…

272
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,413
Do-yun cried.

273
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,416
He was watching you leave,

274
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,210
motionless.

275
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,027
That's when I knew.

276
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,030
That he must really like you.

277
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,284
I didn't know Mr. Ha liked me that much.

278
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,623
So why am I so sad?

279
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,544
Knowing that he liked me
but still kept it to himself…

280
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,174
It'll be even harder for me
to get close to him.

281
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,970
I thought we felt differently.

282
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,684
I assumed I liked him more.

283
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,562
So I thought it was tougher for me.

284
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,526
But if that's not the case,

285
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,072
what do I do now?

286
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,461
EVERY TIME THE NEXT LIFE CAME,
THEN THE NEXT,

287
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,672
IT FELT LIKE MORE AND MORE ROCKS
WEIGHED HER HEART DOWN

288
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:39,973
That's not all.

289
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,184
I was an excellent warrior
in the Goryeo Dynasty.

290
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,438
I survived a war in Spain
and the Japanese invasion.

291
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:52,485
I was also part of a circus troupe
and was amazing at the flying trapeze.

292
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,404
People lined up to see me.

293
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,326
I was Ae-gyeong's uncle
when I was in the circus.

294
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,705
It was thanks to Ae-gyeong's trust in me

295
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,124
that I got to meet you
when you were in high school.

296
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:14,299
I thought she was fine
because she was always smiling.

297
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,261
I'm in Ms. Ban's first life…

298
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,806
that she saw.

299
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,224
And so are you.

300
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,603
Han-ya.

301
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,564
You killed her.

302
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,193
You killed my sister.

303
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,846
DIRECTOR LEE OF MI GROUP
WAS SENT TO THE PROSECUTION

304
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,182
AFTER HAVING CONFESSED
TO HIS CRIMES TO THE POLICE

305
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,703
-It's Director Mun!
-He's here!

306
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,290
-Regarding the criminal motive…
-Did Director Lee confess on his own?

307
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,584
Are you perhaps keeping quiet
about his other criminal deeds?

308
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,461
What are your thoughts on his prosecution?

309
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,797
Are you aware that he will be prosecuted?

310
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,025
Do you feel justified?

311
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:57,902
No.

312
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,572
My heart is heavy.

313
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,949
This could have all been covered up.

314
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,994
Why bring it to the surface?

315
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,996
It wasn't something

316
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,373
a simple apology could cover up.

317
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,294
Ju-won…

318
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,130
and Do-yun's father passed away.

319
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,136
If you had known the truth then,

320
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,264
could you have handled it?

321
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,228
I would have.

322
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,440
Even if it meant

323
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,985
getting on my knees next to you.

324
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,699
Seo-ha.

325
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,256
Seo-ha.

326
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,092
I'm sorry.

327
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,304
You're just like your father.

328
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,600
He did the same thing then.

329
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,521
What?

330
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:18,900
I knew all about Ju-won's accident
since many years ago.

331
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,486
And who was behind it.

332
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,365
Your father told me everything

333
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,576
before you went to Germany.

334
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,332
I couldn't protect Ju-won…

335
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,171
but I wanted to protect you.

336
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:50,765
Because…

337
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,602
you're the son of my precious friend.

338
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:58,857
I'm sorry.

339
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,569
I'm so sorry.

340
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,032
I'm sorry.

341
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,254
Doing that was better

342
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,840
than revealing the truth.

343
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,425
I did all this…

344
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,554
to protect you.

345
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,981
I understand that you were
trying to protect me.

346
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,984
But it was wrong.

347
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,445
Because the two of us…

348
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,615
are only left with scars.

349
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,091
Cut the nonsense.

350
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,719
You know nothing
about what happened ten years ago.

351
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,847
Director Lee, Seo-ha's uncle…

352
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,059
I heard it straight from him.

353
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,311
That's all nonsense.

354
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,604
You seem rattled.

355
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,024
You know that Director Lee
trusts me a lot.

356
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,069
Why in the world would Sang-hyuck…

357
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:28,947
tell you everything?

358
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,699
You should ask him yourself.

359
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,163
Now…

360
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,961
I wonder who I should tell about this.

361
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,922
Please forgive me.

362
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,508
-It was my mistake.
-Mistake?

363
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,053
My son lost his hearing
because of your blunder!

364
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,681
-And an innocent kid died.
-That was never my intention.

365
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,600
I regret it every day.

366
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,852
Then you should've
kept it secret until the end!

367
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,356
But you've gone
and told Yeon-ok all about it.

368
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,904
Act like nothing happened.

369
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,158
Things will only get complicated
if people find out.

370
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,493
But make sure…

371
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:18,955
Seo-ha never finds out.

372
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,499
Ever.

373
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,669
You understand?

374
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,346
I'm sorry.

375
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,890
Why are you here?

376
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,519
I'm here to see Ms. Kim.

377
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,104
Why would you?

378
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,397
You seem on edge.

379
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,525
I have all the reasons to be.

380
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,405
Cheon-un.

381
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,744
You were also in my first life.

382
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,922
It's been a while…

383
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,342
since you called me that.

384
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,096
You approached me
because you knew, didn't you?

385
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,765
You knew we had ties in our past lives.

386
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,684
Why didn't you tell me?

387
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,480
Because you don't remember that life.

388
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,733
What's so great about what you remember?

389
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,485
You could just tell me.

390
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,237
You need to remember it on your own.

391
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,073
Especially your first life.

392
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,577
The shaman bells only act as a guide.

393
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,370
Remembering it is up to you.

394
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,628
Ji-eum.

395
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:14,881
Are you okay?

396
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,760
Seol…

397
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,555
Seol…

398
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,394
What…

399
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,480
was I doing then?

400
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,649
You were at the shrine.

401
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,196
And you were next to Han-ya
in the field of reeds.

402
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,576
So you didn't see all of it.

403
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,915
If you want to save Ms. Kim,

404
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,210
find out about your first life
until it ends.

405
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,129
-And if I do?
-I told you already.

406
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,797
In your first life,

407
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,927
you'll see the person
who made you remember your past lives.

408
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,346
Find out who it is.

409
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,437
Are you sure I can save Ae-gyeong?

410
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,190
Can I trust you?

411
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:16,776
Just try it.

412
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,739
Ms. Ban,

413
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,700
it's very rare for you to meet

414
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,162
people from your first life
in the same form.

415
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,831
It took you a thousand years.

416
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,542
Sadly…

417
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,673
I haven't had the chance myself.

418
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,052
So I can't end this life
even if I want to.

419
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,433
The bells.

420
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,436
I'll leave them with you.

421
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,790
Once you finish seeing
all of your first life,

422
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,419
come find me.

423
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,889
You'll have no choice
but to look for me anyway.

424
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,281
Here we go.

425
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,326
The sunlight's so nice today.

426
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,746
What's this?

427
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,416
This stuff could make a ghost look good.

428
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,709
It's chicken porridge.

429
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,300
Your memory really is exceptional.

430
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,345
It really is, my damn memory.

431
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,347
It looks so good.

432
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,848
Thank you.

433
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,434
I made it, so it has to be good.

434
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,731
It tastes amazing.

435
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,358
Of course.

436
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,989
Ae-gyeong.

437
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,534
I'm going to save you no matter what.

438
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:13,911
I will this time.

439
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,790
It's my resolution
that lasted a thousand years.

440
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:23,337
I see now that you're the one
who's scared, not me.

441
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,175
I'll feed you a bite.

442
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,969
My goodness.

443
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,095
Open up.

444
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,348
Look at you eating so well.

445
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,184
It's so delicious.

446
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,103
-Ae-gyeong.
-Yes?

447
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,354
Shall I fly the airplane?

448
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,815
Goodness.
I can't be doing that stuff at my age.

449
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:45,109
Here comes the airplane.

450
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,572
What a good girl!

451
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,621
Hey.

452
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:01,959
Just hold on.

453
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,837
It's okay. Please hold on.

454
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,754
Please.

455
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,507
Su…

456
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,593
Su…

457
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,513
Thank you for everything.

458
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,481
What's the matter?

459
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,234
I'm just happy to see you.

460
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,363
I missed you a lot.

461
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,949
Me too.

462
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,160
It's nice to come
to an art gallery together.

463
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,495
I wanted to come with you.

464
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:38,829
Let's go in.

465
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,502
Cho-won.

466
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,005
Thank you for being healthy.

467
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,592
I guess you must be quite scared
because of Ms. Kim's condition.

468
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,095
She should be okay after surgery, right?

469
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,640
She will be.

470
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,559
Wishes come true
if you're desperate enough.

471
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,272
That's probably why you and I met again.

472
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:09,193
We met again
because you came looking for me.

473
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,821
You have no idea
how grateful I am for that.

474
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,954
You and I may have
known each other for much longer.

475
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,083
They're all connected.

476
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,961
Sort of like you and me.

477
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,047
It gives off a warm feeling.

478
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,008
I think deep relationships,

479
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:37,054
whether forged out of love or out of hate,

480
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,765
are destined to intertwine again

481
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,852
as family or as lovers.

482
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,439
You think so?

483
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:53,237
Then I guess it's also destined
for certain relationships to not work out.

484
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,992
Come to think of it,
plants are just the same.

485
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,910
No matter how hard I try,

486
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,829
some trees just don't grow.

487
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,832
And some flowers don't bloom
even after they're meant to.

488
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,293
It may take a long time,

489
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,128
but destined relationships
are bound to work out.

490
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,380
I don't think so.

491
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,967
I think it's time for me to let go.

492
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,678
It's the right thing to do.

493
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,810
We can go with this for the promotion.

494
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,687
-Well done.
-Thank you.

495
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,356
We will discuss
the specifics among ourselves.

496
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,816
-Great work.
-Thank you.

497
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,280
How's Ms. Ban?

498
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,074
Did you say
that her aunt was hospitalized?

499
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,534
Yeah.

500
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,036
She's not her actual aunt,

501
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,204
but she's closer to her than family.

502
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,582
I'm clocking out.

503
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,000
All right.

504
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,586
Hey, it's Ms. Ban.

505
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,092
It's me, Mr. Ha.

506
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,178
Yes, Ms. Ban?

507
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,847
I'll keep it short.

508
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,310
If Cho-won really lets you go
for the last time,

509
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,730
it'll be you
who won't be able to let her go.

510
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,525
What do you mean?

511
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,818
I really hope

512
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,155
my words get stuck in your heart.

513
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,285
Also…

514
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,829
about Director Mun…

515
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,289
What is it?

516
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,380
Please take care of Director Mun.

517
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,049
Don't get careless without me there.

518
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,140
Please tell him to wait a little.

519
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,476
Why don't you tell him yourself?

520
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,563
I have some business to take care of.

521
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,524
And…

522
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,736
if I call or text, I'd want to go see him.

523
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,116
But I don't know
what I might do to him again.

524
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,701
I'm just holding back for a bit.

525
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:08,956
All right.

526
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:09,873
Then goodbye.

527
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,544
How could you just…

528
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,921
She called me.
Call her if you want to see her.

529
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,591
I'm not going to call her.

530
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,717
I'm going to go to her.

531
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,637
Hey.

532
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,722
Stop mulling things over.

533
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,808
Don't be scared and just do it.

534
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,810
I'm clocking out.

535
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,275
He's becoming more and more like Ms. Ban.

536
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,447
I miss Seo-ha.

537
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,158
Ji-eum.

538
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,243
Please.

539
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,302
-Mr. Heo.
-Yes?

540
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,012
Does Ms. Yoon have work outside today?

541
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,183
She said she'll be back from the garden
after checking on the inventory.

542
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,908
You think too much, Mr. Ha.

543
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:29,077
You should just
be straightforward sometimes.

544
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,497
I feel so sick.

545
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,586
It seems this is the place for you to be.

546
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,131
It's not often in life

547
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,509
that someone desperately needs you.

548
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,833
I'm here because I didn't want to wait.

549
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,669
How much longer do I have to?

550
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,299
I'm sorry.

551
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:07,050
Can I go over there?

552
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,190
I'm sorry.

553
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,819
Why would you be sorry?

554
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:28,030
I know I'm in your past life.

555
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,491
And I know I've hurt you a lot.

556
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,416
I thought about it all night.

557
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,045
About what I might have
done wrong in my past life

558
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,882
and how I could make you feel better.

559
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,510
But no matter how hard I thought,

560
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,388
nothing came to mind.

561
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,684
So I just want to apologize.

562
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,562
I'm sorry I can't do anything for you.

563
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,651
It was a past life
I'd completely forgotten about anyway.

564
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,278
And a thousand years
have passed since then.

565
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,865
I'm not going to be shaken
by something that happened in the past.

566
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,409
Then why did you run away?

567
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,584
I put you in danger.

568
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:25,962
I was so sorry

569
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,882
that I couldn't bring myself to see you.

570
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,682
But I'm not dead, am I?

571
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,229
I should've expected that much
when I decided to like someone

572
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,106
who remembers her past lives.

573
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,401
Naturally,

574
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,820
I was just worried about you.

575
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:57,244
You used to jump into danger
the first chance you got.

576
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,620
And that shook you?

577
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,832
You really are a strange person.

578
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,752
So I've decided

579
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,213
to stop being so strange.

580
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,634
There's a way for me to become normal.

581
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,886
If I stop remembering my past lives…

582
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,390
everything will be okay.

583
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,354
Please help Ms. Ban become normal.

584
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,568
No matter what choice you make,

585
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,778
and no matter who you are…

586
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,489
I'll be by your side.

587
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,666
I'll tell you what to do.

588
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,626
And…

589
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,253
what comes afterward.

590
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,798
There's something afterward?

591
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:57,846
Yes.

592
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,479
How could I forget you?

593
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,536
You don't have to be here.

594
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,955
Don't worry.

595
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,166
What if…

596
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,044
I attack you again?

597
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,712
You won't get me twice.

598
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,174
I let you attack me then
because you caught me off guard.

599
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,762
You came this far.

600
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,556
So make sure to look at everything.

601
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,517
Don't miss anything.

602
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:46,853
I'll be here.

603
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,069
Get out of my way.

604
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,905
I'm going to kill him.

605
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,241
Would your sister be happy

606
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,660
if you killed him?

607
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,747
Do not repay blood…

608
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,167
with blood.

609
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:33,710
Please…

610
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,380
take care of yourself.

611
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:56,316
Please take care of yourself.

612
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,903
Something's strange.

613
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,446
What did I miss?

614
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,398
He's Master Han-ya from the shrine.

615
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,278
The heavens span
hundreds and thousands of years.

616
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,572
How could you ever serve enough?

617
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,034
Seol.

618
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,373
Seol!

619
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,792
Please, I beg you!

620
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,169
She's already past saving.

621
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:00,880
Su!

622
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,342
Let her pass away.

623
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,180
No human can defy the will of the heavens.

624
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,225
No!

625
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,105
A person is dying before you!

626
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,442
So how could the heavens
or rituals be more important?

627
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,279
What kind of gods do you serve?

628
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:28,908
Are they unable to have mercy
on us helpless human beings?

629
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:33,705
What use are the heavens

630
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,834
if there are no people to worship them?

631
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,091
Keep resisting and you will face death.

632
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,011
Let go when you have the chance.

633
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,514
Please, I beg you.

634
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:55,560
We have no time to delay.

635
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,248
Seol… Oh, no.

636
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,918
Seol.

637
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:23,588
Just hold on.

638
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,173
Please hold on.

639
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,842
Seol.

640
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,639
Seol…

641
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,682
-This is what you wanted.
-Seol.

642
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,478
-There is nothing like death
-Seol.

643
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,105
to bring someone peace.

644
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,861
The time for the ritual is near.

645
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:48,947
We must not delay.

646
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,367
Seol…

647
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,830
Seol…

648
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:58,414
Seol…

649
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,544
Seol…

650
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:03,461
Seol…

651
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,883
Seol…

652
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,468
Seol…

653
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,351
Seol…

654
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:23,690
It was Cheon-un.

655
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,110
He was the one who killed Seol
and even tried to kill me.

656
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,195
It wasn't Seo-ha.

657
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,292
None of that matters anymore.

658
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:44,586
Get out of my way.

659
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:48,840
Get out of my way!

660
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:21,789
Stop!

661
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,005
All I wanted…

662
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:33,009
was to save a life.

663
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,991
I will never forget this day.

664
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,412
I shall forever

665
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,415
remember this rage.

666
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:13,216
Be it hundreds or thousands of years,
I shall remember this and be born again.

667
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:16,052
And I will get my revenge…

668
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,515
no matter what.

669
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,550
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

670
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,927
There's someone I need to meet.

671
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:58,928
Mr. Ha.

672
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:02,515
I'm sorry for everything,
and thank you for liking me.

673
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,726
I came here to see you, Ms. Yoon.

674
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,311
I was waiting for you.

675
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,730
I will never forgive you.

676
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:12,358
If my being strange is an issue,
then I'll become normal.

677
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,571
I'm going to be happy in this life
with the people I love.

678
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,573
Putting an end
to remembering your past lives

679
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:21,784
means you'll lose the memories
of the people from them.

680
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,328
I don't want to forget.

681
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,997
I want to remember them.

682
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:34,672
