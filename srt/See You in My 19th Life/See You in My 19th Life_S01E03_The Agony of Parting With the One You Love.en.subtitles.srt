1
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,970
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

2
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,062
OUR BELOVED DAUGHTER, YOON JU-WON
IF I COULD MEET YOU ONE MORE TIME

3
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,316
Have you been well?

4
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,366
I'm sorry it's been so long.

5
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:11,714
THE AGONY OF PARTING WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE

6
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,436
Director Mun, just a moment.

7
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,080
Beautiful, isn't it?

8
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,127
Doesn't it feel like your worries
are just melting away?

9
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,507
When your past trauma haunts you

10
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,677
and you feel like you're sinking,

11
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,181
think of these flowers.

12
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,407
Your kind gestures are quite one-sided.

13
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,825
You say that,

14
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,912
but you look much better now.

15
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:25,788
Then isn't it fine?

16
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,251
You're such a strange person.

17
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,170
I am.

18
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,339
I may seem strange at first,

19
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,673
but I'm hard to forget.

20
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,509
You'll end up thinking of me all the time

21
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,552
and eventually…

22
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,846
fall in love with me.

23
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,432
That will not happen.

24
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,187
I see. Are pretty women not your type?

25
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,272
That's such a shame.

26
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,446
What do you like?

27
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,698
You, Director Mun.

28
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,576
I was talking about food.

29
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,620
Whatever you like.

30
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,456
Don't you have preferences?

31
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,211
Well, my preference is you.

32
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,882
But there's nothing I can do about it,

33
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,553
so please respect my preference
by letting me eat what you like.

34
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,138
Ms. Ban,

35
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,224
you're not my type.

36
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,309
What's your type then?

37
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,021
I like older women.

38
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,650
People say I'm mature for my age.

39
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,860
Could you consider my mental age?

40
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,779
What do you say?

41
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,615
When will this
meaningless conversation end?

42
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,121
Doesn't that make
a day like today much better?

43
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,666
Director Mun, it's all right.

44
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,711
It's all right.

45
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,303
Here, Director.

46
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,313
Seo-ha.

47
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,742
Ju-won?

48
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,916
Everything's all right.

49
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,008
You're okay.

50
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,499
I didn't know

51
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,795
that my death would become such a shackle

52
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,548
to the people I left behind.

53
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,929
As for me, I've already gone through
19 cycles of dying and being reborn.

54
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,901
MY 19TH LIFE

55
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,487
MY 17TH LIFE

56
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,365
DONGBAEK AERIAL GRAND CIRCUS

57
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,995
I only thought about my own pain.

58
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:47,842
Uncle!

59
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,638
I'm going to make you rice balls.

60
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,890
Wait just a bit.

61
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,281
All right, Ae-gyeong.

62
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,160
I'll play you some music.

63
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,163
So sing your heart out.

64
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,372
Yeah?

65
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,250
Here it goes, Ae-gyeong.

66
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,672
I enjoyed rolling the ball

67
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,010
I was happy when I sang

68
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,136
There you go.

69
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,140
With white makeup on and a red nose

70
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,811
I sang of love

71
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,606
-We promised
-Amazing.

72
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:48,611
Our love would never

73
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:53,866
Ever change

74
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,511
Wake up, Uncle.

75
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,389
Are you dead?

76
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,527
You little brat.

77
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,904
Not yet.

78
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:38,703
I put a lot of effort into making this,
so you can't die before you eat it.

79
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,998
They say that ghosts that died full
look nicer than others.

80
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,384
Without you,

81
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,761
I have no one.

82
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,725
So eat up and live long, all right?

83
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,520
Ae-gyeong.

84
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,066
Even if I'm gone,

85
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,652
you won't be alone.

86
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,947
I don't know how long it'll take,

87
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,535
but I promise to be born again

88
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,871
and come back…

89
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,333
to protect you.

90
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,794
Can you be brave…

91
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,048
and wait for me?

92
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,166
Ae-gyeong.

93
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,628
How did you live on?

94
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,505
How else?

95
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,424
I just did.

96
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,514
You were only about ten at the time.

97
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,185
And you had lost me
as well as your parents.

98
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:36,946
Ae-gyeong.

99
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,243
Thank you so much…

100
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,121
for living through everything.

101
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,625
I should be thanking you.

102
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,549
I'm grateful that you're in my life again.

103
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,222
I'm grateful you grew up so well.

104
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:09,478
Living a safe and ordinary life
together with you…

105
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,566
That's all I want.

106
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,028
Goodness, look how much you've grown.

107
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,116
You shouldn't say that
looking like you do.

108
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,996
There, there.

109
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,004
Come here. I'll give you a hug.

110
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,840
Come on, that's embarrassing.

111
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,717
Embarrassing?

112
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,885
Come on, give me a hug.

113
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,721
-Get in here.
-All right then.

114
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,226
My dear Ae-gyeong.

115
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,608
Goodness. What's that sound?

116
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,236
I haven't eaten all day.

117
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,531
You two didn't eat anything
for his birthday?

118
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,825
Birthday?

119
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,911
What will I do with you?

120
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,414
-What?
-It's the anniversary of Ju-won's death.

121
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,959
That means it's Seo-ha's birthday.

122
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,054
Seo-ha.

123
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,807
Do you want to go to the amusement park
with me on your birthday?

124
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,018
-Really?
-Yes, really.

125
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,853
You really have to go, okay?

126
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:33,938
Promise me.

127
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,940
I promise.

128
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,318
I can't fill the empty space
your mother left.

129
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:46,075
But I'll stay by your side
until you can stand on your own two feet.

130
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,703
I'll…

131
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,166
come back to see you.

132
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,561
This piece was composed
during the Japanese occupation period.

133
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:59,106
It's about someone yearning
for their loved one.

134
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,859
But no one knows
the identity of the composer.

135
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,863
Then how do you know this piece?

136
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,241
Because I'm the one who composed it.

137
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,536
You can't fool me anymore.

138
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,040
Learn it and play it
when you miss someone.

139
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,499
You'll feel much better.

140
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,715
Happy birthday, sir.

141
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,386
Every time I blew the candles out,

142
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,848
I remembered the moment…

143
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,060
Ju-won stopped breathing.

144
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,897
My birthdays

145
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,026
were always linked to her death.

146
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,167
Ms. Ban?

147
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:46,964
Director Mun.

148
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,634
What brings you here?

149
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,302
I forgot the most important thing.

150
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,180
There's something I need to say.

151
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,266
Ms. Ban, just what--

152
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,559
You see,

153
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,270
being confessed to on one's birthday
is a memorable event.

154
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,024
Seo-ha,

155
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,776
just remember this
on your future birthdays.

156
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,278
I like you.

157
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,699
Do you like me?

158
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,494
I'll answer that on your birthday.

159
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,084
In life, timing is key.

160
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,378
And I think the right time is today.

161
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,423
I can't let it pass me by again.

162
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,718
I like you.

163
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,520
Is Mr. Ha coming?

164
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,368
Get inside.

165
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,632
I have a guest over.

166
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,134
Well then.

167
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,152
Why is Cho-won…

168
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,831
What are you doing?

169
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,875
There were no plates.

170
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,919
Blow your candles out
before the day's over.

171
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,595
Take the gloves off and leave within five…

172
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,805
No, three minutes.

173
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,356
I really don't understand you.

174
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,774
I don't need you to.

175
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,277
I really don't get you.

176
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,445
I don't get anything about you.

177
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,741
I told you to call when you returned,
but I had to hear it from others.

178
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,493
Then you never return my calls.

179
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,954
How many times do I have to tell you?

180
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,874
-I don't celebrate--
-I know you don't celebrate your birthday.

181
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,041
I know that.

182
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,837
But can't you see that's why
I'm doing all of this for you?

183
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,008
We're different people.

184
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,677
We're going through different things.

185
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,554
I know we're different.

186
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,141
And I know that it's much harder for you

187
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,351
than it is for me.

188
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,562
But still…

189
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,233
I'm getting fed up, so please stop it.

190
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,989
I really didn't want to say this.

191
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,326
But I'm so upset.

192
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,112
You were still here?

193
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,538
What brought you to Seo-ha's house?

194
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,214
Here.

195
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,843
Why are you giving this to me?

196
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,930
It took me four hours to bake,
so I don't want it to go to waste.

197
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,515
It should be good.

198
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,852
Do you like Director Mun?

199
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,109
Why do you need to know?

200
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,988
Because I like Director Mun.

201
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,119
And what if I do too?

202
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,415
Will you give up on him?

203
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,436
What happened to you?

204
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,730
Oh, my.

205
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,193
He was with Cho-won.

206
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,070
Cho-won?

207
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,822
You mean your sister?

208
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,951
I think Cho-won has feelings for Seo-ha.

209
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:09,953
Oh, no.

210
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,414
So you and your sister…

211
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,416
That won't do.

212
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,126
You should tell her now.

213
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,212
Tell her you're her sister
and that you liked him first.

214
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,798
That's better
than fighting with your sister.

215
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,135
Telling her would just
make things chaotic.

216
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,265
This is the issue
with reincarnating too soon.

217
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,810
This is so complicated.

218
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,272
What do you mean
by reincarnating too soon?

219
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,277
It's different every time.

220
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:48,075
But it's rare to be reincarnated
right after dying like I was this time.

221
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,702
So what happened this time?

222
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,831
In this case,

223
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,335
it may mean that my life was cut short.

224
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,089
That there's a chance I was murdered.

225
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,697
Dong-u, open the door!

226
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,242
Why don't you just
break the door while you're at it?

227
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,159
Hurry up!

228
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,460
Why are you here?

229
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:45,799
You rude little punk.
Is that how you talk to your dad?

230
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:46,967
Where's your older sister?

231
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,052
What older sister? I don't have one.

232
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,346
Where's Ji-eum?

233
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,223
She's not my older sister.

234
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,683
Take your shoes off!

235
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,560
She's not older?

236
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,229
I got confused, okay?

237
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,314
How dare you raise your voice at me?

238
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,069
This is driving me nuts.

239
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,993
-Why are you here?
-Open the bag.

240
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,078
Open it.

241
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,422
I brought you fried chicken.
Stuff it in before it gets cold.

242
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,009
Make me some ramyeon,

243
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,094
and give me Ji-eum's phone number.

244
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,221
Forget it!

245
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,223
Why you little bastard!

246
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,702
Beautiful, isn't it?

247
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,249
You see,

248
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,960
being confessed to on one's birthday
is a memorable event.

249
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,587
I like you.

250
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,436
THE PEACH BLOSSOM HILL

251
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,565
YOU ARE NOWHERE AND ALWAYS THERE
POEMS BY LEE YUN-HAK

252
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:09,901
I'll be right there.

253
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,486
Yes.

254
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,571
I need to stop by the Finance Team first.

255
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,073
All right.

256
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,122
Director Mun.

257
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,217
I like you.

258
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,934
You were thinking about yesterday, right?

259
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:44,769
No.

260
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,648
Did you get home all right
with all the rain?

261
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,109
The rain had stopped by then.

262
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,738
I guess it did.

263
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,950
I was too forward yesterday.

264
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,828
It wasn't right to strike
when you were down.

265
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,457
I sincerely apologize
if you were taken aback.

266
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,628
Thank you…

267
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:13,840
for yesterday.

268
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,096
Are you thanking me for my confession?

269
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,894
Wait for me, Director.

270
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,693
Hello?

271
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,695
Just a moment, please.

272
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,490
Emily, it's for you.

273
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:48,666
Hello?

274
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,752
Is this Ms. Emily Yoon?

275
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,129
Yes, it is.

276
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,507
I'm Ha Do-yun of MI Hotel's
Strategic Planning Team.

277
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,802
I would like to discuss
contracting you for our landscaping.

278
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,095
Are you available tomorrow?

279
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,180
Yes, I am.

280
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,933
I'll text you the details.

281
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,268
-Please add extra meat to one of them.
-All right.

282
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,740
Why did you use an alias?

283
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,620
He keeps avoiding me,
but I want to get closer.

284
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,416
I know it might not work,
but it's worth a shot.

285
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,502
I felt like I should at least
do something.

286
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,550
I contacted the selected
landscaping companies

287
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,176
and set up a meeting for tomorrow.

288
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:41,886
And the Finance Team?

289
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,849
They rejected the budget proposal
for the renovation.

290
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,394
I anticipated that would happen,

291
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,604
but I didn't know Ms. Jang
would make her move this quick.

292
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,607
There's work
that needs to be done immediately.

293
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,651
Should I postpone them?

294
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,569
No need.

295
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,446
We'll get it done no matter what.

296
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,491
Eat up.

297
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,160
I asked for extra meat on yours.

298
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,077
Thanks a lot.

299
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,752
-You like it?
-It's pretty good.

300
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,839
But what's the point
of being the chairman's son?

301
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,716
You should ask for a favor.

302
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,053
I'm keeping that card close to my chest
until I have to use it.

303
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,681
It'll be a negotiation, not a favor.

304
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,183
What a show-off.

305
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,645
Doors closing.

306
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,489
Nice shot!

307
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,406
You saw that?

308
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,909
You're exercising even during lunch hours?

309
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,911
I heard you swing long drives.

310
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,497
I need to practice before facing you.

311
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,918
How was that shot?

312
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,586
Let's see.

313
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,672
Your form and driving distance are great.

314
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,841
But you do need practice.

315
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,676
All right, let's duel it out sometime.

316
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,180
Did you eat anything special
for your birthday?

317
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,224
You know I don't celebrate it.

318
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:13,186
I just wanted to do something simple
like treating you to a meal.

319
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,687
I know you live alone.

320
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,148
Well, I wasn't alone.

321
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,483
Goodness.

322
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:22,445
My wish is to see my nephew
smile on his birthday.

323
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,032
I have nothing to smile about
because of the hotel.

324
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,784
Because of the funds, right?

325
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,227
How's it going?

326
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,812
We're about to meet them.

327
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:56,855
Wait there.

328
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,648
Never mind. I can get back on my own.

329
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,149
Wait there, Director.

330
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,540
-Hello.
-Welcome, Mr. Lee.

331
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,917
-How have you been?
-Long time no see.

332
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,336
-It's been a while.
-Hello.

333
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,630
This is the nephew I mentioned.

334
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,925
He's back in the country
and is a director at MI Hotel.

335
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,511
Nice to meet you. I'm Mun Seo-ha.

336
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:29,888
It's a pleasure.

337
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,728
Hey, Do-yun.

338
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,148
What brings you here?

339
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,483
Where's Seo-ha?

340
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,489
Hey, Ji-seok.

341
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,575
Say hello before you go.

342
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,911
-I'll introduce you to my friends.
-Give it back.

343
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,621
Come on.

344
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,372
You guys know Do-yun, right?

345
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,042
-Do-yun?
-He's Seo-ha's secretary

346
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,126
and my old schoolmate.

347
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,297
-Hand it over.
-Now that I think about it,

348
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:08,009
you used to glare at me
like that at school too.

349
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,888
You said you'd become a prosecutor
and put me behind bars.

350
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,891
What does his father do?

351
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:18,269
What do you think? He's just a commoner.

352
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,439
Actually, he might have passed away early.

353
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,858
He used to be a student worker at--

354
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,449
-Seriously?
-Have another drink.

355
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,426
What?

356
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,303
Seo-ha, you were here too?

357
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,472
It's been a while.

358
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,891
It sure has. Have a seat.

359
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,644
What an expensive drink.

360
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,107
It's going to be such a waste
pouring this down the toilet.

361
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,694
Hey!

362
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,448
Are you crazy, you bastard?

363
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,534
Who are you to run your mouth?

364
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,369
What's wrong with that?

365
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,870
Everything I said is true!

366
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,000
You bastard!

367
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,671
Seo-ha.

368
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,648
If you're human,
at least pretend to be one.

369
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,233
It's not right

370
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,861
to mock someone's parents.

371
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,368
Do-yun.

372
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,371
Hey, Do-yun.

373
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,499
Are you ignoring me?

374
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:04,959
Do-yun!

375
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,007
Mr. Ha.

376
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,136
Are you mad at me?

377
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,851
I told you not to act up like that.

378
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,937
Come on.

379
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,027
What about the funds?

380
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,112
It looks promising.

381
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,866
I met with someone from Hanguk Bank
and the head of an investment firm.

382
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,410
Well…

383
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,412
You did great then.

384
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,999
Have you eaten?

385
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,876
Never mind. I'm going to eat at home.

386
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,336
Let's eat together.

387
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,046
I had no appetite all day
because of the meeting.

388
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,589
Do-jin's waiting for me.

389
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,800
He can join us then. Let's go.

390
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,944
Thank you.

391
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,565
Yes. Then finish it like that, please.

392
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,944
Not at all. We should be thanking you.

393
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,738
Yes, goodbye.

394
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,119
You're here early.

395
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,290
Were you the one
who changed the flowers in the lobby?

396
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,792
No, they were there when I got here.

397
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,256
These flowers are hard to find.

398
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,176
What kind are they?

399
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,179
They're called gladiolus.

400
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,932
Someone I loved really liked them.

401
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,434
There's another person that you loved?

402
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,030
Ms. Yoon, what are you doing here?

403
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:23,991
Hello.

404
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,994
I'm Emily Yoon, and I'm here to discuss
the landscaping contract.

405
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,291
Excuse me.

406
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,293
Mr. Ha, a moment.

407
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:37,964
Yes, sir.

408
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,725
You didn't even think to check?

409
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,936
I told you that it's difficult
for me to see her.

410
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,980
It's just that her name was written as…

411
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,483
I asked you to handle this
because I couldn't.

412
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,111
Cho-won's still…

413
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:04,991
I'm sorry.

414
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,708
Please excuse me.

415
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,954
Ms. Yoon.

416
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,046
Don't worry about me.

417
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,256
I'm tougher than I look.

418
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,217
Let me help you carry that.

419
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,552
It's all right.

420
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,306
I should've thought this through.

421
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,267
I just hoped

422
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,312
I could help those two

423
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,565
bring this hotel back to life.

424
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,609
That's all.

425
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,321
Could you tell them that?

426
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,826
Cho-won…

427
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,040
I know I shouldn't do this.

428
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:37,833
Ms. Yoon.

429
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,383
Are you free for dinner?

430
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,135
Why?

431
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,347
But I was sure of one thing.

432
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,684
My heart was yearning

433
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,187
to see her again.

434
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,778
-I'm going to get you!
-No!

435
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,781
I got you!

436
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,783
What's this?

437
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,078
Its head is facing the back.

438
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,579
Here.

439
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,125
What are you doing?

440
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,627
I made a peanut.

441
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,757
Ju-won.

442
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,684
If Seo-ha and I were drowning,

443
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,060
who would you save?

444
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,855
Who would you save first?

445
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,455
You're good at swimming.

446
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,833
Well, Seo-ha's also very good at swimming.

447
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,754
But he doesn't have a mom
and I feel bad for him.

448
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,551
I guess I'm drowning then.

449
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,927
Oh, no.

450
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,608
Do you also do that?

451
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,651
You tell yourself you'll stop tomorrow,

452
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,778
but your feelings come back
once you see them.

453
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,698
Yes, I do.

454
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,117
When others say he's too cold,

455
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,661
I think of his warm smile
that only I've seen,

456
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,413
then I feel proud, you know?

457
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:40,873
Right.

458
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,459
And I know he's actually very clumsy

459
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,044
and easily frightened.

460
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:45,961
Right?

461
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,506
He might seem meticulous,
but he's actually full of holes.

462
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:54,762
What part of that person
did you like so much?

463
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:57,973
I don't know.

464
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,686
When you like someone,
don't you like everything about them?

465
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,607
That's true.

466
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,030
Do you believe in love at first sight?

467
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,907
I didn't believe it at first.

468
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,701
But then it actually happened to me.

469
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,706
That feeling of being
intensely captivated at first sight…

470
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,210
Was their first encounter that intense?

471
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,633
Hi, Seo-ha.

472
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,427
Hi.

473
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:41,433
People badmouth him
and say he looks down on others.

474
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,351
But I know.

475
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,063
He's not looking down on others.

476
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,233
He just doesn't even have
the energy to spend on that.

477
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,570
That's true.

478
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,287
He may seem aloof,

479
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,873
but he meticulously keeps records
in his housekeeping book.

480
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,835
He also loves to take care of his brother,

481
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,295
so cooking is his hobby.

482
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,422
A brother?

483
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,882
Did you know he's great at driving?

484
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,010
Driving?

485
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,806
HOUSEKEEPING BOOK

486
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,104
Wait a minute.

487
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:32,318
Have you been talking about Mr. Ha?

488
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,529
That's right.

489
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,658
He may act cold,

490
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,745
but I know how warm he really is.

491
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,164
He has a certain look that only I know.

492
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,085
Even a certain gaze
and a certain voice that only I know.

493
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,005
So the person you like

494
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,549
is Mr. Ha?

495
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:57,718
Yes.

496
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,891
Were you going to give up
if I said I liked Seo-ha?

497
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:08,979
No, but I would've felt so uneasy.

498
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,691
I really liked him.

499
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,072
When they both left to study abroad,
I couldn't see him for so long.

500
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,949
But once I saw him again,
I remembered our past.

501
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,493
Then I kept thinking about him.

502
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,373
You must really like Mr. Ha.

503
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,916
I guess I still do.

504
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,379
What a thrilling time for you two.

505
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,049
Thrilling? I'm having so much trouble.

506
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,807
Speaking of,
it must really be tough for you.

507
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,767
Why?

508
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,315
There's one burden
that Seo-ha can't overcome.

509
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,570
She's Seo-ha's first love and your rival.

510
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,032
Yoon Ju-won.

511
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,091
How many times do I have to tell you?

512
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,511
-I don't celebrate--
-I know you don't celebrate your birthday.

513
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,595
I know that.

514
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,391
But can't you see that's why
I'm doing all of this for you?

515
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,727
We're different people.

516
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,855
We're going through different things.

517
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,917
-Yeah?
-What are you up to?

518
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,044
Not much.

519
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,838
-Okay.
-Why?

520
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,467
I was hoping to see you.

521
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,760
We just clocked off, Director.

522
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,555
You're right.

523
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,268
If you're unsure, just do it.

524
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:12,936
Do what?

525
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,732
You're worried about Ms. Yoon
after what you did earlier.

526
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,152
Well, that too.

527
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,118
Rest up then.

528
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,036
Okay.

529
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,499
-Do-jin, come take this.
-Okay.

530
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,599
Starting next year,
let's just visit the columbarium.

531
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,477
Why all of a sudden?

532
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,188
It would be good
to get some fresh air together.

533
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,200
Come on, let's go out.

534
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,662
Let's go out and play.

535
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:23,757
Ju-won.

536
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,427
CONDOLENCES FROM MI GROUP STAFF
AND PRESIDENT MUN JEONG-HUN

537
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,681
Ju-won.

538
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,019
Ju-won.

539
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,983
Ju-won.

540
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,201
Ju-won.

541
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:00,919
Hey.

542
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,507
Let me ask you a favor.

543
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,719
-What?
-Once school's out,

544
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:12,264
a girl in a Yeonju Middle School uniform
will be at the gate.

545
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,019
Could you give this to her?

546
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,105
Her name's Yoon Cho-won.

547
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,190
Why should I do this for you?

548
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,696
She's going to feel bad
if it rains as she waits.

549
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,325
If you care so much,
just give it to her yourself.

550
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,206
Do you even know my name?

551
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,085
What about you?

552
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:43,837
Do you know mine?

553
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,755
I do.

554
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,214
You're Mun Seo-ha.

555
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:47,883
I know yours too.

556
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,468
You're Ha Do-yun.

557
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,747
Take this.

558
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,134
Excuse me.

559
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:39,601
I think

560
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,145
I fell for you at first sight.

561
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:55,784
This is my sister.

562
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,496
Isn't she so pretty?

563
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,207
According to my mom,

564
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:06,044
she was not only pretty
but was also good at everything.

565
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,425
She was…

566
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,846
someone who was loved by everyone.

567
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,184
Someone who knew everything.

568
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:27,023
She taught me to eat well

569
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,317
and to be courageous.

570
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,364
When she was gone,

571
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,619
the world became silent.

572
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,126
In life, timing is key.

573
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,545
And I think the right time is today.

574
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,464
I can't let it pass me by again.

575
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,708
Watch your head.

576
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,251
There you go.

577
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,128
Thank you.

578
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,255
-Careful.
-Thank you.

579
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,550
Sit here first.

580
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,761
-Where?
-Right here.

581
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:44,721
Be careful.

582
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,014
Wait here.

583
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:56,942
Who is it?

584
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,531
Are you all right, Ms. Yoon?

585
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,994
Goodness.
You can't even hold much alcohol.

586
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,292
Is someone there?

587
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,172
Hey, where are you going?

588
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:21,466
Cho-won.

589
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,887
Why are you so drunk?

590
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,973
Gosh.

591
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,557
Are you an octopus or something?

592
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:30,725
Stand up straight.

593
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,728
Cho-won, get yourself together.

594
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,147
That hurts.

595
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,732
That's the point.

596
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,568
Why didn't you go to your place?

597
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,613
Mom, you're so pretty.

598
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,157
What kind of guy did you drink with?

599
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,702
It wasn't a guy. I drank with a girl.

600
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,455
If you were going to drink this much,
you should've drunk with a guy.

601
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,207
Are you not going to get married?

602
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,584
Ms. Cho Yu-seon.

603
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:58,753
You haven't changed.

604
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,132
I can walk on my own.

605
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:14,769
Excuse me.

606
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,940
What are you doing here?

607
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,443
-I…
-Did you

608
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,987
help Cho-won get home?

609
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,990
No, I was just passing by.

610
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,283
I'm sorry.

611
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:30,994
Just a moment.

612
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,080
Didn't you stand here before too?

613
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,046
"Ms. Cho Yu-seon. You haven't changed."

614
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,591
Didn't you just say that?

615
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,270
Are you…

616
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,024
Are you…

617
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,944
my Ju-won?

618
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,116
You're Ju-won, aren't you?

619
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,293
You told me that even if you died,

620
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,631
you would come back to see me.

621
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:29,052
That I shouldn't be sad
and should just keep living my life.

622
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,554
Because you said that,

623
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,642
I've been waiting for you all this time.

624
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,356
Ju-won.

625
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,442
Ju-won.

626
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:46,861
Mom.

627
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:48,947
Ju-won.

628
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,950
-Mom.
-Ju-won.

629
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,993
Mom.

630
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,582
-Ju-won.
-Mom.

631
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,002
Mom.

632
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,048
Ju-won.

633
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,149
Mom.

634
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,615
Mom.

635
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,789
Mom.

636
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,260
Mom.

637
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,137
Mom.

638
00:57:59,058 --> 00:57:59,893
Excuse me.

639
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,313
Ms. Ban.

640
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,407
Seo-ha.

641
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,037
Seo-ha.

642
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,466
When you feel like counting leaves again,

643
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,426
just call me.

644
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,679
Why?

645
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,807
I'll come right over and give you a hug.

646
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,893
Why?

647
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:45,438
I just want to stay by your side.

648
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:51,486
Ju-won?

649
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:26,396
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

650
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,398
Get a hold of yourself.

651
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,066
Why don't you try dating me?

652
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,151
-I like you.
-I feel like she's with me

653
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,736
whether or not she's actually here.

654
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,071
I'm going to be with him

655
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,574
as Ban Ji-eum, not as Yoon Ju-won.

656
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,742
What are you doing?

657
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,452
Let go!

658
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,662
How about a drinking lover?

659
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,664
Not a buddy, but a lover.

660
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,874
Mr. Ha, are you seeing anyone?

661
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,710
Go on a blind date with me.

662
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:51,254
What do you mean by "going astray"?

663
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,630
Becoming a fan.

664
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,299
I must be going insane.

665
00:59:55,341 --> 01:00:00,346
