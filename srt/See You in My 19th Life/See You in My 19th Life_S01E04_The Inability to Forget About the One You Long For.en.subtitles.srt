1
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,970
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

2
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:04,814
MY 3RD LIFE

3
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,079
Hae-wol.

4
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,709
The first time I remembered my past life,

5
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:29,005
I didn't know what to make of it.

6
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,593
-Hae-wol.
-Mommy.

7
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,512
It's okay, that's it. There we go.

8
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,429
Mommy.

9
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,994
Mom!

10
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,664
I didn't know if they were real or not.

11
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,040
Mom!

12
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,961
And those memories frightened me
but also made me sad for some reason.

13
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,175
But I was sure of one thing.

14
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,971
My heart was yearning to see her again.

15
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,120
Mom!

16
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,083
MY 3RD LIFE

17
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,879
MY 18TH LIFE

18
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,964
Ju-won.

19
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,300
Ju-won.

20
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,636
What are you doing out here this late?

21
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,685
When will you stop?

22
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,103
Stop what?

23
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,441
Why have you been
acting strangely these days?

24
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,276
My head is throbbing.

25
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,195
Ju-won, please.

26
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,615
Please.

27
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,702
-Mom.
-Yes?

28
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,705
There's something about me that you…

29
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,667
Never mind.

30
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,254
Tell me.

31
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,341
Ju-won,

32
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,134
you've been acting strangely

33
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,054
ever since we visited
the seaside vacation house last year.

34
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,474
You talk to yourself all day.

35
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,894
You beg for your life in your sleep.

36
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,189
You keep begging not to be reborn again.

37
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:56,069
I need to know
if something's wrong or if you're ill.

38
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,487
Mom.

39
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,495
Mom!

40
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,958
Mom!

41
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,127
Who are you? Is anyone there?

42
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,213
Mom. It's me, Hae-wol.

43
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,967
What are you doing?
Get off me this instant!

44
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,303
Mom!

45
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,138
-Come here!
-Mom!

46
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,850
Mom! It's me, Hae-wol!

47
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,435
Mom!

48
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,771
-I'm Hae-wol!
-Come here!

49
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,314
Mom!

50
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,566
-Mom! I'm Hae-wol!
-Get out of here!

51
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,455
I'm scared.

52
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:54,085
Will she be able to accept me?

53
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,265
Okay.

54
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,935
You are

55
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,521
my beautiful,

56
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,441
smart,

57
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,028
and lovely daughter, Ju-won.

58
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,031
I love you…

59
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,868
so very much.

60
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,077
Okay?

61
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,293
I've never had a mom like you.

62
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,964
I'll make a promise.

63
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,179
I'll remember you in my next life.

64
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,390
Even if I die,

65
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,561
I'll come back to see you in my next life.

66
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,314
So don't be too sad.

67
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,693
And just keep living your life.

68
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,197
Okay?

69
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,201
Ju-won, it's okay.

70
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,036
All right.

71
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,421
Mom.

72
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:30,056
THE INABILITY TO FORGET ABOUT
THE ONE YOU LONG FOR

73
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,350
Mom.

74
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,685
Excuse me.

75
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,022
-Mom.
-Ms. Ban.

76
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,444
Seo-ha.

77
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,910
Ju-won?

78
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,963
Director Mun.

79
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,341
It's me, Ban Ji-eum.

80
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,303
Right.

81
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,305
I know.

82
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,015
Director Mun.

83
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,811
And this Ban Ji-eum

84
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,439
really likes you.

85
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,609
I like you.

86
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:29,740
Let's go.

87
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,684
You have soft hands.

88
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,773
We were just in a rush.

89
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,442
That's the only reason why
I held your hand.

90
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,861
Even if that was the case,

91
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,280
I'll remember this for a long time.

92
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,035
Why were you acting like that back there?

93
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,332
Ms. Yoon was very drunk,
so I dropped her off at her place.

94
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,502
Then I saw her mother.

95
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,672
I was reminded of my mom
who left me when I was little.

96
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:31,928
I'm sorry.

97
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,973
Why are you sorry about
my mom running away?

98
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,394
Where did she go?

99
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,439
I guess wherever she wanted to.

100
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,192
I was too busy
making ends meet to feel sad.

101
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,696
Family members don't always have to
live under the same roof.

102
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,365
We have our own lives to live.

103
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:57,203
At times, an enemy from your past life
becomes your family in the present.

104
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,831
In that case,
it's best to just cut ties with them.

105
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,501
That's so heartless.

106
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,712
It's not heartless.

107
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,631
It's serious.

108
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,383
Life is serious.

109
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,641
It feels like I'm reading a book
when I'm chatting with you.

110
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,060
An ancient book.

111
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,105
Is that a good thing?

112
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,569
I'm just saying that's how I feel.

113
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,823
It's neither good nor bad, so…

114
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,539
Were you going to visit Ms. Yoon?

115
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:42,957
Perhaps.

116
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,089
She grows flowers for a living.

117
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:55,177
It's her job to plant small seeds
and wait patiently

118
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,097
for them to bud out and finally bloom.

119
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,851
I'm sure she'll wait for you,
so don't try so hard.

120
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,814
When did you see me try so hard?

121
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,359
That's something I can feel, not see.

122
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,448
Care to go for a second round?

123
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,130
Did you mean to get ramyeon
when you said "second round"?

124
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,758
Convenience stores and ramyeon
go hand in hand.

125
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,178
I normally have a bottle of soju too,
but I'm holding back because of you.

126
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,638
You should treat me sometime.

127
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,890
Will one bottle do?

128
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,685
Two?

129
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,146
Three?

130
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,607
What's gotten into you?
You're curious about me.

131
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,943
How much can you actually drink?

132
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,446
You'd be shocked.

133
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,865
I tried almost
every single drink out there.

134
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,161
Sure. Of course you did.

135
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,540
You smile a lot in front of me these days.

136
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,672
You look cuter when you're flustered.

137
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,799
I mean…

138
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:18,928
Why are you so interested in me smiling?

139
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,055
Because that's why I was reborn this time.

140
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,770
This isn't my first go at life.

141
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,111
"Because that's why
I was reborn this time."

142
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,405
Did I go too far?

143
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,034
Jeez, I tend to go overboard at times.

144
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,330
You're really funny.

145
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,332
I thought you said I was weird.

146
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,544
Yes, you are weird.

147
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,425
And you're fun too.

148
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,390
Director Mun.

149
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,478
From now on,
let me know when you think of me.

150
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,063
Why?

151
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,773
So I can congratulate you.

152
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,444
-Congratulate me?
-I pop up in your head

153
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,070
and make you smile.

154
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,157
Judging by your symptoms,

155
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,285
you've become a fan of mine.

156
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,163
That's not true.

157
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,331
That's usually how it is.

158
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,668
You're not aware of it at first,
but you later realize that you're a fan.

159
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,469
See? Your heart is racing.

160
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,137
You're obviously a fan of mine.

161
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:29,058
You can't be so forward
and corner me like that.

162
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,854
Hey, don't look at me with that face.

163
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,315
You got the wrong person.

164
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,608
I'm no one's fan.

165
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,237
We call that "the denial period."

166
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,030
No.

167
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,074
You're wrong.

168
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,080
I'm telling you.

169
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,210
Taxi!

170
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,340
Get in first. You're going home, right?

171
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,222
He'll sit in the front.
Please drive safely.

172
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,432
Get home safe, Director.

173
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,977
You too.

174
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,931
Why don't you try dating me?

175
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,184
In life, timing is key.

176
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,061
I like you.

177
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,773
You see, being confessed to
on one's birthday is a memorable event.

178
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,859
Would you like to date me?

179
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:06,780
I like you.

180
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,742
Get a hold of yourself.

181
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,786
She just blindsided you.

182
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,122
You've been brainwashed.

183
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,332
Sorry?

184
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,001
It's nothing.

185
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,253
Let's go.

186
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,511
Brainwashing must be timeless.

187
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,670
Do-jin.

188
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,423
Seo-ha.

189
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,133
Hey, Seo-ha.

190
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,011
How have you been?

191
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,595
I've been good.

192
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,098
Look at you all grown up.

193
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,310
-Let's go upstairs.
-Okay.

194
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,603
-I'll carry those.
-Thanks.

195
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,606
-Were you exercising here?
-I always do it here.

196
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,819
Hey, Seo-ha is here.

197
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,655
You didn't have to bring anything.

198
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,865
Late dinner?

199
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,119
For our dad's memorial service.

200
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,580
You should've told me.

201
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,166
I'd love to say hello to him.

202
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,836
Director Mun, memorial services
are family only.

203
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,379
Well aren't you a peach?

204
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,548
Yeah. How nice.

205
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,800
You're like family to us, right?

206
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,386
-Of course.
-I started working out because of you.

207
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,139
I was impressed
by how you fought off seven guys.

208
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,057
Remember?

209
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,808
That's stretching it.

210
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,769
-I heard you're competing.
-Yes.

211
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,855
I'll be on the national team if I win,
or serve in the military if I lose.

212
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,690
I have no choice.

213
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,194
Just do as you prepared.
Let me know if I can help you.

214
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,488
You're the best.

215
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,323
I know you've got my back.

216
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,078
Go home whenever you want.

217
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,121
Don't be ridiculous.

218
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,040
I'm sleeping over.

219
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,001
He keeps declining
my offer to live together.

220
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,753
I should go shower.

221
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,338
I'm going to shower.

222
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,634
Why is he sleeping over?

223
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,053
You called him, didn't you?

224
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:17,930
No, I didn't.

225
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,934
Why are you using a spoon?

226
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,727
It tastes better this way.

227
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,857
Hey, what's going on?

228
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,734
You said you'd come early and help out.

229
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,860
Early, my foot.

230
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,529
I know.

231
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,155
Unbelievable.

232
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,450
You had a long day.

233
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,704
It's tough.

234
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,792
I understand.

235
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,044
It's tough for me too.

236
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,880
I saw my mom today.

237
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,926
The one who ran away?

238
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,428
No, not my current mom.

239
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,764
Yoon Ju-won's mom.

240
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,476
Should I fry some chicken?

241
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,812
No, thanks.

242
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,899
I'm not that sad about it.

243
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,110
No. I'm fine.

244
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,280
Don't lie. You're obviously not okay.

245
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,282
Let's have a drink.

246
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,368
Gladly.

247
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,289
I didn't want to drink alone either.

248
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,629
How did you see her?

249
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,968
Since I ran into Cho-won
while being around Seo-ha,

250
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,887
I keep getting involved with them.

251
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,181
You saw this coming.

252
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,517
Right.

253
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:50,355
Seo-ha needs someone
who can help him forget Ju-won.

254
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,900
It's good for his sake as well.

255
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,444
I'm going to be with him

256
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,530
as Ban Ji-eum, not as Yoon Ju-won.

257
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,408
What if he finds out?

258
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,621
You're bringing bad luck. Take that back.

259
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,498
Be honest with me.

260
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,876
You're scared, right?

261
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,921
Aren't you scared of what he'll say

262
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,925
once you tell him the truth?

263
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,308
Do you know where Cho-won's garden is?

264
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,560
Why do you ask?

265
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:30,979
We need her.

266
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,814
She's talented.

267
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,900
You're saying that now?

268
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,443
I know.

269
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,905
I was being too emotional.

270
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,076
As her sister,
it must've been harder for her.

271
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,662
Do you know you've changed?

272
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,414
I did?

273
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,083
A bit.

274
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,501
Actually,

275
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,754
a bit more than that.

276
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,008
Korea is very different from Germany.

277
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,303
It's hectic and strange.

278
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,430
What's hectic must be the hotel work.

279
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,770
Then is it Ms. Ban who's strange?

280
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,231
Do you have to nitpick at everything?

281
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,444
Life would've been easier
if you were half as laid-back as Do-jin.

282
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,114
Anyway, it's true
that she's a bit strange.

283
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,491
But she seems to do you good.

284
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,536
You used to be depressed
whenever you came to Korea

285
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,912
but not anymore.

286
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,164
I'm just thankful for that.

287
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,000
You're right.

288
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,586
She was strange from the beginning.

289
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,632
I'm fascinated whenever we're together.

290
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:47,556
So if you ever see me going astray,

291
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,640
stop me.

292
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,020
What do you mean by "going astray"?

293
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,524
Becoming a fan.

294
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,152
Becoming a what?

295
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,239
I must be going insane.

296
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,166
You startled me!

297
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,585
You told me to stop you.

298
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,003
Good night.

299
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,340
"Becoming a fan"?

300
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,814
Because that's why I was reborn this time.

301
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,071
This isn't my first go at life.

302
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,378
What brings you here?

303
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,798
You didn't tell her?

304
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,594
I did call you earlier.

305
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,639
We came to confirm your portfolio
regarding the landscaping contract.

306
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,934
So that's what the call was about.

307
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,770
I was still hungover when we spoke.

308
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,574
You're here early.

309
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,952
Ms. Yoon, you have a beautiful garden.

310
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,454
What's going on?

311
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,290
I'm here on Ms. Ko's behalf.

312
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,125
I'm glad you're here.

313
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,627
Feel free to look around.

314
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,878
I'll prepare some tea.

315
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,217
This is so pretty.

316
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,762
You have a huge variety of flowers.

317
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,555
Right? It's even prettier over there.

318
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,308
How beautiful.

319
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,853
It's really pretty
around this time of the year.

320
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,188
-It really is pretty.
-Oh, my.

321
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,789
I can't believe I have a headache
on such a good day.

322
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,459
Ms. Yoon, are you okay?

323
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,338
I'm sorry. I drank too much yesterday.

324
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,799
It's okay. It's because you mixed drinks.

325
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,260
I talked too much, didn't I?

326
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,304
I can't remember because I was also drunk,
so don't worry.

327
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,931
Have a seat. I'll do it.

328
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,558
Gosh, how pretty.

329
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,686
So these are flower teas.

330
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,496
Be careful.

331
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,165
You can't even hold much alcohol.

332
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,967
Did I…

333
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,972
perhaps ask you to drop me off
at my parents' place?

334
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:43,810
Yes.

335
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,565
I never go there no matter how drunk I am.

336
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:49,899
Why did I do that?

337
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:54,362
I guess talking about the past
made you want to go there.

338
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:00,744
If you don't mind,
could I ask you how old you are?

339
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,788
Why do you want to know?

340
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,291
It's odd.

341
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,501
We just met,

342
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:12,881
but it strangely feels like
we've known each other for a long time.

343
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,592
Have we…

344
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,846
met before?

345
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,392
I almost said,

346
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:29,189
"Yes, I was your sister."

347
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,693
Oh, no!

348
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,035
I'm sorry, Ms. Yoon.

349
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,870
It's okay.

350
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,246
Watch out.

351
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,707
What happened?

352
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,543
My hand slipped.

353
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,004
You should've been more careful.

354
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,591
My, my.

355
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,760
How kind of you.

356
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,971
I agree.

357
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,268
I'll prepare some new tea.

358
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,186
It's okay.

359
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,522
I'll just cut to the chase.

360
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,316
I'll leave MI Hotel's landscaping

361
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,194
to you, Ms. Yoon.

362
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,195
Please take good care of it.

363
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,364
Are you serious?

364
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,575
-Seriously?
-Yes.

365
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,244
They're serious!

366
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,542
Excuse me. Sorry about this.

367
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,463
Mr. Ha, please have a seat.

368
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,756
I'll bring some more tea.

369
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,176
-I still need to look around--
-Come on.

370
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,470
-What?
-Sit and have a cup.

371
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,181
But I didn't… Hey.

372
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,850
All right. Sit down.

373
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,479
Then I'll bring them directly to Daehwan.

374
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,899
I'll be there soon. All right.

375
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,543
Director Mun.

376
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,553
Do you know how anxious I become
when you call me like that?

377
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:27,474
Director Mun.

378
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,143
This is what I'll do.

379
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,271
I'll ask you out

380
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,607
three times

381
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,026
from today on.

382
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,113
If you say no every time,

383
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,325
I'll give you up then and there.

384
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,919
Why don't you just ask me
three times right now?

385
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,797
I can decline right away.

386
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,882
Give me a chance.

387
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,887
I'm confident

388
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,849
that you won't decline me all three times.

389
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,073
What's going on with them?

390
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,450
I'm not sure.

391
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:32,956
Mr. Ha.

392
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,917
Are you seeing anyone?

393
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,673
Are you interested in a blind date?

394
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,925
Sorry?

395
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,723
Go on a blind date with me.

396
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,700
I'll decline.

397
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,788
Why?

398
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,916
Why don't you like me?

399
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,168
Is it my personality?

400
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,336
Or my face?

401
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,090
Or is it because Seo-ha
is uncomfortable around me?

402
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,676
-If that's not it…
-Ms. Yoon.

403
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:31,431
I don't care about
your personality or appearance.

404
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,310
I'm just looking for someone
who's right for me.

405
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,312
Please elaborate.

406
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,938
I'll do my best to be that person.

407
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,524
That arrogant thought
that you can do something about it

408
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,609
is why we won't work.

409
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,613
I hope to see you next time
as business partners.

410
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,801
I just arrived.

411
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,804
Yes, I brought everything.

412
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,556
All right.

413
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,729
Who is this?

414
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,316
-This is Ban Ji-eum of MI Hotel's--
-It's me. Dong-u.

415
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,651
I have no time to explain.

416
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,195
Just wire me some money. I promise to--

417
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,740
How did he get my number?

418
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:56,891
Bro!

419
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,148
How have you been?
You're a bit late for work.

420
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,526
I believe you were blacklisted.

421
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,195
I'm just visiting my mom.

422
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,239
Don't be so heartless.

423
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,825
She told me to get along with you.

424
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,912
Let's grab a drink sometime.

425
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,584
Hey, let me go.

426
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,670
Hey.

427
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,338
Hey!

428
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,718
You'll pay for this!

429
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,138
Gosh, that was embarrassing.

430
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,735
What brings you to my office?

431
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,987
Would you like some tea?

432
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,156
You have an interesting son.

433
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,533
He called me "bro."

434
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,078
I find it more interesting that you'd come

435
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,080
all the way here to tell me that.

436
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,292
Security escorted him outside.

437
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,255
You can see him at home.

438
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,506
Hey, Mun Seo-ha.

439
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,383
Do you think…

440
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,261
I don't know anything?

441
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,978
I wonder what you know…

442
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,898
and how much

443
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,650
you know about it.

444
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,571
I'm curious.

445
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:43,831
Director Mun.

446
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,502
Why were you in there?

447
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,339
I need the hotel's budget documents
for the past three years.

448
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,341
What for?

449
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,095
I was going to take my time
and focus on the renovation first.

450
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,346
But she keeps pushing me.

451
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,391
I understand, but are you going to
check all of that one by one?

452
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,393
Yes.

453
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,601
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS

454
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,647
WRITTEN YEAR: 1996
WRITTEN YEAR: 2020

455
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:53,985
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS

456
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,823
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME STATEMENT

457
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,298
Hey, put them here.

458
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,260
This is how much I got on my first sweep.

459
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,513
I wonder what she'll do
when I confront her.

460
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,557
Let's look through them.

461
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,687
-Aren't you clocking out, sir?
-No.

462
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,400
Did everyone leave already?

463
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,027
Ms. Ko already left.

464
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,279
Mr. Heo and Ms. Ban
have work out of the office.

465
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,699
Shall we have dinner?

466
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,244
I'll have to go
since I have a prior engagement, sir.

467
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,412
With whom?

468
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,206
The chairman?

469
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,334
I'm off.

470
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,336
Call me if you need anything.

471
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,834
I'm famished.

472
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,544
-Tteokbokki? What do you say?
-Wait for me.

473
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,921
-I'm so down!
-Yeah!

474
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,881
-I'm down!
-No, thanks. I have to go somewhere.

475
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,842
Han-na, you've been acting
strange these days.

476
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,511
A new boyfriend?

477
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,305
Not a new boyfriend.

478
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,975
But I do have my eyes on someone.

479
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,104
Actually, some people.

480
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,439
-Seriously?
-Seriously?

481
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,655
Did she clock out already?

482
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,948
That's usually how it is.

483
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,117
You're not aware of it at first,
but you later realize that you're a fan.

484
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,368
I like you.

485
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,540
I feel like she's with me
whether or not she's actually here.

486
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,625
This is driving me nuts.

487
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,223
Hey.

488
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,183
Hey, I just want to talk.

489
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,147
Ms. Ban?

490
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,610
What is she doing?

491
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,739
I just want to talk!

492
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,616
Stop right there! Come on!

493
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,203
Hey, just stop for a minute!

494
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,913
You're dead meat if I catch you!

495
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,292
Oh, excuse me.

496
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:57,918
Hey!

497
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,339
Let me go.

498
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,882
I said you'd be dead meat.

499
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,018
This isn't my first rodeo.

500
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,020
Okay, just let me go.

501
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,521
-No.
-One,

502
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:18,981
two…

503
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,738
Jeez, you and your temper.

504
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,323
What did I tell you?

505
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,909
I told you we were done
and to never look for me again.

506
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,787
Are you serious?
Aren't you worried about us?

507
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,206
Not one bit.

508
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,000
You were elated
when I gave you money and said goodbye.

509
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:43,130
I hope you learn from your mistakes.

510
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,132
Ban Ji-eum.

511
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,051
Hey, I'm not done talking.

512
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,511
Why do you keep walking away?

513
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,222
What are you doing?

514
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,973
And who are you? Let go.

515
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,267
Let go!

516
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,022
How dare you?

517
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:03,984
Director, are you okay?

518
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,736
Blood?

519
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,572
You dare to make him bleed?

520
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,032
It was a mistake.

521
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,742
Stay right there.

522
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,536
-Wait.
-Ms. Ban.

523
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,578
Hey!

524
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,372
I'll come back for you

525
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,165
if you don't send the money.

526
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,418
Damn it!

527
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,466
Are you okay?

528
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,680
I'm sorry.

529
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,723
Who was he?

530
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,142
We share the same parents

531
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,811
and are legally
in the same family registry.

532
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,148
What's with that grand reply?
So he's your brother.

533
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,318
I didn't want to word it like that.

534
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,657
Reality is hitting me hard right now.

535
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,326
I guess it now seems like
I approached you for your money.

536
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,123
Money-grubbers usually grovel to you.

537
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,918
They don't mess with you like you do.

538
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,212
Still,

539
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,340
it's upsetting.

540
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,512
If you're free,

541
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,181
why don't we go there?

542
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:22,521
PYEONGDONG HAGFISH

543
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:26,901
Let's go.

544
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,947
They say the golden ratio
for beer and soju is seven to three.

545
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,326
But I believe it depends on your mood.

546
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,537
My golden ratio for today is five to five.

547
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,956
-What about you?
-Seven to three.

548
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:42,833
All right.

549
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,297
Bottoms up.

550
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,299
Cheers.

551
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,307
That's nice.

552
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,647
Why aren't you asking me about earlier?

553
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,483
You said he's your brother.

554
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,818
It's normal to argue with your family.

555
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:11,946
You're right.

556
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,365
Every family has a story.

557
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,284
We all fight like cats and dogs.

558
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,744
That's how it is.

559
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,752
What?

560
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,463
I'm listening to you.

561
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,092
I'm all ears.

562
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,010
I'll be your drinking buddy tonight.

563
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,557
Look at you.
You know how to listen and all.

564
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,475
Ms. Ban--

565
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,893
How about a drinking lover?

566
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,062
Not a buddy, but a lover.

567
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,357
You really are relentless.

568
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,612
You just asked me out, didn't you?

569
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,073
No, I didn't. I didn't phrase it that way.

570
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,992
No, that was the nuance of it.

571
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,328
That wasn't my intention.

572
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,331
You're only doing what you want.

573
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,792
-Will you say yes then?
-No.

574
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,919
See? I knew you'd decline.

575
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,547
I never fight a losing battle.

576
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,184
Did you know that soju
originated from the Arab drink, arak?

577
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:27,938
MY 4TH LIFE

578
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,250
What is this?

579
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,464
To your health.

580
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,934
-Cheers.
-To your health.

581
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,067
To your health.

582
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,638
Thank you for being
my drinking buddy tonight.

583
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:22,761
Oh, no!

584
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,643
Director, let's sit down here for a bit.

585
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,688
Let's sit for a bit.

586
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,362
Oh, my.

587
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,576
You weren't sitting down,

588
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,912
so I thought you needed
something to sit on.

589
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,050
What was on your mind?

590
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,177
What's on your mind?

591
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,434
What is it?

592
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,606
This is the problem.

593
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,694
Why does she

594
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,281
remind me of Ju-won?

595
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,287
There's no resemblance at all.

596
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,915
They look so different.

597
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,501
-So why?
-Director Mun?

598
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,383
You shouldn't pull my face
so close to yours.

599
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,887
I could just kiss you.

600
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,016
What's stopping you?

601
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,229
Shall we kiss?

602
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:43,277
I'll hold myself back
and spare you the regret tomorrow.

603
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,535
You're too drunk right now.

604
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,372
Tell me the same thing
next time when you're sober.

605
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,293
Hold on.

606
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,588
Are you not drunk at all?

607
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,673
It's strange.

608
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,718
I rarely get drunk
no matter what body I'm in.

609
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,304
What do you mean?

610
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,100
Do you have other bodies?

611
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,396
Something like that.

612
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,185
I was in a serious car accident
when I was little.

613
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,523
A girl I liked…

614
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,028
died while protecting me.

615
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,449
It took a while

616
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,203
before they got me out of the car.

617
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,374
And I could feel…

618
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,880
her body…

619
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,008
slowly getting colder.

620
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,058
Ever since then, it was difficult for me

621
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,144
to physically touch anyone.

622
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,736
Shoulders are for people to lean on.

623
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,548
I apologize, sir.

624
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,343
I didn't say it wrong.

625
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,513
Come on. We go way back.

626
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,849
Then I'll call you again.

627
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,684
Bye.

628
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,107
Things could get messy
between Director Mun and Ms. Jang.

629
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,942
But it's nothing serious, sir.

630
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,861
How are they already bickering?

631
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,280
What about that woman?

632
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:35,907
Ban Ji-eum.

633
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,077
Rumor has it that you hired a girl
who made cars.

634
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,581
You don't need to be
concerned about her, sir.

635
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,915
That's for me to decide.

636
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,794
She had a rough upbringing.

637
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,464
What if she causes trouble?

638
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,259
I don't think she's that type.

639
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,806
Money can give anyone

640
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,684
a change of heart.

641
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,271
I'm sure you know that.

642
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,111
It was your father's death anniversary.

643
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,119
We held a memorial service.

644
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,371
You don't need to
concern yourself with him anymore.

645
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,499
You're just as inflexible as your father.

646
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:26,875
You may go.

647
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,002
Sir.

648
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,465
Is there another reason
why you called us back to Korea?

649
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,682
Fix that habit

650
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,728
of asking sensitive questions
just because you're offended.

651
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,855
You may go.

652
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:15,048
Mr. Ha isn't answering his phone.

653
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,303
I guess it really is
better to live and suffer than to die.

654
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,556
I get to hear Seo-ha snoring.

655
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,145
Taxi.

656
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,106
Taxi!

657
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,342
MY 19TH LIFE

658
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:04,264
MY 16TH LIFE

659
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,476
Oh, no.

660
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,331
I'm sorry.

661
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,791
What happened to him?

662
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,753
You were a lady compared to him.

663
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,798
I just couldn't handle him by myself.

664
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,217
You have it quite hard.

665
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,387
I'm okay. Can we put him in the car?

666
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,098
Step down.

667
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,516
-Watch out.
-Step down.

668
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,811
Let's sit him in the front.

669
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,397
It could be a problem if he wakes up.

670
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,066
Director.

671
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,151
Your legs.

672
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,445
That's it.

673
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:10,181
What did you mean
when you said it could be a problem?

674
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,021
He was in the backseat
during the accident.

675
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,733
So I think he only sits in the front
and can't drive either.

676
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,916
Ms. Yoon, are you okay?

677
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,003
Yes.

678
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,214
I had no idea.

679
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,308
Be careful.

680
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,310
Was I like this too?

681
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,228
You weren't this bad.

682
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,397
-Let's put him down here.
-Okay.

683
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,693
Slowly.

684
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,280
Director Mun.

685
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:08,990
Director Mun?

686
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,867
What's your passcode?

687
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,578
Director Mun.

688
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,081
Do you know his passcode?

689
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,333
No, I'm afraid I know nothing.

690
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,293
Oh, actually…

691
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,182
YOON CHO-WON

692
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,187
-Yes?
-Mr. Ha.

693
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,231
Could you tell me
Seo-ha's passcode for his house?

694
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,483
What?

695
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,860
It's just that he's very drunk.

696
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,655
I need to bring him inside,
but I don't know the passcode.

697
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,744
It's 0423.

698
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:58,998
0423?

699
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,003
Okay.

700
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:14,806
Be careful.

701
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,058
We're almost there.

702
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,855
Okay. Be careful.

703
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,065
Director.

704
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,608
His legs.

705
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,282
-I'll bring some water.
-Thank you.

706
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:32,217
Thank you.

707
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,974
Don't go.

708
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,809
Don't go, Ju-won.

709
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,159
Don't go.

710
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,165
Despite living so many lives,

711
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,834
I still struggle…

712
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,837
with these moments the most.

713
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:16,469
It's when I have to let go

714
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,264
of the person I love.

715
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:26,563
Seo-ha…

716
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,525
is still living in that moment.

717
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:32,735
Don't go.

718
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,946
Don't go, Ju-won.

719
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:06,477
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

720
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,229
I think I like Ms. Ban.

721
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,650
She keeps reminding me of Ju-won
and it's driving me crazy.

722
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,153
Since when were you this sick?

723
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:16,362
Ma'am.

724
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,906
What would you do

725
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,325
if she came back?

726
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,869
What did you do to Seo-ha yesterday?

727
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,663
What's been on your mind?

728
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:28,916
I was wondering
why you kept calling me by my name.

729
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,585
I hope they're dating.

730
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:35,757
This is something
that could endanger Ji-eum.

731
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,592
Director Mun!
