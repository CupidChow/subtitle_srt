00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,970
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

2
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,933
MY 12TH LIFE

3
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,103
Why do I remember my past lives?

4
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,107
Is this a curse

5
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,358
or a blessing?

6
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:14,115
Whatever the case may be,
I decided to accept my fate

7
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,618
and often wondered

8
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,328
-how I would live my life.
-Here.

9
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,248
We're almost there.

10
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:28,546
Someone who's always by your side
whether in good times or bad.

11
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,464
Come on.

12
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:35,553
That's who I wanted to be
throughout my numerous lives.

13
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:43,686
THE ONES WHO SHARE
EACH OTHERS' JOY AND SORROW

14
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:59,160
He seems to have
found out something about the accident.

15
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,161
No.

16
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,997
He's asking who was behind it,

17
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,209
so I don't think he knows to that extent.

18
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,419
Yes, of course.

19
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:12,507
I told him that I knew nothing about it.

20
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,844
So Seo-ha knows about this now?

21
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:19,597
Director Mun.

22
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,227
We're not going to have a bad ending.

23
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:58,803
Get rid of Mr. Bang.

24
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,365

THE LATE HA JEONG-SEOP

29
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,944
Not Yoon Cho-won.

30
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,240
What?

31
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,494
Was it a dream?

32
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,708
Look at you. You're a zombie.

33
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,710
I knew this would happen,

34
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,003
you lightweight.

35
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,088
Is your stomach all right?

36
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,340
How much did you drink?

37
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,758
YOON CHO-WON

38
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,597
Yes, Ms. Yoon?

39
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,350
Hello, Mr. Ha. How's your stomach?

40
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,936
Why would you ask about my stomach?

41
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,275
Do you remember what happened yesterday?

42
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,778
Was I with you last night, Ms. Yoon?

43
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,989
A girl?

44
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:24,907
It's a girl?

45
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,034
You have a girlfriend?

46
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,829
-So you don't remember…
-You have a girlfriend?

47
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,247
-I don't!
-What?

48
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,041
Oh, you don't remember.

49
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,585
I wasn't talking to you, Ms. Yoon.

50
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,004
I'm sorry for…

51
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,423
For this and that.

52
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,340
May I ask you

53
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,218
what happened yesterday?

54
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,472
You seemed very drunk
so I went to pick you up.

55
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,849
Did I contact you?

56
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,270
No, I called and went on my own.

57
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,315
And you left on your own too.

58
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,443
It's a relief I managed to do that.

59
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,153
-What?
-It's nothing.

60
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,281
I have a splitting headache,

61
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,158
so I'll hang up now.

62
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,243
All right.

63
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,085
Does he really not remember?

64
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,567
What are you doing here?

65
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,157
Let me take you home.

66
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,745
I'm not going.

67
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,539
I don't have a home.

68
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,416
I'm homeless.

69
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,503
You're a bad drunk.

70
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,012
I'm all right.

71
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:12,974
I'm fine.

72
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,101
You don't look fine at all.

73
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,981
I'm doomed.

74
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,237
I'm so doomed.

75
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,406
What do you mean?

76
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,080
Not…

77
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,542
Yoon Cho-won.

78
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,003
Not Yoon Cho-won.

79
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,431
Because Yoon Cho-won…

80
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,976
is Yoon Cho-won.

81
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,166
EXPRESS MOVERS

82
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,210
So damn heavy.

83
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,629
Come on, hurry.

84
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,048
We're taking all of this?

85
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,258
Come on, move it.

86
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,891
Are we really going to leave like this?

87
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,685
Yang-sik, listen to me carefully.

88
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,897
This is all an act.

89
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,942
-Sorry?
-I won't fold like this.

90
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,903
I knew this would happen,

91
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,365
so I had something up my sleeve.

92
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,699
Okay.

93
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,630
That hit-and-run driver?

94
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,383
I recruited him.

95
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,885
This is going to get them.

96
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,989
I told you it's scary.

97
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,034
Seo-ha, you're here.

98
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,619
Goodness, Seo-ha.

99
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,122
It's so hard to see you these days.

100
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,039
Hello.

101
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,416
It's been a while.

102
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,294
-You're working at the hotel?
-Yes.

103
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,503
How's the work?

104
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,841
There must not be much to do
at such a run-down place.

105
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,099
-Let's eat.
-Yes, sir.

106
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,157
Cho-won.

107
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,074
Ji-eum.

108
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:19,827
What brings you here?

109
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,872
I just wanted to see you.

110
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:24,957
Come on.

111
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,875
Let's go in.

112
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:35,968
This way.

113
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,431
-Hello.
-Hello.

114
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,433
Welcome.

115
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,479
I'm Yoon Cho-won.

116
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,396
I'm Ji-eum's…

117
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,400
I'm Ms. Ban's co-worker.

118
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,818
I see.

119
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,740
I don't think I can hold it in.

120
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,410
She already knows you were my sister.

121
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,163
Ae-gyeong was my niece in a past life.

122
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,248
What?

123
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,334
Uncle told me a lot about you.

124
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,507
Where are my manners?

125
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,716
Have a seat.

126
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,176
I'll bring some side dishes.

127
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,595
-Hey, Min-gi.
-Yes?

128
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,097
Did you turn off the stove for the tofu?

129
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,598
I did.

130
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,355
Cheers.

131
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,112
Why aren't you drinking?

132
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,115
You two are definitely getting plastered.

133
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,699
And since I'm the oldest here,

134
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,034
I need to stay sober.

135
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,328
No, you should drink with us.

136
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,956
Ms. Kim.

137
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:48,666
Let me feed you one.

138
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,919
You don't have to…

139
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,132
It's so good.

140
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,384
It tastes even better
because you're so pretty.

141
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,386
And on that note,

142
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,720
-have another drink.
-Again?

143
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,765
Thank you.

144
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,019
-Then let us two enjoy ourselves.
-Let's.

145
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,438
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

146
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,941
Out of all the lives I've lived,

147
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,444
I've never seen such a sight.

148
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:17,862
What?

149
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,241
My niece from two lives ago
and my sister from my past life

150
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,411
are eating, drinking,
and laughing together.

151
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,747
I've lived quite a few lives,

152
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,374
but this is a first.

153
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,419
I never imagined this would happen.

154
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,380
Let's commemorate this.

155
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:37,882
How about a picture?

156
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,342
Why not?

157
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,969
Excuse me.

158
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,762
Could you take a picture for us?

159
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,390
Sure.

160
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,519
-Thank you.
-Come here, Min-gi.

161
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,354
-Take it with my phone.
-All right.

162
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,484
-Get closer.
-Like this?

163
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,319
-Good.
-How's this?

164
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,113
One, two, three.

165
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,491
One more.

166
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,327
One, two, three.

167
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,180
YOON CHO-WON

168
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,894
Yes, Ms. Yoon?

169
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,731
What?

170
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,859
What happened?
You were never interested in art.

171
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,987
I had a light shake for lunch
so I'm quite hungry.

172
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,405
Oh, goodness.

173
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,574
Seo-ha.

174
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,910
Did you frequent exhibitions in Germany?

175
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,330
Seo-ha.

176
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,792
Seo-ha?

177
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,549
Your aunt's calling you.

178
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,968
Can't you hear?

179
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,555
Perhaps I should've been louder.

180
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,353
If you know you're different from others,
you should work on it.

181
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,896
Don't you think so?

182
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:25,573
I hear your relationship
with Ms. Jang is strained.

183
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,033
Just don't cause any embarrassment.

184
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,540
This is uncomfortable.

185
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,092
Mun Seo-ha.

186
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,680
-Sit down.
-Since this doesn't feel like a meal,

187
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,599
let me excuse myself.

188
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,958
How funny.

189
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,588
Have you seen the picture?

190
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:36,936
Yes?

191
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,480
I'll be expecting a hefty payment

192
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,733
since I'm putting my life
on the line here.

193
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,697
It was ordered
by someone very close to you

194
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,115
within MI Group.

195
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,619
Who could it be?

196
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:19,228
It was ordered
by someone very close to you

197
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,729
within MI Group.

198
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:36,161
Ju-won died while she was with Seo-ha.

199
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,457
Ju-won.

200
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:45,379
Ju-won.

201
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,382
My father simply passed away…

202
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,885
while working like any other day.

203
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,192
You're here, Mr. Ha.

204
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,362
It's Ha Do-yun.

205
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,531
What's going on?

206
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,450
Ha Do-yun.

207
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,535
Ha Do-yun.

208
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,662
"Not Yoon Cho-won."

209
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,205
No. "Yes Yoon Cho-won."

210
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,750
Ha Do-yun.

211
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,209
Why don't you take her home, Ms. Ban?

212
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,961
I would but I had a drink.

213
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,463
That's right.

214
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,423
I took you home last time,

215
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,009
so you should take me home tonight.

216
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,470
That's what she says.

217
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:41,977
Yes, Seo-ha?

218
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:44,772
What?

219
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,121
You had a tough day.

220
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,961
You don't know what happened.

221
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,505
Whatever happened,

222
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,883
you did well, Director Mun.

223
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,535
Director Mun.

224
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,330
Did you just kiss me?

225
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,878
That wasn't a kiss.

226
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,132
It was just a peck.

227
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,594
You're right.

228
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,761
This is…

229
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,764
a proper kiss.

230
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,058
What is it?

231
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,315
I'm just amazed at how far we've come.

232
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,319
In situations like this,

233
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,239
just say you missed me.

234
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,992
I feel like I'm in a different world…

235
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,372
now that you're here.

236
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,832
Just a moment ago,

237
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,628
my whole world seemed like
it was crashing down.

238
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,763
Let's go somewhere warm.

239
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,641
Once you get warm and eat delicious food,

240
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,060
you'll feel better.

241
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:17,693
Get in.

242
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,113
Watch your head.

243
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,782
There you go.

244
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,663
There.

245
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:36,920
Did you fall for me?

246
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,442
Let's go.

247
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,204
Go wash up.

248
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,455
I'll cook something hot.

249
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,918
She's made herself at home.

250
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,922
I won't stay over tonight so don't worry.

251
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,633
Just tonight?

252
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,429
Or should I…

253
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,850
just stay the night?

254
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,759
Ta-da.

255
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:51,805
What is it?

256
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,224
It's Spanish beef stew.

257
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,768
But I had to improvise
because I didn't have all the ingredients.

258
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,203
Why is it good?

259
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,955
Of course it's good.

260
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:17,914
I made it.

261
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,672
I made this for him when we were young.

262
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,798
Would he remember?

263
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,010
It kind of tastes familiar.

264
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,181
It's delicious.

265
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,207
Are you all right?

266
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,586
It's Ha Do-yun.

267
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,839
We're even now.

268
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,108
Not…

269
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:09,943
Ha Do-yun.

270
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,194
Not…

271
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,612
Yoon Cho-won.

272
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,490
Because he's Ha Do-yun.

273
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,952
Not Yoon Cho-won.

274
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,083
I'll go home on my own.

275
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,429
Are you all right?

276
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,931
Come on, get up.

277
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,726
I'm all right.

278
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,728
It didn't hurt. I'm fine.

279
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,688
That can't be true.
You just twisted your ankle.

280
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,940
You should ice it if it hurts,

281
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,192
and you better go see a doctor.

282
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,446
I swear I'm all right.

283
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,745
She's making it worse.

284
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,084
YOU ARE NOWHERE AND ALWAYS THERE
POEMS BY LEE YUN-HAK

285
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,727
When your past trauma haunts you

286
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,396
and you feel like you're sinking,

287
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,232
think of these flowers.

288
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,114
You were thinking of them.

289
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,158
Come out for tea.

290
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,257
Director Mun.

291
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,384
Please--

292
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,138
Save your confession.

293
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,399
Please date me.

294
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,984
This is my second confession.

295
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,405
Why the rush?

296
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,824
Who knows what could happen in life?

297
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,618
Are you still

298
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,995
unsure about me?

299
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,840
I like you.

300
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:41,970
But first,

301
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,973
please give me some time.

302
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,033
Let me make the third confession, Ji-eum.

303
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:08,913
Of course.

304
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,962
Hearing you call me by my name

305
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,798
is making my heart flutter.

306
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,511
Well, I'm older than you.

307
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,014
He's so cute.

308
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,476
So we're not officially dating yet,

309
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,354
but we can kiss, right?

310
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,120
What horrible timing.

311
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,831
BAN DONG-U

312
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,338
What's this?

313
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,841
That's…

314
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,996
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

315
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,290
He even signed a contract to pay me.

316
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,959
How could he be like this?

317
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,508
What the…

318
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,760
What are you doing here?

319
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,387
You said you'd never come here.

320
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,308
What?

321
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,731
DEBT REPAYMENT NOTICE, PAYMENT REMINDER

322
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,818
Where's Father?

323
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,153
I don't know.
He hasn't been home in a while.

324
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,155
He's probably mooching off someone.

325
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,158
Hey, you.

326
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,911
I warned you not to bother me anymore.

327
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,580
What did I do?

328
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,914
Why did you call Director Mun?

329
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,333
Why would I call him?

330
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,669
You've got the wrong person.

331
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,339
Wait.

332
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,966
You'll break my arm.

333
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,302
Arms don't break that easily.

334
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,555
But I do know how to get it done.

335
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,142
All right, I'll tell you.

336
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,477
Talk.

337
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,440
The thing is…

338
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,027
When you went to Wonjo Capital,

339
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,030
Mr. Bang said something strange
after you left.

340
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,781
What did he say?

341
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:52,160
He said that Mun Seo-ha's car accident
wasn't just an accident.

342
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,536
Apparently, it was his work.

343
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,663
So it was you who told Seo-ha?

344
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,664
You knew already?

345
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,042
Since he'll be my brother-in-law,
I thought--

346
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,627
Shut your mouth.

347
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,421
You.

348
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,673
Stay out of my sight.

349
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,675
Okay.

350
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,807
I'm older, you know?

351
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,191
This family really is…

352
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,028
the worst-fated relationship
I've ever been in.

353
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:35,161
But who was it that tried to kill Seo-ha?

354
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:44,253
It was ordered
by someone very close to you

355
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,630
within MI Group.

356
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,826
So…

357
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,160
-why did you call--
-Do-yun.

358
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,708
I don't think that accident…

359
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,504
was a simple hit-and-run.

360
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,757
Someone ordered it.

361
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,385
I don't know yet

362
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,846
as to who did it for what reason.

363
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,348
But it could be…

364
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,102
someone within MI Group.

365
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,947
If that's the case,

366
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,659
would you be able to
handle the consequences?

367
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,744
I'll have to.

368
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,622
I didn't come this far
without thinking of the consequences.

369
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,129
Go through with it then.

370
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,631
I'll be watching how it goes.

371
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,343
I'm sorry.

372
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,644
You got here fine by yourself,

373
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,105
so go back on your own, Director Mun.

374
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,524
I'll be here a bit longer.

375
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,674
Are you hurting again?

376
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,635
I'm all right.

377
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,346
It'll pass.

378
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,734
Take a painkiller and get some rest.

379
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,954
I'll handle this so don't worry.

380
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,293
I'm sorry for making you worry.

381
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,921
You've helped me a lot as well.

382
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:34,841
Min-gi.

383
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,760
Let me ask of you again.

384
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,391
Don't ever tell Ji-eum, okay?

385
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,893
She's already got so much on her plate.

386
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,187
If she finds out how I am on top of that,

387
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,106
it'll be too much for her.

388
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,693
-Auntie, are you up?
-Don't worry.

389
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:56,028
Tell her I went in
to prepare for reservations.

390
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,705
Auntie.

391
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,668
She went in already?

392
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,045
There are a lot of reservations today,

393
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,255
so she went ahead.

394
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,014
What's this?

395
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,433
I wasn't feeling very good.

396
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,500
Mr. Kang Min-gi.

397
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,878
Who are you really?

398
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,633
First, I'd like to apologize.

399
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,301
I know it was wrong,

400
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,930
but I looked through your room
because you seemed suspicious.

401
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,557
-And--
-Did you…

402
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,352
touch the shaman bells?

403
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:11,812
Why?

404
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,902
What year were you born in?

405
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,530
Why are you asking?

406
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,870
How long…

407
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,833
have you lived like this?

408
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,464
How long have you…

409
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,051
been remembering your past lives?

410
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,516
Do you…

411
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,560
remember your past lives too?

412
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,939
This is my 23rd life.

413
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,069
Do you know how long I've searched?

414
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,363
I wondered

415
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,490
if there were
more people like me out there.

416
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,703
I've searched for so long.

417
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,665
And I was right.

418
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,003
Those shaman bells…

419
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,338
I had strange visions.

420
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,341
Does it have to do with my past lives?

421
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,764
What's the oldest memory

422
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,975
that you remember?

423
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,605
The memories from my first life

424
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,859
were just blurry fragments,

425
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,612
but they became clearer
after I touched the shaman bells.

426
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,034
These bells

427
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,828
must have connected those fragments.

428
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,290
They can help me remember my first life?

429
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:56,959
Yes.

430
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,254
You must find the relationships

431
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,089
you remember from your first life.

432
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,844
Why do I need to look for them?

433
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,471
That's going to…

434
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,684
help you find out
why you remember your past lives.

435
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,827
That was my first life?

436
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,500
PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER

437
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,299
Not…

438
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,384
Ha Do-yun.

439
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,637
Because he's Ha Do-yun.

440
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,601
We're even now.

441
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,105
So he remembers.

442
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,703
You called, sir?

443
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,621
Give me a report.

444
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,083
There's nothing in particular to report.

445
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,301
How could they call this news?

446
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,762
All they know how to do
is copy down gossip.

447
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,097
They have no backbone.

448
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,559
Be it them or you.

449
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:23,439
I had him work at the hotel
instead of fooling around,

450
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,983
but he's wasting his time.

451
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,819
I don't understand what you mean, sir.

452
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,617
The accident.

453
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,912
I don't know
where he's heard that nonsense.

454
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,499
Is there so little to do
at the hotel that he's focused

455
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,750
on such a trivial matter?

456
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,879
Seo-ha is doing his best
at the hotel, sir.

457
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,256
Several projects are underway.

458
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,134
Then tell him to work
and stop wasting his time.

459
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,428
Report to me on Seo-ha every day,

460
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,055
even if there's nothing to report.

461
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,974
That's why I had you study with him.

462
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,309
Understood?

463
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,232
Answer me.

464
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:09,735
Understood, sir.

465
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,076
It's not trivial, sir.

466
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,793
My father

467
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,212
passed away in that accident.

468
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,506
It's not trivial.

469
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,065
Director Lee, did you look into
what I asked you about?

470
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,942
I'm out somewhere right now.

471
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,278
Where are you this early in the morning?

472
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,071
Are you interrogating me?

473
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,490
I stopped by Seo-ha's place.

474
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,242
For what?

475
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,036
What do you mean for what?
At least I should look after him.

476
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,081
All right then.

477
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,836
Have you looked into
CEO Im Chang-su of 24 Caps?

478
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,254
We're in the middle of it, ma'am.

479
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:13,340
How long has it been
since I told you to do it?

480
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,096
Also find out when Chan-hyeok
can start working at HQ.

481
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,681
You are my son

482
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,392
but I might as well
tell them not to hire you!

483
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,562
What are all these?

484
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:29,481
I had breakfast with the chairman
and they served your favorite side dishes.

485
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:35,195
Working at the hotel
must remind you of your mother.

486
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,032
Well, I guess it does.

487
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,201
There's been a lot of noise

488
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,828
since you came back, hasn't there?

489
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,414
In that case,

490
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,749
buy me a drink next time.

491
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:47,666
Okay.

492
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,045
Leave it.
Go get ready for work. I'll do it.

493
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,588
Yes, sir.

494
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,844
Is he making sure to eat well?

495
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,316
RECENT CALLS

496
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,984
WONJO CAPITAL

497
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,534
He does remember everything.

498
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,996
So why isn't he answering?

499
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,081
I'm not sure.

500
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,000
I didn't think Mr. Ha would be like this.

501
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,004
How dare he do this
to my perfect little Cho-won.

502
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,887
My goodness.

503
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,973
You should've waited
for the car to stop, Ms. Yoon.

504
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,853
Is this why he doesn't like me?

505
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,607
You're still so charming.

506
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,068
Oh, stop it.

507
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,111
My goodness!

508
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,655
Look at you.

509
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,124
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

510
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,171
Look here, Cho-won.

511
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,217
You look great in any color.

512
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:26,473
I used to be jealous of kids with sisters.
Now I know how it feels.

513
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:29,184
This feels like a dream to me.

514
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:33,897
Me too.

515
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:36,942
It's like a dream.

516
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,361
Are you crying again?

517
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,155
Don't cry.

518
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,197
I'm not crying.

519
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,703
Let's see. This would look great on you.

520
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,788
Can she try this on?

521
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,540
-This way, please.
-Okay.

522
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,132
Ae-gyeong would look great in these.

523
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,760
What sizes do you have for these?

524
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,437
You're here.

525
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,522
Good morning.

526
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,200
What's with your ankle?

527
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,368
Are you hurt?

528
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,953
I just slipped.

529
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,205
You should be careful.

530
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,166
I'll see you upstairs.

531
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:36,919
Give me a second.

532
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:37,836
Mr. Ha.

533
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,672
Could we talk?

534
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,425
I'm quite busy this morning.

535
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,802
It won't take long.

536
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:46,762
Just five minutes.

537
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,142
I'll head in first.

538
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:53,852
Let's go, Director Mun.

539
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,651
I iced my ankle right away that night

540
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,902
and went to see a doctor.

541
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,196
I did as you told me to do.

542
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:05,572
I did good, right?

543
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,325
Those were obvious things to do.

544
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,618
What I'm trying to say is…

545
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:15,082
I remember everything
that happened that night.

546
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:16,959
All right.

547
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,463
-And?
-"We're even now."

548
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,471
I thought about it.

549
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,935
Everyone has reasons for their actions,

550
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,062
and that's especially true for you.

551
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,773
So I'd like to ask you this.

552
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:42,526
Of course I could be mistaken, but…

553
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,489
Mr. Ha.

554
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,242
You like me, don't you?

555
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,037
Yes.

556
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,165
-I like you.
-What?

557
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,917
You…

558
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,794
You like me?

559
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,379
Yes.

560
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,050
I like you but I won't date you.

561
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,469
Why not?

562
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,305
It's not because of you.

563
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,390
It's because of me.

564
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,226
Well then.

565
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,391
Ms. Ban, we need to talk.

566
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,322
Ms. Ban.

567
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,491
This is a workplace.

568
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,034
I'm aware.

569
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,621
Please think of Director Mun's position
within the group.

570
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,247
You should be careful.

571
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,041
If you keep being reckless--

572
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:21,958
If so,

573
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,585
then what?

574
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,048
I could reveal your real identity.

575
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,466
Oh, my.

576
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,969
Do you actually believe

577
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,721
that I remember my past lives?

578
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:38,517
By any chance,

579
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,770
do you know about the jewelry box?

580
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,564
Jewelry box…

581
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,151
Jewelry box…

582
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,698
The gift I gave Seo-ha for his birthday?

583
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,242
It's inlaid with pearl,

584
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,828
about this size

585
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,454
with round edges,

586
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,873
and a lock right here.

587
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,839
If I tell you what's inside,

588
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,591
will you believe me completely?

589
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,679
Inside the box

590
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,556
is a gift I made for Seo-ha--

591
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:18,473
Stop.

592
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,184
Tell Seo-ha yourself.

593
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,897
It wouldn't be right
for me to find out first.

594
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,984
Good thinking, Mr. Ha.

595
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,697
But if this is real,

596
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,575
how long will you keep it from Seo-ha?

597
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,455
Unless you'll keep it a secret forever,

598
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,998
you should tell him soon.

599
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,669
You're right.

600
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,105
Didn't we meet at the crosswalk last time?

601
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,109
Ju-won,

602
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:13,862
it's been a while.

603
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,282
Does she remember her past lives too?

604
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,533
Do you…

605
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,077
remember your past lives too?

606
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,330
This is my 23rd life.

607
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,291
I pushed you.

608
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,960
So why did I fall over too?

609
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,378
That's funny.

610
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:31,797
Mom!

611
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,762
-Mom!
-Ma'am!

612
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,389
Ma'am!

613
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:42,933
-Mom, wake up!
-Ma'am!

614
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:45,352
-Mom!
-Wake up, ma'am!

615
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,771
-Mom, wake up!
-Oh, no.

616
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,688
Ma'am!

617
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,565
Mom!

618
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,319
Is it really you?

619
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,367
Ma'am!

620
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,260
My goodness.

621
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,720
When did you get here?

622
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,807
You're tangled with quite a person.

623
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,892
What are you talking about?

624
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,144
I am an atheist through and through,

625
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,606
but I'm starting to question my beliefs.

626
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,359
What are you on about?

627
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,154
Be careful.

628
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,492
Hey.

629
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,459
MESSAGES
WONJO CAPITAL

630
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,504
I have evidence. Let's make a deal.

631
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:37,047
WONJO

632
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,475
What's going on?

633
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,345
Ms. Ban?

634
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,474
Director Mun.

635
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,686
What a coincidence meeting you here.

636
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,021
What's happening?

637
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,606
Exactly.

638
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,233
What is happening?

639
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,486
Did you follow me here?

640
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,493
I'm sorry but I was so worried about you.

641
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,329
How could you be so reckless?

642
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,041
What if you get hurt because of me?

643
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,754
Do you want to see me go mad?

644
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,385
What?

645
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:08,805
Director Mun.

646
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:13,101
That kind of felt like
the third confession to me.

647
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,022
But it must all be in my head, right?

648
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:20,984
Where did you park?

649
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,946
By the way,

650
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,406
I'm a great fighter.

651
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,912
Why did you come here?

652
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,541
It's better you don't know.

653
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:42,672
I actually heard all about the accident

654
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,674
from Dong-u.

655
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:48,803
Director Mun.

656
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,598
Everything in life has an end,

657
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,391
and everyone experiences loss.

658
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,809
I know.

659
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:58,188
I know why you're telling me this.

660
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,317
But I'm overwhelmed
by the thought of those…

661
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,446
who were hurt by the accident.

662
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,282
Cho-won.

663
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:11,576
Do-yun.

664
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,745
Ju-won's parents.

665
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,374
I have asked myself,

666
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,668
"What's the point in digging up the past?"

667
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:21,961
But…

668
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,464
we at least need to know who killed her.

669
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,092
I believe

670
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:31,513
Ju-won also needs to know why she died.

671
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:39,896
WONJO CAPITAL

672
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:42,232
Hello?

673
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,192
Are you ready to make a deal?

674
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,320
Yes, I am.

675
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,781
I'll send you the address.

676
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,910
Make sure to come alone.

677
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,125
236-2 HASAN-RI, ANPYEONG-MYEON,
YEONPYEONG-GUN, GYEONGGI

678
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,546
I'm coming with you.

679
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,508
You need someone to drive anyway.

680
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:12,345
Just until the entrance then.

681
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,806
All right, just until the entrance.

682
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:31,948
They're moving. Let's go.

683
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,365
All right, this is as far as you go.

684
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,076
I might as well go all the way with you.

685
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,369
It's better if we move separately.

686
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:00,537
Then you can stay here.

687
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,454
I'll be back soon.

688
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,373
That's nonsense.

689
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,418
Even if something happens to me,
I can come back to you.

690
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,504
But you can't.

691
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,257
Do you not trust me that much?

692
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,467
I've crossed the line too.

693
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,678
At this point,

694
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,974
I've crossed the line so much

695
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,268
that I'll always find you if I lose you.

696
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,563
Oh, my.

697
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,357
You can't come at me
with that line right now.

698
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,235
I'll be quick so wait in the car.

699
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,152
Okay?

700
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:34,571
Okay.

701
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:55,675
What was that?

702
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,418
You must find the relationships

703
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,295
you remember from your first life.

704
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:27,141
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

705
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,185
If you truly cared about Seo-ha,

706
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:32,230
you should've stopped him
from putting himself in danger.

707
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:35,316
Do you perhaps know who the culprit is?

708
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,819
"April 23, 1998."

709
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:43,658
I thought that you might be
behind the accident, Ms. Jang.

710
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:46,661
What kind of minor collision
might you be referring to?

711
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,538
This is getting complicated.

712
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,831
Were we…

713
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,083
lovers a thousand years ago?

714
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:56,337
I decided to only think about us two.

715
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,797
Seo-ha.

716
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,382
Please go.

717
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:01,175
I don't want you to see me like this.

718
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:06,180
