1
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,970
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

2
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:10,862
Get out of my way.

3
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,739
I'm going to kill him.

4
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,076
Would your sister be happy

5
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,495
if you killed him?

6
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,581
Do not repay blood…

7
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,043
with blood.

8
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,503
Please…

9
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,173
take care of yourself.

10
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,010
None of that matters anymore.

11
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,346
Get out of my way.

12
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,350
Get out of my way!

13
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,954
Stop!

14
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,459
All I wanted…

15
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,380
was to save a life.

16
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,775
I will never forget this day.

17
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,154
I shall forever

18
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,240
remember this rage.

19
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,245
Be it hundreds or thousands of years,
I shall remember this and be born again.

20
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,248
And I will get my revenge…

21
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,669
no matter what.

22
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:54,085
THE ONE WHO TIED THE KNOT MUST UNTIE IT

23
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,982
It was me.

24
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,532
I was the one who cursed myself
to remember my past lives.

25
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,453
I bound myself.

26
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,457
Because I was devastated.

27
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,126
Because I was enraged.

28
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,045
I was a fool.

29
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:09,911
Thank you.

30
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,039
You always cared about me

31
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,083
both then and now.

32
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,003
You were always a good person.

33
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,050
I'm sorry.

34
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,676
WEBTOON ORIGINAL SERIES
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE CREATED BY LEE HEY

35
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,722
Did I

36
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,974
do something in that life?

37
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,981
It must've hurt.

38
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:42,902
Was I perhaps

39
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,240
stabbed or shot by an arrow here?

40
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,496
I knew it.

41
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,415
I need to have

42
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,836
at least this level of imagination
to stay by your side.

43
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,964
Aren't you hungry?

44
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,924
I'll cook you some ramyeon, so wait here.

45
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,052
Aren't you curious?

46
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,221
About who stabbed you and why?

47
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,766
Not one bit.

48
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,665
There's someone I need to meet.

49
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,271
I can't believe this.

50
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,273
I like you.

51
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,358
-What?
-What?

52
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,454
If Cho-won really lets you go
for the last time,

53
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,208
it'll be you
who won't be able to let her go.

54
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,794
So please accept it.

55
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,506
This is my love for the day.

56
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,176
Let's stop doing this.

57
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,553
Please.

58
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:54,116
MR. HA, LET'S STOP…

59
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,458
MR. HA, THANK YOU…

60
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,001
…FOR EBERYTING

61
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,673
…FOR EVERYTHING

62
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:18,307
MR. HA, CAN I JUST KEEP LICKING YOU

63
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:24,855
…LIKING YOU

64
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,242
I heard it'll rain tonight.
You didn't bring one, did you?

65
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,452
Mr. Ha.

66
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,875
Don't read that.

67
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,378
I sent it by mistake,
so please don't read it.

68
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,506
Then you can delete it.

69
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,719
Okay.

70
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,892
MR. HAA I RALLY LIK E YOU

71
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:02,852
DELETE MESSAGE

72
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,438
Here you go.

73
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,163
Take this.

74
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,466
Excuse me.

75
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,021
This reminds me of the day we first met.

76
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,693
They'll be closing soon.

77
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,457
This is my last gift to you.

78
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,922
I'm sorry for everything,
and thank you for liking me.

79
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,425
I'll stop being so greedy now.

80
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,220
This is enough

81
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,140
because I want you to smile a lot.

82
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,396
Let's greet each other
with a smile next time.

83
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,386
I came here to see you, Ms. Yoon.

84
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,972
I was waiting for you.

85
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,604
I don't know either.

86
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,900
I know I shouldn't
and that I've hurt you a lot.

87
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,362
So why do I still want to
hold on to you so shamelessly?

88
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,280
Are you…

89
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,825
holding on to me right now?

90
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,453
People will run their mouths.

91
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,372
I'm used to that.

92
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,000
But it'll be new for you.

93
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,298
Will you be okay with that?

94
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,430
Let them judge all they want.

95
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,141
I'll curse them tenfold.

96
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,354
I couldn't care less
what other people say.

97
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,792
So I don't need to give up on you, right?

98
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,295
You better not take this back.

99
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,215
I promise I won't.

100
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,890
I like you a lot, Ms. Yoon.

101
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,041
Professor Kang.

102
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,716
So this is
what you really do in this life.

103
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,385
As you can see.

104
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,264
Cheon-un.

105
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,100
You killed my sister
and had me killed as well.

106
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,854
So you saw everything.

107
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,400
I knew that once you found out everything,

108
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:23,487
you'd come to me with those eyes
and get your revenge on me.

109
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:25,948
"Revenge"?

110
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,458
Is that how you've been living
your 23rd life?

111
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,712
You're right.

112
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,923
I hate these burdensome emotions.

113
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,970
But so what? It's all in the past.

114
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,600
Even if it had been Seo-ha
who I had a grudge against,

115
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,934
I wouldn't have cared.

116
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,563
Yes, the memory would've been painful.

117
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,899
But it happened a thousand years ago.

118
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,485
I was tormented by that life
every time I thought about it.

119
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,281
People died due to my foolishness.

120
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,952
And your curse began.

121
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,378
I wanted to ask for forgiveness.

122
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:26,050
I regretted what I did
and wanted to redeem myself.

123
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,718
I will…

124
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,723
never forgive you.

125
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,481
If I was Su, that is.

126
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,903
But I'm not her anymore.

127
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,072
What's important is our current lives.

128
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,990
We know that all too well.

129
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,660
We didn't live this long for nothing.

130
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,500
Do you remember when I said

131
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,461
that you still had a chance?

132
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,422
So you're saying I can
stop remembering my past lives?

133
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,010
Mr. Kang.

134
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,391
I'm going to be happy in this life
with the people I love.

135
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,560
This life was meant for that.

136
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,566
If my being strange is an issue,
then I'll become normal.

137
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,820
Here.

138
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,447
You told me to look for the one
who made me like this.

139
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,286
It was me.

140
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,833
So am I the one who can undo this?

141
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,335
What do I need to do?

142
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,469
There's something you should know…

143
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,723
beforehand.

144
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,394
Putting an end
to remembering your past lives

145
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,189
means you'll lose the memories
of the people from them.

146
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,696
What do you mean?

147
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,613
In your case,

148
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:13,866
Kim Ae-gyeong,

149
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,451
Yoon Cho-won,

150
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,579
and Mun Seo-ha…

151
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,623
will be gone from your memory.

152
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,729
By now,

153
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,107
Han-na will have become a normal person

154
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,942
who doesn't know anything
about past lives.

155
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,658
Excuse me.

156
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,660
Do you know me?

157
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,623
No.

158
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,750
Then why do you keep staring?

159
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,921
Because you're pretty.

160
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,508
You have a good eye. Thank you.

161
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,885
-Let's go.
-All right.

162
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,014
-Let's go.
-Who is she?

163
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,100
-I don't know.
-She called you pretty.

164
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,105
-So do you know her?
-No, I don't.

165
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,827
You came.

166
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,749
I'm doing fine.

167
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:30,878
By the way,

168
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,965
didn't all this
stir things up at the hotel?

169
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,886
Don't worry about me.

170
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,014
Okay.

171
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,811
Uncle.

172
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,481
When Mom passed away,

173
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:58,030
you should've been
comforting Father, not me.

174
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,831
He may not have expressed it like you did,

175
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,959
but he was suffering as well.

176
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,047
Had you two talked it out that day,

177
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,674
none of this would've happened.

178
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,471
I'm…

179
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,681
not miserable.

180
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,102
I'm actually hopeful enough
to want to become happy.

181
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,858
I hope…

182
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,112
you know that.

183
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,663
Thank you.

184
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,418
Seo-ha…

185
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,547
I'm sorry.

186
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,098
Do-yun is here as well.

187
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:12,896
All right.

188
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:20,779
CIVIL AFFAIRS OFFICE

189
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,537
Stop staring at me.

190
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,455
I have nothing to say to you.

191
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,540
Did I say otherwise?

192
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,250
I was just looking.

193
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,795
Are you okay?

194
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,131
He just cried.

195
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,929
Let's hold your father's memorial service
together from now on.

196
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,848
I said that's just for family.

197
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,641
That's exactly what I'm saying.

198
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,601
We've known each other since high school.

199
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,770
We're practically married.

200
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,484
Thanks for everything.

201
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,612
You lunatic.

202
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,952
Should I drive back?

203
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,203
No way.

204
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,131
Are you sure I can save Ae-gyeong?

205
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,176
Can I trust you?

206
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,469
Just try it.

207
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,137
Then you'll become normal

208
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,057
and also save Ms. Kim's life.

209
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,144
Putting an end
to remembering your past lives

210
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,023
means you'll lose the memories
of the people from them.

211
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,290
Sergio!

212
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:59,294
Sergio!

213
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,921
Sergio!

214
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,552
Rosario.

215
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,764
I want to see you dance

216
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,058
one last time.

217
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,604
Dance for me.

218
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,036
How do you share
a happy goodbye with a loved one?

219
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,963
It isn't with sadness

220
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,881
or with fear.

221
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,848
You simply share your happy moments
for the last time together.

222
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,944
It was painful,

223
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,031
but it was a beautiful and happy goodbye.

224
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,454
But if my memories are gone,

225
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,291
what could I possibly share?

226
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,086
How will I find happiness?

227
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,553
Gosh, Seo-ha.

228
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,057
You didn't need to get me
such a nice room.

229
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,351
Nonsense. Don't worry about it.

230
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,604
How's the restaurant?

231
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,066
I told you not to worry
about the restaurant.

232
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,777
Just focus on your health, okay?

233
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,111
Goodness.

234
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,323
I can't believe I'm getting this pampered.

235
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,453
Ms. Kim.

236
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,163
-Hey.
-Goodness.

237
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,748
You're here, Cho-won.

238
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,416
Goodness.

239
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,877
You didn't have to come
when you're so busy.

240
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,671
Of course I should.

241
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,631
I didn't know you guys were so close.

242
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,216
We're very close.

243
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,426
She's my drinking buddy.

244
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,428
Hey.

245
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,721
-Hey.
-You got here quick.

246
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,722
Hey, about that…

247
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:00,392
What is it?

248
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,228
Never mind.

249
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,320
Which one of you is Ms. Kim's guardian?

250
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,280
It's me.

251
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,990
Hold on. Excuse me.

252
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,079
I'll cook you something good
once you're out.

253
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,956
Actually, please cook me some.

254
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,292
We can all have your braised kimchi.

255
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,335
-Seriously?
-Let's actually have

256
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,753
our team dinner at her restaurant.

257
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,213
I'm down. Let's have soju too.

258
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,090
That sounds great.

259
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,008
We'll drink too.

260
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,385
All right.

261
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,971

Don't worry about a thing and trust me.

265
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,162
Uncle.

266
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,333
I don't know what's weighing on your mind.

267
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,545
But do what's best for you,

268
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,381
not others.

269
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,011
Do what you want.

270
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,679
Okay?

271
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,141
Don't worry about me.

272
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,521
You know I always keep my word, right?

273
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,023
Of course I do.

274
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,942
I won't be long.

275
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,070
Okay.

276
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,905

00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,833
so afraid of?

280
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,878
You haven't changed
in the past thousand years.

281
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,921
You're always concerned…

282
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,759
about people.

Ju-won.

286
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,534
I missed you,

287
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:48,912
Ju-won.

288
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,000
Cho-won.

289
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,170
My precious sister.

290
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,550
Who will I go to when I'm struggling…

291
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,638
if I forget about you?

292
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,266
Uncle,

293
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,560
open up.

295
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,440
My one and only niece.

296
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,110
You were my real mom in this life.

297
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,409
Will I be able to live without you?

298
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,001
This time, stay by my side
for a very long time.

299
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:37,919
No.

300
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,797
I'll stay by your side.

301
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,092
I hope we get along well in this life too.

302
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,010
Seo-ha.

303
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:48,763
Seo-ha.

304
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,184
Had I known we'd run out of time so soon,

305
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,230
I would've expressed my gratitude and love

306
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,816
more often.

307
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,185
A carefree heart
that's ready to forget everything

308
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,314
and four words?

309
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,498
I don't want to forget.

310
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,171
I want to remember them.

311
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,469
What are you…

312
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:45,773
Come on.

313
00:33:59,078 --> 00:33:59,912
Two, three.

314
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,769
To your health.

315
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,089
Shoot.

316
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,679
Give it to me.

317
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,898
I never liked the thought of it.

318
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,610
You remembering me

319
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,071
in a life where I'm already dead and gone.

320
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,410
You'd wonder if I had been reincarnated

321
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,414
and show interest in strangers
who don't remember anything.

322
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:26,916
I don't like that.

323
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,588
You won't be alone.

324
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,344
Mr. Kang told me everything.

325
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,890
He said you'd lose all memories
of Cho-won, Ms. Kim,

326
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,268
and me.

327
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,400
Did you think I'd leave you alone
after you forgot everything?

328
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,738
I'll go to you.

329
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,868
The same way Ju-won came back to Seo-ha.

330
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,412
I'll go to you this time.

331
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,332
I'll bring Cho-won and Ms. Kim with me.

332
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,504
So all you have to do

333
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,798
is stay where you are.

334
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,675
Just trust me.

335
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,013
What if I don't notice you?

336
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,725
What if I just pass you by?

337
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,644
Pass by a guy like me?

338
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,856
The Ji-eum that I know
has a good eye for handsome men.

339
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,108
I can guarantee you.

340
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,693
It'll only take one day.

341
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,573
Your confidence is through the roof.

342
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,535
I'm trusting in you, not me.

343
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,873
I believe the Ji-eum that I know

344
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,125
will love me
even if she doesn't recognize me.

345
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,380
I'll just be your lover
in the next life too.

346
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,341
I'm confident

347
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,760
that I can keep you by my side.

348
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,537
I've been carrying it around
for some time now.

349
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,822
Don't worry and just go.

350
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,367
From now on, I'll remember everything.

351
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,405
-Cho-won.
-Hey.

352
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,158
I came as soon as you called.
Did you wait long?

353
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,993
It's fine. I called you so suddenly.

354
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,871
Is something wrong?

355
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,791
I just wanted to see you.

356
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,209
And I have something for you.

357
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,127
For me?

358
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,090
-What is this?
-It's matching jewelry for us.

359
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,552
Are you sure it's for me?

360
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,387
It's not meant for someone else?

361
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,432
I'd been thinking about getting them
since the day we met again.

362
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,645
It's our promise to never part ways again.

363
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,614
They're gorgeous.

364
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,242
And these are mine.

365
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,370
Let's try them on.

366
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,963
-Let me try this necklace on too.
-Okay.

367
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,760
Done.

368
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,720
How do I look?

369
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,680
You look stunning. It looks great on you.

370
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,724
Thanks, Cho-won.

371
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,604
-Did you have dinner?
-Not yet.

372
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,154
-It looks so good.
-Thank you.

373
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,656
This is my favorite.

374
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,867
It's so good. How is it?

375
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,411
It's really delicious.

376
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,496
It's so good. Thank you, ma'am.

377
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,497
Enjoy.

378
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,916
I want some meat too.

379
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,212
-It's really good.
-Let me try some.

380
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,588
It's so good.

381
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:27,883
It's really good.

382
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,304
My favorite dishes are actually
bean paste stew and bulgogi.

383
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,472
-Really?
-Yes.

384
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,141
-Mine too.
-Really?

385
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,184
-We have the same taste.
-I knew it.

386
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,394
Enjoy.

387
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,816
It's delicious.

388
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,986
Eat up, Mom.

389
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,429
There you are. I was looking for you.

390
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,641
I'm sorry. I was looking around.

391
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,767
It's okay.

392
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,602
It's nice to see someone in this room.

393
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,064
This is my eldest daughter,
Ju-won's bedroom.

394
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,900
I'm not sure if Cho-won
told you about her.

395
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,696
Yes, she did.

396
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,995
But may I ask you

397
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,331
why you kept this room as it was?

398
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,796
Because she said she'd come back.

399
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,550
For some reason,

400
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,927
I always believed everything Ju-won said.

401
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,847
She had that kind of power.

402
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,687
I know it sounds absurd.

403
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,275
But I was reminded of her words
whenever I thought of cleaning it out.

404
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,779
I didn't want her to get hurt
if she ever does come back.

405
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,746
May I give you a hug?

406
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,839
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

407
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,757
How are you right now?

408
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,479
I'm…

409
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,899
happy.

410
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,237
Then it's all good now.

411
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:44,450
Yes.

412
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:47,953
It's all good now.

413
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,171
A carefree heart
that's ready to forget everything

414
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,673
and four words?

415
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,281
Bye, Seo-ha.

416
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,495
Bye, Ae-gyeong.

417
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,376
Bye, Mom.

418
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,378
Bye, Cho-won.

419
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,029
Bye,

420
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,031
Seo-ha.

421
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,006
It's all good now.

422
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:24,693
Hey, Do-yun.

423
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,030
I think we can begin now.

424
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,492
It's all ready.

425
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:33,869
All right.

426
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,370
She should return to the hotel.

427
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:36,872
Right.

428
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,145
Mr. Ha.

429
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,577
You stand out from everything else.

430
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,245
What?

431
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,956
To be honest,
it's been that way for some time now.

432
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,856
Do you know how cute you are?

433
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:47,984
Shall we?

434
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,878
You want an engineer to do marketing?

435
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,090
If you keep this up,
I'm transferring to another team again.

436
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,386
I'll meet with the marketing team
just this once.

437
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,888
Thank you for the gift card, though.

438
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,766
I have some free time,
so I'll shop a bit and eat before I go.

439
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,601
Understood.

440
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,110
How about this one?

441
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,279
I think it'll suit you.

442
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,531
Me?

443
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,454
I like it.

444
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:43,248
How is it?

445
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,168
It looks pretty.

446
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:47,878
But…

447
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,338
I think it'll also look good
as a shoulder bag.

448
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,800
Do I look good?

449
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:54,885
It suits you.

450
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,512
I don't even know you.

451
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,144
Did you hurt yourself?
That'll leave a scar.

452
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,061
This?

453
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,647
I got scratched this morning
while working on a vehicle.

454
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,690
It's nothing.

455
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:10,984
Are you an engineer?

456
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,403
How did you know?

457
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,490
Perhaps this meeting is fate.

458
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,283
Let me give you my business card.

459
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,870
I research tires, autonomous driving,
and engines at MI Mobity.

460
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,789
Ms. Ban Ji-eum?

461
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,874
Sorry?

462
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,669
I took a peek at it.

463
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,589
I'll give you mine too.

464
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,094
HILL OF CHO-WON

465
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,513
"Hill of Cho-won."

466
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,349
I love the name.

467
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,602
Cho-won.

468
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,273
Cho-won…

469
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,695
If you're looking for a good place to eat,

470
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,405
there's a great
braised kimchi place nearby.

471
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,241
I'm sure it'll suit your taste.

472
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,577
That's my favorite food.

473
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:03,620
I knew it.

474
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,167
I hope we meet again.

475
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,378
Okay.

476
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,302
Ms. Ban.

477
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,390
Let's meet again.

478
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,854
Okay, Ms. Cho-won.

479
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,978
AE-GYEONG'S BRAISED KIMCHI

480
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,062
This must be it.

481
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,862
Thank you for the food, ma'am.

482
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,788
This place just screams "good food."

483
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,001
Let's try the side dishes.

484
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:38,757
Why is it so good?

485
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:40,675
No way.

486
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,725
Ma'am, can I get some napkins?

487
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,566
Use this.

488
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,987
Oh, thank you.

489
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,448
I should thank you instead.

490
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,618
I didn't expect to
meet you here of all places.

491
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,579
Sorry? What do you mean?

492
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,631
My goodness.

493
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,054
You're still just as clumsy.

494
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,059
-See you around.
-Sorry?

495
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,228
I'm off, Ms. Kim.

496
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:34,938
Wait…

497
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,858
Don't forget to pick up
some kimchi on the weekend.

498
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,859
Okay.

499
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,407
All right. Here's your braised kimchi.

500
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:50,954
Wow, this looks amazing. Thank you.

501
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,126
Wow.

502
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,795
This tastes exactly like the ones I make.

503
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,091
How amazing. It's really tasty.

504
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,011
People might think
you taught me the recipe.

505
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,221
You're hilarious.

506
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,598
Come by often.

507
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:13,435
I'll serve you a feast every time.

508
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:16,062
And come by the weekends
to pick up some kimchi.

509
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,523
You've won yourself a regular.

510
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,066
Great!

511
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,236
Thank you for the meal. It's really good.

512
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,530
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

513
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,578
So good.

514
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:36,916
It's amazing.

515
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,915
Thank you. Did it come out nice?

516
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,291
-Yes.
-Take one of me too.

517
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,874
Is something down there?

518
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,501
Is something down there?

519
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,839
No, I just happened to look at it.

520
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,052
Didn't we meet at the…

521
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,971
Isn't that place so good?

522
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,350
Let me introduce myself.

523
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:21,062
I'm Mun Seo-ha, the CEO of MI Hotel.

524
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,858
I'm Ban Ji-eum,
a senior research engineer at MI Mobity.

525
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,652
I was told there was
a change in personnel, so--

526
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:29,195
I'm aware of that.

527
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,864
I was the one behind that.

528
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,241
Why?

529
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,994
Because I wanted to see you.

530
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,582
I wanted us to meet naturally,
but it was taking some time.

531
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,712
Have we perhaps…

532
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,715
met before the restaurant?

533
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,967
I think it was in 1997.

534
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,261
I wasn't born then.

535
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,347
A distant relative showed me some pictures

536
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,224
of someone who looked like you.

537
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,603
Well…

538
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,521
I understand that you're curious.

539
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,191
But I have no experience in marketing.

540
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,985
I'd appreciate it
if you could find another person.

541
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,987
If you're still unsure,

542
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,989
why don't you try dating me?

543
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,325
Sorry?

544
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,459
I'm sorry. I must have heard you wrong.

545
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,586
No, you haven't.

546
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:32,383
Consider it a trial run if you will.

547
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,301
Even so…

548
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:37,430
How could you ask a stranger out?

549
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,641
What if we're not strangers?

550
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,393
Will you

551
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,312
consider it then?

552
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,901
I was planning to take it slow.

553
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,988
But I don't want to let you go
now that I've seen you.

554
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,044
Are we wearing matching rings?

555
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,047
Are you seeing anyone?

556
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,549
No.

557
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,343
It's just a ring that I have.

558
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:18,221
Mine is meant for couples.

559
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,267
Are you seeing someone?

560
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,686
I think I am.

561
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,480
From this moment on.

562
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:30,775
What?

563
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,486
Ms. Ban.

564
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:38,324
I'll ask you out three times
from today on.

565
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,327
If you say no every time,

566
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,454
I'll give you up then and there.

567
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,501
You do understand…

568
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,672
that we just met today, right?

569
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,389
Will you date me?

570
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,853
Was that your first confession?

571
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:08,688
Yes.

572
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:10,815
That was my first confession

573
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,234
in this life.

574
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,923
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

575
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:55,044
