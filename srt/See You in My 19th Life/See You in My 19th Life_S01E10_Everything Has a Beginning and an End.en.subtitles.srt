1
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,970
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

2
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,019
It feels nice to leave everything behind.

3
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,855
When you want to leave,
you should just do it.

4
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,232
If not, you can't ever leave.
And you'll regret it.

5
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,236
It feels like leaving a battlefield.

6
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,697
I know exactly how that feels.

7
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,948
There was the Japanese invasion,

8
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,534
and wars in Spain
and the Goryeo Dynasty too.

9
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,245
You always tie everything
to your past lives.

10
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,331
Was I too old-fashioned?

11
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,751
You're from the old days.

12
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,010
I think that's the place.

13
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,890
So what you're saying is,

14
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,811
this was a place from your past life
a thousand years ago?

15
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,521
I only found out recently.

16
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,273
I only remember
bits and pieces of my first life,

17
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,192
mostly from seeing visions in my dreams.

18
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,403
Could I ask what you saw?

19
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,699
I saw a man walking toward me
through exploding fireworks.

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,034
A man?

21
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,663
What kind of man?

22
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,708
Are you jealous of a man
from a thousand years ago?

23
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,087
No, I'm not.

24
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,171
I was just…

25
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,465
asking about him because I was curious.

26
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,551
I don't know who he is yet either.

27
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,678
But since I still remember him,

28
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,513
he must have been quite special to me.

29
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,060
It's not something cheesy like
"love that lasts a thousand years," is it?

30
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,980
That sounds so good.

31
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,733
I'm going to be so excited
if I ever see him.

32
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,486
Come on.

33
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,369
Ji-eum.

34
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,129
I read it again and again.

35
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,007
The storybook in the jewelry box.

36
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,803
You said I was so special to you

37
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,056
that I could lift the rocks
that were burdening your heart.

38
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,603
I felt I had to reciprocate
after receiving such a confession.

39
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,609
Will you date me?

40
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,281
No.

41
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,575
What?

42
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,201
Why not?

43
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,622
Since you turned me down twice,
I'll do the same to you.

44
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,250
But I'll let you ask me
the same question in one go.

45
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,634
Will you date me?

46
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:39,677
No.

47
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,307
Ms. Ban.

48
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,518
Will you date me?

49
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,315
Yes, I will.

50
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,780
I want to date Mun Seo-ha.

51
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,205
Hold on.

52
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,917
I've never done this before, so…

53
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,171
Give me a minute. I'm almost done.

54
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,092
All done.

55
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,637
How do I look?

56
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,723
You look gorgeous.

57
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,643
-I have one more thing.
-One more?

58
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,813
Ta-da.

59
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,439
-Are they a set?
-Yes.

60
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,650
Let me try them on.

61
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,701
How do I look?

62
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,077
You look stunning.

63
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,373
This time,

64
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,875
stay by my side for a very long time.

65
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,793
No.

66
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,629
I'll stay by your side.

67
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,425
Okay.

68
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,136
I hope we get along well in this life too.

69
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,225
Yes, ma'am.

70
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,061
Let's go.

71
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,255
MUJINJEONG POND WATER FIREWORKS

72
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,662
It was somewhere around here.

73
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,324
What's wrong?

74
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,914
Are you not feeling well?

75
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,875
No, I just couldn't breathe all of a…

76
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,251
I'm fine now.

77
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,169
All right.

78
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:31,719
EVERYTHING HAS A BEGINNING AND AN END

79
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,735
Let's go see a doctor.

80
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,154
You were completely fine
until a moment ago.

81
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,657
Let's have them run some tests and…

82
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,117
I'm not dying.

83
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,496
Why would you say something like that?

84
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,830
Of course you aren't.

85
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,458
I'm sorry for worrying you.

86
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,252
But I'm really fine.

87
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,587
I think I just almost choked on something.

88
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,012
I'm really okay.

89
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,182
That's a relief but it was so sudden.

90
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,685
Director Mun.

91
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,354
Shall we head to our accommodation now?

92
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,399
Drink this first.

93
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,779
You scared me back there.

94
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,667
This is nice.

95
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,388
Director Mun.

96
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,308
What are you doing there?

97
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,935
Right.

98
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,814
It's more spacious
than it looked in the photos.

99
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,110
The faucet…

100
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,820
It works.

101
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,532
And the fridge…

102
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,201
It's empty.

103
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,079
Director Mun.

104
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,789
Shall we wash up now?

105
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,707
What?

106
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,125
Already?

107
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,377
Why?

108
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,964
We already had dinner,
so some wine would be nice.

109
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,674
And we'd be more comfortable washed up.

110
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,928
-Right.
-Do you want to go first?

111
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:40,931
Me?

112
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,100
-Or together?
-Okay.

113
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,186
What?

114
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,854
Should I go first?

115
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,943
Then let's do rock, paper, scissors.
Ready-or-not. Rock, paper, scissors.

116
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,612
Yes! I won.

117
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,826
You're so cute.

118
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,287
Where's the bedroom?

119
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,207
The bedroom? Over here.

120
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,337
You can wash up and sleep here.

121
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,092
Where are you going?

122
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,052
To my room.

123
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,847
Why are there two rooms?

124
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,767
Shouldn't we have two rooms
since there are two of us?

125
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,186
Of course not. One plus one is one.

126
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,147
We've also slept together
when we were little.

127
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,483
You can sleep with me in my room.

128
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,235
Me too.

129
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,239
Cho-won was there too.

130
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,699
Anyway, let's reminisce
about the good old days

131
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,076
and sleep together.

132
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,260
Go wash up.

133
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,973
Okay.

134
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,410
There's a lot of talk, isn't there?

135
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,705
There are quite a few articles
and comments, so…

136
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,665
THE IMPACT OF DIRECTOR LEE'S CONFESSIONS…

137
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,083
It'll die down soon.

138
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:36,589
People eventually lose interest
in other people's misfortunes.

139
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,176
The problem is that's not the only thing
they're interested in.

140
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:47,016
They're just commenting on your looks.
They don't care about the article.

141
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,393
"Mun Seo-ha is so handsome."

142
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,645
"He must've been a hero in his past life."

143
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,815
Oh, come on.
I was the hero in my past life.

144
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,069
What's it to them
if you're a bachelor or not?

145
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,199
I guess your father will have
countless potential daughters-in-law.

146
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,039
I'm sorry.

147
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,792
It's nothing to be sorry about.

148
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,671
Ju-won was the one
who needed justice the most,

149
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,174
but I can't do anything for her.

150
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,178
You revealed the truth.

151
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,600
Any apology wouldn't have mattered
to Ju-won who's already passed.

152
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:31,852
Also…

153
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,146
I was greatly consoled by you.

154
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,732
When?

155
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,734
Ban Hak-su.

156
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,403
CONFIRMATION OF DEBT REPAYMENT

157
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,488
How could this happen?

158
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,241
My father was the one
who killed me in my past life.

159
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,660
I know you burned it
because he was my father.

160
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,955
I just didn't want you to know.

161
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,374
No matter how distant you were from him,

162
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,211
knowing that fact
would have hurt you nonetheless.

163
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,007
Seo-ha.

164
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,552
You're all grown up now.

165
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,934
I'm older than you, Ji-eum.

166
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,190
Cheers.

167
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,648
Su.

168
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,658
He's Master Han-ya from the shrine.

169
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:32,491
SU, HAN-YA…

170
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,454
I was Su.

171
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,709
Then there was Han-ya from the shrine
who looked like Seo-ha.

172
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,425
But who was it that called my name?

173
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,480
SU, HAN-YA…

174
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,956
Are you really the man
from a thousand years ago?

175
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,883
Do you want to sleep with me that bad?

176
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,016
I'll let you then.

177
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,178
There's only one place left.

178
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,981
OKAY, I'LL FINISH THINGS UP

179
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,672
Do-yun.

180
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,300
You look tired these days.

181
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,802
So I saved up my allowance
and bought this.

182
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,597
This is good for your joints.

183
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,766
And it's also good for a broken heart.

184
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,936
Have one.

185
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,898
Come on, just open up.

186
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,824
Should we eat out tonight?

187
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,702
Do the dishes.

188
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,412
I'm off.

189
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,748
Have a good day.

190
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,665
Okay.

191
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,128
He seems fine.

192
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:25,849
Jeez, that's salty.

193
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,895
He's definitely out of it.

194
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,116
So this place can show me my past life?

195
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:49,915
There.

196
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,879
Your face is all over the news.

197
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,009
All right then.
Let's go see your past life.

198
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,137
Your grand past life.

199
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,315
What is…

200
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,568
You said you were a turtle
in your past life.

201
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,990
This is a magical rock
that looks like a turtle.

202
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,284
It instantly reminded me of you.

203
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,537
You insisted that you used to be
a turtle in your past life.

204
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,415
You remember that?

205
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,876
Most memories
from my past lives are vivid.

206
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,170
Even more so if they were special.

207
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,880
What were some special memories?

208
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,718
When I beheaded
an enemy commander during a war.

209
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,223
I also wrote a great song.

210
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,392
You know it.

211
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,146
I've also achieved
several feats in the palace.

212
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,147
The palace?

213
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:01,069
Were you a king in one of your past lives?

214
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,531
There were many different jobs
in the palace.

215
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,744
I suddenly feel more respect for you.

216
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,081
But one memory trumps them all.

217
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,919
You're my most special memory.

218
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,382
You're blushing.

219
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,135
No, I'm not.

220
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,388
It's just too hot.

221
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,850
I don't think so.
I think you're getting shy.

222
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,438
No, I'm not.

223
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,995
Were you scared?

224
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,538
-No.
-Your hands are sweaty.

225
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,540
-My body is naturally hot.
-Why are they so sweaty?

226
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,541
Is that so?

227
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,262
Isn't it so radiant?

228
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,099
Thank you

229
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,767
for bringing me here.

230
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,729
Come to think of it,

231
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,774
all the people from my past lives
that I met in this life

232
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,609
are so special.

233
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,320
It must've been hard to believe me.

234
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,740
But they still did and even consoled me.

235
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,245
It feels like I've been rewarded

236
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,414
for all the pain I felt

237
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,625
from my past lives.

238
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:50,178
It must have been tough, Ms. Ban.

239
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,518
You're so warm.

240
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,993
LEE JI-SEOK

241
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,541
Why aren't you picking up?

242
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,378
I think I know why he's calling.

243
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,047
It's obvious why they want to meet.

244
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,093
Even still,
there could be some business talk.

245
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,305
Wouldn't you need this for the hotel?

246
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,391
I did show up a few times.

247
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,186
And I got into a fight twice.

248
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,480
You fought? Why?

249
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,819
It bothered me how they mistreated Do-yun.

250
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,911
He's more than just competent.

251
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,040
People who don't know
say that Do-yun is the one sticking to me.

252
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:01,833
But the truth is,

253
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,128
I'm the one who's sticking to him.

254
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,219
You guys are together
because you both wanted it.

255
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,597
Relationships can only be maintained
when the feeling is mutual.

256
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,267
See?

257
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,562
I was just thinking of Ae-gyeong
and look who's calling me.

258
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,942
Hi, Ae-gyeong.

259
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,151
This is Min-gi.

260
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,030
Hello.

261
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,324
Why do you have her phone?

262
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,035
Ms. Kim is at the hospital right now.

263
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:38,828
What did you say?

264
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,140
-What?
-What do you mean?

265
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,141
How far are you?

266
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,559
From where?

267
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,104
I told you Ga-hui is handing out
her wedding invitations today.

268
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,897
She said you guys talked last week.

269
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:07,816
That's right.

270
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,568
She's waiting for you.
You're coming, right?

271
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,990
Okay.

272
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,866
Take your time and come quickly.

273
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,744
What did she say?

274
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,538
Cho-won is coming.

275
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,956
Of course she should.

276
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,125
Seo-ha isn't picking up.

277
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,042
Maybe he's busy.

278
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,836
His secretary would know.

279
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:30,964
I hope he can make it.

280
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,010
DAEHWAN LEE JI-SEOK

281
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,976
DAEHWAN LEE JI-SEOK

282
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,446
I'm looking for Kim Ae-gyeong.

283
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,532
That way.

284
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,117
Thank you.

285
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:09,836
You're here.

286
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,425
Ae-gyeong.

287
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,849
How long did they say it's been?

288
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,392
It's been a while.

289
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,480
Did you already know about this?

290
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,900
She insisted that I keep it a secret.

291
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,902
Even still, how could you not…

292
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,701
I'll go speak to her doctor.

293
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,767
-Cho-won!
-Cho-won!

294
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,478
-Hey.
-What took you so long?

295
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,565
What was that?

296
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,902
You're literally at every meeting.

297
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,321
Wherever you are, I'll be there too.

298
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,367
-They look good together.
-What was that?

299
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,203
You might become
Daehwan Group's daughter-in-law.

300
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,539
-I'll toss my bouquet to you.
-Hey. Cut it out.

301
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,501
Our group is considering
buying stocks in your family's company.

302
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,628
If our companies end up working together,

303
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,713
then you and I
will naturally see each other more often.

304
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,424
Wouldn't that be nice?

305
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:38,967
In your dreams.

306
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,344
I'm not into meeting people that way.

307
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,763
-There you go again.
-Who is that?

308
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,348
He's my style.

309
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,564
Mr. Ha.

310
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,233
Hey, Do-yun.

311
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,901
You actually came.

312
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,447
But you should've sent
Seo-ha here instead.

313
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,031
What do you mean?

314
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,783
He said Seo-ha can't make it

315
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,535
and asked if you could
send the invite separately.

316
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,079
So I reminded him
of how important this gathering was.

317
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,707
Ga-hui, your family owns
an airline, resorts, restaurants,

318
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,250
and even a distribution company.

319
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,586
I told him not to disappoint
the chief of Yuhan Group

320
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,755
and to show some dedication.

321
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,674
But the mere secretary showed up.

322
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,801
-Ji-seok.
-What?

323
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,517
I'll be receiving the invite
for Director Mun on his behalf.

324
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,729
Please understand
that he's out of the city for business.

325
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,064
I'll ask him to give you a call.

326
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,400
Sure.

327
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,282
You should have some
since you're here anyway.

328
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:45,825
No, thank you.

329
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,620
Hey, just eat.

330
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,121
There's a lot we haven't eaten.

331
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,873
This one's good.

332
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,708
Or have a drink.

333
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,085
Drink up. I'll pour it for you.

334
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,546
You should watch how much you drink.

335
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,924
You're making a sight of yourself.

336
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,718
What?

337
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,850
What's with him today?

338
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,644
That's enough. You're drunk.

339
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,521
She's right. Just sit down.

340
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,356
-Sit down.
-Okay.

341
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,822
You'll only attract lousy men
if you're that naive.

342
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,075
I said that's enough.
You don't even know him well.

343
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,952
-What's wrong?
-What's going on?

344
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,537
-What?
-How do you know him?

345
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,207
He has a knack
for detecting wealthy people.

346
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,417
-He's trying to get to Cho-won.
-That's enough.

347
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,753
And she's just too naive.

348
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,296
How dare he?

349
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,466
What do you know about him?

350
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,469
Tell me.

351
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,347
He has a knack
for detecting wealthy people?

352
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,016
Seeing as how he sticks to Seo-ha and me
but not to you,

353
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,185
you really must be a good-for-nothing.

354
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,396
Hey, that's a little--

355
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,939
What makes you so great?

356
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,525
What do you possibly have
other than rich parents?

357
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,986
Why do you humiliate him? It's upsetting.

358
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,031
Hey, I'm a little upset too.

359
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,534
I was just worried about you.

360
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,329
-We all are.
-Come on, let's just enjoy ourselves.

361
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:15,957
I'm sorry.

362
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,501
Can you give me the invitation next time?

363
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,712
-Wait. Cho-won.
-Cho-won.

364
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:21,963
-Cho-won.
-You're leaving?

365
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,942
Do you know who people gossip about more
whenever I'm with Seo-ha?

366
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:44,903
Me.

367
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,197
They gossip about
how much they have compared to me.

368
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,908
I'm used to it.

369
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,536
But that doesn't mean I'm fine with it.

370
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,705
I endure it because I chose this.

371
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,460
Just hearing them
talk about him was upsetting.

372
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,882
I can't imagine how he must've felt.

373
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:44,754
WORLD-CLASS ACTS
DONGBAEK CIRCUS TROUPE

374
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,900
-Uncle!
-Oh, no!

375
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,319
Promise me.

376
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,406
Promise that you'll be born again

377
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,449
and will come to protect me.

378
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:16,869
I promise.

379
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,580
Come here.

380
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,504
I enjoyed rolling the ball

381
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,719
I was happy when I sang

382
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,643
With white makeup on and a red nose

383
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:46,774
I sang of love

384
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,029
Goodness.

385
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,865
Time passed by so quickly.

386
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:03,124
Where have your chubby cheeks gone?

387
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,835
They didn't go anywhere.

388
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,254
They just disappeared with time.

389
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,758
You're awake.

390
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,343
I guess you found out.

391
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,015
Look at you.

392
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,394
I'm fine. It's nothing serious.

393
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,773
I'm sorry I didn't know.

394
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,151
I was too distracted.

395
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,778
Don't be sorry.

396
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,238
People your age should be busy dating.

397
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,782
You guys looked good together.

398
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,202
That's not important right now.

399
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,873
How long were you going to hide this?
You should've told me.

400
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:48,252
There was nothing to tell you.
Even the doctor didn't know what I had.

401
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,381
I always get better
after getting an injection.

402
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,968
There's no illness without a cause.

403
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,179
I told the doctor
that we're going to a bigger hospital.

404
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,557
Don't you worry about a thing.

405
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,893
Let's just do as I say, okay?

406
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,522
I guess

407
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,525
you were pretty scared, Uncle.

408
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,280
How could I not be when you're sick?

409
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,619
You've lived so many lives.

410
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,081
You must've seen a lot of sick people.

411
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,960
Many must've died too.

412
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,755
But now I've made you worry.

413
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,134
I'm sorry, Uncle.

414
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,387
Cut the nonsense.

415
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,348
Just focus on getting better, okay?

416
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,101
Okay. I will.

417
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,562
So don't you worry.

418
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,275
It's normal to get sick
from time to time when you're old.

419
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,734
It's natural.

420
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,280
People come and go.

421
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,284
And I could return like you have.

422
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,704
No.

423
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,497
Don't leave.

424
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,419
Just stay here for now.

425
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,506
Don't go anywhere.

426
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,008
Just stay.

427
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,803
Stay by my side…

428
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,098
for as long as possible, Ae-gyeong.

429
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,707
You're late.

430
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,586
I had a present to give.

431
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,505
Though I don't know how helpful it'll be.

432
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,257
Ms. Kim…

433
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,093
is hospitalized.

434
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,930
-What?
-I saw it coming.

435
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,556
Perhaps…

436
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,392
this could make it easier to persuade her.

437
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,811
I should've just told Ju-won the truth.

438
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,901
This is something I have to do,

439
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,403
and something Ms. Ban needs to solve.

440
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,908
Seo-ha will also be okay
as long as everything works out.

441
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,036
She'll be pretty shocked.

442
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,623
You should just go on your way.

443
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,500
You don't need to…

444
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,045
remember your past lives anymore.

445
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,340
The life you wanted is right ahead of you,
so stop looking back.

446
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,760
Don't worry.

447
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,614
I finished seeing my first life.

448
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,992
What do I need to do now?

449
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,329
I'll tell you what to do.

450
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,082
And…

451
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,126
what comes afterward.

452
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,461
There's something afterward?

453
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,131
Yes.

454
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,553
I just arrived home.

455
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,513
I couldn't even say goodbye to you.

456
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,598
I'm sorry.

457
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,850
It must be tough for you.

458
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,102
Maybe I should've just stayed.

459
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,231
I can endure this much by myself.

460
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:24,737
Ji-eum.

461
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,489
Yes, Seo-ha?

462
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,115
When…

463
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,870
you feel like counting leaves,

464
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:34,955
just call me.

465
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,086
I don't know what to say to console you,

466
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,879
but I do know one thing.

467
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,256
Which is?

468
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,219
How terrifying it is…

469
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,597
when your beloved family is sick.

470
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,018
So…

471
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,853
just call me anytime.

472
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,190
I'll give you a hug

473
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,067
and keep you company.

474
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,406
Okay.

475
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,409
Don't skip meals. I'll call you again.

476
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,982
Don't go next time.

477
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,484
The hotel needs Yuhan Group.

478
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,654
And Chief Cheon Ga-hui
isn't too bad either.

479
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,364
I was there for work.

480
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,034
Even still,
I should be the one who attends.

481
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,538
All right then.

482
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,792
I didn't expect you to comply right away.

483
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,714
I suddenly didn't like the fact
that I was there.

484
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,594
That's good then.

485
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,179
Is Ms. Jang in?

486
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,347
You're going there?

487
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,058
I'm finishing things up.

488
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,982
STANDARD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

489
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,361
What about this?

490
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,614
You're quite bold

491
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,783
for someone who has committed
one too many corrupt deeds.

492
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,119
The same goes for all other
conglomerate families.

493
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,830
I bet your father has committed
far more than I have.

494
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,332
This hotel is mine.

495
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,586
Do you know just how much
I've taken care of this place?

496
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,421
I thought you'd say that.

497
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,134
I took these on my first day here.

498
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,222
I'm afraid those photos

499
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,225
clearly show just how much

500
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,310
you haven't taken care of this hotel.

501
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:06,023
This hotel was neglected by the group
and I protected it for over 20 years.

502
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,776
Right.

503
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:10,986
This was…

504
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,864
my mother's notebook.

505
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,459
CONCLUSION
MEETING AGENDA

506
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,590
DAEHAN PUBLIC BANK
SINSEONG BANK

507
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,052
They're the slush funds that you swindled.

508
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,388
My mother knew

509
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,431
that you'd ultimately

510
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,767
bring down this hotel.

511
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,274
I admit to the poor management
of the hotel.

512
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:53,112
But I've climbed up here step by step
on the very stairs of this hotel.

513
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:57,366
This hotel could've been long gone
but I protected it.

514
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,703
You only protected your position.

515
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:04,665
The position you stole from a patient
by trampling on her every weakness.

516
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,297
Who do you think took care of your mom
when she was sick?

517
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,883
Her son was too young
and she wasn't close with her husband.

518
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,136
She would've rather died

519
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:21,181
than show her weakness to others
and guess who took care of her?

520
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,231
I never trampled on your mom.

521
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,318
I was envious of what she had.

522
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,487
And I worked hard to get it.

523
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,993
You just coveted
what she had and stole it.

524
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,995
You were a coward

525
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,247
who stole from someone who was sick.

526
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,708
You took advantage of my uncle

527
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:51,128
and threatened my father
for what you wanted.

528
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,757
I will be taking legal action
regarding this misconduct.

529
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,841
So save your energy

530
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,886
for the trial.

531
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:14,943
Are you done?

532
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,200
Where did you even get those documents
from more than 20 years ago?

533
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:22,951
It was a gift.

534
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,453
A gift?

535
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:33,420
IT'S A GIFT

536
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,842
You sure it wasn't you?

537
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,053
The documents I found
were from recent years.

538
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,763
I thought it was from you.

539
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,807
Then I would've said so and got a bonus.

540
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,434
Perhaps Chairman Mun…

541
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,146
-I doubt it.
-I doubt it.

542
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,067
Ms. Jang will try to convince
the board at all costs.

543
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,987
She'd rather die
than see me manage this hotel.

544
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,672
You already spoke with him, didn't you?

545
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,508
Let's go.

546
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,728
After all I've been through…

547
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,314
I won't sit still.

548
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,192
The board has all agreed

549
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,447
to dismiss you from your position.

550
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,031
Sir.

551
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,825
The police are waiting downstairs.

552
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,871
The elevators are under maintenance.

553
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,124
So you climbed up here
on the stairs of this hotel?

554
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,170
Climb them down as you leave.

555
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,426
Sir.

556
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,845
Please help me.

557
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:06,722
Sir…

558
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:33,624
Yeon-ok.

559
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,001
I think these are the prettiest.

560
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,127
Gladiolas.

561
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,841
Do you know what these flowers mean?

562
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,328
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

563
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,496
Goodbye.

564
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,502
Farewell, Seo-ha.

565
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:11,805
Who…

566
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,061
It's a gift.

567
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,526
Seo-ha, you must have been
a turtle in your past life.

568
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:57,411
Stop.

569
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,704
Stop what?

570
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,580
I told you to just sit still.

571
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,999
Why should I for goodness' sake?

572
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,127
Jeez, you never listen.

573
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,296
Come on. I'm fine when I'm not in pain.

574
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,840
Don't treat me like a kid.

575
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,426
You are a kid from today on, okay?

576
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,345
I'm going to take care of you
like Uncle Jung-ho did.

577
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,680
That's that.

578
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,640
Unbelievable.

579
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,517
You took off the scarf again.

580
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,437
It's so suffocating.

581
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,940
I told you to keep your neck warm
so you don't get a cold.

582
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:29,985
You used to get colds all the time
and have a runny nose.

583
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:33,947
Goodness. You never listened to me once.

584
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,284
AE-GYEONG'S BRAISED KIMCHI

585
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,043
Mr. Kang Min-gi.

586
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,133
Ae-gyeong needs to be hospitalized
for a few more days.

587
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,344
So the restaurant will be closed for now.

588
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,430
We might close it down for good.

589
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,767
I think you should look for
another place to stay.

590
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,187
I'm sorry it's so sudden.

591
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,396
It doesn't matter.

592
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:10,192
I wasn't planning on
staying for long anyway.

593
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,531
What did the doctor say?

594
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,785
They didn't know the reason
for her chest pain before.

595
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,453
So they couldn't diagnose her.

596
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,790
But they found a lump this time around.

597
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,335
They'll run some tests
and see if surgery will be necessary.

598
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,086
And?

599
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,799
Would that keep her alive?

600
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,095
We'll have to see, but…

601
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,519
What's with that attitude?

602
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,520
Ms. Kim…

603
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,522
won't get better with the surgery.

604
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,571
What do you think you're doing right now?

605
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,825
Why the hell would you say that?

606
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:00,992
Because I've seen it.

607
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:07,415
I've also experienced the consequences
of reuniting with those…

608
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,002
from my past lives.

609
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,673
Just get to the point.

610
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,591
If you were normal,

611
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,803
you wouldn't have looked for Ms. Kim
when you were little.

612
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:23,640
She wouldn't have known
that you used to be her uncle.

613
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,141
And that would've been natural.

614
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,727
Reconnecting with those from the past

615
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,856
will only cause problems.

616
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,482
And normally, the ones who suffer

617
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,401
are not us who remember our past lives,

618
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,863
but them.

619
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,532
So you're saying…

620
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:45,453
Ae-gyeong is sick
because I reunited with her?

621
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,415
Is that it?

622
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,836
It wouldn't have been as bad
if you were enemies in the past.

623
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,548
Because you would've had
something to resolve.

624
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,676
But fond connections are different.

625
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:02,387
You have to let those relationships go.

626
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,893
Do you expect me to believe this nonsense?

627
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,770
It doesn't matter!
I'm speaking from experience!

628
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,815
Can't you see?

629
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,984
If you continue on,

630
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:20,113
Ms. Kim could even die.

631
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:23,825
"Enemies"? "Fond connections"?

632
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,160
This is my 19th life.

633
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,705
I've reconnected with my past
multiple times.

634
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,041
And have you ever been with someone
for this long?

635
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,043
And lived like family members?

636
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,547
Can you even say…

637
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,967
that this life is a new life for you?

638
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,971
Aren't you just clinging onto
your past relationships?

639
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,942
Ms. Kim's not the only one, is she?

640
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,820
People from your past
whom you've reconnected with.

641
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,575
Those people…

642
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,537
will meet the same fate as Ms. Kim.

643
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,213
Who are you?

644
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,510
Who in the world are you?

645
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,429
I want you to find peace.

646
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,519
I want to help you.

647
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,773
You still have a chance.

648
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:40,235
A chance to stop remembering
your past lives.

649
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,114
You still do.

650
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,785
The answer is in your first life.

651
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,373
So you must remember everything.

652
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,209
If you can do that,

653
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,211
everything will be resolved.

654
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,465
AE-GYEONG'S BRAISED KIMCHI

655
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,773
There's only one way
to stop remembering your past lives

656
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:21,568
and save Ms. Kim.

657
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:32,972
Su.

658
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,226
Su.

659
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,037
It was Cho-won.

660
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,375
She was the one who called me.

661
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,904
Is Ji-eum here?

662
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,492
So we meet again.

663
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:39,289
Have we met before?

664
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,666
It seemed like it at the hospital too.

665
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,002
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

666
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,213
You could still tell me.

667
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:53,344
She's in her room.

668
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,221
Okay.

669
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,165
Seol.

670
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:52,654
I need to save her.

671
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,157
I must save her.

672
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:27,605
Ji-eum.

673
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:34,571
Are you okay?

674
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,122
A person is dying before you!

675
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,667
So how could the heavens
or rituals be more important?

676
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:52,589
Ji-eum.

677
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,465
What use are the heavens…

678
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,595
if there are no people to worship them?

679
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:17,530
Seol…

680
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,543
Seol…

681
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:36,591
-What do I do…
-You're okay.

682
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:39,677
-You're okay, Ji-eum.
-No…

683
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,766
Seol!

684
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:48,895
It's okay.

685
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,692
I'll kill you.

686
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:56,986
I'll kill you.

687
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,405
I'll kill you.

688
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,157
I'll kill you.

689
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,533
Ji-eum.

690
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:03,951
I'll kill you.

691
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,828
-Ji-eum.
-I'll kill you!

692
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,372
I'll kill you!

693
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,499
I'll kill you!

694
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:15,022
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

695
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,400
Do you also know about past lives?

696
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:20,737
I'm in Ms. Ban's first life that she saw.

697
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:22,697
And so are you.

698
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,242
It'll be even harder for me
to get close to him.

699
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,952
What do I do now?

700
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,871
Stop mulling things over.

701
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,998
Don't be scared and just do it.

702
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:35,626
If Cho-won really lets you go
for the last time,

703
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,212
it'll be you
who won't be able to let her go.

704
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,298
Please help Ms. Ban

705
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,258
become normal.

706
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:45,928
I'll be by your side
no matter what choice you make.

707
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:52,935
