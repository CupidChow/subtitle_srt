00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,970
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

2
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:56,139
Please stand by!

3
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,317
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

4
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,593
Don't go.

5
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,011
Don't go, Ju-won.

6
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,027
Ms. Yoon.

7
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,738
You should head home.

8
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,407
You can give that to me.

9
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,993
All right.

10
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,309
He was in the backseat
during the accident.

11
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,730
So I think he only sits in the front
and can't drive either.

12
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,531
I'm getting fed up, so please stop it.

13
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,076
No! I don't want him here!

14
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,247
Ju-won died while she was with Seo-ha.

15
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,525
Seo-ha.

16
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,700
I'm sorry.

17
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,659
Mun Seo-ha.

18
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,872
Why would you still have this?

19
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:41,864
AM I THE BUTTERFLY OR IS THE BUTTERFLY ME?

20
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,922
AE-GYEONG'S BRAISED KIMCHI

21
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:55,772
What's the matter?

22
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,815
I had that dream again.

23
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,818
It's been a while since the last time.

24
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,490
Whenever you have that dream,
I feel bad the whole day.

25
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,159
Wait here.

26
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,368
I'll get you some water.

27
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,084
What's wrong?

28
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,752
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

29
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,879
Goodness, my age
is making my whole body ache.

30
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,846
WEBTOON ORIGINAL SERIES
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE CREATED BY LEE HEY

31
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,157
Director Mun.

32
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,685
Seo-ha.

33
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,062
Seo-ha.

34
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,377
Hey, Mun Seo-ha!

35
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,312
Mun Seo-ha.

36
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,316
What happened to your hand? Are you okay?

37
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,571
What's wrong?

38
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,158
Ms. Ban…

39
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,620
Never mind.

40
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,664
I'll take the day off today.

41
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,390
-Hello--
-What did you do to Seo-ha yesterday?

42
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,391
What is it?

43
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,518
Why did he drink
to the point of blacking out?

44
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,687
Did something happen to him?

45
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,855
He didn't drink with me.

46
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,526
Who did he drink with then?

47
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,444
With Ms. Ban.

48
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,656
Ms. Ban.

49
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,908
All right then.

50
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,396
What are you doing?

51
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,816
Look here, boy.

52
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,194
It hurts.

53
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,111
Does it?

54
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,197
Getting hit by a car
would hurt a thousand times more.

55
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,823
So don't walk like a zombie,

56
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,825
and watch where you're going.

57
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,661
Walk like a human, okay?

58
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:02,995
Okay.

59
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,580
Go.

60
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,085
Keep your head up.

61
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:12,922
Ju-won.

62
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,676
You grew up well.

63
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,106
Could it be…

64
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,633
Seo-ha.

65
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,179
She was definitely crying.

66
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,932
There's no resemblance at all.

67
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,475
They look so different.

68
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,272
I could just kiss you.

69
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,565
Shall we kiss?

70
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,694
When I'm with her,

71
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,904
my worries melt away and I feel relieved.

72
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,827
If this is what love is,

73
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,287
can I let myself feel it?

74
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,130
Am I allowed to feel these emotions

75
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,631
just like everybody else?

76
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:54,899
Seo-ha!

77
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,497
Seo-ha!

78
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,250
Seo-ha!

79
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,045
Seo-ha.

80
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,551
Cho-won.

81
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,346
I thought you were dead!

82
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,045
He didn't answer my calls,
so I got worried.

83
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,964
I'm sorry.

84
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,524
Are you okay?

85
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,278
I'm not.

86
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,412
I think I like Ms. Ban.

87
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,622
What?

88
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,083
What are you talking about?

89
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,252
I'm confused too.

90
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,631
I was trying to organize my thoughts,

91
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,718
then Cho-won came.

92
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,219
You…

93
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,805
Do you know how many people
were worried because of you?

94
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,183
And if you like her, then that's it.

95
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,311
Why are you making
such a big deal out of it?

96
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,564
She keeps reminding me of Ju-won

97
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,736
and it's driving me crazy.

98
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,034
This is killing me.

99
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,754
I'd like a club sandwich

100
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,589
on honey oat bread
with all the vegetables.

101
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,798
All right.

102
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,887
-Thank you.
-Enjoy your food.

103
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,846
Thanks.

104
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,184
Mr. Ha.

105
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,730
Isn't it your day off?

106
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,023
What brings you here?

107
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,567
I stopped by on my way home

108
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,777
from the office.

109
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,489
I had to stop by the site
because I left something there.

110
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,505
Did you get home safely last night?

111
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,216
Yes, I did.

112
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,178
How's Seo-ha?

113
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,014
He's neither good nor bad right now.

114
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,266
I'd like to talk to him.

115
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,309
Would it be possible?

116
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,437
I'll ask him.

117
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,941
Please excuse me.

118
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,234
I have to be somewhere.

119
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,009
DO-YUN

120
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,678
Seo-ha and I are
going for a drive at 2 p.m.

121
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,388
Let me know if you want to come.

122
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,150
Ms. Ban, would you like to
go to the beach?

123
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,860
What's been on your mind?

124
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,780
I was wondering…

125
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,325
why someone keeps calling me by my name.

126
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,161
Who?

127
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,457
You, Ms. Ban.

128
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,419
I'm your superior at work and much older.

129
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,630
So why do you keep calling me by my name?

130
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:12,883
I did?

131
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,595
-When did I--
-You did that day.

132
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,264
And also on that day.

133
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,809
Seo-ha.

134
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,686
Seo-ha.

135
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,815
Do you

136
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,109
tend to cry when you get drunk?

137
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,742
I'm not sure why you cry.

138
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,537
But at the same time,

139
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,373
I feel like I know why for some reason.

140
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,301
Director Mun.

141
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,305
Would you like to date me?

142
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,353
That was my first confession.

143
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,481
You can take your time to answer.

144
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,834
Director Mun.

145
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,878
Shall we dance?

146
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:40,095
You don't have to do anything.

147
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,390
What's going on?

148
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,108
Are those two dating?

149
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,819
I'm not sure.

150
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,198
I hope

151
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,159
they're dating.

152
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:02,928
Together.

153
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,597
Oh, goodness.

154
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:08,892
It's raining.

155
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,202
-Are you okay?
-Ms. Ban, are you okay?

156
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,329
-You must be cold.
-No, I'm fine.

157
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,165
Let's stay somewhere until the rain stops.

158
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,668
What about our vacation house?

159
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,086
It's close by.

160
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,796
No, it's all right.

161
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,591
Let's just go.

162
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,801
Let's go.

163
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,406
Ms. Ban, take a warm shower first.

164
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,074
The bathroom's right there.

165
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:06,992
Then excuse me.

166
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,161
I'll get you some towels.

167
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,078
Come in.

168
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,926
She keeps reminding me of Ju-won.

169
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,612
-Where's Ms. Ban?
-She's asleep.

170
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,947
It's a good thing she got dry.

171
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,200
Are you okay?

172
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,417
Can I watch the fire with you?

173
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,088
Sure.

174
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,783
Seo-ha.

175
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:32,953
Seo-ha.

176
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,834
No! I don't want him here!

177
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,170
Ju-won died while she was with Seo-ha.

178
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,258
What if you die too, Mom?

179
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,467
I'm not going to die.

180
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,719
Cho-won, I'm not going to die.

181
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:54,516
-Ju-won.
-I'm not going to die.

182
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,269
You and Ju-won are very similar.

183
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,565
I often thought, "If she were alive,

184
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,651
would she look like you?"

185
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,239
"Would she smile like you?"

186
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,077
That's why I couldn't bear to see you.

187
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:22,878
I'm sorry.

188
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,384
Thank you for telling me.

189
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,706
AE-GYEONG'S BRAISED KIMCHI

190
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,430
I'm sorry but we're closed for the day.

191
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,227
Are you still looking for a part-timer?

192
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,520
Are you interested in working here?

193
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,277
Ma'am! Are you all right?

194
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,695
Ma'am.

195
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,800
Ju-won!

196
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,593
Cho-won, you'll slip.

197
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,804
-You should dry off first.
-No!

198
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,973
-Get over here, Cho-won.
-I don't want to.

199
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,853
One.

200
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,604
Two.

201
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,648
Three.

202
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:50,984
Four.

203
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,403
Five.

204
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,405
Six.

205
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:57,991
Seven.

206
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,784
Eight.

207
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,370
Nine.

208
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,205
Ten.

209
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,847
She still hasn't found it.

210
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,686
It's so dusty.

211
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,085
Goodness.

212
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,778
There it is.

213
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,697
Keep your feet flat.

214
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,408
There we go.

215
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,952
JUNE 12, 1997
JANUARY 2, 1997

216
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:27,163
Ju-won, I grew so much.

217
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,709
JUNE 12, 1997
JANUARY 2, 1997

218
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,343
How do you know about that, Ms. Ban?

219
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,769
How do you know about it?

220
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,191
Ms. Ban.

221
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,069
What were you doing here?

222
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,780
Well, I…

223
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,159
I woke up and used the bathroom.

224
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,535
Then I had a look around.

225
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,456
Then what did you mean
when you said, "There it is"?

226
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,422
I was looking for my hair tie.

227
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,424
I had lost it somewhere here.

228
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,356
Director Mun.

229
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,655
I couldn't sleep so I'm going for a walk.

230
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,574
Well then.

231
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,492
Seo-ha.

232
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,076
It's raining outside.

233
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,994
Don't worry.

234
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,470
What about this?

235
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,475
How did you find this?

236
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,729
The grandfather clock was so beautiful

237
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,272
so I was taking a look, when…

238
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,901
This…

239
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,028
My sister had hidden it.

240
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,865
But I could never find it.

241
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,536
I see.

242
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,122
I'm sorry for rummaging.

243
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,848
How do you know about that, Ms. Ban?

244
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,725
What's going on?

245
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,103
Director Mun.

246
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,428
You're sick.

247
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,597
Why did you come out?

248
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,933
I took some medicine and slept it off.

249
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,896
Ms. Ban.

250
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,151
Do you know how strange you are?

251
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,450
Am I really that strange?

252
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,872
You said I was your first love.

253
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,084
My first love didn't work out.

254
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,464
It will be the same for you.

255
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,052
Is this your answer

256
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,596
to my confession?

257
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,313
Yes.

258
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,573
Oh, goodness.

259
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,700
Hey, kid.

260
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,579
Wake up.

261
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:22,959
Are you awake now?

262
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,877
What's going on?

263
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,548
Were you here next to me the entire time?

264
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,092
Yes, I couldn't just leave you.

265
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,593
My goodness.

266
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,221
Young people like you are rare.

267
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,766
How long was I unconscious?

268
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,855
About five hours.

269
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,231
Oh, my goodness.

270
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,609
I haven't finished
cleaning up the restaurant yet.

271
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,569
Oh, dear.

272
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,072
Goodness me.

273
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,326
No one saw me, right?

274
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,245
No.

275
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,580
You didn't have your phone,

276
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,998
so I couldn't call anyone
to be your guardian.

277
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,124
That's good.

278
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,627
Don't tell anyone

279
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,421
about what happened to me today.

280
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,424
Who would I tell?

281
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,009
Just don't tell anyone.

282
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,136
It's better they don't know.

283
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,686
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

284
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,229
Thank you.

285
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,399
But…

286
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,444
since when were you this sick?

287
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,571
It's been quite a while.

288
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,032
But they couldn't diagnose
whatever this is.

289
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,785
I was fine for some time,

290
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,870
but I guess it struck me today.

291
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,062
Are you okay?

292
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,232
Yes, I'm fine.

293
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,360
Focus on walking when you walk.

294
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:13,945
Okay.

295
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,906
I moved the car this way.

296
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,369
Mr. Ha.

297
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,791
How did Ms. Ban and Seo-ha meet?

298
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,752
Ms. Ban applied to work at the hotel.

299
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,630
Did they know each other before?

300
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,966
They seem too close
to have only known each other

301
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,384
since working at the hotel.

302
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,847
I did hear that they had a brief encounter
when they were young.

303
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,807
-When they were young?
-Yes.

304
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,853
When they were young?

305
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,485
It's this way.

306
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,164
-Take the onions too.
-All right.

307
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,627
Hello, sir.

308
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,879
Hello.

309
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,392
-Here.
-What is this?

310
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,687
You said you're aching all over.

311
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,689
It's good for your joints.

312
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,067
You really didn't have to.

313
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,819
You should take care of yourself.

314
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,698
Don't just shove these
in a closet somewhere, okay?

315
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,950
Okay.

316
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,076
My goodness.

317
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,786
What a lucky person I am.

318
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,249
Drink it up.

319
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,797
Nice to meet you. I'm Kang Min-gi.

320
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,467
I'll take care of this.

321
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,346
This tastes great.

322
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:05,973
Who's that?

323
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,725
He's the new part-timer.

324
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,354
I was gone for a day
and you already got a part-timer?

325
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,481
You never know if he's--

326
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,483
He's reliable unlike other young people.

327
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,277
I also promised him room and board,

328
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,987
-so treat him like family.
-Room and board?

329
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,322
Stop nagging me.

330
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,531
I'm busy right now.

331
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,034
Save your nagging for later.

332
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,370
This is for table five. Go.

333
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,080
Thanks for the supplements.

334
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,895
It's not here.

335
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,526
Ju-won, what if I can't find the treasure?

336
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,195
I don't want to lose it.

337
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,446
Cho-won.

338
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,864
Whatever's precious to you

339
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,866
is inside here.

340
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,369
In here?

341
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,537
Yes.

342
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,623
So if you just remember that,

343
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,083
you'll find it someday.

344
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,465
When did they meet

345
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,010
when they were young?

346
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,055
Was she Ju-won's friend?

347
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,059
No, Ms. Ban's so much younger.

348
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,898
Why is this bothering me so much?

349
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,661
Make sure that my schedule today
goes exactly according to plan.

350
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,871
Yes, ma'am.

351
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,706
MI GRAND HOTEL SEOUL, CEO JANG YEON-OK

352
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,139
What are you doing here?

353
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,308
Oh, you're here.

354
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,978
I was looking at the hotel's budget
over the past three years.

355
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,898
It clearly says
that you spent some budget,

356
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,734
but it's not reflected
in the hotel itself.

357
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,779
I did sign those documents.

358
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,574
But the incompetent employee in charge
is at fault for the mismanagement.

359
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:32,453
I won't stop you if you want to fire
the employee responsible.

360
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,455
I guess that employee
didn't want to go down alone,

361
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,790
so I heard a few things.

362
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,210
Apparently, you got your hands
on the budget.

363
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,379
What do you think you're doing?

364
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,130
I've told you already.

365
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,467
I'm straightening out
the hotel's disgraceful practices.

366
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,554
Do you think Sang-a
ran this place ever so righteously?

367
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:54,266
You seem to talk about my mother
quite carelessly to me.

368
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,267
Why shouldn't I?

369
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,894
I know you've worked hard,

370
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,981
but don't take your position for granted.

371
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,527
How dare you talk about my position?

372
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,072
What? Do you want to
drag me down from there?

373
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,744
Didn't you see your son
getting kicked out a few days ago?

374
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,331
Either cooperate or leave in disgrace.

375
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,874
It's your choice.

376
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,601
Director Mun.

377
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,356
Mun Seo-ha.

378
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,650
You misjudged me.

379
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,486
You think you can threaten me
with something like this?

380
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,197
If you want to make a deal,
bring something that's worth it!

381
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,742
Ms. Ban.

382
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,244
How dare you disrespect me?

383
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,621
Then from now on,

384
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,249
I won't hold back.

385
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:01,876
What?

386
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,812
I'm sorry you got hit because of me.

387
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:23,856
It didn't hurt at all.

388
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,405
If you think about it,

389
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,450
I have a larger stake
in the hotel than Sang-a did.

390
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,286
I practically built
the whole place myself.

391
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,956
I was the one who ran the hotel
when Sang-a was sick.

392
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,793
And after she died,
who took care of this place but me?

393
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,339
Now he wants to play the owner?

394
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,133
This is about your son, right?

395
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,053
I'll take care of Chan-hyeok at the HQ.

396
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:57,848
The HQ?

397
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,562
But the chairman doesn't think
too kindly of Chan-hyeok.

398
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,899
I'll handle it.

399
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,610
I'll have him work with my people.

400
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,363
Really?

401
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,118

403
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,510
Why don't you just
break the door while you're at it?

404
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,469
Who the hell is it?

405
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,684
Wait.

406
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,240
Wait.

407
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,034
If you just give me more time…

408
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,121
If you can't find a way to get the money,

409
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,789
I'll have to carve you up.

410
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,958
Wait a minute.

411
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,335
I have a way.

412
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,129
My sister works at a big company.

413
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,088
At MI Group.

414
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,674
She was already making money
as the Girl-of-all-trades as a kid.

415
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,385
That brat's done everything
to make it in life.

416
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,386
She's loaded.

417
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,518
Her boyfriend also works there.

418
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,021
Use him to threaten her for money.

419
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,419
Do-jin, where are you?

420
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,713
Sorry, I was stuck in traffic.

421
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:35,798
I'm getting off soon.

422
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,633
Okay. I'll be at the restaurant then.

423
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:38,717
Take your time.

424
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,393
Hey, you!

425
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,310
Hey!

426
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,396
He's ignoring me.

427
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,440
Hey, are you deaf?

428
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,025
Why the hell are you ignoring me?

429
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,860
Who are you?

430
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,362
No need to be alarmed.

431
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,572
I'd just like to have a conversation.

432
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,033
Why would I talk to someone I don't know?

433
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,120
Hey.

434
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,461
You might not know us,
but he should be familiar.

435
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,004
You know me, right?

436
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,840
I'm Ji-eum's brother.

437
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,134
What's going on?

438
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,386
Well, the thing is…

439
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:26,974
This is something
that could endanger Ji-eum.

440
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,017
Help me out here.

441
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,718
Hurry here if you want
your boyfriend unharmed.

444
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,747
Let's talk here.

445
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,173
What do you want from me?

446
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,134
This punk borrowed money from us.

447
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,262
But apparently,
his sister is his only way to repay us.

448
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,891
And since she's the furthest thing
from being cooperative,

449
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,645
we thought maybe
her boyfriend could convince her.

450
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,482
What do you think?

451
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,984
WONJO CAPITAL
SAME-DAY LOAN! IMMEDIATE LOAN!

452
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,195
So you're a loan shark?

453
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,113
Let's just say I work in finance.

454
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,534
It seems your plan
is to use me to threaten Ms. Ban.

455
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,160
But it won't work.

456
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,456
Don't you know
your own sister's personality?

457
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,336
So why don't you repay them for me?

458
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:23,632
Your dear girlfriend's family
is suffering so much.

459
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,926
What you're doing right now…

460
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,388
is illegal debt collection.

461
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,351
Why you little…

462
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,402
You're quite the fighter.

463
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,081
Are you okay?

464
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:59,042
How did you know I was here?

465
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,295
You're an athlete.
You can't go around beating people up.

466
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,463
Come on, think about it.

467
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,134
The MI Group chairman's son
getting charged with assault

468
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,510

-The chairman's…

469
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,595
What would be better?

470
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,474
The cops are here.

471
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,439
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

472
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,356
You?

473
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,608
My goodness.

474
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,167
Director Mun!

475
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,170
Are you all right, Director?

476
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,006
Yes, but…

477
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,884
You arrived just in time,

478
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,802
but what's with the siren?

479
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,015
All the years I've lived
have made me prefer simple solutions.

480
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,433
"All the years"?

481
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,478
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

482
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:03,774
No, don't…

483
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,819
I'll make sure this never happens again.

484
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,365
Don't do anything rash.

485
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,492
I'll be handling this.

486
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,953
No, I'll take care of it.
Don't worry, sir.

487
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,331
I'll handle it, all right?

488
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,541
So you're his girlfriend?

489
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,255
No, it's nothing like that.

490
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,342
She's just an employee I work with.

491
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,010
I'm sorry for being rude.

492
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,804
I'm Ha Do-jin.

493
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,392
Are you Mr. Ha's brother then?

494
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,476
Yes, that's right.

495
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,645
-Nice to meet you.
-It's a pleasure.

496
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,481
We're nothing like that.

497
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,274
I just work with her.

498
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,402
Stop denying it.

499
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,571
Would you like to join us for dinner?

500
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,948
I'd love to.

501
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,324
-Shall we go?
-All right.

502
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:56,702
Do-jin.

503
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,964
Have we met before?

504
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:11,842
Oh, no!

505
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,677
It's so dusty.

506
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,055
JUNE 12, 1997
JANUARY 2, 1997

507
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,183
How do you know about that, Ms. Ban?

508
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,066
Ms. Yoon?

509
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,570
Mr. Ha.

510
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,280
Aren't you clocking out?

511
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,949
Do you have to close up?

512
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:37,325
Yes.

513
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,328
It's also dangerous for you to be alone.

514
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:41,913
You should go home.

515
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,082
All right.

516
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,001
Mr. Ha.

517
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,004
You're indifferent on the surface
but actually quite thoughtful,

518
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:49,921
aren't you?

519
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,299
What do you mean?

520
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,426
I was told
that considering your personality,

521
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,011
you're showing a lot of interest.

522
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,138
Who told you that nonsense?

523
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,556
Ms. Ban did.

524
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,976
She's a good judge of character
and she's quick to pick up on things.

525
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,354
She really has her nose in everything.

526
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,272
What?

527
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,942
Where else does she have her nose in?

528
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,111
Here and there.

529
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,654
Specifically where?

530
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,531
Could you tell me more?

531
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,242
Well,

532
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,369
I don't like talking about other people.

533
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,545
The thing is…

534
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,965
I've been having a hard time
because of Ms. Ban.

535
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,344
What's wrong?

536
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,221
I'm so confused

537
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,932
because she feels like my sister.

538
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,934
Your older sister?

539
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,271
She keeps reminding me of Ju-won

540
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,191
and it's driving me crazy.

541
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:55,111
I did ask her a few questions
because something felt fishy.

542
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,905
And she said she had an ulterior motive.

543
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,117
She had an ulterior motive?

544
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,252
Eat up.

545
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,212
Can we order more meat?

546
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,840
We're celebrating your championship
so eat as much as you want.

547
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:17,050
-Can you handle the bill?
-Just order more.

548
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:19,886
Excuse me!

549
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:22,597
Excuse me!

550
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,641
They must be busy.

551
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:25,642
I'll be back.

552
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,644
Excuse me!

553
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,821
Would you like to get some air?

554
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,574
I'd love to.

555
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:53,962
GARDEN CHARCOAL GRILLED RIBS

556
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,923
It's so refreshing.

557
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,641
Ms. Ban,

558
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,227
why do you keep intervening
without thinking?

559
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,646
You could've gotten hurt.

560
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,941
All I cared about was you.

561
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,695
Don't do that again.

562
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,073
I don't want anyone getting hurt

563
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:23,742
because of me.

564
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,622
Aren't you afraid of anything?

565
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,917
I am afraid of something.

566
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,503
What are you afraid of?

567
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,091
I'm…

568
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,970
afraid of you the most.

569
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,514
Stop lying.

570
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,017
The way I see it,

571
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,727
you're not afraid of anything.

572
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,944
Director Mun.

573
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:04,616
Do you know how much you scare me
when you call me like that?

574
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,285
What part of that person
did you like so much?

575
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,246
Why are you asking me that?

576
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:11,873
I was very young.

577
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,960
Come on, tell me.

578
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,678
Her eyes were very understanding

579
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:26,930
and pretty.

580
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,435
What about my eyes?

581
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,238
Stop right there.

582
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,076
Let's go in.

583
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,294
YOON CHO-WON

584
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:00,422
Yes, Ms. Yoon?

585
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,070
What's going on with Cho-won?

586
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,128
Ms. Yoon.

587
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,506
Is something wrong?

588
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,183
I never thought you'd be like this.

589
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,769
I'm quite disappointed.

590
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,567
What was your ulterior motive?

591
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,279
Were you trying
to find out about my sister through me?

592
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,408
-What are you--
-Ms. Ban.

593
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,203
You said you had an ulterior motive.

594
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,290
You pretended to be Ju-won
to get to Seo-ha

595
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:19,209
because she's his weakness!

596
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,546
-What?
-How could you use his pain

597
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,715
to try to get with him?

598
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,636
Was it part of your plan to be nice to me

599
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,806
so you could find out about my sister?

600
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,392
You saw what I was going through
because of my sister!

601
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,561
So how could you do that to me?

602
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,650
Don't ever do that again.

603
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,735
If you do,

604
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,529
I'm going to make you pay.

605
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,573
I called you to say that.

606
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:52,700
I'm leaving now.

607
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:55,745
Wait…

608
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,379
Ms. Yoon.

609
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,090
Ms. Yoon, wait.

610
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,050
Let go.

611
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,304
You left your bag.

612
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,808
-I'll take you home.
-No thanks.

613
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:18,935
Unlike you,

614
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:23,690
I don't play with people's emotions.

615
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:26,943
To be honest,

616
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,404
I even thought…

617
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,701
you might be my sister.

618
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,208
Why does a stranger
feel so much like my sister?

619
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,255
Why…

620
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,342
does this person remind me of her?

621
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,428
How in the world

622
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,806
did she find my parent's place
when I never told her the address?

623
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,476
How did she know about my secret memories

624
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,311
with my sister at the vacation house?

625
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,773
Why did she stroke my head…

626
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,403
with so much affection?

627
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,621
None of it makes sense.

628
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,419
But the thing is…

629
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,839
it would all make sense

630
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,176
if you were my sister.

631
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,138
For me,

632
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,185
whenever…

633
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,856
you feel like my sister,

634
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,442
I…

635
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:51,736
I…

636
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:53,780
I feel like I'm going mad.

637
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:59,285
I get such a strange feeling.

638
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:00,828
But at the same time,

639
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:05,083
I also wished you really were my sister.

640
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,878
So how could you do this to me?

641
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:13,424
You're such an awful person.

642
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,512
Why did you act like my sister?

643
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,019
Cho-won,

644
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,314
you haven't changed at all.

645
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,610
You're making it hard for me.

646
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,782
I might regret it.

647
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,534
I definitely will regret it.

648
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:42,537
I shouldn't even think about it.

649
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,417
I know I shouldn't, but…

650
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:52,589
Cho-won.

651
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,591
Look at your sister.

652
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,554
What did you say?

653
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,514
Cho-won.

654
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:04,976
I am…

655
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,396
Yoon Ju-won.

656
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,656
I remember my past lives.

657
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:21,993
And in my past life,

658
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:25,580
I was Yoon Ju-won.

659
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:56,778
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

660
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,404
What do you remember?

661
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,156
You have a scar here, right?

662
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,407
Do you believe in past lives?

663
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,284
You sisters are so similar.

664
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,411
In warfare,

665
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,122
you need to behead
your enemy's commander to be victorious.

666
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:09,832
Mun Seo-ha.

667
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,250
That was my work.

668
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,337
I know who was behind it.

669
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,673
That car accident you mentioned…

670
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,341
I died in that crash.

671
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,511
Did she really promise
to come back when she's reborn?

672
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,388
She's made contact with her previous life.

673
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,264
She even revealed her identity.

674
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:30,853
