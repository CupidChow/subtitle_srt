1
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:53,970
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

2
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,819
I've always wondered

3
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,031
why I could remember my past lives.

4
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,538
I couldn't forget them

5
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,290
even if I wanted to.

6
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,382
But the most memorable life
out of them all…

7
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,762
was the warm and ordinary summer days

8
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,223
with you.

9
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,603
I think

10
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,732
I can finally understand why my mom

11
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,442
brought you to me.

12
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,204
Seo-ha.

13
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:06,084
I'll stay by your side
until you can stand on your own two feet.

14
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,049
Ju-won, marry me.

15
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,843
Promise.

16
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,810
I was just an elated kid in my 18th life.

17
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,198
Seo-ha.

18
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,218
Seo-ha.

19
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:02,265
I was reborn this time solely to meet you.

20
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:23,536
THE WILL TO FINISH WHAT YOU'VE STARTED

21
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,038
LANGUAGES:
ENGLISH, CHINESE, JAPANESE, ARABIC…

22
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,289
NAME: BAN JI-EUM

23
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,000
I understand why you're applying,

24
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,461
but the work may be different
from what you're looking for.

25
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,259
If you're still unsure,

26
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,094
why don't you try dating me?

27
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,064
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,107
I must have heard you wrong.

29
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,901
No, you haven't.

30
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,487
I'll repeat myself.

31
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,992
Would you like to date me?

32
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,329
What?

33
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,664
WEBTOON ORIGINAL SERIES
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE CREATED BY LEE HEY

34
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,748
What are you…

35
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,334
You know this is a job interview, right?

36
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,630
You seemed reluctant
to hire me off the bat,

37
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,216
so I'm just giving you an alternative.

38
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,136
Consider it a trial run if you will.

39
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,805
Even so…

40
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,141
How could you ask a stranger out?

41
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,602
What if we're not strangers?

42
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,524
Will you consider it then?

43
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,320
Have we perhaps met before?

44
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,073
I can't say.

45
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,243
I'd like you to remember that yourself.

46
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,715
Are young people these days all so brash?

47
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,759
Jeez, you sound like a boomer.

48
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,178
Is this about Ms. Ban?

49
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,140
Have you met her before?

50
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,309
-No.
-Right?

51
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,227
You've never met her either.

52
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,271
What's this about?

53
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:16,607
There seemed to be something going on
between you two.

54
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,776
You won't believe me even if I told you.

55
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,206
Goodness.

56
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,666
Jeez, Uncle.

57
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,756
You have a tendency
to talk before you think.

58
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,301
-Jeez.
-I tried to take it slow too.

59
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,970
But after seeing his face,

60
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,931
I couldn't help it.

61
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,977
This is your 19th life.

62
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,645
How are you still so immature?

63
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,900
No one ever fully matures in their life.
We just pretend to be.

64
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,529
Simply put, the number of lives I've lived
doesn't matter.

65
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,783
What a grand way of saying
that you did something crazy.

66
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,951
Fill this up for me.

67
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,914
Here you go.

68
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,339
Director Mun.

69
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,885
Seo-ha.

70
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,181
I don't think he can hear well.

71
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,267
I think it's because of that accident.

72
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,146
Why don't you just tell him honestly

73
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,565
that you were Ju-won?

74
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,070
There's something I learned
while living multiple lives.

75
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,906
There are people
I can share my secret with

76
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,659
and people that I should never open up to.

77
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,869
And which one is Seo-ha?

78
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,330
I'm not sure.

79
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,376
I can't think objectively
when it comes to him.

80
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,215
Don't let it eat at you
and just go for it.

81
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,009
What's stopping you
when you've come this far?

82
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,262
Ae-gyeong.

83
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,848
You know me so well.

84
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,183
This is what it means to be seasoned.

85
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,103
Look at you.

86
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,020
Uncle, please!

87
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,398
I'm in my fifties now.

88
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,945
Have some of this kimchi
made with seasoned hands.

89
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,906
All right. I'll give it a try.

90
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,290
You want to come in for a bit?

91
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,499
Don't you dare make a move on me.

92
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,421
Will you keep sitting
in the passenger seat in Korea too?

93
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,841
Would it be weird?

94
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,968
People will talk.

95
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,979
Let's take it slow.

96
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:01,939
Okay.

97
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,404
YOON CHO-WON

98
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,780
Aren't you going to pick up?

99
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,663
You traveled throughout Germany
to get gifts for her family.

100
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,627
Take care of it from your end for now.

101
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,295
Okay.

102
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,344
I'm off.

103
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:32,762
All right.

104
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,186
YOON CHO-WON

105
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,361
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

106
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,196
Are you guys kidding me?

107
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,080
Hey!

108
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,207
Cho-won!

109
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,629
I told you I'm tired.

110
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,215
That's why I'm here.

111
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,426
Who would take care of you if not me?

112
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,680
I don't need you to take care of me.
I need you to take a hint.

113
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,722
I know you like it.

114
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,440
This is nice.

115
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,450
Are you wanting to make a call

116
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,619
or wanting to receive one?

117
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,079
None of your business.

118
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,540
You're only mean to me, you know.

119
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,626
It fascinates me as well.

120
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,379
Strangely enough,
I get grumpy whenever I see your face.

121
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,922
Maybe we were enemies in our past lives.

122
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,803
Do you know Seo-ha flew in?

123
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,471
You told me.

124
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,681
Right.

125
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,725
Why did he pick the hotel?

126
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,560
So he's working at MI Hotel?

127
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,812
That hotel is pretty much done for.

128
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,857
He must cherish it
since his mother used to manage it.

129
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,899
What's it to you?

130
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,194
Do you still like him?

131
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,657
Jeez, cat got your tongue?

132
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,577
Cho-won.

133
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,078
What do you think of me?

134
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,625
-Ji-seok.
-Yes?

135
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,877
Guess what these flowers are called.

136
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,340
NEVER-IN-A-MILLION-YEARS ROSE

137
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:48,105
MI HOTEL MARKET AREA

138
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,612
"Antique furnishing."

139
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,364
"Insa-dong"?

140
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,631
HA DO-YUN

141
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:22,950
Run!

142
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,537
Ms. Ban?

143
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:27,872
Just run.

144
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,708
Why are you here?

145
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,627
-Wait!
-Run!

146
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,258
What's going on?

147
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,968
What's this about?

148
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,512
We can't let them catch us!
I'll explain later!

149
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,060
This way!

150
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,612
Director Mun.

151
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,367
I haven't run in ages.
I'm so out of breath.

152
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,371
So what's going on?

153
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,042
You looked bored.

154
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,878
What?

155
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,339
I did it just for fun.

156
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,008
Aren't you thirsty?

157
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,260
I saw a convenience store back there.
Wait here.

158
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,615
How refreshing.

159
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,539
Do you feel better now?

160
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,964
You almost had
a panic attack back there, didn't you?

161
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,472
I know very well how that feels.

162
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,600
At times like that, I just run.

163
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,812
Then I find myself
only focusing on my breathing.

164
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,575
This is actually…

165
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,954
Was it during
the Japanese invasion of Korea?

166
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,751
There was a time
when I was a sole survivor.

167
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,920
MY 19TH LIFE

168
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,841
MY 10TH LIFE

169
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,187
I can't move!

170
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,564
Help!

171
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,941
It was like I was in hell.

172
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,903
There were bodies everywhere,

173
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,655
and people were moaning
and screaming from being burned.

174
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,450
I couldn't think straight.

175
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,162
I thought my heart would stop.

176
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,581
And I couldn't breathe.

177
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,726
I don't know whether I was startled
or simply wanted to live.

178
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,354
But I just started running.

179
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,366
All the longing
and heart-wrenching memories

180
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,286
must've vanished in the wind while I ran.

181
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,332
I found the will to live once again.

182
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,711
That was when I realized

183
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,505
that if I run, I can live.

184
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,051
During the Japanese invasion?

185
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,265
I read it in a book once.

186
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,602
The descriptions were so detailed
that it felt like I was there.

187
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,354
What was the book called?

188
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,192
The White Buckwheat Flower Field?

189
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,863
It was just a draft
that someone I knew wrote,

190
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,489
so I doubt you can get it now.

191
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,534
What a shame.

192
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,411
Ms. Ban.

193
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,456
Be honest with me.

194
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,374
Are you a pathological liar?

195
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,670
You are, aren't you?

196
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,548
I won't tell anyone,

197
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,592
so your secret is safe with me.

198
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,635
Just tell me.

199
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:35,971
Come on.

200
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,691
Marry me, okay?

201
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,526
Marry me.

202
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,288
What are you doing,
proposing to me out of the blue?

203
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,248
That was a hint.

204
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,834
You wanted to know where we met.

205
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,588
-A hint?
-Yes.

206
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,131
A pretty big one at that.

207
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,426
Think long and hard.

208
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,261
Let's go.

209
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,765
-Goodness, look at these.
-A hint?

210
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,059
Gosh.

211
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,605
Oh, wow.

212
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,733
They even have this?

213
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,360
Mommy.

214
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,319
Hae-wol.

215
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,323
Director Mun.

216
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,741
Stoop down for me.

217
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,202
-Why?
-It won't take long.

218
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:51,296
This is a comb that mothers used
on their babies in the past.

219
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,507
Okay, the other side.

220
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,176
Jeez.

221
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,516
Doesn't it feel good?

222
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,059
I guess.

223
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,980
We can hang this
on antique furniture or door handles

224
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,275
to give off a sophisticated
and traditional vibe.

225
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,902
All right.

226
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,322
There.

227
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,492
Well, aren't you handsome.

228
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:38,719
Ju-won,

229
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,722
marry me.

230
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,934
Marry me, okay?

231
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,477
Do you even know what that is?

232
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,438
It's when we are together

233
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,648
to make each other laugh
whether we feel happy or sad.

234
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,736
I promise that you won't feel lonely.

235
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,738
And I'll make you feel loved.

236
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,531
Promise.

237
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,494
Marry me.

238
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,751
I haven't felt this way

239
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,629
in a long time.

240
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,841
I may be too old

241
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,929
To enjoy a heartbreak

242
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,517
But this song

243
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,646
Is about my heart

244
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:18,151
That feels strangely empty

245
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,865
Fancy seeing you here.

246
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,451
What brings you here, Ms. Ban?

247
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,246
Are you here for work?

248
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,707
-I found him here.
-Sorry?

249
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,792
The person I wanted to meet.

250
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,129
I have a packed schedule, so goodbye.

251
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,465
Come on. Where do you think you're going?

252
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,385
What are you doing?

253
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,012
Be honest with me.

254
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,222
Why are you in this shabby hotel and--

255
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,232
-What are you doing?
-It's called flamenco.

256
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,281
I saved you from becoming a sex offender.

257
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,579
You're really something.

258
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,039
What are you doing?

259
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,291
Mun Seo-ha.

260
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,418
Are you seriously working here?

261
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,963
I heard you flew in ages ago.

262
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,090
How could you not call anyone?

263
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,010
If nothing else,
you shouldn't do that to Cho-won.

264
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,680
Ha Do-yun, are you still working for him?

265
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,890
None of your business.

266
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,267
-Ms. Ban.
-Yes, sir.

267
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,685
What brings you here?

268
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,354
I had something to report to you
regarding the hotel.

269
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,982
-Follow me then.
-Yes, sir.

270
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,195
Come on, I'm not done talking.

271
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,155
She and I were talking business.

272
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:46,656
Is that true?

273
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:51,244
No, sir. I have no interest
in doing business with Daehwan.

274
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,580
You heard her.

275
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:57,584
Did you reach out to her first
after hearing that I wanted to scout her?

276
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,338
-People are already talking.
-About what?

277
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,132
About how the son of MI Group
is managing this hopeless hotel.

278
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,843
And how it seems like
MI Group abandoned him.

279
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:07,761
What the…

280
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:11,973
What was that?

281
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,019
If you dare to offend him again,

282
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,731
I won't let it go.

283
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,904
After you, Director.

284
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,323
Okay.

285
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,330
Ms. Ban.

286
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,500
Did your distant relative
also teach you flamenco?

287
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:40,961
You could say that.

288
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,761
What was it about the hotel?

289
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,305
I haven't received
my interview results yet,

290
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,141
so I thought I would show you
my value a bit more.

291
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,519
Don't people normally wait for the result?

292
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,813
"Pursue rather than wait."

293
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,357
That's my motto.

294
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,209
Ms. Yoon Cho-won?

295
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,504
Long time no see, Mr. Ha.

296
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,590
It's Cho-won.

297
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,592
Is it refreshing, Cho-won?

298
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,427
Ju-won.

299
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,268
Ju-won.

300
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,114
You're looking good, Seo-ha.
How have you been?

301
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:52,866
Good.

302
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,580
I stopped by
because I couldn't reach you by phone.

303
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,873
Do you have some time?

304
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,212
He has a busy schedule today.

305
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,130
Why don't you speak with me instead?

306
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,967
Okay. I guess it can't be helped then.

307
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,304
This way.

308
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,082
Ms. Ban.

309
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,085
I'm sorry but please come by next time.

310
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,295
I'll take your value into consideration
and let you know.

311
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:51,424
Don't be sorry and just hire me.

312
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,888
If you don't,
I'm even considering a bellboy position.

313
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,641
Who uses that term nowadays?

314
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,601
They're not called "bellboys" anymore?

315
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,895
Goodness, since when?

316
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,691
If that won't do,
I'm also good with housekeeping.

317
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:12,070
I just don't understand
why you're going this far.

318
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,364
Don't try to understand
everything at once.

319
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:18,827
Things will all come to you in time.

320
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,370
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

321
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,746
All right.

322
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,248
That will be all.

323
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,002
Here.

324
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,170
What is that?

325
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,589
I also want to save this hotel.

326
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,718
I'm showing you my value.

327
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,487
They all grew up so much.

328
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,661
Oh, right.

329
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,039
I forgot to give him this.

330
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,505
Director Mun.

331
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,094
I guess we really are destined to meet.

332
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,432
Could you just tell me
when we've met before?

333
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,059
You see--

334
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,478
Forget it. Even if I do remember,

335
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,229
it's not going to
change anything between us.

336
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,731
That may be true.

337
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:33,401
But I could still become
someone special to you.

338
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,113
I just can't talk any sense into you.

339
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,866
I forgot to give you this.

340
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,675
Feel free to take a look.

341
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,475
This hotel used to be teeming with people.

342
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,186
It was a lively and radiant hotel

343
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,689
where they even handpicked
the flowers for the lobby.

344
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,655
What do you think?

345
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,038
Well…

346
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:11,916
Let's give it a try.

347
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,711
Thank you.

348
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,671
And sir.

349
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,716
There's one thing I'd like you to know.

350
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,135
I'll be by your side

351
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,846
whenever you need help.

352
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,935
I'll stay by your side.

353
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,055
Look at you.

354
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,059
You've grown up so much, Cho-won.

355
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,564
You're practically a lady now, aren't you?

356
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,613
But what's her relationship with Seo-ha?

357
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,909
You're looking good, Seo-ha.
How have you been?

358
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,286
Good.

359
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,567
Director Mun.

360
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,526
Good morning.

361
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:03,903
Hello.

362
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,408
-So this is it.
-Be careful, sir.

363
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:12,412
-I swear I drank here before.
-Yeah, me too.

364
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,038
-We're allowed to!
-Careful, sir.

365
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,790
Focus, will you?

366
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,500
-Then let's…
-Let's all drink together.

367
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,168
-Sir…
-Right?

368
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,587
-Come on.
-I like that idea.

369
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,630
-We can drink here.
-Hello, Director.

370
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,048
Who are they?

371
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,176
They're Ms. Jang's son and his friends.

372
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,264
-I'll leave after this drink.
-Come on. Let's drink together.

373
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,391
-I'll only have a bit.
-Let's drink together.

374
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,311
Drinking is prohibited in the lobby.
Please leave the premises.

375
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,981
Who are you? A newbie?

376
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,859
No name badge?

377
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,944
Please leave.

378
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,405
Hey.

379
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,115
Do you know who I am?

380
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,701
Damn it. What's your name?!

381
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,500
Hey, cutie. Care to join us?

382
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,587
That's enough.

383
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,755
Let go.

384
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,840
Let go.

385
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,509
-Chan-hyeok!
-You okay?

386
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,554
What the hell?

387
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,264
-You good?
-What's wrong?

388
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,517
Put him on the blacklist
and restrict him from the premises.

389
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,895
But if Ms. Jang finds out…

390
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,648
-Hey!
-Chan-hyeok.

391
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,866
It's been a while.

392
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,952
Hello, Ms. Jang.

393
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,913
How about some tea?

394
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,665
Sure.

395
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,626
Mom.

396
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,586
It's a misunderstanding.

397
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,829
Long time no see.

398
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,832
I'm not sure if you've changed or not.

399
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,792
You do seem to be doing better though.

400
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,377
You haven't changed either.

401
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,381
I didn't expect you to work here.

402
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:32,427
I heard you helped my mother out
quite a lot when she managed this hotel.

403
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,054
I did

404
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,141
keep her in line.

405
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,103
Sang-a was always worried about you

406
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,896
since you were so delicate and frail.

407
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,859
Working in Korea would be difficult
if you're still unwell. Don't you agree?

408
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,156
Right. As you saw earlier,

409
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,533
we'll be taking some measures
against your son.

410
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:58,953
This seems to be a habitual thing,
so it must have been difficult for you.

411
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,329
You see…

412
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,791
Even if he usually behaves well,
people will judge him for one mistake.

413
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,127
Please don't misunderstand.
He's a good kid.

414
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,171
That's something I'll have to find out.

415
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,091
I'm afraid you'll have to meet him
outside of the hotel from now on.

416
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,594
Is that so?

417
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,767
People nowadays don't have
that kind of prejudice.

418
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,853
My son's bad reputation
isn't going to ruin mine.

419
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,024
You must not know since you're new here.

420
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,109
But you'll gradually learn in time.

421
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,321
I agree. I'll learn things gradually.

422
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,573
And change things gradually too.

423
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,534
My goal is to straighten out

424
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,953
the disgraceful practices
that have been overlooked.

425
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,664
"Disgraceful."

426
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:45,833
You understand, right?

427
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,004
Well then.

428
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,183
That stuck-up little bastard.

429
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,852
So that's Ha Do-yun,

430
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:08,147
-the director's secretary.
-Right.

431
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,067
-Do you see that chubby guy in glasses?
-Yes.

432
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,445
That's Team Leader Heo Jin-o
from the Planning Team at HQ.

433
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,781
As for the woman on the right,

434
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,700
she appeared on Starqueen
as the Girl-of-all-trades a while back.

435
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,577
-Do you know her?
-No, I don't.

436
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,330
I heard she's good at flamenco
and also speaks Arabic.

437
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,873
She's apparently multilingual.

438
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,791
Really?

439
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,002
Are we planning to open hotels abroad?

440
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,712
So what's the plan?

441
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,923
We'll only find out
once the director comes.

442
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,467
But I doubt he'll find a solution.

443
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,385
Right.

444
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:42,932
Hello, sir.

445
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,310
Please submit a report

446
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,312
on why you think I won't find a solution.

447
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,239
Mr. Heo will be taking charge of
improving the overall service.

448
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,868
As for Ms. Ko, please analyze
different renovation cases

449
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,619
-and submit a proposal.
-Yes, sir.

450
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,209
Any results on hiring
a landscaping company?

451
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,755
We've been receiving portfolios
from different companies.

452
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,551
I'd really like to get rid of
those artificial flowers in the lobby.

453
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,970
Yes, sir.
I'll make a list of potential companies

454
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,305
by the end of the day.

455
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,141
All right. That will be all.

456
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,142
Director Mun,

457
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,520
you didn't mention my task.

458
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,814
Please support the team.

459
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,275
It was difficult
to assign you a single task

460
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,068
with all your different talents.

461
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:44,368
STRATEGIC PLANNING OFFICE

462
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,291
I guess his cold attitude
was always his charm.

463
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,001
I said, get--

464
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,255
If I start screaming right now,

465
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,091
what do you think will happen to you?

466
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,645
Hello, we meet again.

467
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,646
Yes, hello.

468
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,316
Could you do me a favor?

469
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,818
-Sorry?
-Here.

470
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,820
EMILY YOON

471
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,865
You guys are hiring a landscaping company,
so I thought I'd apply.

472
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,661
I see.

473
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,956
I know Seo-ha won't even consider it
if he knew it was mine.

474
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,834
I'm applying under an alias,
so could you slip this in?

475
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:35,962
It'll be a huge help.

476
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,716
All right. Sure.

477
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,134
Thank you.

478
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,304
I should get going now.

479
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:46,806
Goodbye.

480
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:10,913
What are you doing here?

481
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,501
I thought I could help you pick out
a landscaping company.

482
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,295
There's no need.

483
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,425
Feel free to let me know
if you ever need help.

484
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,593
Ms. Ban.

485
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,680
Yes?

486
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,890
You do realize
how strange you seem, right?

487
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,644
I'm quite concerned, to be honest.

488
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,314
I guess I'm not to your liking.

489
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,450
It seems to me
that you have ulterior motives.

490
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,124
An MI Mobity research engineer
working at our hotel?

491
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,546
I do have an ulterior motive.

492
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,840
But I can promise you this.

493
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,304
I'm not here to harm Director Mun.

494
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:14,101
You'll never be able to see through me.

495
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,114
Yes, sir?

496
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,200
Please bring me
the list of landscaping companies.

497
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,951
Yes, sir.

498
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,136
Were you discussing work
with Ms. Ban just now?

499
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,723
No, we were just chatting.

500
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,144
Anything I should know about?

501
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,903
I've never met such a strange
and suspicious woman before.

502
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,655
Me neither.

503
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,367
I would have remembered

504
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,327
meeting someone like her.

505
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,956
She's up to something for sure.

506
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,750
Even she admitted to it.

507
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:21,877
She did?

508
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,014
What's this about?

509
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,600
We can't let them catch us!
I'll explain later!

510
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,811
I just run.

511
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,647
Then I find myself
only focusing on my breathing.

512
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,733
I'll be by your side

513
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,027
whenever you need help.

514
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,614
-Who could she be?
-Marry me.

515
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,533
That was a hint.

516
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,161
You wanted to know where we met.

517
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:21,979
Run!

518
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,064
Run!

519
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,278
Marry me.

520
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,032
Marry me.

521
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,044
Marry me.

522
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,670
I'll grow up well.

523
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:17,326
DONGBAEK CIRCUS TROUPE

524
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:18,911
Found it.

525
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:27,002
-What's with this today?
-It'll break if you force it like that.

526
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,130
I told you numerous times
to be gentle with it.

527
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,842
What do you think you're doing
at someone else's workplace?

528
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:34,969
You traitor.

529
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,555
You'll get promoted with me gone.

530
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,391
Take the opportunity. I'll help you.

531
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,059
Seriously?

532
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,103
So you're just going to help me for free?

533
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,730
I told you that this work
is important to me.

534
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,358
I appreciate your offer, but--

535
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,860
I'll make you
a senior research engineer by this year.

536
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:53,862
I love you.

537
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,201
DIRECTOR MUN SEO-HA

538
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,829
Hello?

539
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,456
Can we meet right now? I remembered you.

540
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:06,917
What?

541
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,674
Why are you following me?

542
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,843
I need to see who this guy is.

543
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,428
Then run.

544
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,306
Hey. Wait up.

545
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,563
Hey, take it easy.

546
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,113
Oh, my goodness.

547
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,157
Look at how tall he is.

548
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,285
I told you he was perfect.

549
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:28,624
I wish I could be madly in love
with a guy like him.

550
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,876
Dream on.

551
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,671
A guy like that
only comes every thousand years.

552
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,297
-Get home safely.
-Hey.

553
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,842
Darn it. I'm so jealous.

554
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,595
Were you serious about remembering me?

555
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,639
Didn't we

556
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,225
also run that time?

557
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:48,811
We did.

558
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,438
Oh, right. Here.

559
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,777
DONGBAEK CIRCUS TROUPE

560
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,446
How do you have this?

561
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,289
I had a lot on my mind that day.

562
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,635
Let's go for lunch!

563
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,345
Come on, let's eat!

564
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,367
Hey!

565
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,786
What are you doing, you punk?

566
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:32,915
What are you doing?

567
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,255
Run!

568
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,180
Hey, stop right there!

569
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,599
Come here, you punk!

570
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:26,343
Who are you anyway?

571
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:40,983
What is it?

572
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,277
Why are you smiling?

573
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,826
Are you the weird type?

574
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,121
Marry me.

575
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,207
So you are weird.

576
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,292
I'll treat you well.

577
00:47:58,875 --> 00:47:59,835
What do you mean?

578
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,545
I'll grow up well.

579
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,380
How old are you?

580
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,800
I don't count my age anymore.

581
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:08,969
When were you born?

582
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:11,638
In 940.

583
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,391
You're bleeding!

584
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:21,648
You should've just gone home
and taken a nap if you cut class.

585
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,320
Why did you have to hammer that wall?

586
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,113
That stings.

587
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:29,948
You deserve it.

588
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,621
Why you little…

589
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,377
You should just cry
if you're having a tough time.

590
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,547
Don't act out and hurt yourself.

591
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,727
I can't believe that was you.

592
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,815
Didn't I grow up to be pretty?

593
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:08,195
You grew up to be
just as weird as you were back then.

594
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,322
Now then.

595
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:11,657
Marry me.

596
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,077
Everything is so simple for you, isn't it?

597
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,245
This wasn't a simple decision for me.

598
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,832
You're my first love.

599
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,544
This is something that I've decided

600
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,838
after years of pondering.

601
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,428
You're going to this extent

602
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,222
solely based on one childhood memory?

603
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,313
Do you know which memory
resonates the most with you

604
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,315
if you've lived long enough?

605
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,567
What is it this time?

606
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,612
And you're too young to say that.

607
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,156
I guess you're not curious.

608
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,158
Then never mind.

609
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,926
It's about Director Mun.

610
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,469
He won't be there for long.

611
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,637
We have a reputation to uphold.

612
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,432
He'll only be there
until he's ready to join headquarters.

613
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:22,185
Let him do what he wants for now.

614
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,314
Don't make a big deal
out of him being a director.

615
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,649
It won't look good on you.

616
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,484
This isn't about his position.

617
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,075
You wanted to see me, sir?

618
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,160
Is Director Mun

619
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,829
interested in any other subsidiaries
other than the hotel?

620
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,833
His reasoning is the problem.

621
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,793
He's entitled
because it was his mom's hotel?

622
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,088
It's been 20 years since she passed away.

623
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:55,218
I had to work from the ground up.

624
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:58,555
I worked hard for this without any help.

625
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,515
Don't make me laugh.

626
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,476
Sir, please.

627
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,687
See?

628
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,149
This is the current situation,
so keep Seo-ha in line.

629
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,278
Make sure he's doing his share,
but not overstepping anything.

630
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,990
It won't even take two years.
I'll transfer him in a year.

631
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:18,992
Yes, sir.

632
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,041
-I'll have to refuse, sir.
-Take it.

633
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,584
Keep up the good work.

634
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,462
You're required to do
the same task even in Korea.

635
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,550
Is that a no?

636
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,344
Then you can resign.

637
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,139
He's just kidding.

638
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,350
Take it.

639
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,770
I'll do my best, sir.

640
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,237
Free money.

641
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,948
This is a lot.

642
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,760
HA DO-YUN

643
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,808
The number you have dialed is turned off.
Please leave a message after…

644
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,528
RÉSUMÉ
NAME: BAN JI-EUM

645
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,035
What? He remembered
that you were Yoon Ju-won?

646
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,581
No, he remembered me as a nine-year-old.

647
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,748
Hold on.

648
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,626
So he remembered Ban Ji-eum
as a nine-year-old?

649
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,962
-Yes.
-Unbelievable.

650
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,131
You guys didn't even meet that often.

651
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,300
He even had my handkerchief.

652
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,260
How touching.

653
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,511
I know.

654
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,763
Uncle.

655
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,808
Did you have your hopes up?

656
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,021
To be honest,

657
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,857
I did have this much hope.

658
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,695
I knew he'd never recognize me,

659
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:20,739
but I still had hope.

660
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,450
I guess I wanted him to recognize me.

661
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,661
It's normal to forget the dead.

662
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:27,579
That's true.

663
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,665
Only I could recognize you right away.

664
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,251
Correct. You're the best.

665
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,005
You have a call.

666
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,925
DIRECTOR MUN SEO-HA

667
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,384
Gosh, it's Mun Seo-ha.

668
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,053
-What is this?
-Gosh.

669
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,471
Speak of the devil.

670
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,056
Put him on speaker.

671
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,643
Don't pick up.

672
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,187
Don't pick up.

673
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,356
Hello, Director Mun.

674
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,734
Hello. Well…

675
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,947
You said I could ask you for help anytime.

676
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,452
How may I help you?

677
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,617
Hello, Director.

678
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,078
Hello.

679
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,586
I'm sorry for suddenly
asking for your help.

680
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,504
Don't be.

681
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:03,258
I was quite excited
that you asked for my help.

682
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,260
You can call me anytime.

683
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,595
After you, Director.

684
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,055
Okay.

685
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,212
336 GIJUN-RO

686
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,675
Where are we going?

687
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,971
I needed a ride to get there.

688
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,849
And I wanted to go in secret.

689
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:57,187
You must not have any friends
seeing how you called me for help.

690
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,692
But then again,
I believe it's wiser to be alone

691
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,861
than to maintain
unnecessary relationships.

692
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,995
YOON CHO-WON

693
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,082
About that call…

694
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:02,085
Would you mind if I asked you

695
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,546
why you keep ignoring it?

696
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:06,589
Yes.

697
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,929
Sometimes it helps

698
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:18,101
to open up your feelings to a stranger.

699
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,104
I will be your secret journal.

700
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,899
You know, something like "Dear Diary."

701
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,611
Dear Diary…

702
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,161
The end.

703
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,293
What?

704
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,920
How could you ignore
my sincerity like that?

705
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,797
It didn't feel sincere.

706
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,541
I'll go on my own from here.

707
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,502
You can wait here.

708
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,295
Okay.

709
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:08,169
OUR BELOVED DAUGHTER, YOON JU-WON
IF I COULD MEET YOU ONE MORE TIME

710
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,050
Have you been well?

711
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,187
I'm sorry it's been so long.

712
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,536
Ju-won.

713
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:47,750
Ju-won…

714
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,730
Sergio!

715
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:14,611
Mom! It's me, Hae-wol!

716
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:22,493
In all the lives I've lived,

717
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:25,496
I could only feel

718
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,249
my own pain.

719
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,088
But not this life.

720
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,885
The people I've left behind…

721
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,396
I'm witnessing their sadness…

722
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,067
for the first time

723
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,487
in this strange and new 19th life.

724
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,462
Seo-ha.

725
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:17,548
Please don't cry.

726
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:52,875
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

727
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,961
Why does she

728
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,714
remind me of Ju-won?

729
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:00,425
This is the issue
with reincarnating too soon.

730
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,635
She's made contact with her previous life.

731
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:06,556
Were you the one
who changed the flowers in the lobby?

732
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,559
He keeps avoiding me,
but I want to get closer.

733
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,018
I like you.

734
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,729
Is Mr. Ha coming?

735
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,981
Do you like Director Mun?

736
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,400
Why do you need to know?

737
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:19,026
Hey! Ban Ji-eum.

738
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,778
What are you doing?

739
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,157
Because I like Director Mun.
