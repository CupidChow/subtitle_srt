1
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,970
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

2
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,482
Catch me if you can!

3
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,484
-I'm going to get you!
-No!

4
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,360
No!

5
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,653
I got you!

6
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,572
The face is on backwards.

7
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,032
Its head is facing the back.

8
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,996
Ju-won!

9
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,931
I promise to be born again

10
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,975
and come back to protect you.

11
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,465
Cho-won.

12
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,425
Look at your sister.

13
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,972
What did you say?

14
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:19,889
Cho-won.

15
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,309
I am…

16
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,521
Yoon Ju-won.

17
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,485
Are you pretending again?

18
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,821
Why are you doing this?

19
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,032
Ms. Yoon, look at me.

20
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,037
I've never once pretended to be anything
from the moment we met.

21
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,373
I've been holding back until now,

22
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,251
but I just can't do it anymore.

23
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,380
So I'm telling you this
even though I shouldn't.

24
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,054
I remember my past lives.

25
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,558
And in my past life,

26
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,228
I was Yoon Ju-won.

27
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,357
I believe everyone is like me.

28
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,778
Everyone reincarnates each time they die.

29
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,782
What sets me apart…

30
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,163
is that I remember my past lives.

31
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,416
What does that…

32
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,459
I actually

33
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,794
visited our parents' house many times.

34
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,339
Because…

35
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,094
I missed you,

36
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,931
Mom, and Dad.

37
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,644
I remember everything.

38
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,563
I remember all the precious memories

39
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,149
we had together.

40
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,425
How pretty.

41
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,826
What do you remember?

42
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,661
You were born

43
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,747
on the day of that year's first snow.

44
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,291
December 7.

45
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,793
Anyone could figure that out.

46
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,338
You have three moles behind your neck.

47
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,927
I saw them whenever I tied your hair.

48
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,641
Also…

49
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,727
you have a scar here, right?

50
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,274
You were crawling around as a baby
and a mirror shattered on you.

51
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,111
Mom and I cried a lot
because your wound was so deep.

52
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,790
You told her?

53
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,751
Why all of a sudden?

54
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,421
You said it didn't go well
when you told your family before.

55
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,759
But you accepted me.

56
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,554
I guess

57
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,348
I was momentarily swayed
because I wanted to be close to her

58
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,893
like I am with you.

59
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,355
So did she believe you?

60
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,942
She seemed a bit dubious.

61
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,695
What if she tells Seo-ha or her mom?

62
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,780
Come on.

63
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,991
Cho-won knows how to keep a secret.

64
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,870
Goodness. You were here?

65
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,456
Yes, I was.
I'll be stepping out for a while.

66
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,499
Okay.

67
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:42,318
THE SPOT IN ONE'S HEART FROM LONGING

68
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,614
How did it go?

69
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,493
I'll be working and living there for now.

70
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,329
What about you, Han-na?

71
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,747
You were going to see him last time.

72
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,874
I just…

73
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,711
saw him from afar.

74
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,149
Ji-eum and the woman she lives with

75
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,317
seem to have met in her past life.

76
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,697
Didn't you say that would harm
the people from her past lives?

77
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,116
Ms. Kim Ae-gyeong
seems to have been ill for some time now.

78
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,869
And she's hiding it from Ji-eum.

79
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,123
Why do you think this is happening?

80
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:06,903
Oh, my goodness.

81
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,322
What are you doing so late at night?

82
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:13,576
All our azaleas
in the garden were withered.

83
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,620
It was keeping me up.

84
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,831
They just withered all of a sudden?

85
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,667
I dug to the roots
and they were all dried up there too.

86
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,213
Why are you here already?
I thought I'd see you this weekend.

87
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,589
Just because.

88
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,508
Mom.

89
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,304
Do I have three moles behind my neck?

90
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,388
Yes.

91
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,848
What about them?

92
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,726
Did I have them ever since I was little?

93
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,644
Yes.

94
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,896
Why do you ask?

95
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,650
Then do I have a scar back here?

96
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,362
I didn't know you remembered this.

97
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,530
So I do have one?

98
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,907
How did I get it?

99
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,744
You were crawling around as a baby.

100
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,329
And I think a mirror fell on you.

101
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,254
-Then…
-I believe you were four.

102
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,756
You were distracted by a parade
at an amusement park.

103
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,468
And you let go of Dad's hand
so we looked for you all day.

104
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,637
The day you lost your first tooth.

105
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:19,267
You put it in your pocket
before we went to bed.

106
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,562
I can't believe you remember all of that.

107
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,442
So it's true?

108
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,152
What do you mean?

109
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,737
Mom.

110
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,656
Yes?

111
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,950
What kind of person…

112
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,246
was Ju-won?

113
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,796
Why are you suddenly asking about her?

114
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,477
Ms. Yoon?

115
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,022
Is something wrong?

116
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,357
No.

117
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,485
I'll finish up this area
by the end of the day and…

118
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,825
Do you believe in past lives?

119
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,870
Do you believe in past lives?

120
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,582
You sisters are so similar.

121
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,584
What do you mean?

122
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,462
Ju-won asked me the same question.

123
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,048
Did she really?

124
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,091
What else did she say to you?

125
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,640
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,184
I'm sorry for bringing her up.

127
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,980
Is Ms. Ban at the office?

128
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,066
She took the day off.

129
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,203
What do you want?

130
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,330
This is your last chance
to give me the name.

131
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,208
-What name?
-The name of the boss

132
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,168
of Wonjo Capital.

133
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,962
It's Mr. Bang Ho-sik.

134
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,714
Hey, Ban Dong-u.

135
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,425
In warfare,

136
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,845
you need to behead
your enemy's commander to be victorious.

137
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:30,231
MY 5TH LIFE

138
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,936
Get me Bang Ho-sik.

139
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,064
What a lunatic.

140
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,735
Hey!

141
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,135
Ban Dong-u said his sister
could pay off his debt

142
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,636
so we looked for her yesterday.

143
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,722
But it turns out that her boyfriend

144
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,141
is the son of MI Group's chairman.

145
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,853
MI Group?

146
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,192
That's our boss, ma'am.

147
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,151
Goodness.

148
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,779
To what do I owe the pleasure,
pretty lady?

149
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,574
I'm the sister of your debtor,
Mr. Ban Dong-u.

150
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,077
I believe he owes you
around 100 million won in total.

151
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,000
I hope we can settle with this.

152
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,802
What is this?

153
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,429
It's a Goryeo celadon.

154
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,098
I'm sure you've heard of them.

155
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,059
Get it appraised,

156
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,646
and you'll know that it costs
much more than my brother's debt.

157
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,191
You're trying to pay off his debt
with some vase?

158
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,030
I heard chaebol families
store things like this in their vaults.

159
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,074
Maybe it's from her boyfriend.

160
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,118
You think so?

161
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,538
Well…

162
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,455
I'll take it

163
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,832
for now.

164
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,960
I didn't think you'd be this cooperative.

165
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,921
But you have quite an open mind.

166
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,884
That's how I came this far.

167
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,221
A lot of people have told me
that's why I've made it big…

168
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,057
I hope I never have to see you again.

169
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,810
I saw that your business isn't registered.

170
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,938
We don't want any trouble, do we?

171
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,148
CONFIRMATION OF DEBT REPAYMENT

172
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,483
CREDITOR: WONJO CAPITAL

173
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,151
Here.

174
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,361
Your seal, please.

175
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,746
WONJO CAPITAL

176
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,463
What the hell is she up to?

177
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,009
She's really driving me crazy.

178
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,387
Yang-sik.

179
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,432
Look up the name
of the MI Group chairman's son.

180
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,349
Yes, sir.

181
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,644
MI CHAIRMAN

182
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,730
MUN JEONG-HUN

183
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,316
The chairman's name is Mun Jeong-hun.

184
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,901
His son's name is…

185
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:02,818
Mun…

186
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,738
-Mun Seo-ha.
-Yes, sir.

187
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,822
That's his name.

188
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,240
How did you know?

189
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,825
How do I know?

190
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,243
That was my work.

191
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:12,870
Sorry?

192
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,204
What work?

193
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,289
You see,

194
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,041
when Mun Seo-ha was little,

195
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,960
he got into a pretty big car accident.

196
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,504
But you know what?

197
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,673
It wasn't an accident.

198
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,050
Sorry?

199
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,763
I almost got a heart attack
because the wrong kid died.

200
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,107
-Thank you for the food.
-See you again.

201
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,234
Let me do it.

202
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,904
I thought you were busy,
but you're home early.

203
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,405
I took care of everything.

204
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,700
Although it's upsetting how I had to
sacrifice my day off for that.

205
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,078
And I didn't get to see Seo-ha all day.

206
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:54,995
Look at you.

207
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,379
All right.

208
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,673
I want to see Seo-ha.

209
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,138
Director Mun.

210
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,724
Uncle, just leave it there!

211
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,018
I can do it, okay?

212
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,647
Director Mun Seo-ha, what brings you here?

213
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,482
-Uncle, you're still going on about him?
-Auntie.

214
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,733
What is it, Uncle?

215
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,112
This is Director Mun Seo-ha.

216
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,449
Hello.

217
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,160
I'm Kim Ae-gyeong, Ji-eum's aunt.

218
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,662
Well…

219
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,916
Ji-eum is so easygoing
that her nickname is Uncle.

220
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,377
I see.

221
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,090
What would you like to eat?

222
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,468
I'll have your specialty.

223
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,386
All right!

224
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,221
Have a seat.

225
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,389
-This way.
-This way.

226
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,113
I was just curious

227
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,615
why you took the day off.

228
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,535
You were curious about me?

229
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,621
That's nice to hear.

230
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,583
You always put yourself in danger.

231
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,210
So I was also worried.

232
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,504
I put up a better fight than you think.

233
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,798
Director Mun.

234
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,426
This is our rice and side dish set.

235
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,469
Thank you.

236
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,386
Right.

237
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,096
I've heard a lot about you, ma'am.

238
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,807
-I see.
-I heard you loved our hotel.

239
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,100
What hotel?

240
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,520
Back in 1997.

241
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,357
Ms. Ban said something
quite memorable during her interview.

242
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,401
And I was told that she heard it from you.

243
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,030
I also heard that you write books.

244
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,157
She told me about the one
during the Japanese invasion of Korea.

245
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,827
You also said
she's very experienced in flamenco.

246
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,995
Yes, this is her.

247
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,872
My flamenco auntie.

248
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,918
Yes, that's me.

249
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,088
I love dancing.

250
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,173
The food's getting cold. Eat up.

251
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,925
-You should eat it now.
-Okay.

252
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,511
-Let me know if you need me to dance.
-Yes, ma'am.

253
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,595
-Thanks, Auntie.
-Sure.

254
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,225
Enjoy.

255
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:22,893
Thank you.

256
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,233
It's good.

257
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,347
Hi, Mom.

258
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,182
Cho-won.

259
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,226
I was wondering
why you suddenly came by last time

260
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,687
and asked about Ju-won.

261
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,023
Why do you ask?

262
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,066
Well…

263
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,027
It's just been on my mind.

264
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,404
I was just curious.

265
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,198
I wanted to know
what kind of person she was.

266
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,741
Why all of a sudden?

267
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,910
I was too little back then.

268
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,663
So I saw her as just my older sister.

269
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,749
I didn't get to know
what kind of person she was.

270
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,794
Ju-won was one of a kind.

271
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,297
She was odd too.

272
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,593
She was anything but ordinary.

273
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,012
What do you mean by that?

274
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,350
I've never had a mom like you.

275
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,730
I'll remember you in my next life.

276
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,234
Even if I die,
I'll come back to see you in my next life.

277
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,029
So don't be too sad.

278
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,326
Did she really promise
to come back when she's reborn?

279
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,119
I waited for her at times.

280
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,414
I even looked outside
when I heard some noises.

281
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,543
But she never came.

282
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:14,880
Have we…

283
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,008
met before?

284
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,637
Oh, no!

285
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,180
I am…

286
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,599
-What's this?
-Yoon Ju-won.

287
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,685
I believe everyone is like me.

288
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,148
Everyone reincarnates each time they die.

289
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,735
What sets me apart…

290
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,364
is that I remember my past lives.

291
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:46,078
She keeps reminding me of Ju-won.

292
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,746
I remember my past lives.

293
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,207
And in my past life,

294
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,960
I was Yoon Ju-won.

295
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,088
Mom.

296
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,673
I need to be somewhere right now.

297
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,924
I'll call you back later.

298
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,302
Bye.

299
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,059
HILL OF CHO-WON

300
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,249
Ms. Yoon.

301
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,349
What brings you here so late?

302
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,898
I'm going to…

303
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,361
believe you.

304
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:05,991
I…

305
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,535
want to believe it.

306
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,040
To be honest, I still don't get it.

307
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,751
You were my sister in your past life?

308
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,587
That's just ridiculous.

309
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,591
So…

310
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,429
if I find out later that you were lying,

311
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,932
I'm never going to forgive you.

312
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,644
Okay?

313
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,796
I missed you,

314
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,548
Ju-won.

315
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,018
Me too.

316
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,944
I missed you too.

317
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,656
This life is different.

318
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:36,164
My 19th life is strange and new.

319
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,837
Cho-won.

320
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,047
Thank you.

321
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,441
She's made contact with her previous life.

322
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,236
She even revealed her identity.

323
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,947
Does she know?

324
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,368
That things will get complicated
if she does that?

325
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,997
I don't think she does.

326
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,499
That's why she's doing this.

327
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,596
You haven't changed one bit.

328
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,224
What do you mean? I've changed a lot.

329
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,438
There are certain things
about a person that never change.

330
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,983
And for you, it's your kind heart.

331
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,611
You think so?

332
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,658
I can't believe that you're back.

333
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,244
I must've been a hero
in my past life to deserve this.

334
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,662
I feel blessed.

335
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,334
I can't wait to tell Mom about this.

336
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:04,878
Ms. Yoon.

337
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,216
Let's keep this between ourselves for now.

338
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,052
Am I not allowed to tell her?

339
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,179
It's just that…

340
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,973
It never turned out well.

341
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,560
They can't accept the fact
that their deceased child

342
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,979
has returned as someone else.

343
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,942
And telling her this secret

344
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,488
could affect other relationships too.

345
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,409
So should this be kept
from Seo-ha as well?

346
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,164
That's a bit

347
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,959
more complicated.

348
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,337
He's still in a lot of pain
because of Ju-won.

349
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,801
Sometimes I think
I should just stay away from him.

350
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,138
But then again,

351
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,851
just thinking about him makes me miss him.

352
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,488
Let's go this way.

353
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,136
MS. YOON JU-WON WAS ALREADY DECEASED
BY THE TIME THE RESCUERS GOT THERE

354
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,763
This should be my jackpot.

355
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,473
THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK
HAD FLED THE SCENE…

356
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:46,521
If I catch the hit-and-run driver
and hand him over to the police…

357
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,776
Will I get some money as a reward?

358
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,449
Damn it.

359
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,659
Come on.

360
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,006
Why are you doing a headstand?

361
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:14,966
Is something wrong?

362
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,303
Are you worried
now that you told Cho-won the truth?

363
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,431
My head is throbbing.

364
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,433
It'll be fine.

365
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,227
Of course it'll be fine.

366
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,064
Are you going somewhere?

367
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,486
Sweet Min-gi is taking me out

368
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,614
for some fresh air
and some tasty duck soup.

369
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,367
"Sweet Min-gi"?

370
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,744
He works for me so I can call him that.

371
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,120
He's a sweet kid.

372
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,290
-Min-gi.
-Good morning.

373
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,960
-Gosh, Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

374
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,545
You look so young today.

375
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,381
Don't make me laugh.

376
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,384
Actually, should I dye my hair black?

377
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,760
Then I'll look much younger.

378
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,136
Sounds good.

379
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,931
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

380
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,101
-Enjoy your meal.
-Okay.

381
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,310
One more thing.

382
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,230
This is a date so don't you dare call me.

383
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,856
-I won't.
-Bye.

384
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,791
Are you all right?

385
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,131
I'm okay.

386
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,092
Let's go.

387
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,195
Why is his room so empty?

388
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,367
Who is he?

389
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,765
Who carries shaman bells around?

390
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,559
Those images were from my dreams.

391
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,938
Why would they pop up now?

392
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,770
"Yoon Cho-won."

393
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,732
YOON CHO-WON

394
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,234
SECOND DAUGHTER OF WW ENTERTAINMENT

395
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:09,742
YOON JU-WON OF WW ENTERTAINMENT DEAD,
MUN SEO-HA OF MI GROUP SEVERELY INJURED

396
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,910
THE DRIVER, MR. HA, PASSED AWAY…

397
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,288
"The driver, Mr. Ha…"

398
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,332
"Mr. Ha."

399
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,752
"Mr. Ha"?

400
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:41,149
I KNOW WHO CAUSED
THE CAR ACCIDENT YOU WERE IN

401
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,798
Why isn't he responding?

402
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,010
He should at least text me back.

403
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,307
I should've just tipped off
a reporter instead.

404
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,606
Mr. Ban Dong-u?

405
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,774
You startled me.

406
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,321
What are you doing here?

407
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,658
I know who was behind it.

408
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,534
Who was behind what?

409
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,746
I'm talking about the car accident you had
when you were little.

410
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,539
What are you…

411
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,417
talking about right now?

412
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:45,213
I'm saying that I know
who tried to kill you.

413
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,548
Someone…

414
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,301
tried to kill me?

415
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:55,765
Have a seat.

416
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,603
I don't have any intention
to sit down for a chat.

417
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,980
Well, I definitely heard it.

418
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,651
Someone said that the car accident
was his work.

419
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:08,778
That accident…

420
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,115
was just that, an accident.

421
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:16,411
Are you deaf?
You're really not getting what I'm saying.

422
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,787
I'm telling you.

423
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:21,874
I definitely heard him say
that it wasn't just an accident.

424
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,002
What was it again?

425
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,798
"I almost got a heart attack
because the wrong kid died."

426
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,008
He even said that.

427
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,748
"I almost got a heart attack
because the wrong kid died."

428
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,999
He even said that.

429
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,171
I'm saying that I know
who tried to kill you.

430
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,227
Help.

431
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,023
Help.

432
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,943
Help.

433
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,536
Seo-ha.

434
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,716
"I almost got a heart attack
because the wrong kid died."

435
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,009
He even said that.

436
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,361
-1,120 mm.
-1,120 mm.

437
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,324
-940 mm.
-940 mm.

438
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,827
Could you measure the frame as well?

439
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,203
780 mm.

440
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,373
Hi, Ji-eum!

441
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,215
Ms. Yoon, can I have a word?

442
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,260
Excuse me.

443
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,891
You shouldn't be
so casual with me at work.

444
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,060
You're right. It just came out.

445
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,688
This won't do.

446
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,356
Let's call each other like we always have.

447
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,901
I was indeed your sister in the past,

448
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,028
but I'm Ban Ji-eum now.

449
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,863
Okay, Ji-eum.

450
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,615
There you go again.

451
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:50,833
Mr. Ha?

452
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,628
I'm sorry for intruding.

453
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,921
I'll leave you to it.

454
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,631
Mr. Ha, wait!

455
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,841
Hold on, Mr. Ha.

456
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,470
I didn't hear the door open.
Since when were you here?

457
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,349
Don't worry.

458
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,392
Let's just say I didn't hear anything.

459
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,394
Did you hear everything?

460
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,690
Tell me exactly what you heard.

461
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,817
"Let's call each other
like we always have."

462
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,612
"I was indeed your sister in the past,
but I'm Ban Ji-eum now."

463
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,529
And…

464
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,698
This is bad.

465
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,662
You don't believe anything
that we just said, do you?

466
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,998
How could anyone possibly believe it?

467
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,628
I have a meeting to attend.

468
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,714
I see.

469
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,722
All the more reason why
I can't let you go.

470
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,100
If you leave like this,

471
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,853
you'll think I persuaded Ms. Yoon
to make her believe that I'm Ju-won.

472
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,522
That's true.

473
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,775
Because I'm not as naive as her.

474
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,111
Mr. Ha.

475
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,863
I'm not that much of an idiot.

476
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,573
I had my suspicions at first.

477
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,618
But she knew everything about me

478
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,036
that only my sister would.

479
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,836
I need to go.

480
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,838
What do you want me to do then?

481
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,386
You may go.

482
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,346
But please keep this a secret.

483
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,142
Sure, I'll do that.

484
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,311
Mr. Ha.

485
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,730
I like you.

486
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,815
-What?
-What?

487
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:49,076
I meant to say that I trust you.

488
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,373
Anyway, I'll pretend like
I didn't hear anything here.

489
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,589
What do I do?

490
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,799
I'm not sure.

491
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,509
What should we do with you?

492
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,639
WONJO CAPITAL
SAME-DAY LOAN! IMMEDIATE LOAN!

493
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,893
The boss of Wonjo Capital…

494
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,437
I mean, Mr. Bang Ho-sik said so.

495
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,938
Go check for yourself.

496
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:32,661
Going somewhere?

497
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,246
Yes.

498
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,791
My schedule is free for the day, right?

499
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,584
What is it? Do you need a ride?

500
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,502
Yes.

501
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,754
Actually, never mind.

502
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:43,798
I can go alone.

503
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,676
Is this about the family meeting tomorrow?

504
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,597
Can you make up an excuse for me?

505
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,141
You know better than me
what'll happen if you don't attend.

506
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,186
They act as if it's so important.

507
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,022
I'll be there on time. Don't worry.

508
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,453
WONJO CAPITAL
SAME-DAY LOAN! IMMEDIATE LOAN!

509
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,956
It's heavy. Be careful.

510
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:18,958
Do you want gloves?

511
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:19,875
No, I'll be fine.

512
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:10,301
WONJO CAPITAL

513
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,052
How may I help you?

514
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,264
We haven't had
such a decent-looking customer in a while.

515
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,091
How do you do?

516
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,553
Director Mun Seo-ha from MI Hotel is here.

517
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:55,471
But the thing is…

518
00:41:56,263 --> 00:42:02,686
He seems to have
found out something about the accident.

519
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:04,897
No.

520
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,193
He's asking who was behind it,

521
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,446
so I don't think he knows to that extent.

522
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,449
Yes, of course.

523
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:19,328
I told him that I knew nothing about it.

524
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,665
So I was indeed murdered in my past life.

525
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,334
Then who was behind it?

526
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,254
Hold on.

527
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,048
So Seo-ha knows about this now?

528
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,181
I heard that you said

529
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,684
that my accident was not purely by chance.

530
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,396
I just want to know

531
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,939
who gave you the order.

532
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,942
You have one week.

533
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,208
Poor Seo-ha.

534
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,543
Did you know that Do-yun's father

535
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,629
was the driver who passed away
during your accident?

536
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,677
Sir.

537
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,806
You shouldn't move.

538
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,475
Stay still.

539
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,439
Mister…

540
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,733
The ambulance is on its way.

541
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,402
So please…

542
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,197
Please hang in there.

543
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:38,991
You should've told me.

544
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,243
I'd love to say hello to him.

545
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,580
Director Mun, memorial services
are family only.

546
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,124
-Well aren't you a peach?
-Yeah. How nice.

547
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,709
You're like family to us, right?

548
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:55,633
Sir.

549
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,885
I'd like to change my destination.

550
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:07,686
Bang Ho-sik.

551
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,692
Who were you speaking to?

552
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,237
What's it to you?

553
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,740
That car accident you mentioned…

554
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,992
I died in that crash.

555
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,037
Who gave you the order?

556
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,581
Have you gone insane?

557
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,461
I can kill you in a heartbeat.

558
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,005
So you better tell me.

559
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,383
If I told you,

560
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,760
I'd be dead anyway.

561
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:49,937
Pull over.

562
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,903
-Get out.
-Sorry?

563
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:02,991
You heard me.

564
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:04,868
Yes, sir.

565
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,265
Sir.

566
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,766
I can assure you

567
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,894
that Chan-hyeok
has turned over a new leaf.

568
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,192
Not the HQ.

569
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,822
Director Lee Sang-hyuck
said he would personally oversee him,

570
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,032
so please give Chan-hyeok another chance.

571
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,036
I'll do my best, sir.

572
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,499
Did you hear that?
He said he'll do his best.

573
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,170
Are you going to
hurt my feelings like this?

574
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,844
I guess today's not the day.

575
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:04,845
Wait outside.

576
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,274
Sir.

577
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,319
Mr. Im of 24 Caps is here.

578
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,612
It seems urgent.

579
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,917
I should play a game of Go with you today.

580
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,092
I'll reconsider it.

581
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,428
So you may go.

582
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,517
Sir.

583
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,268
Thank you.

584
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,466
He looks familiar.

585
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,051
Okay.

586
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,595
So what did the chairman say?

587
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,222
I barely managed to persuade him.

588
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,516
I have a question.

589
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:37,104
Remember that man
who used to work for Chairman Mun?

590
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,605
He was from
the Agency for National Security Planning.

591
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,773
What's he up to these days?

592
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,484
He's running a security company.

593
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,319
He's the CEO of 24 Caps.

594
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,654
Why do you ask?

595
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:48,490
He came to visit the chairman today.

596
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,993
I don't know what's going on.

597
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,620
Can you look into it?

598
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,163
As soon as possible.

599
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,596
Where are you, Mr. Ha?

600
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,765
Are you with Director Mun?

601
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,225
-No, I'm at the office. What is it?
-It's just…

602
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,437
He's not picking up.
And I don't think he's home either.

603
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,856
Any idea where he could be?

604
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:04,691
I'm not sure.

605
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,777
I can't think of anywhere else
but his house.

606
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,907
Please give me a call
if you can reach him.

607
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,712
Mr. Ha.

608
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,467
You're still here?

609
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,303
I was checking the landscaping project.
I'm leaving now.

610
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,181
Were you waiting for me?

611
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,476
Care to have dinner with me?

612
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,479
Someone is waiting for me.

613
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:45,649
Who?

614
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,653
Thank you for your hard work today.

615
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,113
Have a good weekend.

616
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,903
-You spent too much today.
-Hey.

617
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,864
-Don't worry about it.
-They had only two of these.

618
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:36,324
-No, don't touch it.
-Hey, Do-yun.

619
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,368
Here for Dae-hun's birthday party?

620
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,413
You know, Seo-ha's secretary?

621
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,123
-Oh, it's him.
-I see.

622
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,417
Poor you, man.

623
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,544
Did Seo-ha say anything to you?

624
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,712
Hey.

625
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,547
How much does he pay you?

626
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:53,383
If I paid you twice as much,
would you work for me instead?

627
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,634
Would you?

628
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,719
Hey!

629
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,429
Hey, Cho-won!

630
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,140
Ji-seok.

631
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:01,933
Ji-seok.

632
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:03,810
Let's go.

633
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,897
Hey! Are they insane?

634
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,814
Hey!

635
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,066
Hey! Cho-won!

636
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,236
Don't worry about him.
He's always been unrefined.

637
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,322
Ms. Yoon.

638
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:18,867
Please let me go.

639
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:20,702
No.

640
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,537
I don't want to let go right now.

641
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:26,583
I have my pride too.
It's best to ignore these things.

642
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,085
How could I when it's about you?

643
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:33,173
I get treated like this all the time
while working for Seo-ha.

644
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,552
If you don't let go of me,

645
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,347
people will now talk about
how I'm trying to hit on a wealthy girl.

646
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:44,684
Please let go.

647
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,112
I don't need
another reason to be ridiculed

648
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,615
just for being by someone's side.

649
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,929
What's this?

650
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,350
I thought you had plans today.

651
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:26,518
Why are you here?

652
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,188
We need to talk.

653
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,232
Seo-ha.

654
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:40,991
What's this about?

655
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:46,746
Do you…

656
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,752
have a photo of your father
in your wallet?

657
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,138
Do-yun.

658
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,098
How could you?

659
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,601
I don't know what this is about.

660
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,021
-But that's enough.
-Is it true

661
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,440
that he was my father's driver?

662
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,987
-Yes.
-Was he the one driving the car…

663
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,158
on the day of the accident?

664
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,747
-He was.
-Then why didn't you tell me?

665
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,500
And what would be the point

666
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,669
of telling you?

667
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,214
-Let's drop it.
-Do-yun.

668
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:39,633
Do-yun!

669
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,471
And you call yourself a friend?

670
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,932
I've never been your friend.

671
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,392
I'm your secretary.

672
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,145
Do-yun.

673
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,394
My father simply passed away…

674
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,356
while working like any other day.

675
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,613
I didn't mean it
when I said I was never your friend.

676
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,450
I was just too angry that--

677
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,702
I know.

678
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,206
I was just…

679
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:57,335
mad at myself for being in the dark.

680
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:05,677
I'm sorry.

681
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,485
Director Mun.

682
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,571
What are you doing here?

683
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,033
Nothing much.

684
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,285
I just missed you.

685
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,540
How long were you here for?

686
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:23,713
It's been quite a while since I realized
how hard it is to wait for someone.

687
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,354
Can I keep you company tonight?

688
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,423
Can you give me a hug?

689
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,726
I once desired to live a normal life.

690
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,734
I wanted to meet the love of my life

691
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:12,447
and have our story end
with a happily ever after.

692
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,617
I desperately wanted that.

693
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,456
Director Mun.

694
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:26,002
We're not going to have a bad ending.

695
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,337
I'll stay by your side.

696
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:52,422
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

697
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,299
Do you remember your past lives too?

698
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:57,927
That's going to help you find out
why you remember your past lives.

699
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,556
I don't think that accident
was a simple hit-and-run.

700
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:05,768
We need to keep our guard up
and lie low if we want to live.

701
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,062
We at least need to know who killed her.

702
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,024
Not Yoon Cho-won.

703
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,401
Was I with you last night, Ms. Yoon?

704
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,527
Mr. Ha.

705
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,279
You like me, don't you?

706
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:19,407
If we ever met in our past lives,

707
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,908
what relationship
do you think we would have had?

708
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:22,577
Please date me.

709
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:28,458
