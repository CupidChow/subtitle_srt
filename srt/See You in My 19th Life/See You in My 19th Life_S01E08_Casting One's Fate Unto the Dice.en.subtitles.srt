SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

2
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,035
During the Japanese invasion,

3
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,206
I ran endlessly after losing my baby.

4
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,418
After running for a long time,

5
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,547
I ended up focused solely on my breathing.

6
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:43,353
And I thought of something as I stood
at a white buckwheat flower field.

7
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,066
"These hard times are bound to pass."

8
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,151
"And…

9
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,655
I will eventually arrive somewhere

10
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,577
and be able to continue living again."

CASTING ONE'S FATE UNTO THE DICE

12
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,249
You must find the relationships

13
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,043
you remember from your first life.

WEBTOON ORIGINAL SERIES
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE CREATED BY LEE HEY

15
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,350
Director Mun.

16
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,074
Sir.

17
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:49,867
What is it?

18
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,994
They'll be concluding it as suicide.

19
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,296
Chairman Mun still owes a lot
to Chan-hyeok and me.

20
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,468
Just know that you're the only one

21
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,221
that I go easy on.

22
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,441
CHAIRMAN MUN

23
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,194
Hello, sir.

24
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,613
I didn't expect you to call at this hour.

25
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,118
Yes, sir.

26
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,038
He's asking for you. Is your phone dead?

27
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,708
Here, talk to him.

28
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,170
Hello, sir.

29
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,965
Understood, sir.

30
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,303
What did he say?

31
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,055
He wants to have
a breakfast meeting tomorrow.

32
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,683
What is it about
that he even had to call me to find you?

33
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,019
He probably knew that you called me in

34
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,855
since things with Seo-ha got complicated.

35
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,277
Whatever.

36
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,571
I'm leaving.

37
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,406
You want me to drink alone?

38
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,439
You must know

39
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,608
why I suddenly called you over.

40
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,485
I heard you were with Seo-ha

41
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,570
during the incident.

42
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,614
Yes, sir.

43
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,950
If you truly cared about Seo-ha,

44
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,287
you should've stopped him
from putting himself in danger.

45
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,383
Are you hiding something?

46
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,387
-What?
-Your son almost died when he was little,

47
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,805
and he got hurt today.

48
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,141
Of all people,

49
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,311
I thought you as his father
would be most eager to catch the culprit.

50
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,814
I'll leave that to the police.

51
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,364
I am protecting him as his father.

52
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,866
I just need you to be quiet.

53
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,329
Keeping my mouth shut
is your way of protecting your son?

54
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,126
Do you perhaps know who the culprit is?

55
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,169
I can't talk any sense into you.

56
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,090
Don't say I didn't warn you.

57
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,426
You may go.

58
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,395
That hit-and-run driver?

59
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,564
I recruited him.

60
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,028
-Hey, something's wrong.
-What?

61
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:54,945
Take this

62
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,031
-and run.
-I'm not leaving you behind.

63
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,283
It's okay. Just go.

64
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,201
Hurry.

65
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,291
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

66
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,548
Gosh, that's nice.

67
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,467
All right.

68
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,927
Let me feed you first.

69
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,345
Okay.

70
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,931
Look at you eating so well.

71
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,516
-It's good.
-Is it?

72
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,600
Yes.

73
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,398
Min-gi.

74
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,569
I don't know
why you're always out and busy.

75
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,698
But make sure you don't skip any meals.

76
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,117
Okay?

77
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,871
-Okay.
-And let me know if you crave anything.

78
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,373
I will.

79
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,461
Let me feed you once more.

80
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,879
-Here.
-I'm still chewing.

81
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,506
-Are you?
-Please eat.

82
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,842
-Is it too much? Here.
-Yes.

83
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,762
Is he your long-lost son or something?

84
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,223
You came just in time.
Come eat while it's still hot.

85
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,224
Sit down.

86
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,767
It's okay. I'm too tired.

87
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,977
You're tired?

88
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,812
You should still eat.

89
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,315
Here.

90
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,693
What is this?

91
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,195
I was just passing by
and thought it'd suit you.

92
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,113
Goodness.

93
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,865
Is this for me?

94
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,284
My goodness. Let me see.

95
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,582
Goodness, gracious.

96
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,542
I love mustard.

97
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,295
My, it's so pretty.

98
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,298
You're always in my heart.

99
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,967
And you're in mine.

100
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,761
-Goodness.
-It suits you.

101
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,846
-Really?
-Yes.

102
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,055
-It suits me?
-It does.

103
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,016
Unbelievable.

104
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,560
-Min-gi, can I have a word with you?
-It's so pretty.

105
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,812
Let me borrow him for a minute.

106
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,106
You should eat first.

107
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,280
They've gotten closer.

108
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,742
Gosh, this is gorgeous.

109
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,454
I remembered my first life.

110
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,790
Actually, I saw it.

111
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,043
Was it because of the shaman bells?

112
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,421
Please elaborate.

113
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,466
I was in an unfamiliar place.

114
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,052
I was looking at someone from behind.

115
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,888
And my memory overlapped with him.

116
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,602
There were many people.

117
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,773
And I recognized one of them.

118
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,234
Who was it?

119
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,862
Someone very dear to me in this life.

120
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,826
Mr. Kang.

121
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,789
Was it really a coincidence

122
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,124
that you came here to work?

123
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,671
Were you a part of

124
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,173
my first life?

125
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,679
Why aren't you answering me?

126
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,472
Were we…

127
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,187
lovers a thousand years ago?

128
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,734
Of course not.

129
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,778
Is that so?

130
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,948
I thought we were each other's
first love or something.

131
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,366
Wait.

132
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,703
Try touching the bells again.

133
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,872
Then maybe you'll remember.

134
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,824
Could it be that Seo-ha and I met
in my first life?

135
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,452
Grab them again.

136
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,995
It's okay. That was enough.

137
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,998
I should get going.

138
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,987
Hello, Master Cheon-un.

139
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,424
Our boss didn't commit suicide.

140
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,052
He said the evidence is in this bag.

141
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,164
CONFIRMATION OF DEBT REPAYMENT

142
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,583
"Dump truck operation"?

143
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,668
"April 23, 1998."

144
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,562
DEBTOR
NAME: BAN HAK-SU

145
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,814
"Ban Hak-su."

146
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,071
DEBT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM

DEBTOR: BAN HAK-SU
JOINT SURETY: BAN DONG-U

148
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,619
"Ban Dong-u."

149
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,914
I definitely heard him say
that it wasn't just an accident.

150
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,183
FATHER: BAN HAK-SU
BROTHER: BAN DONG-U

151
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,521
DEBTOR: BAN HAK-SU
JOINT SURETY: BAN DONG-U

152
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,695
At times, an enemy from your past life
becomes your family in the present.

153
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,115
In that case,
it's best to just cut ties with them.

154
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,868
That's so heartless.

155
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,912
It's not heartless.

156
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:25,914
It's serious.

157
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,666
Life is serious.

158
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:55,444
RÉSUMÉ
NAME: BAN JI-EUM

159
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,424
-"Ban Ji-eum."
-Give that to me.

160
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,592
Who is this?

161
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,595
-Give me my phone.
-"MI Hotel Director Mun Seo-ha."

162
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,846
What's it to you?

163
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,389
-MI…
-Come on!

164
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,141
Give it to me!

165
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,185
How dare you?

166
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,794
Hello?

167
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,379
Where are you?

168
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,174
I'm about to go to bed.

169
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,678
Come on. I can hear the crickets.

170
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,513
Are you outside?

171
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,308
I couldn't sleep,
so I'm out for some fresh air.

172
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,686
I should've tucked you in.

173
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,812
What a shame.

174
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,151
Do that thing you're good at.

175
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,697
Director Mun.

176
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,115
If we

177
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,410
ever met in our past lives,

178
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,161
what relationship
do you think we would have had?

179
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,372
I'm not sure.

180
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,000
Try to imagine it.

181
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,586
What do you think we would have been

182
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,297
if we had met a thousand years ago?

183
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,927
A general and his pony.

184
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,555
"Pony"?

185
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,517
You'd be the general,
and I would be the pony.

186
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,562
You really don't know
how to be romantic, do you?

187
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,065
Okay, hear me out.

188
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,902
A man and a woman
are standing face to face on a bridge

189
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,447
while fireworks surround them.

190
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,659
The man is as handsome as the bright moon.

191
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,662
While the woman is as beautiful
as a lotus in full bloom.

192
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,040
That's when we meet for the first time

193
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,917
and fall in love.

194
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,005
What do you think?

195
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,134
Keep going.

196
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,387
We loved each other passionately.

197
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,891
But we were sadly killed
after we were framed for being traitors.

198
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,687
So we've met again in this life

199
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,816
to fulfill our love that was cut short.

200
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,278
That's intriguing.

201
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,157
I wonder if past lives

202
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,659
really do exist.

203
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,247
I bet they do.

204
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:58,293
I bet lovers like us are only destined
to meet every thousand years.

205
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,253
In that case,

206
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,006
what'll happen to us now?

207
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,053
There must be a reason
why we crossed paths again.

208
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,307
What do you think it is?

209
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,107
I'd rather there…

210
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,194
not be a reason.

211
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,029
Why not?

212
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,035
I just don't want there to be one.

213
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,498
All right then.

214
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,458
Let's just say

215
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,419
that we're destined
to love each other for no reason.

216
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,048
We'll be in love like everyone else,

217
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,968
then break free
from the reincarnation cycle.

218
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,847
Our souls will then become one,

219
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,598
and we'll find peace.

220
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,018
Can you repeat…

221
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,772
the last part again?

222
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,529
Our souls will become one,

223
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,408
and we'll find peace.

224
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,083
Dad is back.

225
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,252
Looks like he wants to ask you for money.

226
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,422
They're just unbelievable.

227
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,821
RÉSUMÉ
NAME: BAN JI-EUM

228
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,169
Hello, sir.

229
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,464
Good morning.

230
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,972
What's wrong with him?

231
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,767
Director Mun is acting strange.

232
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,145
What do you mean? He seems fine.

233
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,856
He looks too clean-cut today.

234
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,276
Isn't he always clean-cut?

235
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,695
No, he's way too clean-cut.

236
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,698
Mr. Ha, did something happen
on your way here?

237
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,408
No.

238
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,119
Director Mun is always clean-cut.

239
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,620
There's nothing to worry about.

240
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,804
This is Ban Ji-eum
from the Strategic Planning Team.

241
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:38,847
I'm in the hotel lobby.

242
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,807
Why aren't you answering my--

243
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,828
Your father is over there.

244
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,583
Ji-eum! Over here!

245
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:09,961
I'm sorry.

246
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,761
Mr. Ban Hak-su, what are you doing here?

247
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,388
What? "Ban Hak-su"?

248
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,932
How dare you address me like that?

249
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,059
You brat.

250
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,979
What kind of daughter
calls her father by his full name?

251
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:28,897
How dare you?

252
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,151
Lower your voice and talk straight.

253
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,069
You know very well

254
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,946
that your brother is living by himself.

255
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,784
You should clean his house
and cook for him.

256
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,911
His place is a complete mess!

257
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,372
How are you so selfish?

258
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,582
Just get to the point and leave.

259
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,378
His place was so tiny.

260
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,923
Get your father a room here.

261
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,844
Cut the nonsense and leave
before I kick you out.

262
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,846
What? Kick me out?

263
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,181
You brazen little…

264
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:07,727
I heard that you're dating
the hotel director!

265
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,562
Yet you can't get me a room?

266
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,231
Why you little--

267
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,367
Goodness! Look at her, everyone!

268
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,541
Let me go! I'm not leaving!

269
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,980
Are you walking down a runway?

270
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,106
You look like a model.

271
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,613
That must have been tough.

272
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,076
What do you mean?

273
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,539
Whatever happened, you did well.

274
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,626
Is something wrong, Director Mun?

275
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,463
You're being odd today.

276
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,466
So much…

277
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,136
has happened to us.

278
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,097
I'm also trying to change.

279
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,186
That's good then.

280
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,146
I'll cook you dinner tonight.

281
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,439
Let's leave work together.

282
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,357
Okay.

283
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,707
It's so nice to be out
working with you, Mr. Ha.

284
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,004
They look so lovely together.

285
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,304
Mr. Ha.

286
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,932
I've been thinking,

287
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,770
and I'm going to keep liking you
even if we don't date.

288
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,771
Ms. Yoon.

289
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,899
I just want you to know
how I feel about you.

290
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,615
I know those trees.

291
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,121
Do you know the story?

292
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,583
You see how those two trees are entwined?

293
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,002
They say if you promise love
under those trees,

294
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,255
you'll meet each other in your next life.

295
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,969
I really wanted to see them with you.

296
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,195
I wasn't trying to punch you. It's a ring.

297
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,657
I mean, it's a flower.

298
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,497
Why are you giving it to me?

299
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,791
I'm expressing my love.

300
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,923
I made it with the prettiest flower
I could find in the garden this morning.

301
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,551
This is my love for the day.

302
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,737
Come in.

303
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,912
Are you Ms. Jang Yeon-ok?

304
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:54,829
I am.

305
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,835
Flower delivery.

306
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,754
Who are they from?

307
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,881
I'm only delivering them.

308
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,522
These were my favorite flowers.
Do you remember?

309
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,322
These again?

310
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,200
I think these are the prettiest.

311
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,368
Gladiolas.

312
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,120
-Aren't they pretty?
-They are.

313
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:38,998
Yeon-ok.

314
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,336
Do you know what these flowers mean?

315
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,463
No, I don't.

316
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,876
That man you saw earlier today was my dad.

317
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,509
They say you can endure anyone

318
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:35,179
if you have at least
one good memory of that person.

319
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,725
But I have

320
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,020
no good memories of that man.

321
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,104
Where's the money?

322
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,108
-Get me money!
-I never went to bed in peace.

323
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,443
Please, just…

324
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,695
And I woke up feeling sad every morning.

325
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,865
GIRL-OF-ALL-TRADES FROM TV
STARQUEEN BAN JI-EUM

326
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,908
GIRL-OF-ALL-TRADES BAN JI-EUM
LET'S GO!

327
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,411
I tried to endure it
despite being miserable.

328
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,205
But I eventually ran away from home.

329
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,047
My aunt whom I'm living with right now

330
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,798
took me in when I had nowhere to go.

331
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,716
Open up.

332
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,844
-We're not related.
-Gosh.

333
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,972
But she always asks me if I slept well,

334
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,892
and takes care of me when I'm sick.

335
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,435
CONGRATULATIONS

336
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,187
She's more ecstatic than I am

337
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,272
when I have good news.

338
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,941
Goodness, she's all grown up now.

339
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,488
That's what you call a true family.

340
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,202
I'm just saying.

341
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,621
I just…

342
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,124
felt like telling you that.

343
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,214
Don't worry.

344
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,759
I don't have
that great of a father either.

345
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,805
Let's just

346
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,225
put our families aside.

347
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,812
I decided…

348
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,398
to only think about us two.

349
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,288
Thank you so much.

350
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,255
What is it?

351
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,590
Is it that tasty?

352
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,717
Why is it not good?

353
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,512
Why isn't it tasty when it looks so good?

354
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,850
You're awfully blatant.

355
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,812
Aren't you supposed to
pretend like it's good?

356
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,399
I'm just kidding. It's good.

357
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,748
That was delicious.

358
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,294
Go upstairs first.
I'll bring some fruit and tea.

359
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,212
Okay.

360
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,132
Then I'll wait upstairs.

361
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,133
Okay.

362
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,393
The general and his pony.

00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,789
Let's just

367
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,125
put our families aside.

368
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,754
I decided

369
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,341
to only think about us two.

370
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,081
That was random.

371
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,165
Let me stay like this…

372
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,335
just for a while.

373
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,118
Where's Father?

374
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,412
He's here with me.

375
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,123
He's driving me crazy.

376
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,916
Make sure he stays there.

377
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,506
Wait outside for a minute.

378
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,190
What the…

379
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,609
Sit up.

380
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,486
You impudent little…

381
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,196
Shut it.

382
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,825
And sit up.

383
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,000
Mr. Ban Hak-su.

384
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,087
Have you ever committed murder?

385
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,050
I asked if you have ever killed anyone.

386
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,594
Answer me.

387
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,391
The dump truck accident on April 23, 1998.

388
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,436
Does it ring a bell?

389
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,569
Tell me everything.

390
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,615
And don't even bother
coming up with excuses.

CONFIRMATION OF DEBT REPAYMENT

392
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,850
WORK REQUEST FORM

393
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:18,934
So all I need to do

394
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,439
is be on standby and then hit the car?

395
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,316
What's with all the questions?
You don't want it?

396
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,943
-Should I ask someone else?
-No, sir.

397
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,614
I just can't believe
that you're letting go of all my debt

398
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,907
for such a simple task.

399
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:35,618
Goodness.

400
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,828
That was just

401
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,790
a side job I took to support the family.

402
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:42,708
"A side job"?

403
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,962
A side job killing someone?

404
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,548
I don't know what you heard,

405
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,675
but I wasn't meaning to kill anyone.

406
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,928
It was a minor collision.
That's what it was.

407
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:57,306
Two people were killed,
and a young boy was severely injured!

408
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,683
It's all in the past.

409
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,562
Aren't you dating
the MI Group chairman's son?

410
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,065
You should keep this covered up
for your sake as well.

411
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,150
Bringing this up won't do you any good.

412
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,735
They were the ones

413
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,529
-who were unlucky!
-Father!

414
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,657
Let me say

415
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,952
just one thing for your own good.

416
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,704
It's best that you turn a blind eye to it.

417
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,081
Shut your mouth.

418
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,837
You're not human.

419
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,507
Ban Hak-su.

420
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,009
This is the last time

421
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,929
we'll see each other in this lifetime.

422
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,226
I hope I won't see you
in the afterlife either.

423
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,066
The brakes were malfunctioning!

424
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,362
What's wrong with this?

425
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,471
Help.

426
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,060
Help.

427
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,398
Help.

428
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:35,321
CONFIRMATION OF DEBT REPAYMENT

429
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,495
DEBT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM

430
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:02,681
Ban Ji-eum.

431
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,561
You should go.

432
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,468
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached--

433
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:11,166
APRIL 8,1998

434
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,212
I heard someone from MI Group
made the order.

435
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,423
Does anyone come to mind?

436
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,217
From within the group?

437
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,473
Yes, one person.

438
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:31,395
Someone who would've considered Seo-ha
an eyesore after I died.

439
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:36,692
Someone who could
easily take everything with him gone.

440
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,696
Ms. Jang Yeon-ok?

441
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,825
Let's check if it's her.

442
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,160
I know where she is.

443
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,214
Ma'am, your swing has improved a lot.

444
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,883
The lessons paid off.

445
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,148
You startled me.

446
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,442
What brings you here?

447
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,694
I wanted to ask you something.

448
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,363
And what could that be?

449
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,617
It's about the accident
Director Mun was in when he was young.

450
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,037
What about it?

451
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,774
I thought…

452
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,819
that you might be
behind the accident, Ms. Jang.

453
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,239
Not too long ago,

454
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,408
Chairman Mun even offered me money
to keep my mouth shut.

455
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,787
Are you sure about that?

456
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,373
Chairman Mun offered you money?

457
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:17,417
You must be happy that he has your back.

458
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,879
His son almost died,

459
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,340
yet he shut your mouth just to protect me?

460
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,975
He's unbelievable.

461
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,142
How touching.

462
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,436
Quite romantic, don't you think?

463
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,490
Cho Yeong-cheol, 7.5 million.

464
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,409
Due March 21.

465
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,331
Kim Chang-sik, five million.

466
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,542
Due March 12.

467
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,589
Oh Il-yong, nine million.

468
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,258
Due March 15.

469
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,180
Ban Hak-su, seven million.

470
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,224
Due March 25.

471
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,022
You see,

472
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:23,317
I don't do anything
that would displease the chairman.

473
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:25,944
Why?

474
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,989
Because I need to live.

475
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,039
So it wasn't you.

476
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,960
Then who could it be?

477
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,642
Who are you?

478
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,066
Are any of your debtors

479
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,318
truck drivers?

480
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,155
Why do you ask?

481
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,450
I need a driver.

482
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,413
This voice…

483
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,798
I need a driver.

484
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,009
A lowlife would be best.

485
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,390
Uncle?

486
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,568
Someone the chairman
wants to keep covered up.

487
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,824
Someone that Seo-ha
should never find out about.

488
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,791
His name is Ban Hak-su.

489
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,000
He drives a dump truck.

490
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,545
How much does he owe you?

491
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:09,923
He owes me about 14 million.
That's 7 million plus interest.

492
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,345
I'll pay you 40 million.

493
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,517
In return for letting go of his debt,

494
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,396
I need him to cause a minor collision.

495
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,580
Don't you work for Director Mun?

496
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,582
What brings you here?

497
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,101
What's going on?

498
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,061
This is getting complicated.

499
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,738
What kind of minor collision
might you be referring to?

500
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,867
Why would Uncle…

501
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,336
It can't be.

502
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,424
Why would he…

503
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,351
In return for letting go of his debt,

504
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,062
I need him to cause a minor collision.

505
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,482
In return for letting go of his debt,

506
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,276
I need him to cause a minor collision.

507
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,491
How…

508
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,456
How could he?

509
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,544
Are any of your debtors

510
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:12,963
truck drivers?

511
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,549
I'll pay you 40 million.

512
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,218
I need him to cause a minor collision.

513
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,640
Why did you do it?

514
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,017
Why would you do that to me?

515
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,062
Why?

516
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,023
Why?

517
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,700
Ju-won died while she was with Seo-ha.

518
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:48,164
-Ju-won.
-I'm not going to die.

519
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,337
My father simply passed away…

520
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,757
while working like any other day.

521
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:05,891
Seo-ha.

522
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,353
Look what happened to your handsome face.

523
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:16,938
Please go.

524
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,568
I don't want you to see me like this.

525
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,451
Back then…

526
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,496
I should've been the one to die.

527
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,666
But because of me…

528
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,590
people who were supposed to be loved…

529
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,303
died instead.

530
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,392
So…

531
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,442
I'm not allowed to be happy.

532
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,748
Director Mun, it's all right.

533
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,214
But I'm overwhelmed
by the thought of those

534
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,633
who were hurt by the accident.

535
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,915
Seo-ha.

536
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:05,046
Would this help alleviate your guilt?

537
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,142
I have something to tell you.

538
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,371
This piece was composed
during the Japanese occupation period.

539
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:23,625
It's about someone yearning
for their loved one.

540
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,753
But no one knows
the identity of the composer.

541
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:30,965
Then how do you know this piece?

542
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:46,272
How do you know that piece?

543
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,778
Because I'm the one…

544
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,781
who composed it.

545
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,575
Because I'm the one who composed it.

546
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,248
Play it when you miss someone.

547
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,959
Play it when you miss someone.

548
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,169
-You'll feel much better.
-You'll feel much better.

549
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,047
Ju-won said that, right?

550
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,843
How do you know that?

551
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,517
Because I was Yoon Ju-won.

552
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,443
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

553
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:16,779
I revealed to Seo-ha that I was Ju-won.

554
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,364
Past lives?

555
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,491
What are you talking about?

556
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:24,912
You and I see eye to eye on these matters.

557
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,415
I have something I want to say to Seo-ha.

558
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:30,376
Not as Ban Ji-eum, but as Yoon Ju-won.

559
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:34,005
You have to let those relationships go.

560
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,050
Hey you! Let go of him!

561
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,176
Stop.

562
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:41,346
Would that person
who remembers their 18 lives

563
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,723
be able to enjoy life
together with the kid?

564
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:49,479
