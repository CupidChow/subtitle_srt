1
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,970
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

2
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,814
Normally, I start to
remember my past lives

3
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,858
between the ages of 8 and 12.

4
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,242
The memories flood me like waves.

5
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,039
I remember everything

6
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:22,999
from who I was

7
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,667
to what I did.

8
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,802
My good lives fill me with longing

9
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,304
while my bad lives bring me pain.

10
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,140
I wish they were just dreams.

11
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,601
But they're real.

12
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,321
Yes, I remember my past lives.

13
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,743
Let me tell you my story.

14
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,501
Mommy!

15
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,628
-Just keep living your life.
-Mommy!

16
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,678
I knew I was different at the age of nine.

17
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,597
That's when I recalled everything.

18
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:25,019
Even the precious memories
we shared together.

19
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,606
Don't worry.

20
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,234
I'll stay by his side.

21
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,702
Ju-won?

22
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,453
Seo-ha.

23
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,788
Seo-ha…

24
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,040
When my memories returned,
my first thought was…

25
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,294
Is he alive?

26
00:02:53,882 --> 00:03:00,013
HAPPINESS, SADNESS, PITY, AND JOY

27
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,848
Hey!

28
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,100
Give me money.

29
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,477
-What do you mean, money?!
-Screw you!

30
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,980
-I'm so sick and tired of you!
-I said, give me money.

31
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,023
Hey.

32
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,651
Where's the money?

33
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,737
Stop, for goodness' sake!

34
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,867
You stop right…

35
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,294
MY 19TH LIFE

36
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,547
This life isn't going to be easy.

37
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,146
Give her a round of applause!

38
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,692
Ji-eum, what did all of that mean?

39
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,154
I said, "Hello, I'm Ban Ji-eum,
the Girl-of-all-trades from Siheung."

40
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,906
What language was that?

41
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,908
-Spanish.
-Spanish, everyone!

42
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:59,007
"The islands Ulleungdo and Dokdo
are not related to Japan."

43
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,843
It was around 1870.

44
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,014
During Japan's Meiji era,

45
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,725
the Great Council of State declared
that Dokdo is not Japanese territory

46
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,226
in this important document.

47
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,854
Give her a round of applause.

48
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,857
The future of Korea
has never been brighter!

49
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,192
Great job, everybody.

50
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,819
-Are you Ji-eum's father?
-Yes.

51
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,529
This is her appearance fee.

52
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,365
Thank you.

53
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,413
Great job, Ji-eum.

54
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,505

58
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,578
You blew it!

59
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,206
What are you doing?

60
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,707
What do you think you're doing?

61
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,167
-Go away.
-Hey!

62
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,878
Why are you searching through my stuff?

63
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,880
-Come on.
-Hey.

64
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,423
Look who's rich.

65
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,634
Let go!

66
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,432
It's okay.

67
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,685
I've even been born during a war.

68
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,604
This is nothing.

69
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,926
Where am I going?

70
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,388
I'm looking for the person
who will help me meet Seo-ha sooner.

71
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,474
I really want to know if Seo-ha is alive.

72
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:19,021
This is the only thing I can do right now.

73
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:28,656
AE-GYEONG'S SNACK BAR

00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,659
A BEAUTIFUL ACCORDION PERFORMANCE
BY THE GIRL-OF-ALL-TRADES

DONGBAEK AERIAL GRAND CIRCUS

76
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,552
That little girl can do everything.

77
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,558
Oh, boy.

78
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,643
She's certainly going to make it in life.

79
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,729
How does she know that song?

80
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,814
Amazing.

81
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,776
My goodness!

82
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,986
That hurt.

83
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,030
That really hurt.

84
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,702
WEBTOON ORIGINAL SERIES
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE CREATED BY LEE HEY

85
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,078
Do you want a donut?

86
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,004
What's this?

87
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,220
Ae-gyeong, it's Uncle Jung-ho.

88
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,015
I'm in a tight spot,
so please lend some money to this girl.

89
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,559
Lend me money.

90
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,603
I'll pay you back many times more.

91
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,021
Little girl.

92
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,689
Who are you?

93
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,775
What a performance.

94
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,901
You are amazing.

95
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,570
That's me.
The Girl-of-all-trades, Ban Ji-eum.

96
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:53,407
How do you know this song
by Choi Beck-ho from 1995?

97
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,076
It's a song I sang often.

98
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,371
You're right!
I thought you looked familiar.

99
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,331
What a surprise seeing you here!

100
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,041
My goodness.

101
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,960
But why do you look so messy?

102
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,170
And where did you get this note?

103
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,091
Uncle Jung-ho's been dead for years.

104
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:14,178
A round of applause to the nine-year-old,
the Girl-of-all-trades, Ban Ji-eum!

105
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,430
Thank you.

106
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,561
Weren't you ten years old
when that picture was taken?

107
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,022
You used to follow your uncle around
performing plate-spinning tricks.

108
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,484
The tall, handsome acrobat next to you…

109
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,152
That's Kim Jung-ho.

110
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,405
Your uncle.

111
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,740
How do you know that?

112
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,203
You know, your uncle…

113
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,332
I'm the reincarnation

114
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,418
of your uncle.

115
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,546
What did you say?

116
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,885
MY 17TH LIFE

117
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,178
DONGBAEK CIRCUS TROUPE

118
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,270
Uncle!

119
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,814
Are you really going to die?

120
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:10,860
Ae-gyeong.

121
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,529
Remember what I told you?

122
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,198
You're going to be born again

123
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,701
and will come to protect me.

124
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,039
That's right.

125
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,542
So don't be sad.

126
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,586
Just keep living your life.

127
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,423
Promise me.

128
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,093
I promise.

129
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,306
Do you remember our promise?

130
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,980
What's my father's name?

131
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,609
Let me think.

132
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,820
Kim…

133
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,574
Is it Jung-seok? No, Jung-hyeok!

134
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,242
That's not even close.

135
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,164
Are you perhaps
Uncle Jung-ho's secret daughter?

136
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,333
I told you I'm your uncle.

137
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,544
I raised you and took care of you.

138
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,422
Because your parents died
so early in your life,

139
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,510
I had to give up on getting married
and raised you as if you were my own.

140
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,969
That's true.

141
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,639
But what in the world is going on?

142
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,641
-It's okay.
-Goodness.

143
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,562
I understand
how this could be hard to believe.

144
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,274
So you can take your time
getting used to it.

145
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:39,115
But for now,
help out a little starving kid and…

146
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,493
lend me about 100,000 won.

147
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,206
I promise to repay you, so don't worry.

148
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,670
Where would you even spend that money?

149
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,133
I need to meet someone.

150
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,427
Who would that be?

151
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,679
Seo-ha.

152
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,013
Seo-ha?

153
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,141
Who's that?

154
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,059
He's someone

155
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,604
I really need to meet in this life.

156
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,150
MY 18TH LIFE

157
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,777
On a rainy day

158
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,533
Sitting in an old coffee shop

159
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,121
With a glass of bellflower whisky in hand

160
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:32,126
Listen to the rich saxophone playing

161
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,131
With her bright red lipstick on

162
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,133
Hey! What's your problem?

163
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,763
Shouldn't you apologize
after bumping into someone?

164
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,599
Who are you?

165
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,895
You look like a kid.
What grade are you in?

166
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:51,812
A kid?

167
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,239
Hey!

168
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,667
She's going to love it.

169
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,045
You can give it to her.

170
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,382
Sang-a.

171
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,899
Apparently, the kids at her school
call her "Ms. Yoon."

172
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,152
She acts like a teacher
when she's still a kid herself.

173
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,698
The problem with Seo-ha
is that he's too impudent.

174
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,284
I may have spoiled him too much.

175
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,916
How do you raise a child
to be like Ju-won?

176
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,418
Around two years ago,

177
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,714
it was as if she fully matured overnight.

178
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,761
At times,
she's more like an adult than I am.

179
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,222
And sometimes…

180
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,725
I wonder if she's really my daughter.

181
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,939
In any case, she suddenly changed.

182
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,316
It was my 18th life.

183
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:06,947
Just as I was getting bored
of repeating life after life,

184
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,077
I met Seo-ha.

185
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,000
Was something down there?

186
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,557
What's so funny?

187
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,816
It's been so long
since someone piqued my interest.

188
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,063
THE MOON AND THE WEST WITCH'S FOREST

189
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,195
Do you need help?

190
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,248
Get away from me. I don't need your help.

191
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,333
You're too short to reach it.

192
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,751
I'm not a kid.

193
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,838
I said, get--

194
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,258
You did that on purpose.

195
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,426
Are you crazy?

196
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,510
Well…

197
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,054
What better way
to teach a rude rich kid a lesson

198
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,264
than a book to the head?

199
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,434
Look here.

200
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,602
If I start screaming right now,

201
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,230
what do you think will happen to you?

202
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,690
Do it then.

203
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,028
If you do…

204
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,701
I'll make you disappear like this.

205
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,288
What was that?

206
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,000
-How did you do that?
-It's a secret.

207
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,212
Are you a witch?

208
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,174
If I tell you,

209
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,259
will you entertain me?

210
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,723
Do you believe in past lives?

211
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,142
-Like before I was born?
-Yes.

212
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,478
I haven't thought about it.

213
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,900
I believe in them.

214
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,697
Come closer.

215
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,994
This isn't my first go at life.

216
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,377
Were you cursed by a witch?

217
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,048
What?

218
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,466
Why are you laughing?

219
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,717
Tell me!

220
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,386
-You're adorable.
-No, I'm not!

221
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,475
Ju-won, Dad's back from work.
Let's go home.

222
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,684
I'll be right there.

223
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,646
That was the most fun I've had
in 100 years.

224
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,730
Bye.

225
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,357
You can't just leave!

226
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,293
Did you have fun with her?

227
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,170
Not really.

228
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,548
Shall I invite her back?

229
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,174
I don't care.

230
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,093
She can do whatever.

231
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,201
Green light, red light!

232
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,537
Ju-won!

233
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,872
No, don't!

234
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,957
THE MOON AND THE WEST WITCH'S FOREST

235
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,404
Could you look after

236
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,907
my dear Seo-ha?

237
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,753
She'll die.

238
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,257
She'll live.

239
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,886
She'll die.

240
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,351
She'll live.

241
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,228
Hey.

242
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,775
Why were you counting the leaves?

243
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,819
There's one remaining.

244
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,780
What's left?

245
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,074
Whether my mom…

246
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,705
What about your mom?

247
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,584
I also…

248
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:54,836
remember.

249
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,965
-Remember what?
-My past life.

250
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,425
What were you…

251
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:02,886
in your past life?

252
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,139
-A turtle.
-What?

253
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,307
You know, a turtle.

254
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,691
Seo-ha.

255
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,484
Mun Seo-ha.

256
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,071
When I was younger,
I went to Mom's hotel and…

257
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,573
That's just a memory, not your past life.

258
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,741
You're wrong!

259
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,576
My mom said she doesn't remember it.

260
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,869
But I do.

261
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,664
That's not what I meant by past lives.

262
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,874
But good effort, kid.

263
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,293
Don't call me a kid!

264
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,836
What else would I call a kid?

265
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,004
Stop it!

266
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,965
Why do you hate that word so much?

267
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:48,307
My mom has to take care of me
even when she's sick

268
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,808
because I'm a kid.

269
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,319
Seo-ha.

270
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,656
When you feel like counting leaves again,

271
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,951
just call me.

272
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,621
I'll come right over and give you a hug.

273
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,749
Why?

274
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,668
I just want to stay by your side.

275
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,590
Do you…

276
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:23,967
like me?

277
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,515
I'll answer that on your birthday.

278
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,022
Oh, come on!

279
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:44,362
When I was with Seo-ha,
I felt like I was actually 12.

280
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:48,075
He made me forget
that I had died and lived again

281
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,077
seventeen times in the past.

282
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,048
I said I would stay by his side.

283
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,675
But I couldn't keep my promise.

284
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,052
Why couldn't you?

285
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,764
I was reborn.

286
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,894
I left him too suddenly.

287
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,982
I want to find him and see if he's alive.

288
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,027
But I was born into a lousy family,

289
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,904
so I don't even have the money
to get to him.

290
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,159
I tried to save up so I could look decent.

291
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,372
But my family is onto me like leeches.

292
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,999
I had no choice but to come here.

293
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,045
Ae-gyeong, I know you have a good heart.

294
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,215
So I hoped you would take me in.

295
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,721
As you saw on television,

296
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,598
my talents are endless.

297
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,058
Just put up with me for a bit,

298
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,811
and I'll earn my keep, all right?

299
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,023
And can I just say

300
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,609
that your restaurant is hopeless?

301
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,404
Don't have too many things on the menu.

302
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,698
How about you use this kimchi

303
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,826
and try serving braised kimchi?

304
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,747
What a smart little kid.

305
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,332
All right.

306
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,377
I'll give you the money.

307
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,297
Take this.

308
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,176
Make sure to find that Seo-ha kid, okay?

309
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,428
Thank you for this.

310
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,096
I'll pay you back ten times over.

311
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,639
All right then.

312
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,355
Ae-gyeong.

313
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,443
It must have been hard growing up alone.

314
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,988
I'll take care of you now.

315
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,622
AE-GYEONG'S SNACK BAR

316
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:27,025
ME, AE-GYEONG, SEO-HA

317
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,340
Oh, right.

318
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,859
Wait.

319
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,744
Taxi!

320
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:21,871
Taxi!

321
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,728
Thank you.

322
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,687
You're welcome.

323
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,152
Here you go.

324
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:35,779
Happy birthday.

325
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,530
Thanks.

326
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,827
How do I open this?

327
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,371
I hid the key.

328
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,373
At the amusement park?

329
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,166
I didn't put in that much work.

330
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:53,129
I'll tell you where it is
if you're a good boy today.

331
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,923
You always do this.

332
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,302
Just give me a hint.

333
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,596
Should I?

334
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,766
All right, here's hint number one.

335
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,060
It's my favorite place.

336
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,854
Your favorite place?

337
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:10,772
Number two.

338
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,315
It's a fragrant place.

339
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:14,943
Is it your room?

340
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,695
Wrong. Now, hint number three.

341
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,515
Whenever one life ended,

342
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,059
I would say the same prayer.

343
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,897
Seo-ha.

344
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,357
Ju-won.

345
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,652
I would pray that this life
would be my last.

346
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,114
Or that my memories would never return.

347
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,534
Ju-won.

348
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,538
But I said a different prayer that time.

349
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,534
Ju-won.

350
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,002
Ju-won.

351
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,932
Ju-won.

352
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,600
Do you remember what I told you?

353
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:59,232
When a person dies, they're born again.

354
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,494
Seo-ha.

355
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,478
Then…

356
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,064
will I get to see my mom again?

357
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,403
No one knows who your mom

358
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,488
will be reincarnated into,

359
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,657
not even your mom.

360
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,867
Then…

361
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,413
there's no point even if she's reborn.

362
00:31:56,164 --> 00:32:00,001
But you'll know your mom
will be free from her hospital bed

363
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,086
and live a healthy life.

364
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,551
That's good.

365
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,805
I'm glad to hear…

366
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,350
she won't be sick anymore.

367
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,035
I'll stay by your side.

368
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,037
You're alive.

369
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,045
Seo-ha.

370
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,132
Thank you for being alive.

371
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,791
What is that woman doing here?!

372
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,293
Mind your manners.

373
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,421
If she ever comes back here--

374
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,010
It's none of your business. Get out.

375
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,156
The plan was just to see if he was alive.

376
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,118
But once I saw him, I couldn't get enough.

377
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,378
The grumpy little kid grew up so fast.

378
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,016
Uncle, open up.

379
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,149
If I told you I was Ju-won,

380
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,401
you wouldn't believe me, right?

381
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,738
If only you would believe me
like Ae-gyeong did.

382
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,990
That would be great.

383
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,082
Uncle.

384
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,253
I guess studying so hard

385
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,880
has made me thirsty.

386
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,548
What? My goodness.

387
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,632
What are you doing?

388
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,842
Oh, my goodness!

389
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,343
Oh, my.

390
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,138
Look at you go.

391
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,191
When you were upset, I was upset.

392
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,652
I wanted to ask you what was wrong.

393
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,117
Then one day,

394
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,162
you suddenly disappeared.

395
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,601
Eight years passed just like that.

396
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,230
YEAR 2015

397
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:21,155
HIGH SCHOOL QUALIFICATION EXAM

398
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,331
Time's up.
Put your hands on your head, please.

399
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,835
Our kid is going to KAIST!

400
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,087
Congratulations.

401
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,506
GIRL-OF-ALL-TRADES, BAN JI-EUM
EARLY-ADMITTANCE TO KAIST

402
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,302
It took Ae-gyeong a lot of effort
to accept me as her uncle.

403
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,221
But thanks to her,

404
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,056
I endured those tough times.

405
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,099
Soda is on the house!

MUN SEO-HA APPOINTED TO GERMAN BRANCH

409
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,777
I finally found

410
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,280
a way to get to you, Seo-ha.

411
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:05,825
Germany?

00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,869
MI MOBITY 2020 RECRUITMENT FINAL INTERVIEW

413
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,579
YEAR 2020

414
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:15,584
I will do my best
to advance MI Mobity's technology.

415
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,545
Thank you.

416
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,755
Hello, you leave quite the impression.

417
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,132
Excuse me.

418
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,885
-Yes?
-I feel a special energy coming from you.

419
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:29,932
Sadly, I can also sense
misfortune in your life.

420
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:34,478
Your current life
may be shorter than your past life.

421
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,316
If there's a certain someone
weighing on your mind,

422
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:43,029
then showing your ancestors
sincerity and effort will…

423
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,323
-You're mistaken.
-Excuse me?

424
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,366
I died when I was 12 in my past life.

425
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,870
And this happens to be my 19th life.

426
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,832
You were right about one thing.

427
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:58,753
There is someone weighing on my mind.

428
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,131
You got that right.

429
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,178
What a strange person.

430
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,348
Hello, you have a great aura.

431
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,061
I managed to join MI Group,
where Seo-ha works…

432
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,024
Daehwan Motors
is desperate to headhunt her.

433
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:23,694
Daehwan Motors?
Why is she staying here then?

434
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,780
-Exactly.
-But isn't that pretty cool?

435
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:31,410
…but he seems to have
no intention of coming back to Korea.

MUN SEO-HA

438
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,892
It's nearly impossible to meet him.

439
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,021
Should I just go to Germany?

440
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,314
Germany again?

441
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,400
Is this about your first love?

442
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:03,984
Yeah.

443
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,945
You said you last saw him
when you were nine.

444
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,865
Why look for him when you don't even know
how he turned out?

445
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,784
Oh, boy.

446
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,873
You're right.

447
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,376
I don't understand why you're so obsessed.

448
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,294
What's the reason?

449
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,881
There are moments
that are indescribable with words.

450
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,927
They're all still in here though.

451
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,972
You were such a mature kid.

452
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,807
Go meet him then.

453
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,684
He probably won't even remember you.

454
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,631
Does Seo-ha even remember me?

455
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,844
Should I just go to Germany?

456
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,009
Swimming again today?

457
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,677
It's still pretty cold outside.

458
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,680
Yes, careful not to catch a cold.
Thank you.

459
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:09,276
The German branch mainly hires
from the local talent pool.

460
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,862
Besides, only executive-level staff
get sent over.

461
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,783
Should I become an executive then?

462
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,827
But that would take too long.

463
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,704
What?

464
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,997
I can still apply to go, right?

465
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,541
Sure, you can.

466
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,335
Ms. Ban.

467
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,128
Have I upset you in any way?

468
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,422
You can tell me anything.

469
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,007
There's nothing of the sort.

470
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,300
I'll be leaving now.

471
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,262
Ms. Ban.

472
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,514
Ms. Ban.

473
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,976
She really has you on a string.

474
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:48,482
For some reason, I can't treat her
the same way I treat others.

475
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,652
Was she a king in her past life
or something?

476
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,431
The yaw rate is spiking
according to the data.

477
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,057
How's the steering?

478
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,184
It's a little stiff.

479
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,562
But the clutch, torque converter,
and transmission are stable.

480
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,107
The steering is stiff.

481
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,403
The data doesn't look good.

482
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,906
You said it's hard to steer.

483
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,658
I'll do one more lap.

484
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,993
You should stop.

485
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:43,871
Hey!

486
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,684
Hello, Ms. Ban.

487
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,645
It's Lee Ji-seok of Daehwan Group.

488
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,022
Have you changed your mind?

489
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:13,525
I have no intention
of working for Daehwan.

490
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,903
We're showing a lot of effort, you know.

491
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,155
Were you not swayed at all?

492
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,783
Your company must have a lot of free time.

493
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,829
Finding and recruiting talent
is the most important job.

494
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,333
I'm quite selective in whom I approach.

495
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,628
And I'm quite selective
in whom I work for.

496
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,674
Objectively speaking,
Daehwan has a lot more to offer than MI.

497
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,259
Well, that's true.

498
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,971
-You're right.
-Then let's shake hands on it.

499
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,809
Unfortunately, he isn't there.

500
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:47,726
Who isn't?

501
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,938
The person I want to meet.

502
00:44:58,904 --> 00:44:59,738
Hello?

503
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,740
Which Seo-ha?

504
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,077
You mean Mun Seo-ha of MI Group?

505
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,663
He went to the hotel?

506
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,249
Why would the chairman's son
go to the hotel?

507
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,917
He didn't go to HQ or Mobity?

508
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,287
What were you in your past life?

509
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,498
A turtle.

510
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:27,761
It's Seo-ha.

511
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,102
We finally meet again.

512
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:45,988
Seo…

513
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,246
CHINESE RESTAURANT LUSHUI
NOTICE OF CLOSURE

514
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,882
Seo-ha, you must have been
a turtle in your past life.

515
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,405
Was something down there?

516
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,907
Is something down there?

517
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,223
This place is
for authorized personnel only.

518
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,603
I see.

519
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,064
All right.

520
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,642
Are you serious?
Just come up with some excuse.

521
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,769
Tell them we're out of ingredients
or something.

522
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,272
You can't cater
to each guest individually.

523
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,690
You're really pissing me off.

524
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,525
Go!

525
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:39,786
CEO OF MI HOTEL, LEE SANG-A
(1990-1997)

526
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:49,796
Out.

527
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,399
Welcome, sir.

528
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,286
I don't care about what you've been up to.

529
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,830
And no one else needs to know either.

530
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,333
I'm assigning you
to the Strategic Planning Team.

531
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,627
Assess our stockholders within this week,

532
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,338
and get the earnings report from
the local subsidiary of the Trade Team.

533
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:37,135
If you don't want people
to know you're hard of hearing,

534
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,347
get in the habit of replying right away.

535
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,273
Are you

536
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,318
not listening on purpose?

537
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,208
From the back office to the front office,

538
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,919
to the food business department,
sales, and marketing…

539
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:15,215
I noticed a difference in approach
depending on the brand concept.

540
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,259
What are you talking about?

541
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,302
I'm going to…

542
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,722
restore Mother's hotel.

543
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,978
Get the hell out, you punk!

544
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,949
-Be careful, everyone.
-Careful.

545
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,996
-Leave it there.
-Okay.

546
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:46,997
Just a bit more.

547
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,999
How many times are we going to move this?

548
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,542
Okay, right here.

549
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,461
-That's good.
-My shoulder.

550
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,297
You want a massage?

551
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,173
Don't be gross.

552
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:00,719
Here.

553
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,473
How's the Strategic Planning Team
coming along?

554
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,436
The office will be set up within the week.

555
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,062
In terms of operations,

556
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:15,025
we have MI Hotel's financial reports,
analysis of rival hotels,

557
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,776
and job applications.

558
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,944
Let's see the applications.

559
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:20,780
Here you go.

560
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:29,789
"Ban Ji-eum"?

561
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,417
Graduate of a school for gifted children

562
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,127
with an engineering doctorate from KAIST?

563
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,050
She's a senior researcher at MI Mobity.

564
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,469
She has a senior position at only 24?

565
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,764
Are you sure she applied for our hotel?

566
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:47,682
Beats me.

567
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:52,312
She speaks English, Chinese, Japanese,

568
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,647
and Arabic?

569
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,651
She was the Girl-of-all-trades
on Starqueen,

570
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,737
and her hobby is flamenco dancing?

571
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,655
What's that?

572
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,368
COVER LETTER

573
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,912
I was most taken aback
by the artificial flowers in the lobby.

574
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,748
I believe that a hotel business

575
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:14,668
is ultimately about making people happy.

576
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,921
A lobby that makes your heart race

577
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,424
and guest rooms that excite you…

578
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,512
A hotel just like you, Seo-ha.

579
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,855
And guest rooms that give you comfort.
I envision such a hotel.

580
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,317
What a strange person.

581
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,861
Better to weed someone like her out.

582
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,321
You're right, but…

583
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,658
with a résumé like this,
she should at least get an interview.

584
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,079
My impression of her…

585
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,331
RÉSUMÉ

586
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,916
I guess it wouldn't hurt to meet her.

587
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,649
Ms. Ban Ji-eum?

588
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,775
Yes.

589
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,862
Is this the Strategic Planning Office?

590
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,573
Yes. Director Mun is waiting for you.

591
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,241
Right this way.

592
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,328
STRATEGIC PLANNING OFFICE

593
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,253
This way, please.

594
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,489
Director Mun.

595
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:13,578
Director Mun?

596
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,137
Seo-ha.

597
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,778
Nice to meet you. I'm Mun Seo-ha.

598
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:48,947
I'm Ban Ji-eum.

599
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,281
Have a seat.

600
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,628
I see you're employed at MI Mobity.

601
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:04,546
I am.

602
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,965
So why did you apply to the hotel?

603
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:11,344
I want to help you
return this hotel to its former glory.

604
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:16,099
I'm assuming you want that as well?

605
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,602
By former glory, you mean…

606
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,648
The end of the 20th century.

607
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,359
So around 1997.

608
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,904
Isn't that before you were born?

609
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,157
You're right.

610
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,785
A distant relative
once showed me some pictures

611
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,538
and they left
quite a deep impression on me.

612
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,709
I see.

613
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,587
LANGUAGES:
ENGLISH, CHINESE, JAPANESE, ARABIC…

614
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,921
How do you speak Arabic?

615
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,840
That's because…

616
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,509
A while ago…

617
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,180
It was around the tenth century.

618
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,598
MY 4TH LIFE

619
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,766
The arrack I distilled then

620
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,477
spread to the Middle East,
Mongolia, and Goryeo

621
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,437
and later became modern-day soju.

622
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,399
I had once worked over there

623
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,776
and found the language
interesting and fun.

624
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,904
She started working three years ago.

625
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,906
So when did she have time to go there?

626
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:19,245
I understand why you're applying,

627
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,456
but the work may be different
from what you're looking for.

628
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,964
If you're still unsure,
why don't you try dating me?

629
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,309
I'm sorry.

630
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,603
I must have heard you wrong.

631
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,396
No, you haven't.

632
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,107
I'll repeat myself.

633
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,947
Would you like to date me?

634
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:25,353
SEE YOU IN MY 19TH LIFE

635
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,981
Why don't you just tell him honestly

636
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,190
that you were Ju-won?

637
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,192
-Director Mun.
-Hey, cutie.

638
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,986
-Let go.
-My goal is to straighten out

639
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,238
the disgraceful practices
that have been overlooked.

640
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,824
Director Mun, you didn't mention my task.

641
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,910
Are young people these days all so brash?

642
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,538
"Pursue rather than wait."

643
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,707
I told you he was perfect.

644
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,459
It seems to me
that you have ulterior motives.

645
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,253
Run!

646
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,922
Marry me.

647
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:58,803
