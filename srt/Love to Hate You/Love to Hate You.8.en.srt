2
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,901
Why am I playing along
in this game?

3
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,030
Nam Kang-ho means nothing to me.

4
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,072
Se-na.

5
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,244
Could I…

6
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,082
Could I perhaps sleep
in your room tonight?

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,085
-They ran out of rooms here.
-What are you saying?

8
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,299
Think about it. You brought
your girlfriend on board as a stunt double

9
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,301
but also want her
to sleep in your room with you?

10
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,596
Uh, I'd be happy to share.

11
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,057
You can use my makeup remover
and lotion if you'd like.

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,892
-That'd be great.
-Hey.

13
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,438
What?

14
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,735
It's because I'm worried.

15
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,655
Stay in my suite.

16
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,200
Oh…

17
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,372
Just sleep in my room.
This way you won't be bothering Ms. Oh.

18
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:22,999
-Uh…
-No, really.

19
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,169
Well, as long as it's all right with you,
I really don't mind at all.

20
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,172
Oh…

21
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,176
Thank you so much for your assistance.

22
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,220
Thank you for looking out
for my girlfriend.

23
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,640
Shall we?

24
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,642
Oh…

25
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,769
Thank you anyway.

26
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,817
Why was he… so rude?

27
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,659
Did Se-na…

28
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,745
Did Se-na say anything to you?

29
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,331
-About…
-Like how we used to date before?

30
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,917
Whoa, you did?

31
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,128
Wow, that's wild.

32
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,171
Hm.

33
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,551
We met at the theater company
I joined right after college.

34
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,762
We were each other's first love,
but it ended badly.

35
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:22,016
It was a very long time ago,
and we honestly haven't talked at all.

36
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,977
Now I have zero feelings for her.

37
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,231
-Is there anything you'd like to know?
-Oh, no.

38
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,024
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

39
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,694
Okay, then. That's all.

40
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,196
Don't just stand there.

41
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,407
Lie down here and get some rest.

42
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,578
-You want me to sleep over there?
-Of course.

43
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,537
Oh, it's okay.

44
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,582
I'll sleep here, so you can sleep
comfortably on the bed, Mr. Nam.

45
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,083
You have a lot to shoot tomorrow.

46
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,095
Ah, this is so good.

47
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,064
Is it?

48
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,860
Because I'm not comfortable with sleeping
on the bed and you sleeping here.

49
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,196
Do you think this is
why I asked you to sleep in my room?

50
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,449
I mean, what kind of asshole
would I be if I slept on the bed

51
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,825
and left the couch for you?

52
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,745
Ah, you're unexpectedly chivalrous.

53
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,205
Look here, Ms. Yeo.

54
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,209
You're my guest. You're injured
with 14 stitches in your back.

55
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,544
So stop insisting
on sleeping on the couch.

56
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,962
It just makes me feel bad!

57
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,466
Oh, gosh. Okay, okay, I'll go.

58
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,912
It is more comfortable
on the bed after all.

59
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:06,829
Thank you.

60
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,295
Now what?

61
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,297
What are you worried about now?

62
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,465
I didn't shower?

63
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,549
Is that getting to you?

64
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,176
Come on.

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,428
I won't die from
not showering for one night.

66
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,556
Don't worry about me. Good night.

67
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,100
But I am worried.

68
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,476
Damn it.

69
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,645
I should've just slept at Oh Se-na's.

70
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:34,607
I still can't wrap my head around this.
I've never met a woman like you ever.

71
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,067
"A woman like me"?

72
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:37,986
Like what?

73
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,946
A dirty one?

74
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,323
Damn it!

75
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,326
No, that's not it. And stop moving around
and just stay still.

76
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,540
If that's not it, then what?

77
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,131
There were a lot of guys back there.

78
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,842
Why did you, a woman, have to go do that?

79
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,093
"A woman"?

80
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,596
If you knew it was dangerous,
why not tell Hyun-sang?

81
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,932
Why did you take it
upon yourself to do that?

82
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,267
"A woman"?

83
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,066
Nam Kang-ho,
if someone saves you from danger,

84
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,486
are you really going to argue
why a woman came to save you?

85
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,199
If your life's in danger and a woman comes
to your rescue, are you going to say,

86
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,661
"What's the matter with you?
You're a woman." That's how you sound.

87
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,874
I mean, why would you care if it's a man
or woman if they helped to save your life?

88
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:36,544
No, what I'm saying is…
it could've been you who died.

89
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,796
So what? If I die, I die.

90
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,550
You know what I hate?
Scenes where there's a damsel in distress,

91
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,178
and then right at the last second,
it's like, pow!

92
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,388
A man comes to the rescue.

93
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,767
Actually, I have a real problem
with the one we're doing too.

94
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,935
What's that?

95
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,647
The woman is weak and needs help,
and the man swoops in to save her.

96
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,983
Ugh, I hate that.

97
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,198
What's going on?
Why is he just watching the rushes?

98
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,870
You've worked with him twice,
and you still don't know? Really?

99
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,205
No.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,752
He's feeling inspired.

101
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,754
Ah.

102
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,966
Looks like he's gonna change some things.

103
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,849
Sure, women are physically weaker.

104
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,768
But do they lack willpower?

105
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,146
Her man is wrongfully incarcerated,
and she's forced to be the boss's woman.

106
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,942
I mean, why is she just taking it
but not plotting revenge?

107
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,861
Well, it's not my place
to offer critique to you.

108
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,698
Where are you going?

109
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,076
To wash up and brush my teeth.

110
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,052
This late at night,
just the two of us.

111
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,763
Are we going
all the way to Seoul like this?

112
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,350
And why is
the music so romantic too?

113
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:17,895
KANG-HO

114
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,772
How's it going?

115
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,234
So, she's staying in my room
because there are no spare rooms.

116
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,154
Who is? Ms. Yeo?

117
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,781
Yeah. By the way,
when I sleep, do I snore?

118
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,699
Huh?

119
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,535
Yeah. No. Well, sometimes?

120
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,828
Sometimes?

121
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,413
Is it loud?

122
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,165
As loud
as an electric toothbrush.

123
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,624
Electric toothbrush?

124
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,711
What's she doing right now? Sleeping?

125
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,046
No, she's washing up.

126
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,258
-Oh…
-Yeah?

127
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,136
So sleep on the bed with her, okay?

128
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,224
If you try to sleep
on the couch like a pathetic fool,

129
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,101
she'll feel bad
and won't be able to relax.

130
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,731
So lie next to her
and do anything to make her comfortable.

131
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,526
That's what you need to do.

132
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,995
So lie next to her.

133
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,581
That's what you need to do.

134
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,418
And do anything to make her comfortable.

135
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,759
Anyway, I'll call you when I'm done here.

136
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,722
Oh, do you wanna stop by the rest area
and get something to drink?

137
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:35,806
Yeah, why not?

138
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,141
What?

139
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,440
Oh, this is so crazy.

140
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,859
I find everything about him attractive.

141
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,821
What's wrong?

142
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,949
I'm going to use the ladies' room.

143
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,666
Oh, no. My bangs are flat.

144
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,001
Okay.

145
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,420
Do this.

146
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,215
Ah!

147
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,401
First of all, ask a lot of questions,

148
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,069
like you're interested.

149
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,780
You know, like where she went
to elementary school

150
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,198
and her middle school.

151
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,784
And then casually touch her.

152
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,954
No! Not like a creep.

153
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,208
You know, like picking lint off her
even though there isn't any.

154
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,169
And then, when the mood is right,
say stuff like,

155
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,381
"Wow, you have really slender fingers."

156
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:51,882
Try that.

157
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,427
I noticed she had long fingers.

158
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,723
And then keep looking at her hands,
like you wanna touch them.

159
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,518
You can stare at hands suggestively
without making it look weird.

160
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,104
And if she happens to fall asleep,

161
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,481
she's just pretending
and playing hard to get.

162
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,693
Don't fall for that. Just grab her hands,

163
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,655
and if it feels like the right time,
then you can start to move in.

164
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,618
I'm also gonna quickly seduce Na-eun.

165
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,745
And I'll try to provide support.

166
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,662
Uh…

167
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:28,127
Na… Na-eun. Wha… what are you doing here?

168
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,714
And what are you doing here, Mr. Do?

169
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:36,010
The reason I've been acting
in a way that would put him off

170
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,970
instead of trying to seduce him

171
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,765
is because I lost the will to fight

172
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,851
after seeing
Oh Se-na's true feelings towards him.

173
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,735
You awake?

174
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,622
Ms. Yeo?

175
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,408
Am I about to make a big mistake?

176
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,845
It's just that I've never met
a woman like you.

177
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,597
The type of women I know are

178
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,350
ones that try to improve
their lives through marriage,

179
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,438
ones that try to improve
their lives through remarriage,

180
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,608
or ones that improve their lives
and then discard the men they were with.

181
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,697
Those are the women I know.

182
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,784
Most women I know don't ever do anything

183
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,620
unless it's beneficial to them.

184
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,169
I have to go to work.
It's not like it's a holiday.

185
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:10,623
THE WAY YOU CHANGE ME

186
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,379
You are quite the mastermind then, huh?

187
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,966
You tricked me into keeping silent
about Mi-ran's contract.

188
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,678
And then tricking Mi-ran and Nam Kang-ho
into falling in love like that?

189
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,057
So you don't… approve of Kang-ho?

190
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,934
But why do you approve of Mi-ran though?

191
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,646
Of course, Mi-ran is a fabulous woman
by anyone's standards,

192
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,774
but I'm not sure she's worth
all the trouble you're going through.

193
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,318
So why don't you just step back
and leave her be?

194
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,030
It's because Ms. Yeo
is actually quite special.

195
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,160
I'm aware that she didn't have
a good first impression of Kang-ho.

196
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,579
Apparently,
he was actually pretty arrogant.

197
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,542
But that's not something personal
towards her or anything.

198
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:59,588
It's because he's so strongly suspicious
of women in general.

199
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,759
Kang-ho has been around
countless beautiful women

200
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,136
on an incredible amount of projects.

201
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,849
However, he's never had
feelings for any of them.

202
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,891
Not even a single one.

203
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,563
But somehow, I think
he's met the right person, don't you?

204
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,359
It's my goal to see Kang-ho
become a really successful actor

205
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,654
and see to it
that he's a happy man again too.

206
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,615
I feel like you did
when you were arguing with me

207
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,325
about the contract you saw,

208
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,370
and you were worried for Mi-ran.

209
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,415
And it's the same for me.

210
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,836
That's why I was hoping that
we could be on the same side.

211
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,214
I'm sorry I came across crass.

212
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,096
Na-eun.

213
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,558
Don't you want to be on the same side?

214
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,646
Kang-ho is not a man
who would break a woman's heart, ever.

215
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,399
There's only one woman
his heart belongs to.

216
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,943
There's just one.

217
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,705
Celebrities aren't all that, right?

218
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,957
As you can see, they're mortal.

219
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,837
Well, some are nicer than I thought.

220
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,756
Who, Kang-ho?

221
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,676
Kang-ho's always come across nice.
I know you don't think so.

222
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,012
No, I meant you.

223
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,807
When I just read the contract,
I really thought you were a scoundrel.

224
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,853
But now that you know me,

225
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,481
do I seem nice to you?

226
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,815
Uh…

227
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,609
When you ask so bluntly…

228
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,072
Ah, it would be a lot of fun
if we team up and work together.

229
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,283
The four of us can hang out
and spend some time together, you know?

230
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:56,038
Oh… I guess that would be
a bit difficult if you have a boyfriend.

231
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,331
I don't have a boyfriend.

232
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,170
If I had a boyfriend,

233
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,006
I wouldn't have asked you
to pick me up at the airport.

234
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,343
That's true.

235
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,429
And might you be… seeing anyone?

236
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,976
I see you.

237
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,688
Ah! Okay.

238
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,898
Hallelujah!

239
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,734
INCOMING CALL
GRACE

240
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,286
-Hey. What's up?
-I heard there was an accident.

241
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,580
Oh, I just found out today.

242
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,166
Oh, well, she's really not that hurt.

243
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,752
Yeah, you don't have to worry about it.
I'll call you later, okay?

244
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,047
That's a relief.
I'll have to inform the insurance company,

245
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,549
so let me know which hospital it is.

246
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,509
Yeah. I will call you
as soon as I know that.

247
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,929
-Where are you right now?
-Oh, I'm just driving.

248
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,015
Oh, so you're still on your way back.

249
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,809
Then why don't you call me,
or, um, you could just come over?

250
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,812
All right, then.

251
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,190
Mi-ran was right.

252
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,359
Mi-ran is always right.

253
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,155
You don't know this man.
It wouldn't hurt to be suspicious of him.

254
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,120
Uh, I know this sounds
really strange for me to tell you this.

255
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,789
I'm not with her.

256
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,958
Uh, are you…

257
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,127
I think it's stranger
that she isn't with you.

258
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,295
That's true.

259
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,634
I won't waste your time.
I'll just tell you now.

260
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,971
I won't be on the same team with you.

261
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,851
Why would I team up
with you and Nam Kang-ho?

262
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,103
Clearly, I'm on Mi-ran's team.

263
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,507
Even the back of your head is pretty.

264
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,969
I'm curious what you're thinking
inside that head of yours,

265
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,098
and I'm curious what you think of me.

266
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,065
I'm curious if what I'm doing
is okay to do.

267
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,839
The fact that I can be this close to you…

268
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,307
and that I can even hold you like this…

269
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,606
What have you done to me this time?

270
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,280
Do you wanna stay together like this?

271
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:24,955
I like you,

272
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,665
Yeo Mi-ran.

273
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,186
Oh…

274
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,606
-Uh… Oh…
-Get the door.

275
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,774
Someone's here.

276
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,948
Uh, I slept hugging you like that

277
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,327
because you kept trying
to roll over on your stitches.

278
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,871
-You understand, right?
-Okay, then.

279
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,831
I won't ask why you had to hold me

280
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,666
instead of using your back
to hold me up.

281
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,930
Initially, So-jeong was captured and lived
in misery as the boss's mistress,

282
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,890
but the director
would like to change the story

283
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,559
so that she's secretly training
during that time.

284
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,686
-What is she training for?
-Fighting skills.

285
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,231
She's planning how she's gonna get out.

286
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,066
No. That's not it.

287
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,445
She's planning out her revenge,
to kill the boss.

288
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,993
How will she train to fight?
Is she taught by someone?

289
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,828
-The gangsters do.
-Nobody taught her.

290
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,044
-She did.
-Uh…

291
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,505
So, not only is the story changing,

292
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,675
but you're changing
So-jeong's entire character?

293
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,018
Are you okay?

294
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,939
-Oh, I'm just so sorry about the--
-Oh! No, I'm good, really.

295
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,399
I heard you got stitches.

296
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,942
I'm really sorry.

297
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,278
Oh, it's not a huge deal.
It's okay, I swear.

298
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,947
Hey, be good to her.
She's the reason you're here.

299
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,074
Sis, you were so awesome!

300
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,034
You were so cool.

301
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,328
These people
are no longer seeing me

302
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,080
as just Nam Kang-ho's girlfriend.

303
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,957
I can't do that.

304
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,710
How could I possibly throw knives?

305
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,837
Don't worry about that.
Your stunt double will do it.

306
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,381
What about getting beaten up?
I have to do that, don't I?

307
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,092
That's also for your stunt double.
Even getting thrown around

308
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,135
would need to look real.

309
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,636
But she's hurt. Can she do it?

310
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,680
Of course she can't!
Her stitches will split.

311
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:50,225
The director says all of Ms. Yeo's parts
will be pushed to the end of production,

312
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,561
so she can film it
when she's fully healed.

313
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,689
The stitches come out
in ten days or so, so maybe…

314
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,193
She could do it in about two weeks, yeah?

315
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,405
She won't do it
if her role gets bigger.

316
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,073
She's a working lawyer.

317
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,660
Truth be told, she's only doing this
because I asked her to do so.

318
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,912
Oh, yeah? She seemed to be enjoying it.

319
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,914
Are you saying
you know Mi-ran better than I do?

320
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,999
Hey, man,

321
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,754
I don't know if you can see
what your girlfriend really likes.

322
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,756
Fine. I can at least ask.

323
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,467
Of course I'll do it. I wanna do it.

324
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,636
The stitches come out in two weeks,
so I should be able to do it around then.

325
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,181
The stitches
come out in ten days or so.

326
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,016
She could do it in about two weeks, yeah?

327
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,435
I knew it.
A master recognizes another master.

328
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,604
I wish this one would be
a blockbuster action movie,

329
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,730
like Mission: Impossible.

330
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,107
I guess
that doesn't fit the plot though.

331
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,861
I don't know if you can see
what your girlfriend really likes.

332
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,571
Look, say no.

333
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,698
Huh? Oh, why?

334
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,159
You're the type of person
who shouldn't do stunt work.

335
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,495
You have to be cautious
and meticulous out there,

336
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,997
but if you just dive in,
you'll end up getting hurt again.

337
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,833
-Are you trying to die?
-I don't like your tone right now.

338
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,502
It's because you make me worry!

339
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,670
Even now you're driving by yourself
without telling me.

340
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,798
I can take care of myself.

341
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:06,134
I don't wanna stay together
if you're gonna keep acting like that.

342
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,224
Do you wanna stay together like this?

343
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,228
Uh, actually, Mr. Nam,
don't worry about me.

344
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,480
Have a good day on set.

345
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,736
I think she heard it all.

346
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,279
All.

347
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,323
I like you,

348
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,366
Yeo Mi-ran.

349
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,745
I guess
I'm also capable of romance.

350
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,249
But love hormones are only effective
for around three months,

351
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,084
maybe three years if it's long.

352
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,670
Three years? No way.

353
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,591
Nam Kang-ho said he liked me.

354
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,804
You said
you would seduce and dump him.

355
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,264
Looks like you did it.

356
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,432
Nicely done.

357
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,771
This is so unlike you.

358
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,607
You'd be all excited like that.

359
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,653
Don't be so confident.
Things don't always go the way you want.

360
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,240
People who think too highly
of themselves fall the hardest.

361
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,075
Bro, you ruined it.

362
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,287
Bro.

363
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,539
So this is my fault?

364
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:23,753
Know what, dude? She already dumped you
long before Grace called me, you know?

365
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,465
She didn't dump me,
and she didn't say she disliked me.

366
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,634
But now that you screwed up with Na-eun,
they'll judge me too.

367
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,803
You know what they say,
misery hates to be alone.

368
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,430
Misery hates to be alone.

369
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:37,642
All of his feelings toward you
could be a lie, you know?

370
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,812
Seeing how
he's so good at acting.

371
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:45,817
So, are you going to kick him to the curb
during or after the contract?

372
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,861
I don't know.

373
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:52,073
You look like you're deciding if
rather than when to dump him.

374
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,869
I'm just so tired.

375
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,165
Think we could just have one drink?

376
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,626
Hey, no way!

377
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,586
You stay away from booze
until your wounds heal.

378
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,423
Also, never in my entire life
have I seen you just have one.

379
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,841
It usually turns into ten.

380
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:14,012
I wouldn't have talked about my feelings
if you hadn't told me to tell her.

381
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:18,225
Her back was in pain, and I just thought
it might be a good time to…

382
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,810
Come on, you're
the "Master of Kiss," dude.

383
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,855
Was that really the best that you got?
That's some stone-age tactics, bro.

384
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,815
Confessing your feelings
to the back of her head?

385
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,693
Woof. You did that.

386
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,029
Oh, yeah?
And you're so much better than me

387
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,323
because you flirt
with every girl that you see?

388
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,742
I knew you'd get yourself
in big trouble one of these days,

389
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,536
but instead, I'm taking the hit!

390
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,996
Grace is the only one
that I ever slept with.

391
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,167
Hey, stop taking it out on me, coward!

392
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,877
Call her, I'm serious.

393
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,421
Meet her in person,
say it for real, and call!

394
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,926
She won't answer?

395
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,512
How many times did you try?

396
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,894
-Once.
-Damn it! Are you serious?

397
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,611
What are you doing?

398
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,155
-I'm making a phone call.
-Stop. Wait. Don't do it.

399
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,407
Wait.

400
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,159
-Stop it!
-It's ringing. It's ringing. It's ringing.

401
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,202
Hello?

402
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,455
-What now? What do I say?
-Tell her you want to meet.

403
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,583
Why aren't you saying anything?

404
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,961
Oh, uh, yes. Uh, there's
something I want to tell you in person.

405
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,380
Where are you right now?

406
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,424
I'm in the middle
of something with Na-eun.

407
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,011
-Why?
-I'll ask her and then call you back.

408
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,597
What are you asking me about?

409
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,932
He's asking
if he and Mr. Do can take us out.

410
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,185
The confidence on that guy.

411
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,856
What if we meet again?
Does he think he can just change my mind?

412
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,111
So you're saying Mr. Do had Nam Kang-ho
ask me so you two could go out?

413
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,738
What else could it be though?

414
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,742
Nam Kang-ho can just meet you alone.
Why have me tag along?

415
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:02,454
He's so cool, and he thinks
he can get what he wants. Ha!

416
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:07,334
If you decide not to go with,
does that break the contract?

417
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,377
No. That's not in the contract.

418
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,712
Ah.

419
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,507
So, I guess we can ignore
your client's request.

420
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,343
And then,

421
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,637
even after this contract is over,

422
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,472
Nam Kang-ho will still be
your client, right?

423
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,182
Yeah, I believe so.

424
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,768
Ah. Oh, no.

425
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,936
Then you'll have to keep up
appearances for work then.

426
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,482
Are you confident enough
to hold it together in front of Won-jun?

427
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,609
Me?

428
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,988
Of course. I'm already so over him.

429
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,743
So… I'll come too?

430
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,661
Yeah.

431
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:46,039
When you're in front of him,
I'm sure you can compose yourself.

432
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,000
Thank you.

433
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,635
Wow! Thanks to my friend,
I'm at Nam Kang-ho's house.

434
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,096
Can I take a selfie?

435
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:06,476
You're already so excited, huh?
Will you be able to keep your cool?

436
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,061
I'm excited about the house.

437
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,313
And by the way,
this is Nam Kang-ho's house,

438
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,398
not Do Won-jun's.

439
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,869
If you don't want wine,
there's soju and beer too, so feel free.

440
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,371
Wine will be fine.

441
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:27,997
How about you?

442
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,209
She's not allowed to drink
until her stitches are out.

443
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,504
Are you still with us?

444
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,601
Are you having juice

445
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,271
because you don't want her
to be alone or something?

446
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,814
So it's just gonna be me?

447
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,025
Wow.
You must be possessed or something.

448
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:00,363
This man is nothing like his characters.
He has zero consideration for women.

449
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,615
You two are the first women
that have been in this house.

450
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,325
I mean, it's a miracle, really.

451
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,287
No way.

452
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,707
I'm telling you this so you
don't dislike Kang-ho because of me.

453
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,584
I'm a bit of a flirt, yeah.

454
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:17,255
But he never flirts
with any woman literally ever.

455
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,842
Kang-ho is different from me.

456
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,178
-What is your definition of flirting?
-Huh?

457
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,638
I think
we're all old enough to know.

458
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:29,350
Well, I don't know what he means exactly,
and I think I deserve to know.

459
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,978
You know, it's always good
to be clear about these things.

460
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,856
But you've seen me
casually date probably 100 guys.

461
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,150
-A hundred?
-Yes.

462
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,985
I'm not sure exactly how many,

463
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,404
but with casual flirts,
I'm probably close.

464
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,990
It's not 100.

465
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,785
How could she have 100 flings
and still have time to become a lawyer?

466
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,161
She's been really busy.

467
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,455
Yeah,
that's what I thought.

468
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,874
Oh, Ms. Yeo. Wow, what a bluff.

469
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,627
A hundred guys, no way.

470
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,337
No.

471
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,840
From my experience,
I'd say she'd never bluff.

472
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,386
She was supposed to be a stunt double,
but she ended up saving a person's life.

473
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,973
That night, when she drove me home,

474
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,850
I was shocked by her skills.

475
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,268
It was amazing.

476
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,855
I'd believe her 100%

477
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,025
even if she said
she could spin hay into gold.

478
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,071
You paint such a nice picture of me.

479
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,907
Thank you for believing in me that deeply.

480
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,409
So, back to flirting.

481
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,372
If the other person
thinks you're going steady,

482
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,166
but you insist it's just flirting,
is it just flirting?

483
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,878
The moment you tell
a person how you really feel…

484
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,505
I like you.

485
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,551
…from that moment,
it's no longer flirting.

486
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,473
N… Na-eun, may I give you
a tour of the house?

487
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,560
The owner of the house
should give the house tour, not you.

488
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,729
Oh, sure. I'll show you around, uh,
even though there isn't much to look at.

489
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,814
Okay.

490
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,070
What do you mean,
there's not much to look at?

491
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,364
Wow, you've thought of everything.

492
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,991
You do this yourself?

493
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,994
I do it myself.
I don't like to go out much,

494
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,912
so I spend a lot of time at home.

495
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,582
I see.

496
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,667
You have some real skill.

497
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,128
May I sit over there?

498
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,596
She's met that many guys,

499
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,514
and she's never found
one person she liked?

500
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,682
Mi-ran?

501
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,434
I don't know.

502
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,937
If you try to see the good in people,
you tend to see the good,

503
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,441
and if you focus on the bad,
then all you see is the bad, you know?

504
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:44,903
Mi-ran has a tendency
to first see men in a very bad light.

505
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,654
Why?

506
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,240
I think it's because her first crush
honestly was a real jerk.

507
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,659
 Move it!

508
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,077
Where you going, huh?

509
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,663
Oh, what's the matter?
That big old head…

510
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,584
Mi-ran used to date
a really cool guy back in high school.

511
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,502
Damn it, what the hell?

512
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,797
He was good-looking,
and he was very noble.

513
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,802
But he ended up
asking me out too.

514
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:15,266
He was cool,
so out of curiosity, I went out with him.

515
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:21,064
I wasn't really close
with Mi-ran back then, but I felt bad.

516
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:24,484
Hey. Who do you think you are,
trying to look cool right now?

517
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,069
Take your hands out of your pocket!

518
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,201
She's not even friends with me,
and she says sorry.

519
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,827
So what's up?

520
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:36,871
Yeah.

521
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,498
I'm sorry.

522
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,293
You can have him if you want.
I don't care.

523
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,422
Piss off!

524
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,802
That's when I was smitten
by how cool Mi-ran was.

525
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,679
I'm not a toy you can just hand off.

526
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,180
So I dumped him right there

527
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,474
and became friends
with Mi-ran from then on.

528
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,684
Hey. Hey!

529
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,188
A good person
is not necessarily a good guy.

530
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,316
That's what Mi-ran always says.

531
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,902
She tries dating
to see if she's wrong…

532
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,153
…but she's not.

533
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,949
Oh, it's not like she's loose or anything.

534
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,951
Please don't get the wrong idea.

535
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:19,205
Oh, no. I was just thinking about how
she was cool even when she was a teen.

536
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:20,623
Huh.

537
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,212
I regret having made this contract.

538
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,506
If I had left you two be,

539
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,009
you'd be happy

540
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,177
with Kang-ho.

541
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,889
You would've seen him
so much differently.

542
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,766
I think I messed this up.

543
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,771
I was greedy in trying to get you
and to kill the rumor at the same time,

544
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,148
and it backfired on me.

545
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,649
Why do you think

546
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,693
I'm the one for him?

547
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,903
That's more perplexing to me.

548
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,156
You didn't like me at first,
and then suddenly…

549
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,240
Yeah, I know.

550
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,164
Honestly, it was seeing
how much he cares about you.

551
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,667
So I really had no choice.

552
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,796
I'm telling you,
this is not how it typically goes.

553
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,676
Um, does Mr. Nam Kang-ho…

554
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,430
take some kind of medication?

555
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,807
What?

556
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,894
I wasn't meant to hear it, but I did.

557
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,353
Uh…

558
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,359
Nam Kang-ho seems
different from Do Won-Jun.

559
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,488
He really seems to like you.

560
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,367
Mr. Do isn't that bad of a person either.

561
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,789
Don't see him in a bad light
just because he's handsome.

562
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,798
It's a form of anxiety disorder.

563
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,511
Like, in extremely stressful situations,
he has trouble breathing.

564
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:02,725
Those situations are
when he has to make physical contact

565
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,976
with a woman.

566
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,898
So whenever
he had to film a scene

567
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,109
where he had to be close to a woman,

568
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,944
he'd take some medicine

569
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,363
so he wouldn't have panic attacks.

570
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,740
The fact that I can be this close to you

571
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,576
and that I can even hold you like this…

572
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,792
What have you done to me this time?

573
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,559
Action!

574
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,578
Ms. Yeo!

575
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,165
Wow, that's amazing!

576
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,958
You know, back in the day,
I used a compass.

577
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,293
A compass?

578
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,588
Do you wanna see it?
Does anyone have an ice pick or something?

579
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,756
Maybe someone has a Swiss Army knife.

580
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,176
Someone give me a Swiss Army knife.

581
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,969
-Give it to her.
-No, I'm serious!

582
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,596
-That's so cool.
-Oh.

583
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,639
I brought some cookies for you guys.

584
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,601
I baked them myself at home,
so please enjoy.

585
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,978
-Thank you.
-Here, enjoy.

586
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,730
Thank you, Oh Se-na.

587
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,065
That knife throw earlier
looked really good.

588
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,650
Ah, thank you so much.

589
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,248
He must have looked like that

590
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,500
after I left.

591
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,467
Se-na.

592
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,765
So you want me to do my own stunts?

593
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,682
Yes.

594
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:11,395
I don't know. I wouldn't be very good.
And there'd be no time to practice.

595
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,813
Instead of the cool action scenes,

596
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,191
how about the scenes
where they're beating you to death?

597
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,859
What?

598
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,862
To kill the boss, So-jeong
had to train herself to be a fighter.

599
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,032
She's probably well-trained
in kicking, punching, and stabbing,

600
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,034
but she's never truly been hit before.

601
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,579
So I don't think you'd have
to try too hard to make that look good.

602
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,915
I haven't done
as much research on the script as you.

603
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:34,460
And if you do scenes like that yourself,

604
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:38,547
I think everyone here would be
incredibly impressed with that.

605
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,634
And Kang-ho would be too.

606
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,345
Cut!
All right, that was good. Moving on.

607
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,098
You really don't feel
threatened by me, do you?

608
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,057
Honey.

609
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,568
Even if I did it to the back of your head
while you were sleeping,

610
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,028
I was still honest with how I felt.

611
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,823
If you're going to turn me down,
do it to my face.

612
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,449
Why would you help out Se-na?

613
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,786
I know that Se-na is trying
to get back together with me.

614
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:12,665
But I don't want that,
at all, no way, no how!

615
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,835
Then you'd be fine
even if I helped her out a little.

616
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,128
What's the problem?

617
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,884
Is that really what
you feel about me? Nothing?

618
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,222
No. I don't feel nothing.

619
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,726
Even with it being a contract,
I'm dating a star.

620
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,061
And that's a really big deal.

621
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,605
You couldn't understand.

622
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:41,319
I'm cool on my own,
but I have to be treated like Cinderella

623
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,946
because I'm dating a superstar.
I really don't like that.

624
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,783
Regardless of how I feel,
I'll stay professional,

625
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,201
so don't worry about that.

626
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:54,123
Right, you did nothing wrong here,
and I'm sorry. It's just a complex I have.

627
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,587
But I don't know how to get over that.
Unfortunately, that's just how I feel.

628
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,673
If we could help how we feel,
life would be much better.

629
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,426
But life is hard 'cause we can't.

630
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,811
I thought this was just a job to you.

631
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,274
Our arrangement is also a job.
It doesn't mean anything.

632
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,401
Why do you feel like this?

633
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,946
You've done worse, like driving me home.

634
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,242
Are you sure this is just a job to you?

635
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,078
No feelings for me?

636
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,503
Okay. There were a few times
when I felt something.

637
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,755
You put in so much effort,
so how could I not?

638
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,010
But instead of that something,
that crappy feeling is what stuck around.

639
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,596
If I become an ordinary nobody,

640
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,057
then we have a chance here, right?

641
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,768
Is this one of your movies, huh?

642
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,853
Even as a movie, it's a bit far-fetched.

643
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,272
I mean, you're Nam Kang-ho.

644
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,275
How could you become
an ordinary nobody?

645
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,488
And it does feel good to know
that Nam Kang-ho likes me this way.

646
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,325
So let me have that, please.
Can you do that?

647
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,121
And then we can still be friends.

648
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,544
A class warfare seems easier.

649
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,879
At least we know
we're being exploited by the enemy.

650
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,424
But if the enemy is your own family…

651
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,468
Through Eun-hee's life,
we see how unfair family bliss is

652
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,470
in a patriarchal society.

653
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,849
We have to go now.

654
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,269
The things you put
in this book are not true!

655
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,771
They're insults!
I'm going to file a lawsuit.

656
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,064
Sure, yeah!

657
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:46,735
You better get yourself a good lawyer,
because our daughter really knows the law.

658
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,530
KIM EUN-HEE PUBLICATION SIGNING EVENT
CHEW IT TO TASTE IT

659
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,037
-I'm a bit pretty in person, aren't I?
-Yes!

660
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,082
I was blown away
to see how beautiful you are.

661
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,086
Honestly, I was blown away even more.

662
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,922
I thought you were her sister.
You're really her mother?

663
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,674
You are stunningly beautiful.

664
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,843
What?

665
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,554
Oh! Oh my goodness.

666
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,766
Well, people usually say
that I look like my husband's mistress

667
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,895
or… or her stepmother,
so that means a lot.

668
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,397
-Stop it.
-They really do though.

669
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,861
Well, then, let's all say congratulations
to the writer of the hour, Kim Eun-hee,

670
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,279
and her new book.

671
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,531
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations, Mom!

672
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,450
Oh, thank you so much.

673
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,077
I mean, to be sitting with Choi Soo-jin,

674
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,412
I don't know if I'm dreaming.

675
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,750
-Does it hurt?
-Yes, it hurts.

676
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,585
Really? Thank you.

677
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,754
It's real, madam.

678
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,382
And by the way,
you did a wonderful job raising Ms. Yeo.

679
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:55,763
Mi-ran is a phenomenal attorney.
She's helped me out so much, seriously.

680
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:00,142
It's honestly a real honor and privilege
to be able to support you.

681
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,354
Oh, and the book,
so interesting to me.

682
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,439
Oh, thank you so much for this.

683
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,902
It seems she exaggerated
certain parts to make it more fun.

684
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:10,945
Dad, watch it.

685
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,948
Exaggerated? Which part was that?

686
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,951
Well, overall,
here and there, all throughout.

687
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,619
Here, there, where?

688
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,956
To be honest, I don't recall
any of it being a falsehood.

689
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,461
What do you think, Dae-jun?

690
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,881
Actually, I haven't finished
the whole book, so…

691
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,633
Hmm.

692
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,429
Oh, so, Mr. Nam, where is he?

693
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,764
Is he still on the set?

694
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,017
Um, yeah, I think so.

695
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,354
-Did you have a fight?
-No.

696
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,439
You had a fight.

697
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,784
-Hey.
-Kang-ho, this is Choi Soo-jin.

698
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,289
You didn't know?
Explains why there's no endorsement.

699
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,541
What did you guys even fight about?

700
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,293
Was it something about work?

701
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,714
If Ms. Choi Soo-jin is doing this for you,
then where is Mr. Nam Kang-ho?

702
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,716
I thought he'd be here.

703
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,259
Kang-ho is busy right now.

704
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,803
Are you actually dating
this man seriously?

705
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,597
You know, you're only getting older.

706
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,642
Well, I'm doing just dandy.
Thank you for the sincere concern.

707
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,520
If he can't make it,
he could have at least called,

708
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,522
especially on a day like this.

709
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,400
Men categorize
when it comes to women they like.

710
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,612
The ones they would toy with
and the ones that are gonna stay.

711
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,365
What? Our daughter
isn't just some plaything, all right?

712
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,744
She shouldn't carry herself like that.
She should have some dignity.

713
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,664
Oh goodness. Where did Ms. Choi go
in the middle of a meal?

714
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,794
If you show up unannounced,
it could really go either way.

715
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,296
It's all or nothing.

716
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,590
She could be happy about it or not.

717
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,091
You can decide.

718
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,636
Sis?

719
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:03,140
-Hm?
-I… have something to tell you.

720
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,228
I really wanted
to tell you sooner.

721
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,897
I'm really sorry.

722
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,360
I made a fool out of myself
in front of Nam Kang-ho.

723
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,279
You guys
are making me look like an idiot.

724
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,906
I'm so sorry.

725
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,076
Why'd you say anything?
Why'd I find out this way?

726
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,327
Piss me off.

727
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:27,164
I felt you would forgive me
if I decided to just tell you the truth.

728
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,670
Why do I keep getting treated
like a pushover by everyone that I like?

729
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,713
Oh, a pushover! Who said that to you?

730
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,299
Let's head inside. We'll talk later.

731
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,550
Okay.

732
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,854
You're here.

733
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,401
Oh, hey. It's good to see you.

734
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,111
"Oh, hey"?

735
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,865
I would love to stay until the end.
Unfortunately, I have to leave.

736
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,995
-Thank you so much for tonight.
-Thank you for everything.

737
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,956
It was a pleasure. See you later.

738
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,126
Take care and… I owe you.

739
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,086
Okay.

740
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,755
Have a good night.

741
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,181
Uh, would you mind if I address you…

742
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,851
Oh, sir, it's okay to speak informally.
As you were saying.

743
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,811
All right.

744
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,690
It is nice that a superstar like you
likes my daughter,

745
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,485
but she's a bit irresponsible
and very headstrong.

746
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,697
What do you mean, headstrong?

747
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,490
She's just independent.

748
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,874
I respect Mi-ran.

749
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,253
Mm-hmm.

750
00:45:56,336 --> 00:46:00,048
And I've been learning
many, many things from Mi-ran.

751
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:02,843
Oh.

752
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,347
-Such as?
-She's noble and brave too.

753
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,727
She does good deeds
and acts like it was nothing special.

754
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,189
And once you really get to know her,

755
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,024
it's impossible to not like her.

756
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,654
She's the most amazing woman I've met,
and I'm truly lucky to know her.

757
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,921
Mom, what's wrong?

758
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,506
I'm just happy for you.

759
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,468
Oh, Mom.

760
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,974
It makes me so happy
to hear that Nam Kang-ho

761
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,185
respects my daughter.

762
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:01,151
If I heard something like that
just once from your dad,

763
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,695
I mean, I wouldn't have written this book.

764
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,583
-See you again.
-Okay, take care.

765
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,835
-Bye, Mi-ran.
-Yes, sir.

766
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:21,380
Mr. Nam Kang-ho, thank you.

767
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,422
Have a good day.

768
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:23,966
See you again.

769
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,884
Of course. Have a safe drive.

770
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,812
Mm, did the gangster movie scenes

771
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,938
rub off on you?

772
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,440
You're not upset, are you?

773
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,569
No.

774
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,405
I'm grateful.

775
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,035
Then why don't we go somewhere,
and we can talk it out?

776
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,584
Well, didn't you come straight
from the set though? You must be tired.

777
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,178
Let's go home.
It's more comfortable that way.

778
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:14,933
Your house.

779
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:17,853
You don't want to?

780
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,022
-Oh, I guess you don't.
-I do. I do.

781
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,779
I really meant what I said earlier.

782
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,327
About how I respect you

783
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,914
and that you're the most amazing woman
I've ever met in my entire life.

784
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,671
I believe in quid pro quo,

785
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,425
so I would like to return the favor
by saying something nice.

786
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,808
Even though I've dated over 100 men,

787
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,104
you are the first
to have ever met my family.

788
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,524
That's a great honor.

789
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,612
Right now, they're probably getting ahead
of themselves, excited for our future,

790
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,322
like we'll get married soon.

791
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,909
Well, if one person changes her mind,
it wouldn't be too unrealistic.

792
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,788
It's still unrealistic even if I do.
I don't believe in marriage.

793
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:18,789
What?

794
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,208
What's wrong?

795
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,585
Then what's the point of dating 100 guys?

796
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,547
Meeting all those men
made me lose faith in marriage.

797
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,342
However…

798
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,805
even if I don't believe in it,

799
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,101
I do think
that I'd still like to date you anyway.

800
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,271
I've dated men that I didn't like before.

801
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,692
Why shouldn't I date a man I like?

802
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,031
I'm pretty sure that's what I want.

803
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,084
Do you want a glass of wine?
Your wounds are all healed.

804
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:12,467
Since I had my first kiss stolen,

805
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,220
what if I just…
