♪ Love to hate you ♪

2
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,191
You must be freezing.

3
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,028
-Let's go inside.
-Okay, sounds good.

4
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,113
I'll order something tasty.

5
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,741
-See you around.
-Good night.

6
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,372
I can't stand these girls.

7
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,254
Yes!

8
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,297
Whoa.

9
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,466
Uh-oh.

10
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,679
Yes! At least they're outside now.

11
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,184
Here. Have a good night.

12
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,769
Oh, thanks.

13
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,024
You're here.

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,780
Seriously? Is he actually
the president in disguise?

15
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,075
It looks like it was
intentionally thrown at the camera.

16
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,994
-Does anything come to your mind?
-No.

17
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,247
Well, I mean, I do have some crazy fans.

18
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,882
NICE GUYS GET A PASS
BAD BOYS HAVE IT COMING

19
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,094
There's no way

20
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,805
that she could be just a fan

21
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,098
or a relative.

22
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,891
It was late,

23
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,643
and the young girl came alone.

24
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,520
I have a hunch about this.

25
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,108
A cop's intuition.

26
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,778
A rookie cop may not notice it
no matter how hard they try.

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,532
But once he starts to see it,
he sees it all the time.

28
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,666
Please, don't hurt me!

29
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:16,136
A professor, 52, paid
his daughter's underage friend for sex.

30
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,513
A 49-year-old executive
had paid intercourse

31
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,473
with 13 minors through an app.

32
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,643
A 47-year-old male teacher
stalked a female student.

33
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:27,772
A pastor, age 46, sexually exploited
40 minors over 20 years.

34
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,567
A 36-year-old star
has paid intercourse with a minor.

35
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,986
I can't stand these girls.

36
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,699
I feel it in my gut.

37
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,617
She's definitely a minor.

38
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,287
I would love to gather some evidence
and ruin Nam Kang-ho,

39
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,205
but what's more important is

40
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,958
I need to make sure
that the girl is rescued and safe.

41
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:51,838
Please look this way.
Ji-hye, over here. Please wave your hand.

42
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,339
Okay, thanks a lot.

43
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,675
Mr. Nam Kang-ho,
in the spirit of your show,

44
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,135
could we ask you to make a heart?

45
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,598
Ah, as we all expected, not today either.

46
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,350
Mr. Nam is too classy to do that for us.

47
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,728
This is the first time
you worked together.

48
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,605
Was there chemistry between you two?

49
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,192
Uh, I think there were sparks between us.

50
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,110
We had long discussions
about our characters

51
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,239
and the scenes we were in, and I would say
that we worked well together.

52
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,037
I heard that there was already
a kissing scene.

53
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,331
What do you think
this kiss will be called?

54
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,917
Um, some have called it a kiss like glue.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,961
Why is that?
Is it because your lips won't come apart?

56
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,714
I guess you'll find out
when you watch the show.

57
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,095
I heard
you recently made a special cameo

58
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,931
in Tim Samuel's latest film.

59
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,475
Can you explain the connection
that led to your appearance?

60
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,852
Right, so I used to live in LA
when I was younger.

61
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,438
And a friend of mine from back in the day,

62
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,357
he worked on the production.

63
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,694
So I actually had to audition for him,
and I was lucky enough that they liked me.

64
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,280
Um, I was there for only five days.

65
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,617
It was really a small part,
and I gave it my best.

66
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,994
And I just hope
that they didn't cut me out.

67
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,873
What happened
to the noise complaint at Lia's apartment?

68
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,293
Mr. Ko, they dropped the charges.
I made them know it'd be hard

69
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,672
for them to prove their claim.
We wrapped it with four concert tickets

70
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,048
courtesy of Dowon Entertainment.

71
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,675
Okay.

72
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,677
What about Hyeon Chang-min's apartment?

73
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,388
Last week, we "handled it."

74
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,597
"Okay."

75
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,849
Seriously?

76
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,644
Accounting, legal,
labor issues, everything.

77
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,481
All legal matters for our clients,
we do it all.

78
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,607
Hmm.

79
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,152
Oh, yeah. The ex-girlfriend
of Jay from Good Boys?

80
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,529
She agreed to get an abortion.

81
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,240
Fifty million won
for the procedure and an NDA.

82
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,199
Okay!

83
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,243
That's less than expected.

84
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,370
-Thank you.
-What about Min Ju-hyeok?

85
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,205
We found new videos.

86
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,749
We deleted them along with the chat room
where they were shared.

87
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,838
Wait a minute.

88
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,382
Isn't this illegal?

89
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:05,346
I said that we have already deleted
all the videos along with the chat room.

90
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,479
Ah. Got it.

91
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,361
You're strong.

92
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,947
Yeah, a little.

93
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,409
But you seem to have a soft heart.
You won't do well at this place.

94
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,457
Yeah!

95
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,958
I'm here to make money.

96
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,460
The rent. The rent.

97
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,379
I'd have gone somewhere else
if not for that.

98
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,723
Wow. Shh.

99
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,147
That's close enough!

100
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,198
Kang-ho, I texted you.

101
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,200
I told you to use the back door.

102
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,329
By the way, I think
it's time that you get a new stylist.

103
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,082
I simply couldn't believe
what you were wearing today.

104
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,292
But then you spoke very well.

105
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,961
I'll see you later! Good luck.

106
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,590
Oh, Kang-ho, you're here. Hey, come in.
Everyone's waiting. Hurry up.

107
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,469
Man, is she still acting up like that?

108
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,138
Jeez, we really have to do something
about that.

109
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,058
A bunch of them out there?

110
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,059
Yeah.

111
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,854
Keep watching,
and if things get out of hand,

112
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,314
call Attorney Lee, okay?

113
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,024
-Got it?
-Yeah.

114
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,235
-Hey!
-You!

115
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,570
Who are you to get
in between Kang-ho and us, huh?

116
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,490
I just wanna say,
Kang-ho is really exhausted.

117
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,492
He won't come out, so please go home.

118
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,537
Hey, who do you think you are?
Are you his wife? Manager?

119
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,330
I'm his fan club president.

120
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,915
Think you're somebody, but you're not.

121
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,209
What fan club has a president these days?

122
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,378
This one. Right here!

123
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,547
-I am. Me! Me!
-We've never seen you before.

124
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,465
-I don't care!
-What? What?

125
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,217
Wha… wha… wha… what?

126
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,596
NAM'S ROMANCE
WILL THE WIN STREAK CONTINUE?

127
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,439
Welcome.

128
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,775
Oh man.

129
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,530
Oh, thank you.

130
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,120
-Are you trying to pick a fight?
-Young-ki.

131
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,330
That depends on you.

132
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,373
How scary.

133
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,794
Yeah, you want me
to stay away from Mi-ran, don't you?

134
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,755
-Yeah.
-You said it was over.

135
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,674
Man, that girl,
we didn't reach out to her.

136
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,051
She submitted her résumé
and got hired through an interview.

137
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,847
Of all the law firms in the city,
she has to join ours.

138
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,931
That's how she is.

139
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,727
She didn't even patch things up.
She just, bam, falls into your life.

140
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,604
I thought it was over between us,

141
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,481
but I realized it
that night when we went out.

142
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,067
I don't care what people think of me,
but because Mi-ran was there…

143
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,653
Why did I have to wear
pink briefs that day?

144
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,905
YEO MI-RAN

145
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,451
Hey, Mi-ran.

146
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,953
Jin-suh, I have a question.

147
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,039
Who's Mr. Nam Kang-ho's lawyer?

148
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,707
Huh? I am.

149
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,542
Oh. Yeah?

150
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:27,006
Then maybe, on his cases,
we can work together?

151
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:28,966
Why?

152
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,136
Well, isn't it obvious? I'm interested.

153
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,391
I think we still need some time apart.

154
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,269
No, no, I'm not saying
that I'm interested in working with you--

155
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,354
Yeah, I'll think about it.

156
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,605
-What?
-See ya.

157
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,732
Oh.

158
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,151
What? She wants you back?

159
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,111
You got it.

160
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,947
Even after seeing your pants rip?

161
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,157
You're kidding, right?

162
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,536
Man, she must feel really bad for you.
So what are you gonna do?

163
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,955
There'll be more embarrassing things
for her to see.

164
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,208
Like how much you have to grovel
for Choi Soo-jin and Nam Kang-ho.

165
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,127
No, it isn't.
Not with Choi Soo-jin anymore.

166
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,505
Okay, you can keep telling yourself that.

167
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,049
Ah, here she is.

168
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,218
YOON SANG-SUP

169
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,138
Yes, Sang-sup.

170
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,266
Oh, yeah, I'm having a drink
with an important client.

171
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,892
-What?
-I got it.

172
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,230
-Oh, shit.
-Why? Do you have to go?

173
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,856
Man, I'm kind of dizzy.

174
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,775
Gosh, do they think
we have nothing better to do

175
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,235
than just to be on standby?

176
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,903
Young-ki.

177
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:31,821
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,240
Can you cover me just for tonight?

179
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,245
-No.
-Come on.

180
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,747
Then I guess it's on me.

181
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,668
I'll just have to ask someone
who would do anything for me.

182
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,338
Gosh, I'm an idiot.

183
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,341
Did I really just ask my ex
to hook me up to another man?

184
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,010
It's like I was trying to insult him.

185
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,974
Hello?

186
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,184
Can you get over
to Nam Kang-ho right now?

187
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,395
You mean, right now?

188
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,774
So does this mean,
from now on, we'll be working together?

189
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,444
I'll send you the location
and the manager's phone number.

190
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,446
We'll talk while you're
on the way. Thanks.

191
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,697
Sounds good.

192
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,160
Wow, unbelievable.

193
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,913
You ran into her at the hotel,
and she still wants to get back together?

194
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,707
Well, that's how she is.

195
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,459
So cool.

196
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,046
Look at this!
He's not captured in any of these photos!

197
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,049
Whatever. I am telling you
as the president of his fan club.

198
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,009
President, my ass!

199
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,093
Goodness.

200
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,472
Man, what is her problem, seriously, huh?

201
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,682
-What's wrong?
-Mr. Do.

202
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,851
Things are getting
more and more serious out there.

203
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,312
Shouldn't we call someone right now?

204
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,357
If we call the police, it'll be on
the front page of the newspaper tonight.

205
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,358
Mmm.

206
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,985
-Where is Attorney Lee?
-He said he would be here soon.

207
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,947
We have to remove Ip-sae
as the fan club president.

208
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,283
She's ruining Kang-ho's new TV show.

209
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,451
Let her be.

210
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:05,039
At least she's acting out of affection.
Her obsession will be hard to stop.

211
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,751
And you'd better not even think about
going out there yourself, okay?

212
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,504
-Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
-Keep watch for now.

213
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,881
-Hey!
-It's not my problem! Let go of me!

214
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,051
-What is it? Is there a problem?
-No, not at all.

215
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,719
If they see you, they'll get crazier.

216
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,179
…really don't care!

217
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,601
You hear that?

218
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:54,171
-What is she doing?
-I can't believe she threw that.

219
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,798
-What the…
-Isn't that a toy?

220
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,591
Ta-da! Don't be alarmed, everyone.

221
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,260
-Just a toy.
-Yeah, right.

222
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,595
-Who is she?
-Okay, this is me.

223
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,722
I'm a lawyer.

224
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,765
-A lawyer?
-A lawyer.

225
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,892
-Why is that woman here?
-Beats me.

226
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:07,935
What is she doing here?

227
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,688
-You don't know why?
-Hey, Sang-sup, why is she here?

228
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,734
I… I don't know either.
I called Lee Jin-suh when you told me to.

229
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,652
Okay, does anyone here know

230
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,488
how much the fine is
for public disturbance?

231
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,533
-Well, uh…
-Fifty thousand won per person.

232
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,495
And whoever attacks me
will be sued for assault, just FYI.

233
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,706
-Understand?
-No one's going to attack you.

234
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,834
However, let's say
the assault possibly leads to an injury.

235
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,588
Then the situation
could become very complicated.

236
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,466
You know the difference
between assault and injury? Goodness!

237
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,594
Oh, Mr. Do!
The director's looking for you.

238
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,970
-Yeah?
-Yes.

239
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,513
-Sang-sup.
-Yes.

240
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,891
Keep an eye on them.
Call if something goes wrong.

241
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,392
Yeah, I got it.

242
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,478
-This way.
-Let's go.

243
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,437
I'll see you.

244
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,982
That's enough legal talk.

245
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,360
I will now talk to you ladies
on a very personal level.

246
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,321
I will probably talk informally,

247
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,240
so if you'd be offended,
please go home now.

248
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,075
Well, then let's hear what you got.

249
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,578
Hmm. Okay. Raise your hand

250
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,831
if you've been to events like this
less than three times. Hands!

251
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,584
Sure, if you're a fan,
you can do this once or twice.

252
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,295
How about more than three times
and less than ten times? Hands.

253
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,425
So many of you, huh? Okay.

254
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,636
This can be sort of a hobby, I understand.

255
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,720
More than ten times?

256
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,806
Those who follow him on every occasion.

257
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,018
You, stalker.

258
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,436
-You, stalker. You, stalker.
-What?

259
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,979
What do you mean, "stalker"?

260
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,023
You think anyone in this world
actually wants that?

261
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,526
-Of course not!
-How can you call us that?

262
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,569
You're a lawyer.
You can't say something so rude.

263
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,197
-Think you know everything?
-Lawyers don't know everything!

264
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,949
Girls!

265
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,158
The thing about men is

266
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,328
they like women who can make
their own decision to walk away anytime,

267
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,623
but for the women who can't live
without them, they don't care at all!

268
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,501
Remember that.

269
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,336
Take that to your hearts!

270
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,298
Trust me.
One day, you will all understand.

271
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,927
-It must have been tough to cast.
-Please try this.

272
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,012
This is really tasty, the crab shell.

273
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,390
You have a lot of work to do, so eat up.

274
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,519
Ah, jeez, you're drinking again.
No way. Don't drink any more. Hey!

275
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,855
Kang-ho, let me pour you a drink.

276
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,030
I'm learning a lot from you.

277
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,742
You spoke so graciously
at the interview earlier.

278
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,662
To tell you the truth,
I'm really not good at lying.

279
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,747
A poker face isn't something I do well.

280
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,878
It's cool to be honest,

281
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,796
but don't be a nuisance.

282
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,687
Yeah. What happened?

283
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,648
-Well, they've all left.
-Okay. And you haven't eaten yet?

284
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,984
-No, not--
-Right. Come over here and join us.

285
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:06,071
But the lawyer is waiting.
She says she wants to say hi to Kang-ho.

286
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,282
Huh? Why?

287
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,743
She says
she'll be handling Kang-ho's cases

288
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,369
with Attorney Lee from now on.

289
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,704
Wait, what?

290
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,962
Nice to meet you.

291
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,422
Yes, hello.

292
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,259
Hey, Sang-sup,
you haven't eaten?

293
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,803
-Not yet.
-You must be starving. You should go eat.

294
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,639
Thanks.

295
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,308
We met at the party.

296
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,853
So starting today, I'll be handling
Mr. Nam's cases. I'm Yeo Mi-ran.

297
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,605
Yeah.

298
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,858
Miss Yeo, thank you so much
for what you did tonight.

299
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,029
But I wasn't notified
of such an arrangement.

300
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,866
Ah. Attorney Lee and I
talked earlier about working together.

301
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,660
-But I never--
-On whose authority?

302
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,496
Pardon?

303
00:15:55,579 --> 00:16:00,876
Are you perhaps doing this
in the hopes that we would get closer?

304
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,920
-What?
-Huh?

305
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,922
She said she likes me.

306
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,801
She confessed that at dinner.

307
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,011
She told me she tripped me
because she liked me.

308
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,599
You know, back at the office,
she was the one who did it.

309
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,934
What?

310
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,896
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

311
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,482
Hey. No, hold on. Wait a minute.
What are you saying, huh?

312
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,235
So you're saying
that you tripped him on purpose?

313
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,154
I wasn't intending
to hurt him at all.

314
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,698
It's fine. She's already apologized.

315
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,950
What I want to know is
what exactly brought you out here?

316
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,995
That's because I felt very bad.

317
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,248
I just wanted to help out
in any way possible.

318
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,418
I don't have an ulterior motive. Not me.

319
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,544
-I swear to God!
-Oh!

320
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,839
I do have an ulterior motive.
You have no idea.

321
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,841
No ulterior motive? What about that?

322
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,759
This?

323
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,053
It's soft. It doesn't hurt.

324
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,723
And I'm accurate,
so don't worry, it wouldn't hurt anyone.

325
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,349
-Ah!
-Oh, damn it!

326
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,437
I'm quite athletic, you know.
Or so I'm told.

327
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,316
Hey, I could be your bodyguard
in situations like earlier.

328
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,234
You wanna see?

329
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,698
Here, watch.

330
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,678
What are you doing? Never mind
guarding him. You're about to kill him.

331
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,599
Hang on. You're amusing, I'll admit.

332
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,978
But, you know, you can't win a fight
just with some fancy moves, right?

333
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,731
What if someone bigger and stronger
grabbed you like this?

334
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,613
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, come on. What are you doing?

335
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,323
What's wrong with you?

336
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:58,410
-Are you out of your mind?
-Oh, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

337
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,370
What am I doing?

338
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,751
Whatever the case, thank you very much
for taking care of things today.

339
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:09,213
But Kang-ho here feels uncomfortable
around female lawyers.

340
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,130
Good work today.

341
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,299
Have a good night. Let's go.

342
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,760
Come on, let's go. Hurry up.

343
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,221
-Let's go, come on. Let's get out of here.
-Huh? Yeah.

344
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,599
Oh man.

345
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,604
How the hell?
He could have just said no to me.

346
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,523
Why point out that I'm a woman?

347
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,191
Come on.

348
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,487
Hey, don't you think
that woman is a little unstable?

349
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,990
Whoosh!

350
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,659
Oh, I feel dizzy.

351
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,077
Mixed martial arts.

352
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,539
She seemed legit but not traditional.

353
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,124
What the heck are you saying?

354
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,416
Hey.

355
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,169
I really think she's a bit unstable.

356
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,046
She screws you over, huh?

357
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,757
Then she helps you out,
and then she's all over you?

358
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,385
Be careful of women.

359
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,805
Yeah, I'm always careful around women.

360
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,557
Whoosh!

361
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,313
What are you two doing?

362
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,150
Answer the phone.

363
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,820
YEO MI-RAN

364
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:15,863
Huh?

365
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,532
Hello? Ah, shit.

366
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,783
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me.

367
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,161
-Why didn't you answer my--
-It's all done here.

368
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,454
How? Did you handle it well?

369
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,372
Yeah.

370
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,168
Of course. It was nothing.

371
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,420
I knew it. You don't need me.

372
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,131
You don't need my help either.

373
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,800
What kind of girl
never asks for a ride home

374
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,802
and never asks me to pick her up?

375
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,721
-You better stop drinking.
-Seriously.

376
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,557
-You take care, all right?
-Huh? Hello?

377
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:50,022
Hmm? Hello?

378
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,319
Who's this?

379
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,238
-Hey, give it back!
-You stupid moron.

380
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,949
I knew it.
You like her more than she likes you.

381
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,911
I still love her.
What do you know about that?

382
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,331
Hey! Maybe if you hadn't seen
each other like that.

383
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,500
You both caught each other cheating.
How could you get back together?

384
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,919
I don't know.

385
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,922
I just know that she has
a knack for ruining men.

386
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,341
It's almost like, once you fall for her,

387
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,385
you can't back out easily.

388
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,431
In pool, she scores 500
with her right hand and 200 with her left.

389
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,351
She's an expert in all kinds of things.

390
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,938
And she's good
at just about any kind of sport.

391
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,773
She is fearless.

392
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,403
Wow. So cool.

393
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,447
Get on.

394
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,744
In order to catch a tiger,
one must enter the tiger's den.

395
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,123
You've done great.

396
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,501
Are you okay to go home?

397
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,211
I'm fine. I can get myself home.

398
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,588
-Thank you. Thanks for the great work.
-Okay, I hear you.

399
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,839
-Take care
-Get home safely.

400
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,383
-Good work today. Okay.
-Thank you!

401
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,425
-Good job.
-Mr. Do!

402
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,678
-Yeah?
-Can I please have a word with you?

403
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,138
Looks like you've drunk again today.

404
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,932
Let's talk later when you're sober, okay?

405
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,269
But I do really have
something important to tell you.

406
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,479
Please, it'll take only a minute.

407
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,483
Go on ahead.

408
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,193
-Good night. Bye.
-Okay.

409
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,029
-Where are you taking me?
-Right over…

410
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,825
Hey.

411
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,494
I'm very sorry.
Let me get something for my stomach.

412
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,495
What's wrong?

413
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:32,541
I don't know.
I must be having an upset tummy.

414
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,460
This is the reason
why you shouldn't eat too fast.

415
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,503
-Come here.
-What?

416
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,421
Hmm.

417
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,965
You don't have a fever.

418
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,217
Right.

419
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,052
Go home and get some rest, okay?

420
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,722
Huh? Oh, no.
No, I have to drive you home first--

421
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,307
It's fine. I'll call a driver.

422
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,184
-But still, I should drive you.
-Take this.

423
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,438
-Should I call you one?
-No. I couldn't ask that.

424
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,523
Come on, it's no problem. You're not well.

425
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,401
Get some rest.
Let me know when you feel better.

426
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,402
All right.

427
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,279
-Thank you.
-Go home now.

428
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,198
-Get home safely.
-All right.

429
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,249
-Driver!
-My goodness!

430
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,418
-Shall I be your driver?
-You're still here?

431
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,087
Oh, yes.
I was hungry so I was eating at…

432
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,881
at a nearby restaurant.

433
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,633
I had just come out of there,
and, well, here you are.

434
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,469
Ah…

435
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:29,222
I can see you might think of me
like some stalker. Well…

436
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,807
All right, then.

437
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,436
I'm really truly sorry
about the day that I tripped you,

438
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,272
and I would like to be of help
in any way to apologize.

439
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,107
I'm fully certified.

440
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,485
I present to you a class-one license.

441
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,154
Just in case,
if you're considering which way is ruder,

442
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:47,074
whether rejecting me and calling a driver
or letting me drive you home,

443
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:50,911
from where I stand, it's more pitiful
to be rejected and going home.

444
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,539
Come on. If I blow this,
it'd be hard to get to him again.

445
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,630
-You have a class-one license?
-Of course I do.

446
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,257
Having one isn't that big of a deal.
Why would I lie?

447
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:15,977
CLASS ONE STANDARD

448
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,150
Well, give it a try then.

449
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,777
Yes.

450
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,280
I'll get you home safely.

451
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,576
I was really stressed-out that day,

452
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,121
so I made a fool out of myself. I'm sorry.

453
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,123
Oh, you did not. Don't worry.

454
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,209
And, you know, you're still so young.
I think that you're doing all right.

455
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,337
No, I thought
you would hate me for acting like that.

456
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,630
Jeez.

457
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,132
I don't hate you.

458
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,425
-Look here.
-Yes?

459
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,801
With you,

460
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:51,221
say if you tone down your drinking a bit,

461
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,641
I think that you would make
a really good director in the future.

462
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:58,979
Really?

463
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,192
Can you tell me why you think
I could become such a great director?

464
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,572
I knew this would be a good talk,
so I prepared something.

465
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,615
Ta-da!

466
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,957
One for you and one for me.

467
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,667
Cheers!

468
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,673
Now tell me what makes you think
I could become a great director?

469
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,802
Please tell me, eh?

470
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,410
What if he lets me drive him home

471
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,829
but still tells me
he doesn't want a female lawyer?

472
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,498
He could say that.

473
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,415
Damn it.

474
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,628
-Did you learn martial arts?
-Oh, yes. I did learn a little.

475
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,671
-What kind?
-This and that.

476
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:10,008
I learned tae kwon do,
also judo, aikido, kung fu,

477
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,677
and a bit of boxing and MMA.

478
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,012
You really learned all those?

479
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,431
I've only dabbled in them,
never had a black belt.

480
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,349
Ah.

481
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,102
So why did you learn all those?

482
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,438
It's just my hobby.
It's what I like to do.

483
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,858
What do you like? Fighting?

484
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:27,776
Mm-mmm.

485
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,945
Feeling of victory. It's good.

486
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,869
Make a right
at the second alley over there.

487
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,455
-Huh?
-I wanna stop by the store real quick.

488
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,333
Oh. Yeah.

489
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,503
Just put
a tiny scratch on the van.

490
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,001
-Where's the store you wanna go to?
-Uh, take a left, over there at the end.

491
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,933
How about it?
I bet you can't make it through.

492
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,567
Yeah!

493
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,861
Slow down! Slow down!

494
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,451
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, okay?

495
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,829
-Whoo!
-I'm sorry!

496
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,380
-Well, we have arrived.
-Ending voice guidance.

497
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,550
By the way,
how did you know it was this house?

498
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,054
Eh? Well… well, the navigation said so.

499
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,015
No, what I'm saying is,
how did you know it was this very house?

500
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,017
It could be that house
or that house there.

501
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,477
Oh, you've seen it.

502
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,521
I have exceptional
spatial and distance awareness.

503
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,191
Hmm.

504
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,442
Here's your key.

505
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,572
Mmm.

506
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:38,990
I should go.

507
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,701
Ah, yes. Thank you. Let me call you a cab.

508
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,453
Oh, it… it's fine.

509
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,580
I'll call you one. Just take the cab.

510
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,792
Will this really end
with me just driving him home?

511
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,752
It will be here in three minutes.

512
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:55,465
Oh, don't worry about it. I'll catch one
from the main road. Have a good night.

513
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,300
Wait.

514
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,139
-Yeah?
-I've already called it for you.

515
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,766
Ah, right.

516
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,151
You know, you don't have to wait with me.

517
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,698
Let's have you handle
my cases from now on.

518
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,740
Okay.

519
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,784
What?

520
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:27,330
You're not even assigned to me, so I feel
indebted to send you home… like this.

521
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,374
Oh! Thanks a lot.

522
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,458
I'll do my best!

523
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,420
You can call me
anytime you need me.

524
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,381
You already gave this to our boss earlier.

525
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,341
Ah, I sure did!

526
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,427
-Oh my.
-Congratulations.

527
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,638
-It's a huge deal for you.
-Oh, yes.

528
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,391
Sure, I did.
I'm enraptured from gratitude.

529
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,351
You must think being assigned to you
is an award.

530
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,687
Just because you succeeded here,

531
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,273
that doesn't mean
that you'll become successful.

532
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,190
What?

533
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,067
I'm saying, don't like me
too much, you know?

534
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,695
It's not my fault if your heart breaks.

535
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,156
Oh my gosh, what a pompous jerk!

536
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,535
Oh my gosh. I wouldn't dream of it.
I dare not think about it!

537
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:10,790
I'm sure you would end up dating
a very young and gorgeous girl.

538
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,042
Oh, the cab's here.

539
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,673
-Okay, have a good night.
-Yeah.

540
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,099
What was that?

541
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,895
I've never met a woman like that.

542
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,856
Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes!

543
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,860
It seems like
the beginning of your end is starting now.

544
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,739
-What?
-Oh, no, I was just talking to myself.

545
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,823
Mmm.

546
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:50,079
-I'm so tired.
-I thought you came to have a drink.

547
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,248
Are you asleep?

548
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,172
Oh, your couch is so comfortable.

549
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:01,758
Mmm.

550
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,885
Which girl tormented you today, Do?

551
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,845
It's nothing like that.

552
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,808
Try as she might,
Do Won-jun won't fall for it.

553
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:14,270
Not even someone as pretty, intelligent,
and rich like me can win his heart.

554
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,898
Come again? Hmm?

555
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:22,111
If we stay single until we're 40,
do you wanna get married?

556
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,580
Wow, Grace, you really have
so much energy.

557
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,000
My goodness,
you're still wide-awake at this hour.

558
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,669
There is a reason for this.

559
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,506
-I met Yoo Sung-jun earlier this evening.
-The director?

560
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,801
-You're producing that?
-Mmm.

561
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:48,429
-Who's the male lead?
-It's undecided. The script just came out.

562
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,392
Hey. Whoa.

563
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:56,563
You know what? Action-noir is something
Kang-ho has always wanted to do.

564
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,899
It's Yoo Sung-jun's film.
We'll do it, guaranteed.

565
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,451
Here.

566
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,370
Take a look and let me know.

567
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,415
-I'll take this straight to Kang-ho, okay?
-Okay.

568
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,877
Wow, Grace, thanks so much.

569
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,044
Hey.

570
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,341
I wish you cared for me
as much as you care for Nam Kang-ho.

571
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,302
One, two, three, four!

572
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,263
Come out.

573
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,182
♪ Why are you coming out of there? ♪

574
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,728
Hey!

575
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:37,812
Whoo!

576
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,983
Ah, like this.

577
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,862
Ms. Yeo, you should work on upgrading
your repertoire for company parties.

578
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:46,779
All right.

579
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:48,948
Good.

580
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,659
-All right, it's meeting time, everyone.
-Sir.

581
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,494
Lee Jin-suh! Yeo Mi-ran!

582
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,915
Who said Nam Kang-ho's case
could be passed off without my say?

583
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,921
Uh, I'm sorry.
I suddenly had something come up,

584
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,464
and I requested Ms. Yeo's help.

585
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,758
Mr. Nam Kang-ho also approved it.

586
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,092
Oh, right.

587
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:12,055
-I'm asking… how did you get him to agree?
-What?

588
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,306
You know that Nam Kang-ho

589
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,642
doesn't normally get along very well
with ladies.

590
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,101
Ah!

591
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:21,606
I was able to drive him home.
His road manager suddenly fell ill.

592
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,232
To his house?

593
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,151
-That's good timing.
-Was that all?

594
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,321
That was all. Be quiet.

595
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,156
Good job. Well-done.

596
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,366
Excellent.

597
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,620
Hey, I told you
to be careful of that woman.

598
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,039
Come on, don't worry. You know me.

599
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,707
I'm gonna put her in her place.

600
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,961
"There must not be
a lot of beautiful lawyers like you

601
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,295
where you come from,

602
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,673
but they are a dime a dozen around me."

603
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,634
"So stop trying to hit the jackpot
by landing a top star."

604
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,970
"Just live humbly and do honest work."

605
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,138
It's a life lesson.

606
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,850
But why?
Wouldn't it be better just to ignore her?

607
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,395
Or are you interested in her?

608
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,188
No, not at all.

609
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,273
What brings you here so early?

610
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,525
Did something happen?

611
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,363
Here.

612
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,364
What is it?

613
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,534
It's a script. Director Yoo Sung-jun.

614
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,493
Yoo Sung-jun?

615
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:19,831
I said I'll let them know
after you look at the script.

616
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,916
Are you crazy? Tell them yes right away!

617
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,543
Tell them I love the script!

618
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:26,462
Let the director know I'm really excited
and I'm dying to meet him.

619
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,172
All right.

620
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,340
-Hey.
-Yeah.

621
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,758
Hey. I love you.

622
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,926
-You know that?
-Okay.

623
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,012
Hey, no. Stop it! Ah!

624
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,890
-Hold on! Hey!
-I love you!

625
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,059
-What?
-I thought you were tired of romance.

626
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,769
This isn't romance. It's erotica.

627
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,939
Ah! You're crazy!

628
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,650
-Why? What's wrong?
-Seriously, stop it!

629
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,318
What are you… Damn it!

630
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,529
And you're so freakishly strong!

631
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,781
Ms. Yeo.

632
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,366
Yeah?

633
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,201
Up-to-date case log involving Nam Kang-ho.

634
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,328
Almost all concern women.

635
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,623
That many, huh? What?
Is he some kind of a womanizer?

636
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,669
It's the opposite. He ends up fighting
every actress he works with.

637
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,547
And our job is to cover up
those disputes.

638
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,382
He's kind of an oddball.

639
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,633
He doesn't date anyone.

640
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,636
I think he dislikes women.

641
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,348
-He dislikes women?
-Mmm.

642
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,104
I guess we'll see.

643
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,774
-Maybe just not into adult women.
-Huh?

644
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,609
Oh, nothing.

645
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:34,489
Wow, you nabbed the top two clients
from Dowon Entertainment right away.

646
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,074
Nam Kang-ho. Choi Soo-jin.

647
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,869
That's true.
So sad that as soon as you start working,

648
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,662
you're gonna be cannon fodder.

649
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,374
Huh?

650
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,044
How does nabbing the top two clients
turn you into cannon fodder?

651
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:51,714
It means they cause a lot of work
and create a lot of trouble along the way.

652
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,758
Lee Jin-suh got booted by Choi Soo-jin.

653
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,427
Nam Kang-ho called his lawyer
when his fans fought.

654
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,514
Both of them treat lawyers
as if they're their personal servants.

655
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,725
Lee Jin-suh acts like a hotshot out there,
but he must have been through a lot.

656
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,728
He was kind of like that at work.

657
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,147
He tries too hard. He ripped
his own pants at the work party.

658
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,817
His pants? Whoa. Why?

659
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,734
As a joke.

660
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,695
He was doing a split, and they ripped!

661
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,241
-Pow!
-Pink panty.

662
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,692
Sang-sup.

663
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,612
Am I making your life hard?

664
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,157
What?

665
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,241
Not at all.

666
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,659
Not at all?

667
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,911
-I trust you.
-Yeah.

668
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,663
Don't get sick.

669
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,540
You'll make me sick too.

670
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,295
Are you studying some new lines?

671
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,590
What? Was that too much?
Does it make you sick again?

672
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,384
It's been so long
since I saw you this happy, you know?

673
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,719
That makes me feel good too.

674
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,304
Cheesy.

675
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,389
Still love ya.

676
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,028
Welcome, Mr. Nam Kang-ho.

677
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,614
Kang-ho has been going on and on
about his dream

678
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,783
of working on a film project
with you as the director.

679
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,827
And finally, he got his chance.

680
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,498
Hmm.

681
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,419
Mr. Yoo.

682
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,255
Thank you very much.

683
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,800
For the script. I won't let you down.

684
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,848
May I ask,

685
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,018
have you decided on a female lead
by any chance?

686
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,025
Uh, well, no. There are
a few names we've been floating around.

687
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,027
But the director
has not decided on whom yet.

688
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,612
Ah.

689
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,081
Uh… The director's asking

690
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,959
if there's anyone you find
uncomfortable to work with.

691
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,168
Huh?

692
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,672
-Oh, uh, that's…
-Uh, no. I'll be fine.

693
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,298
Uh, sure.

694
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,427
Yeah, no one like that.

695
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:48,057
Oh, and having looked at the script,
it seems that Kang-ho might need

696
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,602
just a little more action training.
It'll be good practice.

697
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,021
So may I know, has the stunt coordinator
been decided yet?

698
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,235
Yoo Hyun-sang will be in charge.

699
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,736
-Oh!
-Wow.

700
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,657
Gosh, seriously! Wow,
we can't wait to start working with you.

701
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:10,830
Loosen up!

702
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,758
How was that?

703
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,635
Look, here's the thing.

704
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,054
-What now?
-You do have good reflexes.

705
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,057
But… you look too sporty.

706
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,477
What our director wants is
like that of a gritty back-alley thug.

707
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,314
-If that's what you want, I can do that.
-Show me.

708
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,273
Huh?

709
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,244
Bah!

710
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,164
-Oh, no, no, no. All right. Here.
-Oh, I'm dizzy.

711
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,915
-Let me show you something.
-Huh?

712
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,126
Huh?

713
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,006
Lightly, you know? Yeah, come on.

714
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:06,886
Tap.

715
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,763
Tap.

716
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,930
Ah!

717
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,101
Looks like it won't be easy
to shake that style of yours.

718
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,770
So, what did you mean by "too sporty"?

719
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,606
You didn't train to fight.
You trained to stay fit.

720
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,448
He has parents, a brother,

721
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,408
dropped out of SNU,

722
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,119
blood type… B.

723
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,663
"If you know your enemy,
you will win the battle."

724
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,123
But he's got no dirt.

725
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,416
DISCORD WITH ACTRESS CHA JI-EUN

726
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,960
Doesn't get along
with actresses, but crew like him.

727
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,380
It's almost like he's
some kind of warrior of justice

728
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,590
who chastises and punishes prima donnas.

729
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,967
Warrior of justice, my ass.

730
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,224
If only she had worn her uniform,

731
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,267
I could've found out
what school she attends.

732
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,728
A stakeout.

733
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,647
There's no other way.

734
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,293
Man, when is he coming home?

735
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,505
Who is this?

736
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,509
-Yes, hello?
-Hello, this is Nam Kang-ho.

737
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,261
Oh, yes!

738
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,432
-Where are you right now?
-Oh!

739
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,017
Uh… Oh, why?

740
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,521
I have something to ask you,
but I would rather do it in person.

741
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,898
-Can I see you for a little bit?
-Right now?

742
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:46,068
-If you're home, I'll head that way.
-Oh, no, I…

743
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,405
I mean, uh…
I'm not at home. I'm actually outside.

744
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,408
Oh, let me see. Oh, yeah, I think
I might actually be nearby your house.

745
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,493
You're nearby my house?

746
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:59,457
I mean, uh, not really close.
Like five minutes by taxi?

747
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,750
Okay, then, can I see you at my place?

748
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,254
-If that's okay with you.
-Sure, I'll call when I'm outside.

749
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,181
Mmm,
how can I explain the feeling?

750
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,057
So, you know, it's kinda like

751
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,977
something you learn
growing up fighting on the streets.

752
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,148
Something not traditional?

753
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,026
Was it traditional or not?

754
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,535
How am I sensing that
from a woman?

755
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,916
He'd rather talk to me
in person at this hour.

756
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,167
"Let's meet up."

757
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,710
And at his house!

758
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,630
That's 100% a come-on!

759
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,715
He thinks I'm super easy

760
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,051
just because I confessed
my feelings to him.

761
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,720
And I've signed an NDA
for the client's privacy.

762
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,432
That'd make me a really easy and safe toy.

763
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,811
Then… I will make things
even easier for him, perhaps?

764
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,360
NEW RECORDING

765
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,780
You really picked
the wrong target this time.

766
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,745
You're here sooner than me.

767
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,331
Yeah, like I said,

768
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:25,834
I just happened to be around the corner.

769
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,505
And I happen to be
a little drunk.

770
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,924
Well, does that excite you?

771
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,302
-Are you drunk?
-Huh?

772
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,933
Then let's talk some other time.
Get in. I'll take you home.

773
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,686
Uh… Wait a second.

774
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,356
I'm… not drunk.

775
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,734
I was just dozing off
while waiting for you.

776
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,653
I didn't even drink.

777
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,215
Come on in.

778
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,467
Then what on earth
are you trying to do with me?

779
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:17,970
This way.

780
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,601
Have a seat here.

781
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,692
The reason I wanted to see you so soon

782
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,611
is because I'm a bit impatient.

783
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,864
Do you know Director Yoo Sung-jun?
The action-noir master?

784
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,616
Yes, of course.

785
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,619
I got on board
one of his film projects.

786
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,162
I know this may seem perplexing,

787
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:46,498
but the action scenes
in the script kept reminding me of you.

788
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,959
You said you're good at fighting.

789
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,503
-Yes, I do fight well.
-Where did you learn to fight?

790
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,756
Well, like I told you the last time,

791
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,591
I did dabble in many things.

792
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,469
But the fighting techniques
are all self-taught.

793
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,471
In other words,
it is nontraditional, right?

794
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,473
I guess, since it's my own style.

795
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,641
May I see that again?

796
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,978
-Right now?
-Uh…

797
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,857
I, um… I just wanna get
a better idea of your style.

798
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,568
You asked to see me
because you want to see my fight moves?

799
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,819
Yeah.

800
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,614
Is he just insane?

801
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,658
Or is it some shenanigans?

802
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,371
Oh, and I also will compensate you
accordingly for helping me tonight.

803
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,207
Well…

804
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,419
I don't really think of any set style.

805
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,046
Hmm?

806
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,258
Hmm.

807
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,811
Oh, I have to stretch to avoid injuries.

808
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,522
Here I go.

809
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,859
Hit the ribs! Hit the ribs!

810
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,861
Slap the face! Slap the face!

811
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,071
Throat strike!

812
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,280
Eyes! Eyes!

813
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:01,740
Crotch!

814
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,039
I usually have a partner for this.

815
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,084
When I'm doing this by myself,
it just feels a bit…

816
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,839
All right, then, let's go.

817
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,174
Um…

818
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:30,144
No, no. I don't attack
someone standing still. Come at me.

819
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,028
Huh?

820
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,991
Is that all?

821
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,205
Here I go.

822
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,708
No one says, "Here I go," when they fight.

823
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:53,625
Come at me.

824
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,298
Huh?

825
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,861
Are you okay, Kang-ho?

826
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,446
Oh, can I help?

827
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,282
Oh! Oh!

828
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,910
Are you not into me anymore?

829
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,953
What?

830
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,004
Are you not into me?
