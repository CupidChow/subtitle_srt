00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,854
♪ Love to hate you ♪

2
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,471
Mm, wait, wait, wait a second.

3
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,228
What?

4
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,441
This feels a little odd.

5
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,401
What, having sex on day one?

6
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,946
No, hooking up
without even saying, "I like you."

7
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,531
We said it earlier.

8
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,618
What about the next step?

9
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,333
I love you.

10
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,921
You've never said it?

11
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,674
-No.
-Not once even?

12
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,179
-No.
-It's okay.

13
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,473
You can say it later.

14
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,351
I'm always taking the lead with you.

15
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,521
Do I have to say it out loud?

16
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,815
I thought only guys said that.

17
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,090
I think this really sealed the deal.

18
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,677
I fell for you
'cause you weren't like other women.

19
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,848
The women I know were all
manipulative, selfish, and calculating.

20
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,477
You were so "act now, think later,"
rash, and idiotic.

21
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,104
What do you mean, idiotic?

22
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,898
Courageous.

23
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,192
Frankly, I liked you
from even before that.

24
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,323
So what did it for you?

25
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,075
When you threw the boomerang.

26
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,914
It's true that men
are attracted to unusual women.

27
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,958
Oh, you were unusual.

28
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,335
You drove like a maniac.

29
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,005
You got all beaten-up on your birthday.

30
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,800
And you risked
your own life to save a stranger.

31
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,721
There's no stranger when saving lives.

32
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:03,266
You're right.
You're a hero who would save anyone.

33
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,979
Wait, no. You're a heroine,
since you're a woman.

34
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,775
Respect.

35
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,529
You know that I mean it, right?

36
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,537
I just wasn't expecting you

37
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,624
to be showering me
with compliments like this.

38
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,917
That was nice of you.

39
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,337
You'll win if you know
your enemy and know yourself.

40
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,631
But I'm not talking about winning here.

41
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,675
I just think it'd be good
if you read Mi-ran's mom's book.

42
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,888
You know, Mi-ran's father
is extremely sexist,

43
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,767
so her mother suffered
a great deal of unfairness over the years.

44
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,187
It's a huge plus
that my mom likes you, honey.

45
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,065
-I don't care what my dad thinks.
-"Honey"?

46
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,984
-Mmm.
-Good. That was natural.

47
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,417
YOU MADE ME WHO I AM

48
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,839
I think I'm gonna cry. What do I do?

49
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,966
It's all right.
Hey, you're gonna be great.

50
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,384
Once the cameras start rolling,

51
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,511
you'll turn back
into a movie star right away.

52
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,347
I should have shot
this scene before I saw that.

53
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,933
The image of him
grabbing that woman's hand

54
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,601
and taking her to his room

55
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,854
keeps on replaying in my head.

56
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,315
Ah, damn it. It's driving me crazy.

57
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,317
Well, then,

58
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,236
can you take how you feel

59
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,448
and use that feeling
while you're out there?

60
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,409
You do know that this scene
actually requires you to portray

61
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,577
a bit of sadness, don't you?

62
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,832
Just cry! You should take advantage
of this opportunity with him.

63
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,001
This is your last kiss,
and you can't have him back.

64
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:35,918
Make it special.

65
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,880
Are you sure? I can't have him back?

66
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,716
I don't think Mi-ran
actually likes Kang-ho.

67
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,675
You're wrong.

68
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,678
They are quite serious.

69
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,934
I brought it 'cause you wouldn't tell me
your account info.

70
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,146
No. Honestly,
you don't have to return this money.

71
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,066
How could I keep seeing him
after taking this?

72
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,360
Na-eun told me not to touch it.

73
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,696
She said that you'll never know
how things are gonna turn out.

74
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,705
Hey.

75
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,290
Are you out of your mind?

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,378
How could you forget
something so important?

77
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,922
Kang-ho, Hyeok-su on standby.

78
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,799
-Oh, yeah. Thanks, got it.
-All right.

79
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,718
Hey, I'll tell them
that you're feeling sick,

80
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,929
so pretend you're dizzy.
Come on, just drop down. Now.

81
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,097
No, no. I'll do it.

82
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,139
Do what?

83
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,849
I'll do the kiss scene.

84
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,767
Huh?

85
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,353
Just trust me. I can do this.

86
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,492
Cut!

87
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,677
Uh…

88
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,139
-Mm.
-Thanks.

89
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,020
So you took the medicine,
you little bastard.

90
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,731
-Why'd you scare me like that?
-I didn't take them.

91
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,108
-For real?
-Yeah.

92
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:05,985
And I did it.

93
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,165
Oh, do you really need to ask me that?

94
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:23,211
Of course. You're dating
none other than Nam Kang-ho,

95
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,505
but you've never fallen
for anyone else before.

96
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,008
So I'm totally curious,
what made you fall for him?

97
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,720
Was it his face, his voice, body,

98
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,805
or technique?

99
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,684
Don't you dare say, "His personality."

100
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,353
Hmm.

101
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,481
His arm.

102
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,524
Hm?

103
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,442
He put his arm
under my head while I slept.

104
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,654
-That's really what attracted you?
-Mmm.

105
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,198
Oh my God! That's crazy.

106
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,366
What?

107
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,202
It turns out,
there's a little girl inside?

108
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,664
Finally, you're really in love.

109
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,418
Don't you just love this song?

110
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,255
-You really like this song?
-Mmm.

111
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:13,052
♪ It screams out
For the whole world to hear ♪

112
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,891
♪ Why am I hearing it now? ♪

113
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,647
♪ And finally, we've met ♪

114
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:30,194
Don't you love that part,
"And finally, we've met"?

115
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,530
There's always a chance.

116
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,241
When it comes to lawsuits,
nothing is guaranteed.

117
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,577
I don't think you need to move first

118
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,495
and pay the court deposit.

119
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,832
Let me know what stance
the other side takes, okay?

120
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:46,877
NAM KANG-HO

121
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,880
-Hi.
-Did you have lunch yet?

122
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,923
Mmm!

123
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,305
-What did you eat?
-Doenjang-jjigae.

124
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,141
Oh, doenjang-jjigae, huh?

125
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:05,688
Did I just… talk like a… baby?

126
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,943
So are you done yet?

127
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,781
My dad was rich, and my mom was poor.

128
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,659
He loved her,
but maybe Mom only cared about money.

129
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,207
We were a… very happy family
until my mom took me to America.

130
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,377
But after my dad's business failed,
we returned to Korea.

131
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,177
I've never seen
my mom comfort my dad once.

132
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,846
He always felt guilty that he was broke.

133
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,851
Then he passed away
from a car accident suddenly,

134
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,562
and I had a stepdad
in less than two years.

135
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,897
He was very rich.

136
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,278
I swore to myself that I'd never end up
with a woman like that,

137
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,448
but I failed in my first love
in a very similar way.

138
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,005
It must have been hard.

139
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,680
I also have something to share.

140
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:25,518
My recent ex-boyfriend
is Attorney Lee Jin-suh at the firm.

141
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,021
I needed a job, so I was asking around.

142
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,524
And every other firm told me no.

143
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,111
I really needed the money,
so I couldn't walk away.

144
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,408
We're just coworkers,
and we're keeping everything cordial.

145
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,035
Don't worry.

146
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,579
Well, I'm also working with Oh Se-na.

147
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,873
We even did scene 94 yesterday.

148
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,710
Ah.

149
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,462
What? You know about it?

150
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,798
I do. The motel scene.

151
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,717
I remember things like that.

152
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,219
I didn't think
you'd remember that kind of thing.

153
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,762
I know, right?

154
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,974
I can baby-talk and get jealous too.

155
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,768
Oh, that's right.

156
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,311
That was cute.

157
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,439
Doenjang-jjigae.

158
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,566
Stop it.

159
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,152
 Doenjang-jjigae?

160
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,361
Stop it!

161
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,113
-Why?
-Stop it!

162
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,781
-Why?
-Stop it! Stop saying that!

163
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,283
-Say it again.
-Ah! Hey!

164
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,244
-I'm never gonna say that again!
-Then say something else.

165
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,829
Kimchi-jjigae.

166
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,080
Hey!

167
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,583
"Hey"?

168
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,087
Does it hurt?

169
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,298
Know what? I liked it.

170
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,760
-My turn.
-Ah!

171
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,845
-Why, you!
-And this side too.

172
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,475
-Now the neck. Now the neck.
-No. No, no, no. No, no!

173
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,646
I'm gonna bite you in the face.

174
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,190
You're wanna bite me, huh?

175
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,275
I know you do.

176
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,201
I have to be up for work.

177
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,205
I should really get going.

178
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,583
I have to go to work.

179
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,588
-What's that?
-Breakfast.

180
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,348
You really like me, huh?

181
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,142
What time do you get off work?

182
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,894
Aren't you tired?

183
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,068
Hey,
why don't you take a day off?

184
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,320
You look really exhausted.

185
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,239
The more I try to rest,

186
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,658
the more tired I get.

187
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,671
There must be a beast inside me.

188
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,340
I crave seeing her every hour

189
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,342
and every day.

190
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,350
Since they're dating,

191
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,978
inevitably, we'd run into each other too.

192
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,772
So I'm gonna get this off my chest now.

193
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:21,110
Honestly, I really found
myself falling for you.

194
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,195
But you're way out of my league,

195
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,948
so I know
that it'll never work between us.

196
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,284
So please, help me get over you.

197
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,202
Help me find my inner peace.

198
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,954
-Inner peace?
-Yes.

199
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,040
I just need you to be quiet for a second
and hear me out.

200
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,001
Once I reveal how pathetic I am,

201
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,170
I don't think I'll be all that worried
about impressing you again.

202
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,467
Honestly, I'm a little broke.
I have a 50-million bank loan--

203
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,304
Oh.
I just thought you were frugal.

204
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,890
When Mi-ran and I moved in together,

205
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,602
we pooled our savings together,
and I still had to take out a big loan.

206
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,146
There are fewer flights,
so my income was low.

207
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:01,108
And there was a guy who swindled
my savings without paying it back.

208
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,778
Come to think of it, I guess
I lent him, like, three million? Or more?

209
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,365
-I also lost smaller sums to others.
-Wow, you dated men like that?

210
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,118
Yeah. I'm not the best
at picking decent men.

211
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,538
-I tend to fall for the handsome ones.
-Ah.

212
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,707
And I have a bad habit when I'm drunk.

213
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,043
I'd call them
and make a pathetic fool out of myself,

214
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,462
crying and asking them,
"How could you do what you do?"

215
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,923
Oh, you were heartbroken,
so that's totally understandable.

216
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:24,840
Please don't.

217
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,635
I don't need such kind words from you.

218
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,512
Anyway, thank you for coming today.

219
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,764
I appreciate it.

220
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,683
Whoa, whoa. Wait. W… wait a minute.

221
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,936
You can't just spill
all those embarrassing secrets

222
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,395
about yourself and leave.

223
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,731
It makes me feel really bad, you know?

224
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,274
Please, sit.

225
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,820
I'm quite pathetic myself.

226
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,197
If you hear my stories,

227
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,950
it might help you a lot
with finding your inner peace.

228
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:51,909
No, no.

229
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,746
Then we'd be equal,
and I would just fall for you.

230
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,290
You're supposed
to crush my hopes altogether.

231
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,960
Jeez.

232
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,380
Wow, birds of a feather flock together.

233
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,590
You yourself are
just as much of an oddball as Ms. Yeo.

234
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,385
-Are you speaking ill of Mi-ran now?
-No, no, no.

235
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,637
I just find you amusing.

236
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,265
When I said "oddball,"
that was a good thing.

237
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,852
Well, then, I guess the four of us
going on trips and hanging out

238
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,187
is a done deal?

239
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,814
I would say so.

240
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,610
Brief meetings, we could do,
but I'm not so sure about trips.

241
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,654
You three can go.

242
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,240
You want me to tag along
like a third wheel?

243
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,951
By myself? I'll look stupid.

244
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,120
Oh, I guess that would kinda suck.

245
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,414
I mean, why did you
have to fall for me, huh?

246
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,083
Look what you did
to mess things up like this. Gosh.

247
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,961
What, did you think it'd be fun
if I went along with you all?

248
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,921
Yeah.

249
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:50,801
Now, no. Stop saying things like that.
Thank you so much for your time today.

250
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,678
You have a nice day.

251
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,729
Why are you so mad, dude?

252
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,940
Is it because
the four of us can't hang out?

253
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,486
Oh, where did that file go?

254
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:17,870
Thanks a lot.

255
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,706
Oh, coffee.

256
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,916
I'm gonna get some coffee. Anyone?

257
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,258
-Huh.
-Hey. She scares me. What's going on?

258
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,926
Huh.

259
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,140
Coffee?

260
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,351
I've always said people don't change,
but I guess I was wrong.

261
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,728
You seem so different these days.

262
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,605
Are you mad about it?

263
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,106
No, it's not that.

264
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,067
It's creepy, honestly.

265
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,570
The other guys are spooked too.

266
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,823
Do you wanna grab a drink later?

267
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,494
It's all thanks to you.
I owe you a nice meal.

268
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,746
Oh, look at you!
I didn't do much.

269
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,540
But you think buying me dinner is enough?

270
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:10,923
Where's mine?

271
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,301
So you don't have hands now?
Two left feet too, huh?

272
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,182
You can get your own glass.
I believe in you.

273
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,477
So, did you have a bad day today?

274
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,689
Oh, come on,
it's not like I'm taking it out on you

275
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,358
because I had a bad day.

276
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,069
I just think that you should handle
more of your things yourself.

277
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,863
And by the way, I don't wanna pretend
to be female role anymore!

278
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,950
Plus I hated
the romance genre more than you did!

279
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,370
It was so disgusting that I nearly puked,
but I endured it for you.

280
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,205
Hey, puking's a bit much.

281
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,125
Man, look how easily
you overcame that condition.

282
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,211
You had me suffer all this time
with that stupid condition of yours.

283
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,922
Hey, if you could pull off
a kiss with Se-na,

284
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,341
then you could do it
with just about any actress.

285
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:58,053
-Am I right to say that?
-Honestly… it's a mystery.

286
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,224
It's not like I suddenly find Se-na
or other women more likable.

287
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,185
It feels like something inside

288
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,855
was once frozen and now thawed.

289
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,649
Well, that must be
what being cured feels like.

290
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,445
-Are you happy at least?
-Yeah.

291
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,825
That's good then. Finally, that's
a huge load off my shoulders, truly.

292
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,915
Oh. She's here already?

293
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,626
Who?

294
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,092
I apologize.

295
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,678
Out of desperation, I joined this firm,

296
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,306
made you uncomfortable,
and took a client from you.

297
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,600
You didn't take away my client.

298
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,020
Choi Soo-jin was already gonna pick
someone else to represent her.

299
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,564
There were other things, not just that.

300
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,525
I know that there were times
that I made you feel like a loser.

301
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,526
So you know.

302
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,529
"Someone like you means nothing to me."

303
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,990
"Men like you are a dime a dozen."

304
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,617
That kinda thing?

305
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,702
Did you do it on purpose?

306
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,414
I can't say
it wasn't on purpose.

307
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,250
But it wasn't just to you alone.

308
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,170
I know. All the guys
that dated you from law school…

309
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:18,008
You know what? Huh.
They were all two-timing cheaters.

310
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,428
I knew you were
double, triple cheating on me.

311
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,013
Hold on. Wait a minute.

312
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,724
Did you date those types of guys
on purpose? To punish them?

313
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,227
Cheating types are easier to seduce,

314
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,647
fun to hang out with,
and they're easier to let go.

315
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,067
Whoa. I was dating
a terrifying woman then, huh?

316
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,819
So even though you weren't into them,
you dated them

317
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,280
so you could break their hearts?
Am I right?

318
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,783
To those guys, dating is just like a game.

319
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,785
And I was just playing it.

320
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,412
I'm a big fan of the saying,
"An eye for an eye."

321
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,872
I live my life that way.

322
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,000
These men have no empathy,
so I had to make them learn it.

323
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,752
The only way they know what they've done.

324
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,630
So Nam Kang-ho is
another one of those to you, huh?

325
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,007
He's not.

326
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,842
You know, a good person…

327
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,471
…isn't someone who's just nice.

328
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,474
It's someone who can inspire
others around them to be nice.

329
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,434
Nam Kang-ho, a good person?

330
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,852
That's what I think.

331
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,896
He's turning me into a nice person.

332
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,232
I'll tell you.

333
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,485
If you really wanna thank me,
then throw me a surprise party.

334
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,736
-A fun one!
-A party?

335
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,781
Look at the mess you're in right now.
You still wanna party?

336
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,867
Oh, that's why I'm asking
Nam Kang-ho to host it.

337
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,246
He will throw a party
and invite me to be there

338
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,580
in all of my glory.

339
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:36,044
We didn't do anything for Christmas.
I don't wanna spend the holidays alone.

340
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,421
Depressing.

341
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,593
Oh, can't you just stay quiet
for a little while?

342
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,680
Just stay depressed for a while, then.

343
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,766
I've seen you get
irritated and angry plenty of times,

344
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,227
but I've never actually seen
you get depressed.

345
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,770
It'll help you act too.

346
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,398
Help me act? So I'm not a priority?

347
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,025
Hey, what's up with him today?

348
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:03,363
I think he's stressed-out because of me.
I gave him a lot of headaches.

349
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,614
Wait.

350
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,117
Something's going on here.

351
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,663
Are you irritated
'cause Kang-ho has a girlfriend?

352
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,208
And why isn't Mi-ran here?
Shouldn't she be on her way?

353
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,210
No. She and her friend went out.

354
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,344
There were a lot of times
when you were nice when we dated.

355
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,471
You paid for expensive meals

356
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,556
and let me pay for cheap ones.

357
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,435
Let's go. I'll take you home.

358
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,103
Taxi!

359
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,816
That was the first time
I ever went to a hotel with another woman.

360
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,071
Damn it. Stop lying, you idiot.
You know I can tell when you lie, right?

361
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,239
-Hm?
-Gosh, seriously.

362
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,199
How did you know?

363
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,368
You're a psychic.

364
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,245
-Huh?
-All right, I'm sorry!

365
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,916
Just forget this guy
who lies all the time.

366
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,211
Have a… nice life.

367
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,670
Where are you going?

368
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,341
-Yeah? What's up?
-Are you still out?

369
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,928
Hey. Come on, stand up.

370
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,722
-No cab will take you like this.
-Get Lee Jin-suh on the phone.

371
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,809
He's in no shape to talk. Don't worry,
I'll get a cab to take him back.

372
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,353
Oh, just forget about me and go.

373
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,313
A grown man
doesn't need help getting home.

374
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,231
Wait there.

375
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,734
Something urgent has come up.

376
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,612
Make yourself at home.
All the drinks are in there.

377
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,161
He's totally my type.
I had no idea. Truly, I had no idea.

378
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,454
Who knew? Wow!

379
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,209
You boys are so silly.

380
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,713
-Hey.
-What?

381
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:47,092
What goes on in the mind
of a woman who rejects you

382
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,052
when it hasn't even occurred to you

383
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,972
that you might want
to ask her out at some point in time?

384
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,890
Is she literally rejecting you,

385
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,643
or is that her way
of telling you that she's interested?

386
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,186
Were you rejected, Mr. Do?

387
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,312
Yeah.

388
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:03,984
She said that it's impossible between us.
And I was just sitting there, you know?

389
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,403
-She said that all on her own.
-So who is she?

390
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,864
Oh, you don't know her.
We met not long ago.

391
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,117
Mmm. So it's someone I don't know.

392
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,452
Mm-hm.

393
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,663
Wow, that's really intriguing.

394
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,291
So what girl
was able to woo you like that?

395
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,085
What?

396
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,380
It's obvious that you're annoyed
because she's rejected you.

397
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,426
Just a moment.

398
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,554
Jin-suh.

399
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,056
-Let's go. The cab's here.
-Oh, taxi.

400
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,101
Oh no! Wait, don't go!

401
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,854
-I'll report you! You watch out!
-Watch out!

402
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,898
This is killing me.

403
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,401
Huh? Why are you here?

404
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,321
I only told you on the phone
where we were because you asked.

405
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,989
You didn't have to do that.

406
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,951
I got him. I'll hold him.

407
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,370
-You go get the cab.
-Okay.

408
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,039
Oh, no. I'm fine.

409
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,500
Go.

410
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,127
God bless.

411
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:11,176
Impressive. What a sight to see
you taking care of your ex-boyfriend

412
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,011
in front of your current one.

413
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:13,929
Are you mad?

414
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,723
Are you asking why I'm mad
like there's no reason for me to be?

415
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:20,227
Hey!
I'm staying out this late with my ex,

416
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,938
so you have a right to be upset.

417
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,774
And hey, I'm sorry if I upset you, hm?

418
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,026
What's wrong with him?

419
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,861
-Hey!
-What is wrong with you?

420
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,198
-Yeah, I'm okay.
-He's so annoying.

421
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,870
What's your home address?
I need you to help me out.

422
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,081
It's Seodaemun-gu, Hongeun-dong.

423
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,874
No, that's where I lived.

424
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,336
Your house is in Sadang-dong.

425
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,131
Ah, you still remember my address, huh?

426
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,845
So, um, I feel really, really bad.

427
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,807
It's just I should probably make sure
he gets home okay.

428
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,351
He almost froze to death
on the streets last winter.

429
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,478
Let's get a cab.

430
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,854
Let's get you-- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

431
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,774
All right. Okay, okay. Shit.

432
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,611
-Why are you getting in?
-You can go home now, Ms. Yeo.

433
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,951
Would you look at that?

434
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:25,208
If… I never cheated on you…

435
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,503
…would we still be together?

436
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,713
Hm.

437
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,922
Absolutely not.

438
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,257
Huh?

439
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,844
You're right.

440
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:40,515
You didn't go out with me
because you liked me in the first place.

441
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,643
You didn't like any of the guys you dated.

442
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,819
But I still…

443
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,031
liked you a lot.

444
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,829
Shit.

445
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:03,830
Yep.

446
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,250
I should congratulate you.

447
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:12,172
Mi-ran, now that you have met
a guy you truly like,

448
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,715
I wish you happiness.

449
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,683
I guess the four of us
going on trips and hanging out

450
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,934
is a done deal?

451
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,936
So why can't we do that?

452
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,272
Even Mi-ran and Nam Kang-ho are dating.

453
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,614
CEO DO WON-JUN

454
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:41,034
Why is he calling me? Why?
Oh, I thought I explained everything.

455
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,453
Oh, please don't do this.

456
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,415
Well, hello.

457
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,918
This is Do Won-jun.

458
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,170
Ah, yeah.

459
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,839
I have some questions I wanna ask you.

460
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,925
I'm outside your place right now.

461
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,094
Are you not home?

462
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,055
Ah, no, I just got back.

463
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,434
Okay.

464
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,978
Uh, I'll be right there.

465
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,188
I just need a minute.

466
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,369
Oh, why is he doing that?

467
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,425
Is it something
you couldn't ask over the phone?

468
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,719
You also showed up
and rejected me in person

469
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,596
when you absolutely could have done it
over the phone.

470
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,183
Uh, that was, uh,
'cause I had a lot I wanted to say to you.

471
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:52,147
What I'm about to ask you tonight…
is better discussed in person as well.

472
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,251
So what do you need to know?

473
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,212
Can you tell me,
of all the men you've met so far,

474
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,924
is there anyone
you can't seem to get over?

475
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,802
Is there someone that you'd like to try…

476
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,554
…maybe going back to?

477
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,681
Gosh, no!

478
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:30,310
If anything, I wanna stop
any woman from dating them.

479
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,354
I wanna tell them not to be fooled
by their looks and to leave them alone.

480
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,355
Right?

481
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,940
Since you had that experience,

482
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,068
you're thinking that I'm probably
no different from the other guys, huh?

483
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,113
Well, don't you think so?

484
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,869
This is coming out
all wrong again, damn it. Gosh.

485
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,455
Okay. You're right.

486
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:54,667
It is true that I've always been
kind of popular among the ladies.

487
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,961
But you treat me
like I'm on a whole nother level.

488
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,588
Is that how you think of me?

489
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,966
And to talk about
who's out of whose league,

490
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,468
that made me uncomfortable.

491
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,931
I mean, there's nothing wrong with you.
What's your problem, anyway!

492
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,975
Are you here to ask questions,
or are you just gonna scold?

493
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,560
Oh no.

494
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,021
Uh, I didn't mean to yell.

495
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:18,149
I thought I've made it quite clear.

496
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,901
So why did you call me so late at night,

497
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,861
start being all sweet,
and then take me out?

498
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,740
That was sweet to you? I didn't say that
to make myself look like a sweet guy.

499
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,783
So what, then?

500
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,369
"Just go out with me.
Everything'll be great."

501
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,496
So you took me here to ask me out?

502
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,664
Huh?

503
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,252
Uh…

504
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,295
So what I'm trying to say is,

505
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,382
you're a fine woman
who can date anybody that you want to,

506
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,424
literally anybody.

507
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,219
And I think
you're being too harsh on yourself.

508
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,347
The fact that you met
all those unworthy men before?

509
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,183
That's 'cause you just have a pure heart.

510
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,520
Being wary of men
because of your past experiences

511
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:59,274
will ultimately…
…um, make you really miserable.

512
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,068
Oh gosh.

513
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,654
-Oh, what's wrong with you, huh?
-What did I do?

514
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,615
Is the cat now worried for the mouse?

515
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,536
A mouse will go on to date another mouse,
so stop it already and go away!

516
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,585
Was I being sweet again?

517
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:32,056
I'm sorry. Why did you put yourself
through all that trouble?

518
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,641
I could have taken care of it.

519
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,644
You take asshole home like this
when you were together?

520
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,645
Uh-huh.

521
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,480
Uh, I mean…

522
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,275
I would.

523
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,697
So you did it every time, huh?

524
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,991
Wow, the two of you are really a lot.

525
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,328
I mean, now I gotta give you a ride
'cause you're here!

526
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,122
No, you don't have to do that.

527
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,792
-I don't have to go.
-Oh yeah? You're not working?

528
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,003
Tomorrow, I'll be on set,

529
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:02,962
so it's all good.

530
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,010
So you're good, yeah?

531
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,929
You feeling better that I'm staying?

532
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,516
-I was never angry with you.
-Oh yeah? Then I'll go now.

533
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,809
Hm! Good night!

534
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,062
Hey!

535
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,480
Yeah?

536
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,564
Are you serious?

537
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,149
Come over here.

538
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:26,194
You said you weren't mad,
so why would I stay here with you?

539
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,198
See? Look at this.
Now you're mad 'cause I wanna go.

540
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,617
Okay, fine then. I'm angry!

541
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,664
Oh, what's the matter?

542
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,875
-Uh?
-Hey!

543
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,877
Aw, come here.

544
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,171
Huh? Wait!

545
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,422
Wait, wait.

546
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,508
We have a shoot in the morning.

547
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:49,968
I'll be quick.

548
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,512
-Oh, wait. What are you saying?
-Oh!

549
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,722
We have a shoot tomorrow.

550
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,600
Better tap out.

551
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,358
Hold on. Ah!

552
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,318
I said no.

553
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,782
Okay. I give up. I give up.

554
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,661
I don't want it.

555
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,956
Not anymore. Let's just sleep.

556
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,165
I'm not an animal.

557
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,377
Oh, let's just sleep.

558
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,631
Oh, I won't do it.
I promise. Let's just sleep.

559
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:31,801
Hey.

560
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,428
I love you.

561
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,857
I said, I love you.

562
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,807
Come on!

563
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,546
Okay, this is the last scene!

564
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,964
Everyone hang in there!

565
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,132
Well, all right.

566
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,871
You're not a killer.

567
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,330
I'll testify.

568
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,708
I'll tell them
you aren't the killer!

569
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,968
It's not as thrilling as I thought.

570
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,139
It's like killing a bug.

571
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,458
I'm not dead.

572
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,710
Huh?

573
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,004
I think I'm gonna be okay.

574
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,589
Cut! Wow, good job!

575
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,723
Great work, everybody.

576
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,145
Let's toast to the movie Shadow.

577
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,606
We're done!

578
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,150
Oh yeah, great job. Well-done.

579
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,694
Good work. Thank you.

580
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,448
-Good work.
-Great job.

581
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,367
-Good work.
-Thank you.

582
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,454
Whoo!

583
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,040
Whoo!

584
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,750
-Look at her!
-What's she up to?

585
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,794
-Ha!
- Hey, don't point it at me!

586
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,213
I could light up
this whole place.

587
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,632
Here. So our backs
are touching now, right?

588
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,884
I'm going to throw my foot back
and hit him in the skull.

589
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,177
Nah.

590
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,888
-You think I won't? You think I won't?
-Show us.

591
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,974
-Go ahead
-One, two, three!

592
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,687
How'd you do that?

593
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,323
You know, you did well.

594
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,410
You have something to tell me, right?

595
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:54,332
I'm not sure that we'll get
another chance for us to talk.

596
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,752
So go ahead. What do you wanna tell me?

597
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,463
So we're really over.

598
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,843
-You've no ill feelings towards me.
-We were over a long time ago.

599
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,762
This isn't anything new.

600
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,591
-Don't you have tissues?
-Use this to blow your nose.

601
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,968
No. That's not a tissue.

602
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,987
You know, back in the day,

603
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,907
you were nice to a fault.

604
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,993
That's why I took you lightly.

605
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:17,248
I thought you'd like me again
if I gave you another chance.

606
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,501
Won-jun told me

607
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,796
that I was the worst woman
in your entire life.

608
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,091
Now I've become
even worse than that.

609
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,301
That's not it.

610
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,471
You never took me lightly.

611
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,935
But you did let me go.

612
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,147
And for that, I'm grateful.

613
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,782
You leaving like that
actually helped me in a way.

614
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,454
I was so envious
after seeing you making it big,

615
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,748
so I promised myself I would too.

616
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,172
After the first movie became recognized,

617
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,466
I was actually scared.

618
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,803
I suddenly had unlimited opportunities.

619
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:17,558
I had to prove that my first success
wasn't just out of pure luck.

620
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,687
And I tried to be the best…

621
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,148
…in the next project
and the one after that too.

622
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,236
It was a really tough time for me.

623
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,367
And every night, I couldn't fall asleep.

624
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,498
Even when I was dating
impressive men…

625
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,374
…I felt like something was missing.

626
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,463
I still didn't know
it was love that I was missing.

627
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,550
And then I saw you on TV one day,
and I realized…

628
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:55,054
…"Ah, work isn't everything."

629
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,388
"There's more to it."

630
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,769
I thought to myself,

631
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,522
I could stop my obsession with success

632
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,442
if I was able
to get back together with you.

633
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,369
I really miss what we had.

634
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,122
Yearning and memories, that is not love.

635
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,711
You love a person.

636
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,549
I'm sure you'll find
the right one for you next time.

637
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,011
Let me know if you find someone like that.

638
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:41,559
I'll be hosting a party this weekend.
You should come and look for one.

639
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,435
You're hosting a party?

640
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:44,937
For what?

641
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,024
A good friend of my girlfriend
has asked me to host one, so…

642
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,610
A party? You?

643
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,285
Hey, come with me, please?

644
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,663
No. I don't have nice clothes.

645
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,165
I don't wanna look pathetic
around everyone.

646
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,126
It's not like
you're competing with actresses.

647
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,837
Come with me, have some food,
and maybe you'll find yourself a guy.

648
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,548
Forget it. I've given up on handsome men.

649
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,093
Do Won-jun got you down?

650
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,470
You don't wanna see him
out there mingling?

651
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,265
Oh, I don't care
whether he's mingling or not.

652
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,434
Oh, stop annoying me and just go.

653
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,687
Oh jeez.

654
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,357
-You want me to bring you some snacks?
-Mm-hm.

655
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,747
CEO DO WON-JUN
DELETE CONTACT

656
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,093
Have you been well?

657
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,970
-Oh, absolutely.
-Yes, of course.

658
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,388
Thank you for inviting us.

659
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,140
Oh, you're welcome. Thank you for coming.

660
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,309
-Please, enjoy yourselves.
-Thanks.

661
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,311
Oh, welcome.

662
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,522
Oh, you look so amazing.
You haven't aged at all.

663
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:14,943
Wow, did Nam Kang-ho
just compliment a female actor?

664
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,112
You've changed quite a bit,
even hosting a party.

665
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:21,158
When they're in love, people change.
Even more so when they're married. Hm.

666
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,201
One night!

667
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,537
-What?
-Oh, no, that's not it. One night!

668
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,206
Two days!

669
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,876
You have a girlfriend?
Who is she? Is she here right now?

670
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,883
Whoa! Where did you learn how to do this?

671
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,469
Back in the day,
I had a friend who was a DJ.

672
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,138
-Did you two go out?
-Yeah.

673
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,350
Ah. Don't you worry about it.
I won't tell Kang-ho.

674
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,811
Oh, don't worry. It's not a secret.

675
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,020
Love that.

676
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,606
Woot woot!

677
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,984
I saw you on TV.
Your singing is incredible.

678
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,113
I've refined my skills since, uh,

679
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,281
we used to… …karaoke all the time.

680
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,201
I would sing, and you would dance.

681
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,789
Man, I don't think
that I've ever gone back

682
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,666
to a karaoke bar since then.

683
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,836
Oh, since we broke up, I haven't heard
that you had another girlfriend.

684
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,087
Haven't had one since.

685
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,007
Why don't you have one?
You holding out for someone?

686
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,261
To be honest,

687
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,888
I think I am.

688
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,523
-So is it packed there?
-Yeah, lots of people. A lot.

689
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,191
Ah, that's a good thing.

690
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,568
Mmm, can't wait.

691
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,904
So why don't you make
your entrance? You're the special guest.

692
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:47,035
You look lonely.
You know, it's really dangerous

693
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,496
for a handsome man
like yourself to look lonely.

694
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,420
Oh!

695
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,505
It's been a minute. How are you doing?

696
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,631
Yeah.

697
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,178
Wow! You're on a hot streak these days.

698
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,345
It's great. Congrats.

699
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,847
Thanks a lot.

700
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,808
Hi there.

701
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,311
Huh.

702
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,146
Hello.

703
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:19,067
Hey, I heard
that you and Nam Kang-ho don't get along.

704
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:22,154
Isn't it the same for you? You guys
didn't even say hi at the wrap party.

705
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:25,699
-How are you doing?
-I'm fine. How about you?

706
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,910
Honestly, I didn't think
you'd invite us to your party.

707
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,661
Oh, thank you for coming.

708
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:33,123
I've been wanting to get a chance
to apologize to the both of you.

709
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,003
Hey!

710
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,048
I told you to stay out of my view.

711
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,382
You're breaking my focus!

712
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,051
Hey, cut, cut!

713
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,304
If you're gonna throw a tantrum,

714
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,807
at least you should know how to act.

715
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,768
I apologize for what I did.

716
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,895
I was rude and presumptuous.

717
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,607
And Ji-eun, I was really harsh
to you too, wasn't I?

718
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,150
I'm really sorry for that.

719
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,654
I bought it because I needed it
for the show. It's a prop!

720
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,197
All the other shows reimburse me.

721
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,243
Are you a beggar?

722
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,202
What did you say?

723
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,412
-Let's have a drink later.
-Okay.

724
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,500
What's up with him?
Is he terminally ill, you think?

725
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,462
Hey there. What are you doing up here?

726
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:26,426
Didn't you see me when I came in?
I was like Moses parting the Red Sea.

727
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,137
Everyone split up and…
…to avoid me.

728
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,182
In the past, I treated them
to so many meals.

729
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,643
Once they heard the rumor
of my divorce from having an affair,

730
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,145
no one reached out to me,
so…

731
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,731
I thought there has to be
at least a few who'd be glad to see me,

732
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,358
and now…

733
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,862
…they're all afraid to be
even in the same photo as me.

734
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,739
This is the harsh, cold, cold world
we live in today!

735
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,741
Well, at least allow me to…

736
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:53,287
No, Mi-ran needs you to be here.
She doesn't know anyone else.

737
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,915
Oh, I'm totally fine on my own.
Even better with you.

738
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:01,628
Come on, let's not sit here like this.
How about we go have some fun over there?

739
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,006
I saw a lot of fun things.

740
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:04,923
Over there?

741
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,633
Just come with me.

742
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,720
Okay.

743
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:10,804
Bye.

744
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,057
What? Is it something bad?

745
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,727
Depending on how you take it,
it could be good.

746
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,437
Or it could be bad.

747
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,357
You're beating around the bush.
Must be something I wouldn't like to hear.

748
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,358
Grace…

749
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,195
we could be friends for life.

750
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,616
Would you like that?

751
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,203
With the emphasis
on "friends" or on "life"?

752
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,247
Friends.

753
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,541
You seeing someone?

754
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,085
You said before
that we should just get married

755
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,004
if none of these relationships work.

756
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:50,052
I don't want you waiting…
and wasting more of your time.

757
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,638
I'd rather hear you just say
you found someone.

758
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,057
If there's really nothing going on,

759
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,517
it means you just don't wanna
go through with this.

760
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,186
That's not what this is about.

761
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,271
It's just better for everyone.

762
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:06,026
So, for you to be like this…
you do have someone then.

763
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,237
Sure, okay.

764
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,824
I wouldn't wanna throw away
15 years of our friendship.

765
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,661
But I'm not sure
if we could still be good friends.

766
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,752
-Go for it!
-Yeah!

767
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,505
Oh! Oh no!

768
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,883
-Okay.
-Again.

769
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,056
Let's go again.

770
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,191
What?

771
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,615
Sang-sup, have a smoke for me?

772
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:55,826
It's just, um…

773
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,203
You should see this.

774
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,547
-Wow.
-I knew it.

775
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,805
Ooh!

776
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,393
Hey, look at this.

777
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:24,813
SHOCKING LIFE OF NAM KANG-HO'S GIRLFRIEND!

778
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,110
Oof!

779
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,404
Everybody knows her here at this club.

780
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,781
She's really a master pickup artist.

781
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,826
She even hooked up with a guy she met here

782
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,537
while she was still dating her boyfriend.

783
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,373
She thinks nothing
of having one-night stands.

784
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,374
Ooh!

785
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,711
I think
she thinks of it like some kind of a game.

786
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,755
-My gosh. Whoa.
-Huh? What?

787
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,132
When I saw
that Nam Kang-ho's girlfriend's a lawyer,

788
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,760
I thought it could be her,
but that's none of my business.

789
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,512
Wow! If this is indeed true,

790
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:58,889
it's really shocking.

791
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:02,309
Would Nam Kang-ho
have known this about his girlfriend?

792
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,395
Come on, who
would knowingly date a woman like this?

793
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,397
But what if it's just a fling?

794
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,774
Whoa!

795
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,650
Yay!

796
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,360
-Wow!
-How amazing!

797
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,820
So good.

798
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,363
-I did good, right?
-Yes, as always.

799
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,698
Yes!

800
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,325
Oh!

801
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,994
It's Na-eun. Just a second.

802
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,538
Hm?

803
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,672
Doesn't it feel
like something's wrong here?

804
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,424
Yes, it does.

805
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:35,926
Hm?
