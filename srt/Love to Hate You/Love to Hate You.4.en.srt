1
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,854
♪ Love to hate you ♪

2
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,580
Are you okay, Kang-ho?

3
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:39,956
Oh, can I help?

4
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,545
Are you not into me anymore?

5
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:47,881
What?

6
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,764
Are you not into me?

7
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,019
Uh…

8
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,605
Oh, I don't know. It's not that.

9
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,774
You told me to fight you.

10
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,072
Have a seat for a second.

11
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,203
Where have you been going around
fighting like that?

12
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,456
I wasn't going around fighting.
I've just worked a couple cases.

13
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,250
For example,
tracking a swindler and fending off thugs.

14
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,376
Ah.

15
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,254
So that's why your moves
seemed a little bit…

16
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,758
Oh, everyone fights dirty.
There's no rules.

17
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,886
No, what I'm saying is,
I really like the way you fight.

18
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,388
A dirty street-fighting style
can't be learned from a textbook.

19
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,682
That's the vibe I need right now.

20
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,685
So, would you be interested
in training me to fight like you?

21
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,145
Huh?

22
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,315
Instead of doing what I say,
just act like you're beating up some thug

23
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,485
and throw your kicks
and punches all like… or whatever.

24
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,448
If you decide you wanna do it,
I'll pay you as much as you want.

25
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,452
Talk about a stroke of luck.

26
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,913
I get paid to beat up this jerk?

27
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,625
Sounds like we have a deal.

28
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,463
No photos allowed, please.

29
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,883
Oh, of course not.
I'd never try to sneak a picture.

30
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,137
That'd be worse
than tripping me for sure.

31
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,556
You accepted my apology, and still you…

32
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,559
Wait, you're not just doing this
to beat me up, right?

33
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,395
-That's ridiculous.
-Hmm.

34
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,605
For a lawyer,
you have quite the imagination.

35
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,829
I guess you wouldn't get swindled
that easily since you're a lawyer.

36
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,373
As long as I'm careful around men,
it's not an issue.

37
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,375
Eighty percent of inmates
are men, after all.

38
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,884
So, I have entered
the tiger's den.

39
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,181
Should I install a hacking app?
Mmm, no, no.

40
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,184
I have to find out
that girl's number, though.

41
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,313
Here.

42
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,317
The first portion
is a standard contract agreement.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,153
You just have to review
the bottom portion and the second page.

44
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,946
Hourly rate is
the standard attorney's fee,

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,531
plus 10,000 extra for hazard pay.

46
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,825
Ten-thousand? That's too cheap.

47
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,743
Make it 50.

48
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,995
Fifty-thousand? P… per hour?

49
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,705
I'll be hitting a woman,
so I'd feel better

50
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,582
if the hazard pay was at least that much.

51
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,792
Well, if you that's
what you want…

52
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,880
"Expenses for treating injuries sustained
during training will be self-handled"?

53
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,133
Why? That's usually
the employer's responsibility, isn't it?

54
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,221
And what if I intentionally hurt myself
to take a lot of money from you?

55
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,973
In this case, I'm serving
as both the contracted party

56
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:44,974
as well as your lawyer.

57
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,227
So I made the wording
more favorable to you.

58
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,979
This whole work-life balance thing
is interesting.

59
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,898
Seems like you have
a pretty good grasp on it.

60
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,192
Well, it's not complicated, actually.

61
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,487
I'm teaching you some
of my moves part-time, and that's great,

62
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,405
but I'll be your lawyer first.

63
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,955
So… anything you want to change?

64
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,208
Uh, no. I'm just impressed
at how thorough you are.

65
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,542
I appreciate it.

66
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,089
I'm sorry.
I feel l may have been too harsh on you.

67
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,759
It's only because of fans like you
that I get to be who I am.

68
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,928
No way.

69
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,847
For what I've done to you,
this is what I deserve.

70
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,477
I look forward to working
with you very much,

71
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,729
as my lawyer and

72
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,107
master.

73
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,734
I, as well.

74
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,945
Hm! You're mine now.

75
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,532
YOU ARE NOT WHAT I EXPECTED

76
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,617
Too tight. Ah!

77
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,994
GILMU LAW CORPORATION

78
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,704
A training partner?

79
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,957
During the incident with his fans,
I was able to show him a move or two,

80
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,127
including throwing a boomerang
and totally catching it.

81
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,086
Yah!

82
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,469
Pretty basic stuff, really.

83
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,309
I said I could do things like that too.

84
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,811
I also told him I could be
his bodyguard if he really wanted.

85
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,937
Incorrect.

86
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,149
-Huh?
-Once it settled down, you should've left.

87
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,777
What was the point
of all that?

88
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,948
And Nam Kang-ho's not far off,
opting for you over a pro like that.

89
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,034
You two are quite the pair!

90
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,912
Pardon me, but I only agreed
because you said to cater

91
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,039
to the clients' every need.

92
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,333
So if you don't want me to,
then I'll tell him I can't.

93
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,711
You said that he asked about it,
and you said that you'd do it.

94
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,171
Now you wanna back out of it?

95
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,508
Just be on your guard from now on.

96
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,761
And remember, it's okay
if he oversteps things,

97
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,721
but you respect the boundaries.

98
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,183
If a celebrity's privacy
is jeopardized at all,

99
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,060
there's a penalty
of three times your salary.

100
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,145
Same goes for causing
a ripple in their private life.

101
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,106
-Ripple?
-A scandal, come on!

102
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,443
If you were unattractive,
there wouldn't be any concern,

103
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,694
but you're pretty.

104
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,614
If, by any chance, something does happen,

105
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,158
we'll have no choice
but to support his side.

106
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,495
If he finds it uncomfortable, we'll have
no choice but to let you go immediately.

107
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,497
Mmm-kay?

108
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,082
Yes.

109
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,605
You can tell
he's well-educated.

110
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,150
Obviously. He's put in a lot
of extra practice to be this good.

111
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,945
He'll be
an action star soon enough.

112
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,783
Yeah, it's still
really textbook right now.

113
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,202
Like a special forces soldier

114
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,079
or Presidential Secret Service.

115
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,997
Needs to be rougher about it.

116
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,376
-Like what you see in a back alley.
-Not like that.

117
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,211
Man, that's not it.

118
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,171
He knows it too. But I wonder…

119
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,383
Mr. Yoo, I wanna talk to you.
Can I come by later?

120
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,927
It's probably better to stay here
and keep training, you think?

121
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,347
I'm not done yet.
I'm gonna train with a real thug.

122
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,308
Wait, you actually invited her
into your house?

123
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,061
Are you out of your mind, man?
She's a woman.

124
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,896
How much fighting experience
could she have?

125
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,606
Oh, she's the real deal.

126
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,525
She took me down easily.

127
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,485
Are you listening to yourself right now?

128
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,529
I mean, for all you know,

129
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,865
she could have planted wire taps
and recording devices

130
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,825
all over your house, man.
You think about that?

131
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,994
She couldn't have pulled that off
if she wanted to.

132
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,079
She had no idea
I was gonna invite her over.

133
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,124
Plus, she's a lawyer.
She wouldn't just break the law like that.

134
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,794
Yeah, well, all I'm saying is,
the biggest issue here is not knowing

135
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,671
if she's a fan or an anti-fan.

136
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,840
If she's a fan,
it'll be like that movie Misery.

137
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,176
If she isn't,
it'll be even more miserable.

138
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,471
And don't you think an anti-fan
would be the more aggressive one?

139
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,723
-An anti-fan?
-She tripped you, dude.

140
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,642
You could've been seriously injured.
And she did it on purpose.

141
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,520
So, ask yourself this,

142
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,023
would you trip someone you hate
or someone you love?

143
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,358
Okay, I'll play along.
Suppose she does like you.

144
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,277
You wanna know what that makes her then?

145
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,445
A maniac.

146
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,672
Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Yeah!

147
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,509
Ha!

148
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,886
Na-na. Should we break all the records?

149
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,180
-Who are you beating up now?
-Oh…

150
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,098
Found a job,
and things are turning around,

151
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,559
which means money
for medical bills, right?

152
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,812
A punch like that would put someone
in the hospital for four weeks.

153
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,774
-One mistake would cost four million.
-Ooh, I see.

154
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,527
You can assess treatment
and settlement costs now?

155
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,195
Who is it?

156
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,863
No one.

157
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,448
Who is it?

158
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,533
Nam Kang-ho?

159
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,785
You're like a fortune teller.

160
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,286
What do you mean? I only said that

161
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,830
because he was the last guy
you complained about.

162
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,207
Wait, are you kidding me?

163
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,877
So he hired me to be
his training partner. Don't tell anyone.

164
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,922
I mean it. If this leaks,
it'll cost me three times my salary,

165
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,507
and I'll be fired right away.

166
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,093
And that will mean
the end of our livelihoods as well.

167
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,595
Okay. So he must have
a stunt coordinator, right?

168
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,515
Why choose a woman?
Ah, no. Why choose you?

169
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,476
I don't know,
but he really knows what he wants.

170
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,604
-Does he just have a good eye?
-Mm-mm. That's not it.

171
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,523
Nam Kang-ho is an actor, yeah?

172
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,316
He's a very good actor.

173
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,278
He likes you, and he's putting you
in a position to see you again.

174
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,154
He's enticed you
with a high-paying side gig,

175
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,657
and you've totally fallen for it.

176
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,117
It's so romantic.

177
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,704
That way you'll hold him, fall over,
roll around, smell each other's sweat.

178
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,747
Doesn't it just make you wanna…

179
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,207
This isn't harlequin, okay?

180
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,714
Hmm. You know,
I forgot how pretty you are.

181
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,550
-What?
-I always thought you were pretty too.

182
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,469
Instead of
some expected-to-be pretty celebrity,

183
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,180
wouldn't he be more excited
to see a regular girl who's pretty?

184
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,559
Mmm! Well, if he falls for me,
then maybe I'll think about it.

185
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,770
And by that, I mean how I'm going
to take down that sexist pervert.

186
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,857
Pervert? What are you trying to say?

187
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,485
Ah, you know me. I'm always suspicious
when it comes to guys.

188
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,155
Well, then you should think
about meeting someone nice.

189
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,241
I've met
at least ten times more men than you have.

190
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,659
It's not hard to figure out why.

191
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,703
The only thing
that mattered to all of you was sex.

192
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,290
Yeah, exactly, which is why
I've never been betrayed the way you have.

193
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,709
They broke your heart and took your money.

194
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,128
I swear I'll strangle anyone
who ever does that to you again.

195
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,881
Keep acting cocky, but you're gonna fall
for him just like that.

196
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,966
Nam Kang-ho is very handsome,
and you know it.

197
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,802
Good looks aren't
as important to me as they are to you.

198
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,319
Hello, Mr. Ko.
I'm at work right now.

199
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,489
Yes, absolutely.

200
00:10:56,572 --> 00:11:00,201
Star actress Ms. C
has gone into countdown mode for divorce.

201
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,578
When you say a star actress,

202
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,872
do you mean the one
who's been acting nonstop

203
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,541
even after marrying
into a wealthy business family?

204
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,835
Yeah, I hear
her most recent show was a big hit.

205
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,295
Didn't she get an award for it too?

206
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,297
Anyway, it appears
that the reason for the divorce

207
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,091
is actually an affair. Is that true?

208
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,094
Yeah, but instead of the usual
rich-guy-cheats-on-his-wife situation,

209
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,970
in this case, the actress is cheating.

210
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,976
Seriously…

211
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,146
Uh, sorry, I'll get you a new one.

212
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,608
Oh, no, no, it's okay, really. It's fine.

213
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,153
He's the one who cheated.
That son of a bitch!

214
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,532
Hey, hey, come on, it's okay.
Listen, this is what we're gonna do.

215
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,576
We're gonna hit them with charges
for defamation of character

216
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,495
and knowingly spreading falsehoods.

217
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,789
We can use that
for your divorce proceedings.

218
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,457
It'll take forever fighting like that.

219
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,336
It's just, no matter
how much I try to keep it together,

220
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,671
if they drag me through the mud,

221
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,881
then I have no choice
but to fight dirty also.

222
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,800
I'm going to find a picture of her

223
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,720
and make sure everyone knows
that he cheated on me!

224
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,097
-Seriously…
-Come on, just take a breath.

225
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,436
You just have to issue
a statement saying you intend to take

226
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,521
immediate legal action
and leave it at that.

227
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,316
Unless you also show some kind of proof,
people won't believe you anyway.

228
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,318
If we find the source
of the tabloid claim,

229
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,820
it will work against you in court.

230
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,322
Attorney… …Yeo Mi-ran

231
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,241
will do her best to help you.

232
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,076
Don't worry about a thing, Mr. Do.

233
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,163
Okay. Well, I trust that you'll handle
all of it appropriately then.

234
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,498
By the way, about Ms. Yeo Mi-ran,

235
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,460
I'd like you to withdraw her
from being Kang-ho's council.

236
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:34,962
Oh…

237
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,882
I heard Mr. Nam gave the okay,
isn't that right?

238
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,884
Yes, that's true. It's just, uh,

239
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:43,596
you know Kang-ho always gets himself
into trouble whenever he's around women.

240
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,891
Also, if I'm being honest,
I think that she's a little…

241
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,893
Something about her
just rubs me the wrong way.

242
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,353
I mean, you hired her
to handle Ms. Choi's cases.

243
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,440
Then out of the blue,
she offers to handle Kang-ho's cases too.

244
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,609
And now she's working
as his personal fight trainer--

245
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,611
Hey! Do Won-jun!

246
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,697
I picked her, remember?

247
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,283
Are you saying someone I personally picked
rubs you the wrong way?

248
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,620
Are you saying that I lack
the intuition to pick the right person?

249
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:11,791
-Seriously, do you think I'm an idiot?
-Oh… No, of course not.

250
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,833
Oh! Oh, yeah.

251
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,586
I can't pick the right person,
which is why my marriage failed, yeah?

252
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,046
My vision isn't keen enough,

253
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,924
so I turned down better offers
and stayed with you for ten stupid years!

254
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,218
All right, all right.
Uh, Mr. Ko,

255
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,720
please disregard everything
I was just talking about.

256
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,806
Yes. I'll call back later.

257
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,099
Yes, sir. Have a good day.

258
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,815
It'd behoove you to behave.

259
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,025
Yes.

260
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,320
With all this happening,
you're still thinking of Kang-ho

261
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,614
and not me?

262
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,783
Why would you talk about that right now?

263
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,284
Okay, okay, okay.

264
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,830
You're right. I'm sorry.
I was wrong. I'm so sorry.

265
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,541
It was really shortsighted of me.

266
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,459
Promise you won't be upset, okay?

267
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,378
I mean it.

268
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,756
I really am sorry, you know?

269
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,259
You can't just try
and hug your way out of it.

270
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,554
Oh, wait. You're all better.

271
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,725
Okay, okay. I'll make sure
to be extra careful from now on.

272
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,728
You'd better be.

273
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,750
Give me a hug too.

274
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,752
-Huh?
-I'm not kidding.

275
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,380
I deserve a hug, so give me a hug too.

276
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,678
Oh gosh. There we go.

277
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,390
-What is it?
-They picked the female lead.

278
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,142
Oh yeah? Who is it?

279
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,143
Oh Se-na.

280
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,312
-She kept saying she'd think about it.
-Oh…

281
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,481
Once she heard Kang-ho was the lead,
she said okay right away.

282
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,070
Actually, about the female lead,

283
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,448
shouldn't you have discussed it
with us too?

284
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,992
What is this? I thought
you'd be ecstatic with my choice.

285
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,286
Do you not like Oh Se-na?

286
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,246
The director seems happy, so…

287
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,540
Ah, well, it's not really that.

288
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,095
Excuse me, ma'am. We just received word

289
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,097
that the other expected guest
will not be coming.

290
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,850
Would you like to order?

291
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,648
-No. I should get going, I guess.
-Yes, ma'am. No problem.

292
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,284
Ah, I'm sorry.
Something urgent came up.

293
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,164
Is this your way of saying
that I'm just a toy to you?

294
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,333
Oh, come on. What do you mean?

295
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,044
I just can't make it, okay?
But I'll get the check.

296
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,922
Just invite some friends out
and have a good time.

297
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,715
You aren't the only one
with money, you know?

298
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,845
I was actually going to break up
with you today,

299
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,306
so this kind of disgusting ending
feels appropriate.

300
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,517
The gifts you got me
are staying right here.

301
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,603
You can send someone or get them yourself.

302
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,232
I'm so sorry.

303
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,694
I just want to know.

304
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,072
You won't tell anyone
we used to date, right?

305
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,453
Please find all the pictures
of us together and… delete them.

306
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,830
Please.

307
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,421
I mean, is she out of her mind?

308
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,716
You, a stalker? All she had to do
was say you've broken up.

309
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,178
-Instead, she reports you as a stalker?
-It's not Se-na's fault.

310
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,679
It was her manager.

311
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,932
Then she should've stopped him
instead of just watching it happen!

312
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,147
Kang-ho, you need to become
as famous as her.

313
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,857
That'll be your revenge.

314
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,110
Actually, there's a way
to get revenge now.

315
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,987
"Oh Se-na, head over heels

316
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,656
for stage-performer
from Seoul National University."

317
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,283
-That one line will do it.
-Hey!

318
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,453
I just don't get it, man.
I'm just trying to look out for you.

319
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,914
Anyway, it's not like it's a lie.

320
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,877
All right. I won't do it.

321
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,712
And to tell you the truth,

322
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,924
you don't need her fame
to be a success anyway.

323
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,510
No. You're gonna make
yourself famous, you hear me?

324
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,011
You can do it. I know you can.

325
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,014
You crying?

326
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,767
Hey, you crying?

327
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,187
Yes, hello?

328
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,939
It's been a while, Ms. Oh Se-na.

329
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,899
This is Do Won-jun.

330
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,695
You're right. It has been.

331
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,822
I was wondering if I could see you.

332
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,117
As it turns out,
I was going to ask you the same thing.

333
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,500
I don't like seaweed soup. You know that.

334
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,919
If it's my birthday, why do I have to eat
something I don't want?

335
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,921
Well, what do you want to eat then?

336
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,757
I'll make it and leave it at your place,
so you can have it tomorrow.

337
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,676
Thanks, but there's
no time to eat before work.

338
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,345
Besides, you gave birth to me.
You deserve some time for yourself.

339
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,056
-Go do some shopping.
-You're that busy?

340
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,393
Just be careful.
Don't let them work you to death, okay?

341
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,771
I have a work call, Mom. Sorry.

342
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,068
-Good morning.
-Ms. Yeo, time to deploy!

343
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:55,986
Deploy where?

344
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,988
Go to Jeongha Detention Center.

345
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,699
Ms. Unpredictable decided
to crash her husband's car.

346
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,455
Wow, the wife
of a major corporate executive

347
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,415
is definitely below ten.

348
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,959
Visiting the VIP room
so soon after being hired.

349
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,544
Your career's taking off.

350
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,338
Rooms one through ten
at the detention center

351
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,923
are reserved for VIPs.

352
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,009
Has anyone been
to any of those rooms?

353
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,929
Well, I visited room number three
when I worked at my old company.

354
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,222
Number three?

355
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,640
-Room number three.
-Three!

356
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,725
It's just glorified servant duty,
you know.

357
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,187
Would you like a massage?
Are you hungry? What else can I get you?

358
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,397
All I did was have
expensive multicourse meals all day.

359
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,816
I thought I was going to pass out.
It's like a hotel.

360
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,903
And just so you know,
room numbers one, two, and three

361
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,905
are reserved
for the very, very important clients.

362
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,324
Ah.

363
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,743
And how about that VIP, though?
Where are they now?

364
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,621
Serving time in prison, I think.

365
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,456
And Mr. Seo got fired.

366
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,583
-Isn't that right?
-Ooh.

367
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,713
-All right, I'll be back.
-But still, I…

368
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,757
Oh! I'll call a cab.

369
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,468
-Wait…
-Oh, come on.

370
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,970
Are they still dating?

371
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,140
Are you kidding me? No way. Lee Jin-suh
is just pathetically clinging to her.

372
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,601
He actually thinks
she still has feelings for him.

373
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,103
They both seem cool with it.

374
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,522
Can exes get along
working like this in the same office?

375
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,983
Well, that depends.

376
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,527
Once, I dated one of my ex's besties.

377
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,033
-What a sleaze.
-He's super sleazy.

378
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,452
Choi Soo-jin doesn't have a stable middle.

379
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,663
She either feels
extremely good or extremely bad.

380
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,248
It's gonna be rough either way.

381
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:32,958
Right here.

382
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,545
You're gonna feel like crap,
so call me if you want a drink.

383
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,755
-I'll be standing by.
-No, that's fine.

384
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,675
I'm just happy that you've been
such a good coworker so far.

385
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,804
Well… what are you doing
tomorrow for your birthday?

386
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,057
Oh, I'm meeting up with a guy.

387
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,642
See you later.

388
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:02,279
Why did you have to end up
working here and torturing me like this?

389
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,239
You idiot, come on.

390
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,242
Let it go. Let it go! When you were going
into that hotel room,

391
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,037
she was on her way out
with a dude she met that day.

392
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,419
Ah.

393
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,005
I never thought
I'd get to see you this easily.

394
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,467
You know, I must have called you
at least a hundred times back then.

395
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,761
It was a tough time… for you as well.

396
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,597
Well, I'm not here to rehash
what happened over ten years ago.

397
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,308
So why don't we drop the pleasantries
and get straight to the point.

398
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,185
Why are you interested
in doing this movie?

399
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,604
Well, what did Kang-ho tell you?

400
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,566
I'm asking you just in case, but please…

401
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,613
You're not trying to get back
with Kang-ho, by any chance?

402
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:46,948
Or you are?

403
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,743
What about that rich boyfriend of yours?

404
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,247
-Actually, I broke up with him.
-You've lost your mind.

405
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,044
Are you seriously trying
to be in this movie

406
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,213
so you and Kang-ho can be together again?

407
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,925
Are you kidding me right now?

408
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,428
I've been suffering this whole time.
At every awards ceremony,

409
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,596
I'd always avoid him,

410
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,182
because I was afraid if he saw me,
he'd get upset.

411
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,397
At least give me the chance to apologize.

412
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,191
I've always wanted to, believe me.

413
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,402
I just could never bring myself to do it.

414
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,826
It's been that way for a long time now.

415
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,789
Because you lacked the courage?

416
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,835
Okay, fine.

417
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,172
Then now is the time to show your courage.

418
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,758
If you really do want
to apologize to Kang-ho,

419
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,510
muster that courage

420
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,848
and announce that you'd like
to drop out of the movie.

421
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,602
In the end, one of you will have to leave
the film and take the blame for it.

422
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,770
And it's not Kang-ho.

423
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,691
And if you still want to apologize,
I would love to see that happen.

424
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:06,153
Meet up with him and apologize.
I'll even arrange it for you.

425
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,366
Although, if I were to apologize to him

426
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,995
and then say I'm dropping out of the film,

427
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,956
would he still want to be in it?

428
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,458
What?

429
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,919
Then it will look like I'm just trying
to make up for how I treated him,

430
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,257
and he'd only be forgiving me
because he wants to be in that movie.

431
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,678
It's not like Kang-ho to allow
something like that to happen, is it?

432
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,680
Is that your way of saying

433
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,141
that you're not going to back out
of this movie?

434
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,768
Oh, what the hell?

435
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,897
Wow, you really are crazy.

436
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,319
Then again… I guess that explains

437
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,946
why you'd try to make a move
on Kang-ho after all these years.

438
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,906
Please.

439
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:56,036
Ever since I walked in this room,
you've been rather rude, you know that?

440
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:56,953
Oh yeah?

441
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,249
You think talking to Kang-ho
would be any better?

442
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,419
You honestly believe
Kang-ho will accept your apology,

443
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,506
and everything will go back
to being all ha-ha, ho-ho?

444
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,467
That's never gonna happen.

445
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,928
You know why?

446
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,807
Kang-ho can't stand you.

447
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,065
JEONGHA DETENTION CENTER

448
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,233
YEO MI-RAN

449
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,779
She's in room number one.

450
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,405
-Room number one?
-Yes.

451
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,324
Oh.

452
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:35,742
Thank you so much.

453
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,621
What did Won-jun say?

454
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,665
Did he tell you to come yell at me?

455
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,085
He only talked to Mr. Ko,
so I didn't get the chance

456
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,169
to talk to him on my own.

457
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,923
You know, Mr. Ko
doesn't like me very much.

458
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,550
Wait, says who?

459
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,760
Well, I heard it on speakerphone.

460
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,346
-Oh my.
-Thank you for having my back.

461
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,517
Well,
there's no need to feel bad.

462
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,645
Nam Kang-ho truly has
such a hard time with women.

463
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:07,524
Sure. Now, listen, there are
a few ways to get out of here.

464
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,442
Illness, caring for a family member.

465
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,403
There's no flight risk.
You're all good there.

466
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,989
Paying to cover the cost
of other party's injuries would help.

467
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:18,034
Well, we'll talk about that.
You're going to be here all day anyway.

468
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,330
-How about we eat something, huh?
-Huh?

469
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,960
Even if he wasn't cheating on me,
I would have divorced him anyway.

470
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:30,088
I've lost all feelings for him
just after a year.

471
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,841
You'd think they'd only have
serious concerns because they're so rich.

472
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,052
It all started with small things.
Our first fight we ever had

473
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,139
was about attending the wedding
of my mother-in-law's friend.

474
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:43,435
She hands me the wedding gift money,
and she says, "Have a nice meal, okay?"

475
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,813
She goes on a trip and skips the wedding.
It's like I'm running an errand for her.

476
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:50,275
And so, shouldn't it have been on her
to ask if I was even free to do that?

477
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,569
Of course. It was her friend's wedding.

478
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,112
My husband and I fought,

479
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,531
and then I ended up going by myself,
because he had work.

480
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,617
I had plans to see my friends,
which I had to cancel.

481
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,201
Ugh, that's so annoying!

482
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,912
To tell you all this
and try to eat this food

483
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,123
without some sake is…

484
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,917
Next time, stash some soju
in a water bottle.

485
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,754
-Huh?
-And don't just bring one bottle with you.

486
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,464
Ah! Yeah.

487
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,257
Hmm, eat some more.

488
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,677
I just can't eat this without soju.

489
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,015
Dying

490
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,310
is a scary thing to anyone.

491
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,521
It really is scaring me to death.

492
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,482
You're scared?

493
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,568
Don't I give off a thuggish vibe?

494
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,238
You know, I won't work for you anymore
if you don't take off your sunglasses.

495
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,575
Wow, I just can't believe
you would be scared by that.

496
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,038
I have good night vision, so it's okay.

497
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:46,790
Sure, whatever.

498
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,001
You're not allowed to drive anymore
until the movie is done.

499
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,587
Hey, I don't play around
while I'm driving, okay?

500
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,840
I'm not as scared of dying
as I am of killing someone else.

501
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,260
My father was killed in a car accident.

502
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:03,264
Oh, he was?

503
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,394
Still, I could die right now
and not regret a thing.

504
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,438
A film noir directed by Yoo Sung-jun.

505
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,148
That's a set I'd happily die on.

506
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,653
I saw Oh Se-na.

507
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,447
She's the female lead in the movie.

508
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:20,949
What do you mean?

509
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,910
Well, I was told that the director
had her in mind from the beginning.

510
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,162
She kept saying she'd think about it,

511
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,124
but after finding out
that you're the male lead,

512
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,583
she suddenly agreed to it.

513
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,002
-Why?
-I think she still has feelings for you.

514
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,131
What?

515
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,716
Hey, you okay?

516
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,181
I'll try one more time
to get her to back out.

517
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,101
If she doesn't,
we'll wait for something else.

518
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,812
Why do I have to leave because of her?

519
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,441
You're still young.

520
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,945
A project like this will come along again.

521
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,997
I'm sorry,
but it looks like we'll have to do

522
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,915
our training tomorrow afternoon.

523
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,417
Something came up at work.

524
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,253
Are you not into me?

525
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,050
Oh, I don't know. It's not that.

526
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:26,097
Kang-ho, if you want to work
with Yoo Sung-jun again in the future,

527
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,726
you need to handle this carefully.
As carefully as you can, okay?

528
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,478
No.

529
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,355
-I'll do it.
-Huh?

530
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,398
This is work.

531
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,233
So I'm gonna work.

532
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,244
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.

533
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,339
Mmm.

534
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,508
Clever girl, bringing Kaoliang liquor.

535
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,676
I guess I really did pick
the right person for the job.

536
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:10,183
Anyway, it's not just the husband
and the in-laws. It's everything.

537
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,478
Do you know what I was asked
when my marriage was announced?

538
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,232
"Once you're married,
are you still going to keep acting?"

539
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,027
"What do you consider to be
more important, family or work?"

540
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,280
It's like…
Does anyone ask that to a man?

541
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,367
That's what I'm saying.
Do they think work is a hobby for us?

542
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,954
In the early days, "Do you make breakfast
for your husband every day?"

543
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,997
"Would you say you're a good cook?"

544
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,166
Wow, that's absurd.
You know, I can't even watch

545
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,293
those reality shows
that have married couples on them.

546
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,088
They're totally fine when the husband
comes home drunk late at night.

547
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,090
But when the wife does it,
it's a family crisis.

548
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,300
They have to bring in
some sort of expert to discuss it!

549
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:48,179
Tell me about it!
You know, you and I get along really well.

550
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,640
Should we drop the formalities
and become friends?

551
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,101
-Huh?
-I mean, if you don't--

552
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,228
No, no, I do… girlfriend.

553
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,688
You don't have to force it.

554
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,232
No, really, I like it… girlfriend!

555
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,693
Girlfriend?

556
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,820
Should we order some food again?

557
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,114
How about the pig feet? Mwah!

558
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,199
Aw!

559
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,117
Cool!

560
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,452
You know, I kind of like her.

561
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,872
Pour me one more shot!

562
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,081
Miss!

563
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,291
Mmm.

564
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,333
Miss!

565
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,294
Are you asleep?

566
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,213
Hey, miss!

567
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,800
I was trying to wake you!

568
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,218
What?

569
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,139
Oh, I'm so sorry.

570
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,433
I had so much to eat, and I fell asleep.

571
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,685
You were drooling too.

572
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,228
Huh?

573
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,566
Sorry, again.

574
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,528
I'm sorry.

575
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,615
What happened in there?

576
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,574
Oh.

577
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,619
I was sleeping,
and then I twisted his arm.

578
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,246
Ugh, and I drooled all over.

579
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,294
-So shall we? Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. Let's head inside.

580
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:09,010
I've actually never taught
anyone to fight before.

581
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,346
Have you ever fought someone for real?

582
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,932
-What, like a fistfight?
-Think I'd care about shouting matches?

583
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,184
-Have you ever beaten up anyone?
-Of course not.

584
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,353
How would I be here
if I'd beaten up someone?

585
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,188
Ah… you're right.

586
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,775
I've always felt the biggest difference
between real fights and fights in movies

587
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:27,111
is that in a movie, a good guy looks
like a good guy even when he's fighting.

588
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,821
He never throws the first punch.

589
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,075
But in a real fight,
the most vicious person always wins. Hmm.

590
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,035
Elbow. Fingernails.

591
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:34,994
A rock.

592
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,747
You have to use anything you get
your hands on and swear more too.

593
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,708
Yeah, yeah, I get all that,
so stop talking and show me something.

594
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,677
Ow.

595
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,763
-Ah! Hey, stop.
-Hmm.

596
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,932
A fight will always start off
with being angry.

597
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,787
-Ah, jeez!
-So are you getting angry yet?

598
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,630
Whoa!

599
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,970
She dodges my attacks
like we've practiced each move.

600
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,889
Is she gifted,
or did she just work really hard at it?

601
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,976
Whichever it is, it's impressive.

602
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,021
Mad respect.

603
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,740
Okay, okay, time-out!

604
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,867
What do you mean, time-out?

605
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,370
Yeah! Yeah!

606
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,539
Whoo!

607
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,874
Whoo!

608
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,356
I got you now, you jerk.

609
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,652
FINGERPRINT DOES NOT MATCH

610
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:13,736
Hmm.

611
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,363
Ah.

612
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,406
Damn.

613
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,492
Come on, which one is it?

614
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,624
Left pinky, really?

615
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,543
What a pervert.

616
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,629
Hmm.

617
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,298
Princess, hmm?

618
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,470
Thank you for the pocket money.

619
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,638
You're welcome.

620
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,326
Are you hurt?

621
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,372
What happened?

622
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,499
You got knocked out after just one hit.

623
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,417
Huh?

624
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:14,797
I was wondering if I should call 911,
but you seem okay now.

625
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,383
You didn't use a Taser on me
by any chance, did you?

626
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,343
Oh, come on. Don't be ridiculous.

627
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,890
Uncle Kang-ho.

628
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:26,976
It's her!

629
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,270
I knew it.

630
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,063
I knew she was a minor!

631
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,567
-Uncle, you're bleeding!
-Ha!

632
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,571
-So she calls him "Uncle" in public.
-What are you guys doing here?

633
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,574
Oh, she said
you weren't picking up your phone

634
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,868
and kept asking me where you were, so…

635
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,495
Oh, does it hurt?

636
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,164
What were you doing?

637
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,708
Just practicing some action scenes.
I'm fine.

638
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,835
Let's take a quick break
since my niece is here.

639
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,671
All right, come on.

640
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,840
-Shouldn't you be at the tutor's?
-Uh…

641
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,426
-I finished already.
-Why is this backpack so heavy?

642
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,303
-Look at this.
-Is she really his niece?

643
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,638
Uh, yeah.

644
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,931
What kind of a niece?

645
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,850
The niece kind.
Kang-ho's older brother's daughter.

646
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,768
Huh?

647
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,895
And, you know,
he really adores her too.

648
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,648
He even has her as "Princess"
in his phone.

649
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,107
"Princess."

650
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,154
You know that autograph from Johnny?

651
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,281
They say that it looks fake.

652
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:26,327
What are you talking about?
It's totally real. I swear.

653
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,995
I asked him for it personally.

654
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,583
His manager probably did
the one your friends think is real.

655
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,962
-That's the fake one.
-I don't know. They don't believe me.

656
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,548
They're saying
you're probably not even my real uncle.

657
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:45,304
-Why don't they believe you?
-Because… I pretended I had a mom.

658
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,889
No, I mean, I didn't pretend.

659
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,308
I… I don't know.
I just didn't say I didn't.

660
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,519
They're bullying you
because you don't have a mother?

661
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,230
-No, not really.
-You just said they don't believe you.

662
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,274
They're bullying you
by treating you like you lied.

663
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,234
They're not bad kids at all.

664
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,028
We've been friends since grade school.

665
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:05,116
But this is the first time they're hearing
about it, so I get it. Why can't you?

666
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,158
Seriously.

667
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,038
They really don't believe
I'm your uncle, huh?

668
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,875
Well, what if we arrange
a phone call? Right now.

669
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,254
-Wow, he's so handsome!
-As you can see, it's me, Nam Kang-ho.

670
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,964
-I'm not an imposter, okay?
-Oh my God!

671
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,216
I'm Nam Kang-ho.

672
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,509
Ji-woo is my niece,

673
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,053
and I got Johnny's autograph
from him personally, okay?

674
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,097
It was a gift to Ji-woo and her friends.

675
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,057
-Thank you so much, really!
-Oh!

676
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,851
Ji-woo, hey, sorry.

677
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,520
Kim Ji-woo, I believed you, you know?

678
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,732
Should I invite your friends over
and treat them to a meal?

679
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,649
-Yes!
-Really?

680
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,235
-Yes, please do that! Please do that!
-Yes, I wanna go! Please!

681
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,949
The niece kind.
Kang-ho's older brother's daughter.

682
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,160
-Here. Have a good night.
-Oh, thanks.

683
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,496
I've never made
a bigger mistake in my life.

684
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,874
I've let some go that deserved a beating,

685
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,835
but I've never beaten up someone
who didn't deserve it.

686
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,546
A woman is drawn to a bad boy
not because he's bad.

687
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,965
The experience of seeing a bad guy change

688
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,260
is more appealing
than the reliable behavior of a good guy.

689
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:11,140
Okay. Let's get into it for real now.
I was just feeling the waters earlier.

690
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,989
What are you doing?

691
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,991
Am I chasing you, or…

692
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,795
So I am chasing you.

693
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,807
-Come here!
-Whoa!

694
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,981
Wait, wait.

695
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,947
Time, time, time, time, time.

696
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,366
You said
there weren't any time-outs.

697
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,100
Are you sure
you're not taking it easy on me?

698
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,686
Absolutely. Kick away.

699
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,564
I've never felt so good
after getting my ass handed to me.

700
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,400
How could I not realize
she was his actual niece?

701
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,526
Let's call it a day.

702
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,944
Wait.

703
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,738
Uh, why?

704
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,949
I'm not being lazy with you.

705
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:55,161
I just wanted to see what type of moves
you'd try to use in a free-for-all.

706
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,912
Now we'll really get into it.

707
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,498
I can teach you
the real nasty techniques now.

708
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,167
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

709
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,838
You didn't listen to me at all.

710
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,260
Yeah.

711
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,304
Are you living
a happy life without me?

712
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,015
I haven't forgotten
it's your birthday today.

713
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:19,518
When you black out soon,
go ahead and forget about that, okay?

714
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,313
You're so cold, evil, and vicious!

715
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,190
But I still loved you.

716
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,608
Happy birthday!

717
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:28,986
It's your birthday?

718
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,865
-Yeah.
-Your birthday's today, really?

719
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,034
Yeah.

720
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:39,747
Then you should have told me that before.
We could have trained a different day.

721
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,334
I still had to go to work.
It's not like it's a holiday.

722
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,794
Thanks to you,
I sure got a good birthday bashing.

723
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,923
You don't have to drive me home.

724
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,300
-Have a good day.
-Do you have any plans?

725
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,384
Now, you mean?

726
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,303
I don't.

727
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,180
Let's go somewhere
and get something to eat.

728
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,474
-Together?
-Well, yeah, I'll pay.

729
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,602
Let's go eat.

730
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,941
Women's birthdays are
characterized by bragging about the gifts,

731
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,277
bragging about the special ceremonies,
bragging about the boyfriend and friends

732
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,488
who bought the gifts
and arranged the ceremonies.

733
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,990
It's supposed to be
a day of bragging, and yet…

734
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,171
…she just goes wherever
and proceeds to drink two bottles of soju.

735
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:32,341
She seems mostly indifferent
to her own birthday.

736
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,718
She truly is a different breed.

737
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,558
Did you have seaweed soup this morning?
You live with your parents, don't you?

738
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,810
What kind of friends do you have?
Guy friends?

739
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,144
I assume you have a boyfriend?

740
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,651
Look, if you do have a boyfriend,
don't let me keep you too long.

741
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,363
I don't. If I had a boyfriend,
then I wouldn't be here with you.

742
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,075
And didn't you say you were hungry before?
Why aren't you eating?

743
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:58,993
Oh.

744
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:05,082
You should eat too.
You shouldn't drink without eating.

745
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:08,460
I actually ate a ton of food earlier.
It was a huge smorgasbord.

746
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,551
So how long have you been
such a good fighter?

747
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,720
Mmm… since I was a kid.

748
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,764
-Were you a bully?
-A bully?

749
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,350
I've been compared to that.

750
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,561
That would've made you
a gangster.

751
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,023
So were you?

752
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,360
No. I decided to beat them up too,
so I became a prosecutor.

753
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,906
-But I failed the interview.
-You must have a strong sense of justice.

754
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,867
I wouldn't say that.

755
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,077
-I just wanted to be a strong person.
-Mmm.

756
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,496
In Korea, a prosecutor
is stronger than anyone.

757
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,542
-So you learned to fight to become strong?
-At first, it was for self-defense.

758
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,793
Hello, girls!

759
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,546
There was a crazy old man
in my neighborhood.

760
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,840
The kids were creeped out and avoided him,

761
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,009
but he still kept chasing them
and touching them.

762
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,470
But when I told my parents about him,

763
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,722
my dad told me to start taking
a different route home

764
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:06,769
and that the world was full of creeps,
so I needed to be careful.

765
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:10,022
I was young, but I felt something…
…burning inside.

766
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:13,359
I'm a girl, so I have to be careful?
I have to avoid them? Why?

767
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,943
So I'm not strong?

768
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,417
So, for about a year,

769
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,046
I trained as hard as I could
and went back to punish him.

770
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,089
Hey!

771
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,806
Please, leave me alone!

772
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,974
I was just doing that
because the kid was so adorable…

773
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,561
Well, as it turned out,
no one believed that a healthy old man

774
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:53,190
could actually be pummeled
by a sweet, little 13-year-old girl.

775
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,526
There were no security cameras either.

776
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,945
It was… perfect.

777
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:02,533
And, this… this… feeling
in my hands when I hit him

778
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,953
felt really good, you know?

779
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,956
Honestly, I'm more comfortable
with violence than I am with the law.

780
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,834
If I'd become a police officer,
I probably would have gotten fired

781
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,378
for beating up suspects.

782
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,588
She's most definitely
a different breed.

783
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,390
Oh. Sorry for making you listen
to my boring stories.

784
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,435
I enjoyed it. Don't be sorry.
Do you have any other stories?

785
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,228
Other stories?

786
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,439
Did you fall for me right away or no?

787
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,691
-Huh?
-Why do you like me?

788
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,234
Uh…

789
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,696
What isn't there
to like about you?

790
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,031
You look good… and sexy.

791
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,827
And you're a really good actor

792
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,704
and a Seoul National alumnus.

793
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,330
I never graduated.

794
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,331
I dropped out.

795
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,791
Ah.

796
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:58,589
I can't stop feeling really guilty.
It's your birthday,

797
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,883
and I shouldn't have beaten you up
like that.

798
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:02,468
Therefore,

799
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,344
a special gift!

800
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,229
One date with me!

801
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,860
Um… what?

802
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,240
You know, go somewhere nice
and get some food, go for a drive.

803
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,244
Anything else you want to do? Huh?

804
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,997
I really appreciate
the gesture.

805
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,957
You don't need to do that.

806
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,794
-Really, I'm okay.
-Oh, yes, I do. You deserve it.

807
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:40,798
Oh…

808
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,092
Would you look at the time, uh…

809
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:48,305
Oh, looks like the subway is crowded.
And I have work tomorrow, so…

810
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,476
Thank you.

811
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,019
-Goodbye.
-Okay.

812
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:55,646
Huh?

813
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,651
-Does it hurt where I kicked you?
-No, it feels fine.

814
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,949
Look, I don't even do this
at my fan meetings, but…

815
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,077
Here.

816
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,209
It's okay.

817
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,553
Happy birthday to you.

818
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,308
Oh. Well, um, thank you.

819
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,980
My hand isn't locking up.

820
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,441
Oh!

821
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,821
You know, I'm so grateful to have…

822
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,657
No anxiety attack.

823
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,577
What's happening?
