Why do you like me?

00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,446
A special gift!

00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,034
One date with me!

Answer me this,
did I end up seducing Nam Kang-ho now?

8
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,547
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

9
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,299
Okay.

10
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:54,262
-Does it hurt where I kicked you?
-No, it feels fine.

Look, I don't even do this
at my fan meetings, but…

Here.

13
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,943
It's okay.

Oh!

Happy birthday to you.

Oh. Well, um, thank you.

17
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,916
My hand isn't locking up.

18
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,085
Oh!

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,129
You know, I'm so grateful to have…

No anxiety attack.

WILL NAM BECOME YOO'S MUSE?

29
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,094
They say that things can develop fast
between a man and a woman.

30
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,139
Just about as quick as you were fired.

31
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,349
-Seduced him, did ya?
-Who, me?

32
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,601
Why are you getting so upset?

33
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,105
It's just a logical suspicion.
We hired you to handle Choi Soo-jin,

34
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,732
and yet you pulled out
all the stops for Kang-ho.

35
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,276
What? A fight training partner?

36
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,778
Was it good? Was it fun?
Rolling around and wrestling?

37
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,281
Wait, wait, wait.

38
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,491
Tell me, you're not gonna get sued
over this, are you?

39
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,661
Out of anybody, I should be suing.

40
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:45,707
Nam Kang-ho has been making moves
since I got hired! So I drew a clear line.

41
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,584
Then he got embarrassed,
and I was let go.

42
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,085
Ah!

43
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,672
I've made a terrible mistake.

44
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,425
That's why they say you should never tell
divas that they're pretty.

45
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,886
-I can set you up with a good shrink.
-Ah, shi--

46
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,389
Ah, shi… shi… What was that all about?
Did you just curse at me, huh?

47
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,809
I did not, sir! I wish there was
a photo to prove my innocence.

48
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,228
Close it. Gently!

49
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,193
Happy birthday to you.

50
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,863
You know…

51
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,491
I'm so grateful to have…

52
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,123
Oh my. He is kind of handsome.

53
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,788
Man, I told you she'd cross the line,
didn't I? I told you to be careful, huh?

54
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,707
And in the name of training for the movie,
you wrestled with her,

55
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,543
rolling around and hugging her,
then it triggered your attack.

56
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,464
And in the end,
you really didn't train that much.

57
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,633
You only got your butt kicked.

58
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,094
Did you have to get beat up
to come to your senses?

59
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,471
You should have just listened to me
from the start.

60
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,890
You're right.

61
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,935
So, how far did it go?

62
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,814
-Did she kiss you?
-She didn't.

63
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,817
Well, I'm just asking
'cause you terminated her.

64
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,696
Wait a minute.

65
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,953
-She didn't find out, did she?
-'Course not.

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,422
No anxiety attack.

67
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,174
What's happening?

68
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,040
Was that fan service good enough?

69
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,168
It didn't trigger an attack.
There was no reaction.

70
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,629
Excuse me?
What exactly did you mean by that?

71
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,839
Fan service?

72
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,927
Actually, I've never done
this much for fan service.

73
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,932
I hope this will be
a cherished memory forever.

74
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,351
Cherished memory?

75
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,437
Wow, holy crap.

76
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,940
-Am I the asshole, or are you the asshole?
-Huh?

77
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,359
Asshole?

78
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,528
I'm supposed to feel
so blessed and privileged, right?

79
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,697
After you hugged
and kissed me at your whim?

80
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,495
Damn it. I can't let this go.

81
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,955
Oh shit.

82
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,291
I have to confess. I was never your fan.

83
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,212
I tripped you on purpose and made you fall
because you are a self-centered asshole.

84
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,339
In fact, that wasn't
the first time I saw you.

85
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,716
I saw you a while back
in the parking lot of the resort.

86
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,177
"She's just trying to find herself
a mega-rich guy,

87
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,763
so why does she even work?
Oh, yeah. That's right!"

88
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,265
"So she can bring up her status."

89
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,435
"Because she thinks
that if she raises her value,

90
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,229
everyone will bid on her, right?"

91
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,607
"After all,
that's every woman's dream, I suppose."

92
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,408
And yet, you still insisted
on being my lawyer?

93
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:54,038
Then again… anti-fans
are more relentless, I guess.

94
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,963
I was drunk. How could I?

95
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:06,175
How did I remember
exactly every single word he said!

96
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,475
Am I a genius?

97
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,562
My memory is that good?

98
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:21,107
Then again… anti-fans
are more relentless, I guess.

99
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,277
I had no clue it was the case.

100
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,087
I had no clue it was the case.

101
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,172
Shit.

102
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,175
No clue for what? What? What? What?

103
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,093
Oh, so what?

104
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,766
All done. Wow, you look pretty.

105
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,273
What's all this? Why am I so shiny?

106
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,901
It's not shiny.
It's a glow like a star, bling-bling.

107
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,903
I used a base
to make you look rejuvenated.

108
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,363
I don't want that.
I want natural. Natural.

109
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,949
This is as natural as it gets.
Are you trying to look dead?

110
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,620
Please do it again. Take out the base
and make me look pale and sick.

111
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,291
Just the thought of her
all dolled up makes me…

112
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,585
Damn.

113
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,213
Well, I wouldn't count on that.

114
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,590
She won't be that blatant.

115
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,383
You'll see.

116
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,637
I betcha… she's gonna look
like she's been troubled.

117
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,516
You were right.

118
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,101
I told you.

119
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,480
Now we get to meet finally.

120
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,484
So, have you been well?

121
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,496
We are sorry about the past.

122
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,873
We wrongfully accused you as a stalker

123
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,668
and haven't had the chance
to give a proper apology to you.

124
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,628
It's not like you haven't had the chance.

125
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,298
There are plenty of occasions
that we ran into each other, right? Huh?

126
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,262
Let's not talk about the past.

127
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,013
We've all moved on.

128
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:22,019
I'm sorry to inform you, but the director
won't be able to join you.

129
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:22,937
He'll reach out.

130
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,359
Yes, we've deposited for her treatment.

131
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,237
Yep, 30 million won. She'll be out soon.

132
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,697
Sure, I'll see you then.

133
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,491
You got this.

134
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,334
A drink tonight? I'm buying.

135
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,547
-Hey, guys, tonight who wants some booze?
-Oh, me!

136
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,383
-It'd be nice if it was just us two.
-Thank him. He's buying!

137
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,052
All right. Just one person,
first come, first serve.

138
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,305
Uh, just one person.

139
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,224
-I'm on my way. Meet you there.
-I have to decline.

140
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,352
-That's very considerate of him.
-And you're leaving? Wait.

141
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,605
Ms. Yeo, hey, you have to come too.

142
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,900
She's hard to get.
It's fine 'cause she's cute, though.

143
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,861
Mi-ran's a real pill.

144
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,369
-Are you all right?
-Mm-hmm. Thanks to everyone's concern.

145
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,538
Coffee?

146
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,334
They're probably just looking
for a chance to get close to you.

147
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,045
I know. But everyone is so ordinary.

148
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,797
-There's no surprise.
-What happened with Nam Kang-ho?

149
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,060
Sorry, I know we said
that we'd work together.

150
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,395
-Did something happen with you two?
-Like what?

151
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,230
Sleep together?

152
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,400
Oh, right. We shouldn't discuss
a client's personal life, huh?

153
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,862
But it's no problem
discussing mine, right?

154
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,614
Stay in your lane.

155
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,784
So this is why all the guys
who dated you ended up ruined.

156
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,662
You never really liked them at all,
did you?

157
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,288
It's like they didn't even matter.

158
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,125
I gave you a reason
to be mad, so I understand.

159
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,252
That's why you cheated out of revenge.

160
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,632
I don't understand
why you think I needed a reason.

161
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,802
I'm flirtatious, just like many men are.

162
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,304
This is just how I am.
It has nothing to do with you.

163
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,764
Just how you are.

164
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,272
-Yes, sir.
-It's an emergency!

165
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,608
You and Mi-ran get here right now!

166
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,862
I hear that after a kiss scene
with an actress, he had a very hard time.

167
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,948
He even showed symptoms of nausea.

168
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,410
That's why he does his very best
when he has to shoot a kiss scene

169
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,121
so that the director
would film it all in one take.

170
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,330
Ah.

171
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,125
And there's even a rumor
that he and his boss, Mr. Do,

172
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,334
are longtime lovers.

173
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:54,130
Apparently, Mr. Do follows him around
anywhere he's filming.

174
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,216
His manager?
Instead of an assistant or a coordinator?

175
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,594
Reportedly, they always sleep
together in the same room as well.

176
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,932
Now take a look at this here. This is
from a brunch café, taken this morning.

177
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,021
When men go to a café,
it's either to sign a contract

178
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,816
or to borrow money or something
like that, am I right?

179
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,901
Wow, that looks so romantic.

180
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,362
Hey, maybe they were together
last night too.

181
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:23,325
All the pieces are coming together
on how he's never had… any rumors.

182
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,910
Ah!

183
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,079
You said Nam Kang-ho made a move on you?

184
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,543
Are you a dude? Transgender?

185
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:36,088
No, I'm not. They also spread
fake news about Ms. Choi, remember?

186
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,716
I never thought of Nam Kang-ho like that,
but wow!

187
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,843
Being gay isn't a sin.
There's nothing wrong.

188
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,054
The top priority is to kill these rumors
and get Nam Kang-ho back on set.

189
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,514
You better do your best!

190
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,935
After that, gather evidence and label them
CC, BB exhibits to prove your case.

191
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,979
I'm sure you'll put
your best foot forward, right?

192
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,231
-I'm doing this alone?
-Thoughts?

193
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,691
Have them both handle the case.

194
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,152
When you meet with Nam Kang-ho,
Yeo Mi-ran can stay behind.

195
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,112
My goodness!

196
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,865
You know, I… …used to handle

197
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,660
over 30 of these cases a week
on my own back in the day. Yes, sir.

198
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,789
These law school kids
don't have the stamina like us.

199
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,625
They need to bring
back the bar exam. Jeez.

200
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,044
NAM KANG-HO IS GAY?

201
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,670
DID NAM KANG-HO GET OUTED?

202
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,047
NAM'S AGENCY STRONGLY DENIES

203
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,465
FAKE NEWS, JUST A RUMOR

204
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,842
NAM SWEPT UP IN GAY RUMOR

205
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,803
NAM'S GAY RUMOR SPREADS LIKE A WILDFIRE

206
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,887
NAUSEA AFTER KISSING

207
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,388
REPORTEDLY LONGTIME LOVERS

208
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,016
MOVIE PRODUCTION STOPS

209
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,102
Hey, why would you want
to eat at a brunch café?

210
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,022
Dude, I was really craving
for some good eggs Benedict, okay?

211
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,982
What can I say?
Do you know how to make it?

212
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,401
The underwear we bought, the blue one,

213
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,070
throw them out.

214
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:41,987
Hey.

215
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,824
That's one of my favorite pairs.

216
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,325
Get rid of yours.

217
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,660
I bought them.

218
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,120
Yours were free, so get rid of yours.

219
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,166
Oh, you cheapskate. Wow, honestly…

220
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,336
So this is where I can use the term,
you really are a cheap-ass bastard.

221
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,921
I'm so mad at the director.

222
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,799
How could he do this?
He wouldn't even hear what I had to say.

223
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,093
The investors were threatening
to pull out their funds,

224
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,719
so what do you think he could have done?

225
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,650
Kang-ho, let's expose
your past relationship.

226
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,734
What?

227
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,115
About you and Se-na.
It's not gonna cause any big impact now.

228
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,700
It'll actually help with the promotion.

229
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,786
In her state,
I'd imagine she couldn't say no.

230
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,831
Do you have that serious look right now?

231
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,125
Well, you could just kiss
this movie goodbye then.

232
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,501
This is frustrating.

233
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,421
Let's meet up and talk. I'll come to you.

234
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,714
Are you crazy?

235
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,300
Your place and my place
are the most dangerous right now.

236
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,760
-Let's meet at another place.
-Where at?

237
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,012
Your second house.

238
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,014
JEONGHA DETENTION CENTER

239
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,771
-It's good to see you, ma'am.
-It's for your troubles.

240
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,065
You want me to eat that right now?

241
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,862
There and over there. Eyes everywhere.

242
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,032
-I'm sorry. Maybe go to the car.
-Do you want to grab a drink?

243
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,993
Oh, I'm sorry,
I have something urgent to attend to.

244
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,203
Ah. Nam Kang-ho?

245
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,999
That news made it
all the way into these cells.

246
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,084
This must be a headache for Won-jun.

247
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,295
I'd better not cause more trouble for him.

248
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,923
But then, if we don't cause trouble,

249
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,758
lawyers will be out of work, right?

250
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,431
So, how are you going to make it right?

251
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,184
First, we'll put in some pressure
to have them say it wasn't true.

252
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,062
Who likes to hear retraction stories?
They're boring.

253
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,689
Bad gossips sell better than good deeds.

254
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,400
Strange news is
more fun than ordinary news.

255
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,904
When you were hired,
you signed an NDA, right?

256
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,447
Do you know why?

257
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,201
So you wouldn't be able to talk
to the public about these things.

258
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,912
Which story is more fun,
the good or the bad?

259
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,957
A drama must be countered with a drama.

260
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,793
Things will get tougher for him now.

261
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,170
Unless something more fun comes up.

262
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,986
It's Hwang Ji-hye.

263
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,697
My thoughts as well.

264
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,825
So I told Gilmu to take action.

265
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,078
What do you mean? It's just a hunch,
and we have no evidence.

266
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,706
We've gotta do something.

267
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,041
You can't just take
all the punches sitting dow--

268
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,545
Is that a camera?

269
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,173
What's up with the cameras?
Were they here before?

270
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,550
Oh, I'm filming myself.

271
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,261
I wanna see how I look
in this kind of crappy situation.

272
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,514
Once my lifelong dream is taken away,
and I really wanna kill someone,

273
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,684
but I can't, I wanna use
that emotion in acting later.

274
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,438
Yeah, okay. Just like what you said,

275
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,691
if all these experiences
are somehow meaningful to an actor,

276
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:10,070
I think a dramatic experience
in your real life wouldn't be a bad idea.

277
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,822
Wha…

278
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,663
Se-na sent this to me. Man,
she had this picture after all this time.

279
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,957
-So what?
-What's up with that attitude?

280
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,794
You and I were born in the same year,
but we're both very different people.

281
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,963
You were in grade nine. I was in ten.

282
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,759
We didn't graduate the same year.
You're a tiger, and I'm an ox. I'm older!

283
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,511
Hey, man, it's about time
you stop caring about formalities.

284
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,723
No wonder I'm still not a global star yet.

285
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,641
What, global star?

286
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,561
Man, that's acting, your thing.
It's not up to me that you--

287
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,233
Be calm. Be calm, okay?

288
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,361
If you still wanna be
in Director Yoo's movie,

289
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,405
you can't afford to mess this up.
All right?

290
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,908
Come in.

291
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,917
I brought her here.

292
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,338
So you guys are friends then?

293
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,008
Did you stop by a drive-through
on your way over here?

294
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,177
We had corn dogs, okay? Huh?

295
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,428
You happy?

296
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,513
Hi there.

297
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,682
I'll tell them.

298
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,854
I think it is really unfair

299
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,983
for you to not be in a movie you wanted
because of this baseless rumor.

300
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,405
It's not a bad idea.

301
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,406
But no, thanks.

302
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,745
Anyway, thanks for your concern.
I guess we're done here.

303
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,759
Um…

304
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,011
I wish you wouldn't do that.

305
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,598
I've missed you.

306
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,771
I really, really missed you
so much, Kang-ho.

307
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,072
Look, I gave up on this a long time ago.

308
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,908
Don't be gross.
It's time to move on, okay?

309
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,166
Yeah, Kang-ho. What's up?
Are you done talking?

310
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,460
You guys came together,
you can leave together.

311
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,882
You're so stubborn.
Damn it…

312
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:39,636
He told me that I needed
to stop being so gross.

313
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,930
Oh, see? Why would you be
all gross and cry like that?

314
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,186
He said that… he said that I'm gross?

315
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,484
-What's all this?
-What do you think?

316
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,837
I really wanna do this movie.

317
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,257
Shit.

318
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,471
Didn't I tell you?

319
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,473
Kang-ho would be much harsher than me.

320
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,702
Uh, are you sure those cameras
were all turned off?

321
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,454
It's not going to get leaked?

322
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,917
Look, even if those cameras were kept on,

323
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,585
you think he would leak it?

324
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,006
He didn't do anything in revenge
when you betrayed him and broke his heart.

325
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,383
He kept it all to himself
and suffered so much

326
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,511
that he developed
that illness that--

327
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,015
-He got ill?
-I mean, it was extremely painful.

328
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,812
You're right. I deserve
to be treated this way.

329
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,397
Serves me right.

330
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,405
But I'm glad
that you're over that whole thing now.

331
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,907
Pardon me?

332
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,871
REPORTER PARK

333
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,298
Oh, wow, Mr. Park, how are you?
Yeah, it's been a while.

334
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,800
Mr. Do, you must be stressed right now.

335
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,510
Yeah, well…

336
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,763
You know, it's not true at all.

337
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,182
Yeah, it'll pass soon, believe me.

338
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,100
Of course, I know it will.

339
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,186
I have a scoop on Mr. Nam's love story.

340
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,773
-Along with solid evidence.
-What?

341
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,692
Let's meet first and talk.
Where are you?

342
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,111
Yes, right now I'm…

343
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,323
-I'm outside the city.
-Then call me once you return.

344
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,700
Yes-- Hey. Hold on.

345
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,578
-What is this?
-It's not me.

346
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,332
I looked all over for photos,
and that one was all I found.

347
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,251
Do you think someone else tipped him off?

348
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,338
Who else would know about you two
from the theater company days?

349
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,091
There is none.

350
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,053
Anyhow, if that reporter
wants to break the story,

351
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,846
please make this clear to Kang-ho.

352
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,515
It's not me.

353
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,278
Looking at the facts,
Mr. Do has to be right.

354
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,282
I had a feeling about Hwang Ji-hye.
I knew she would cause trouble for us.

355
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:33,412
Then the first thing,
we'll pressure the informant.

356
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,374
All right. Let's go fishing.

357
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,751
How do we get her on the hook though?

358
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,045
You just gotta wait
till the fish takes the bait.

359
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,672
Not even Mr. Nam was complaining

360
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,757
about being put up
in a small tourist hotel,

361
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,593
but Ms. Hwang Ji-hye
insisted staying at a five-star hotel.

362
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,262
The show already cost so much to produce,

363
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,264
and she made so much fuss
about sponsored items.

364
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,099
It was a scene
where she had to put on makeup,

365
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,018
but she refused 'cause she thought
she might get a makeup ad offer.

366
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,687
I heard Hwang Ji-hye used profanity

367
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,314
on a crew member who was older
and more experienced than her.

368
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,027
I'm telling you,
that thing with Mr. Nam wasn't us.

369
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:10,031
Well, the show is still playing on TV.
What would we even do this for?

370
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,366
Of course.

371
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,870
Mr. Nam felt bad that the rumor came out
while the show is airing.

372
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,497
We can't let this recording
about Ms. Hwang Ji-hye

373
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,417
get leaked out there.
We have to make sure.

374
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,587
-Are you blackmailing us?
-Uh…

375
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,963
It's not me!

376
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,383
Mr. Yoon, I didn't do it. I'm serious.

377
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,302
Goodness. Did someone accuse you?

378
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,763
We were suspecting that it was Mr. Yoon.

379
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,640
Me?

380
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,769
It seems like Ms. Hwang clearly knows
that Mr. Yoon didn't do this.

381
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,441
I mean… I was just…

382
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,779
I'm sorry!

383
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,782
You're crazy. Are you a moron?
Why are you admitting it?

384
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,327
I should just…

385
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,371
We looked into a few more things,
and it seems you've made other claims.

386
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,789
-Is that right?
-What?

387
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,754
Unpaid wages and abuse.
I'm here to inform you

388
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,007
all of your assets will be frozen
if you're sued or if someone reports you.

389
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,513
I do hope you'll be able to clean up
your own mess in a prompt manner.

390
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,977
Are you new? I don't think
I've seen your face before.

391
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:23,772
Ah, I see…

392
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,440
Let me clear that for you.

393
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,399
SHIN NA-EUN

394
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,360
Na-eun.

395
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,032
Oh! Sorry about that.

396
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,451
-Please give me another one.
-Would you like the same drink?

397
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,452
Okay!

398
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,879
More. More. More. More.
More! More, more, more, more!

399
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,090
Stop! Okay. Okay.

400
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,846
Ah!

401
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,181
Ooh, sour.

402
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,892
Yeah, it's sour. Shin… Shin Na-eun.

403
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,896
You have a pretty face, pretty name too.

404
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,065
Thank you so much.

405
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,945
If he touched me,
I could have reported him for harassment.

406
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,363
Luckily, he didn't.

407
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:17,075
If there's a crash, we should just…
…let him go down.

408
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,662
I don't know if he deserves
to die for it. I mean…

409
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,080
Na-eun!

410
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,207
Hey, it's you!

411
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,376
You're so fine.

412
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,629
Hey, look. It's a phone, hmm?

413
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,215
If you give me your number,

414
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,759
I'll give you a good review.
Cheese! Cheese!

415
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,970
Is that funny?

416
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,556
Hey, keep walking. Go.

417
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,601
-Give me your number! Your number!
-He goes down with the plane. Let him die.

418
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,560
Damn it.

419
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,437
TRANSFER PAGE
181,818

420
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,273
Another rage transfer?

421
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,111
If this had happened at a bar or a club,
I wouldn't be this upset.

422
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,781
Hmm! I'd be like,
"I guess I'm pretty." Know what I mean?

423
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,951
Even at a club, if they talked
to you like that, you'd be upset.

424
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,453
I guess so.

425
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:05,874
But usually, in those places, guys
mentally prepare themselves for rejection.

426
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,501
But in my situation, I have to risk my job

427
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,879
if I were to raise
my voice at him.

428
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,922
You should have taken a selfie with him,

429
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,841
just in case he rolls up
in front of me someday.

430
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,595
And he wasn't even good-looking.
I can't imagine it.

431
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:25,143
You must have fun working
with the cute Nam Kang-ho then.

432
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,228
Do you work for fun?

433
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,565
I would find it more fun to fly
with cute stars on board.

434
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,655
-Why don't we go blow off some steam?
-Where?

435
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,782
Only guys could fix a guy problem.

436
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,661
-Let's go!
-Do you think maybe your logic is broken?

437
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,794
Wow, it's not a bad night, huh?
Starting to feel better now?

438
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,962
Why did you take me here?

439
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,299
I'm too old to waste time
with guys that only have good looks.

440
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,386
Oh, jeez. No one's saying
you need to date anyone.

441
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,554
Enjoy your night with some handsome guys.

442
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,640
Okay!

443
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,990
I wanted to rule over
all men who desired me.

444
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,870
The lighter they treated me,
the harder I punished them.

445
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,707
Did I have a heart-fluttering romance?

446
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,298
Hey! Shin Na-eun!

447
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,552
Whoo! Hey, wow!

448
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,096
-I can't believe it.
-Hey, you need me?

449
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,723
Huh?

450
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,934
A pretty girl
next to another pretty girl!

451
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:51,229
He's the one from the plane today.

452
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:55,191
Oh, I'm sorry
if I offended you earlier.

453
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,861
Guys usually bother and tease pretty girls

454
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,655
in order to get their attention,
you know what I mean?

455
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,741
So then, is this you apologizing?

456
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,660
He isn't. He wants us to hang out
with him. He's being obnoxious.

457
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,829
Oh, come on. Come join me.

458
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,665
Look, I brought back
something fun from America.

459
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,754
-Something fun, huh?
-Yeah, something super fun for us!

460
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,049
What could that be?
I'm really curious.

461
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,176
Mi-ran!

462
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,345
Hang on. I wanna check something.

463
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,097
Whoo!

464
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,807
Come in, come in, come in.

465
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,185
Na-eun, come in. Come over here!

466
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,188
Move!

467
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,074
Stay glued to me.
Don't eat or drink, not even water.

468
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,037
Hey, what are you doing?
Here's your drink. And yours.

469
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,164
Let's drink!

470
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,251
Bottoms up!

471
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,387
What do you think? Solid evidence, right?

472
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,266
Wait a sec. It looks like you didn't know.

473
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,227
You know who the woman is?

474
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,230
To be honest, we weren't paying attention
to Mr. Nam Kang-ho.

475
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,565
We've chased him for years,
but there wasn't anything.

476
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,943
Then someone sent us these photos.

477
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,947
At first, I suspected
they might be edited, but they're real.

478
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,616
So we bought them.
And they weren't cheap either.

479
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,703
Yeah, this is a problem.

480
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,373
You've obviously spent
so much money on this.

481
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,625
I don't think
you could simply cover this up

482
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:39,003
just because I asked you
to keep this story under wraps.

483
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,463
I don't know what to do with this.

484
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,091
Oh, you want this covered up?
I could help you with that.

485
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,051
Huh?

486
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,554
If you check the date,
it was before the gay scandal.

487
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:51,182
Therefore, it'll prove that this
wasn't staged, clearing the rumor.

488
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,934
Then you can clear his name

489
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,478
and humiliate those jerks
who almost ruined him.

490
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,688
It's a win-win.

491
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,648
So you're asking for money.

492
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,149
Oh man.

493
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,987
Wow, I've spent money
on covering up scandals, but this is…

494
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,906
It's not like Mr. Nam committed a crime.

495
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,451
Although it would take years
for a gay rumor to die down.

496
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:14,747
Has there been a gay actor in Korea?
I wonder if they can stay in the business.

497
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,959
No, come on, Mr. Park. Wait up.
Why are you in such a hurry?

498
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,963
I'm in the middle of processing
what it is that you're telling me.

499
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,048
And I was just thinking really hard on it.

500
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,593
I was thinking how much
I should compensate you.

501
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,802
So I was just thinking

502
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,014
if we should discuss more
about those things.

503
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,641
You know what I'm talking about.

504
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,827
That keeps the smell from leaking out.

505
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,376
Man, this is so much fun!

506
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,005
They're on their way, so let's go.
Act natural, 'kay?

507
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,215
-Mmm.
-Shall we go dance?

508
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,800
Sure, yeah.

509
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,428
Where the fuck are you going?

510
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,347
Hey!

511
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,184
Hey, what the fuck is wrong
with you weird bitches anyway?

512
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,270
-You're here for fun, but you don't drink.
-Yeah, we did.

513
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,565
We just drank two shots straight.

514
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,276
So try it with me.

515
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,112
Oh, no, really, it's okay.

516
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,490
We have to use the ladies' room.

517
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,034
Damn it! Just try it once!

518
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,955
This is less dangerous than alcohol.

519
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,123
Try it. Just try this once.

520
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,125
Fuck! I'm telling you it's really fun!

521
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,585
-I don't want to.
-Oh…

522
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,253
Oh, fucking hell!

523
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,173
You're so fucking boring,
you ugly bitches.

524
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,180
Hey!

525
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,033
Ah, no!

526
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,663
Hey!

527
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,423
Na-eun, let's go.

528
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,091
-Yes, ma'am.
-Where are you going?

529
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,135
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

530
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,022
Hey!

531
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,154
What was that?
Who you calling ugly, huh?

532
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,824
Huh? How are we ugly?
Are you stupid and blind?

533
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,871
Oh! Hi, detective.

534
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,790
Waiter!

535
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,126
Please dial 911!

536
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,504
It hurts so much.

537
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,256
Shit.

538
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,509
You'll have to pay
a lot for our compensation.

539
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,053
You'd better be ready!

540
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,138
-Hello!
-Hey!

541
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,307
Shut up!

542
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,018
Gosh, I should have broken his jaw
so he couldn't talk.

543
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,855
Hey, why would you have to pay?
You got these junkies arrested.

544
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,150
The law is stringent like that.
It doesn't work the way we want.

545
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,902
And yet you still beat them up?

546
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,946
How much
would that be anyway?

547
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,366
I didn't break their bones,
so at most, four weeks?

548
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,494
Four weeks is four million.

549
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,038
That's the going rate.
He'll demand more. Unreasonably.

550
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,706
You're unreasonable.

551
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,085
How can you be a lawyer
when you rely on violence like a criminal?

552
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:48,669
Hmm.

553
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,339
Gosh, it's all my fault.
I knew you'd be upset.

554
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,758
I never should have told you.

555
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,806
You're released.

556
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,599
You can stay.

557
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,517
What?

558
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,310
Uh, no.

559
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,732
If we need your statements,
we'll give you a call.

560
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,276
-Sure, anytime. Have a good night.
-Thanks. You too.

561
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,115
Hmm. So this is it?

562
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,282
There's no reward?

563
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,620
That's only if they arrest the sellers,
not those in possession.

564
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,207
With the rent and treatment costs,

565
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,959
don't mess up at work.

566
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,171
Oh! When's Nam Kang-ho paying
for that part-time work?

567
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:34,924
Oh.

568
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,384
I got fired.

569
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,469
Didn't you do one session?

570
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,721
Yeah.

571
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,849
You were fired after just one session?

572
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,476
Yeah.

573
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,398
Did you beat him up like those guys?
Huh? Tore him apart?

574
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,235
No. That's not why I got fired.

575
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:55,987
Then why?

576
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,489
What could be worse than that?

577
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,077
I just thought…
he was really self-centered.

578
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,162
Okay, and…

579
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,166
I called him a jerk.

580
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,042
You called your client a jerk?

581
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,003
-To his face?
-Mm-hmm.

582
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,340
I was crazy to say that to a client.

583
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,925
Even if he wasn't your client,

584
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,137
how can you be so rude
and say that to anyone?

585
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,889
You're right. I made a mistake.

586
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,351
Well, this is a first. You're admitting
you're wrong before a man does.

587
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,312
I didn't tell him I'm sorry yet.

588
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,316
Oh, that's right. I haven't apologized.

589
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,653
What now?

590
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:47,038
The person who crossed the line this time,
it… wasn't the lawyer, was it?

591
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,875
Even if the lawyer was
the one who first seduced you,

592
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,421
this shows you were doing it
at your own will.

593
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,797
Where did you get these?

594
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,051
Who's the reporter? How much? I'll pay.

595
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,511
You didn't have an attack?

596
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,389
-It was all good?
-Yeah.

597
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,809
-I don't know how.
-Huh?

598
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,023
So then what?

599
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,942
What happened with you two? Tell me.

600
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,860
That was it. It's nothing.

601
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,572
-Why?
-What do you mean, why?

602
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,575
Why… why stop at first base?
You should have kept going.

603
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,535
You said that she liked you too.

604
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,330
She doesn't like me, okay?

605
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,085
Huh?

606
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,628
Wasn't she your fan?

607
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,381
Is every fan supposed to want to date me?

608
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,676
What? Why are you overreacting?

609
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,718
She rejected you?

610
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,055
Hey, did she reject you and…

611
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,808
You fired her 'cause you were angry?

612
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,403
ATTORNEY YEO MI-RAN

613
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,203
Hey.

614
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,706
I sincerely apologize.

615
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,624
I'm really sorry.

616
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,794
I'm also sorry. I've offended you.

617
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,338
I ruined your birthday. I'm very sorry.

618
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,299
Oh, no.

619
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,718
I'm the one
who made you misunderstand things.

620
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,052
I also made a mistake with you.

621
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,764
MISTAKE

622
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,435
Yes, it was. I was overreacting
when I called that fan service.

623
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,062
FAN SERVICE

624
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,439
Oh, I almost forgot.

625
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,357
I'll deposit your pay
for the part-time work.

626
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,151
Oh, okay. Thanks for your time.

627
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,861
I know you have a lot going on.

628
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,782
What do you mean? Um, the things
they say about me, it's not true.

629
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,577
Oh! Yeah, sure. Of course.

630
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,078
All right, then…

631
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,163
Bye.

632
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,419
What's that about? Seriously.

633
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,173
-Does she have a boyfriend?
-You scared me! Jesus Christ!

634
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,549
Can I have some privacy, please?

635
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:07,386
Okay, so… she rejected you
'cause she has a boyfriend?

636
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,766
I'm sure you're not gay.
Not with that kind of fan service.

637
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,643
It's a tough job being a top star.

638
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,732
Hi, good morning.

639
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,236
CEO DO WON-JUN
J BAR

640
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,405
For members only?

641
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,660
Why did you want to see me here?

642
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,789
First, we should have a drink.

643
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,675
Cheers.

644
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,135
Oh! Oh, yeah.

645
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,768
I heard that Kang-ho

646
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,188
has made a mistake in front of you.

647
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,818
Was there an issue?

648
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,113
I'm saying this
so that we can be on the same page.

649
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,615
It seemed to me
that you really liked Kang-ho.

650
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,701
Probably why he did that
without thinking he'd be rejected.

651
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,330
-Isn't that true?
-What did he do?

652
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,624
I don't know how to put it.

653
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:22,044
Like a gesture that shows… he likes you?

654
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,422
Mr. Nam Kang-ho said he likes me?

655
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,758
What, he did that without telling you
he liked you? What an asshole.

656
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:32,138
Wait, he said that he told me
he likes me, and I rejected him?

657
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,347
You didn't reject him?

658
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,100
Were you playing hard to get or something?

659
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,894
No way. I'm not that kind of person.

660
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,812
Ah…

661
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,235
Are you disappointed right now?

662
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,072
Yeah. I really wish
that you could be a happy couple.

663
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,159
I just hate
to see you guys like this.

664
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,707
-But you said you didn't trust me though.
-What?

665
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,625
I heard it all, on the speakerphone.

666
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:05,504
Uh… Oh, back then, there was
a misunderstanding on my part.

667
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,214
I'm sorry.

668
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,634
Mmm. So tell me then,
has it been resolved?

669
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,554
Since nothing's been done to clear it.

670
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,531
Okay, if you look at this,

671
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:36,076
well, it does appear
that Kang-ho made the move here, right?

672
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,703
Who… who took this photo?

673
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,747
An anonymous informant.

674
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,916
I got this copy from a reporter I know.

675
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,293
Has this already gotten out?

676
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,294
Probably.

677
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,005
This is insane.

678
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,634
We can take legal action.
You want me to block it?

679
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,931
I don't. Could you just…
admit to everything, maybe?

680
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,644
Kang-ho's… lover.

681
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,443
Oh, why can't you say it?

682
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,446
Just say, "It turns out
the informant was incorrect."

683
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,950
Why can't you just go ahead and say it?

684
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:20,371
Oh gosh. You can't just take back
something you gave us.

685
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,249
That's why you should have been
more prudent about things.

686
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,917
Listen to me right now.

687
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,878
Whether it's fake or not,
we run with it, okay?

688
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,131
And you do know that we live and die
by our credibility, right?

689
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,384
 What did you say?

690
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,886
-Hello? Hello?
-What?

691
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,513
NAM KANG-HO'S LATE-NIGHT DATE, WITH WHO?

692
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,641
That's why I told you
not to break stories without checking!

693
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,185
Ah, shit, Hwang Ji-hye.

694
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,397
NAM KANG-HO HAS A SECRET GIRLFRIEND!

695
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,690
NAM ADMITS IT?
AGENCY KEEPS MUM

696
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,441
WHO IS IT IN THE PHOTO? A CELEBRITY?

697
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,568
GIRLFRIEND, NOT A CELEBRITY

698
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,571
I knew he wasn't gay!

699
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,323
Wow, I knew he wasn't, but then… Huh?

700
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,284
He's with her?

701
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,285
Huh?

702
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,329
Where have I seen her?

703
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,747
I've seen her before.

704
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,833
Where did I see this chick?

705
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,337
Ah!

706
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,006
NAM'S GIRLFRIEND
PRESUMED NONCELEBRITY

707
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:36,113
So could it be true,
that someone's watching us?

708
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,659
-Maybe.
-Then we should put on a show.

709
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,678
Your seat belt.

710
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:01,847
Uh…

711
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,600
My seat belt.
