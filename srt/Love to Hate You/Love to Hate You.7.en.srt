00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,609
Mm.

3
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,323
Is this enough,
or do you want to go a little longer?

4
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,953
Just a little longer.

5
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,546
Oh.

6
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,717
Oh.

7
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,219
It's revenge.

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,138
He still hates me…

9
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,600
…and he likes me… still.

TRIGONOMETRY: THE LOVE TRIANGLE EDITION

11
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,781
Um… I think this… should be good enough.

12
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,163
Okay, then, see you later.

13
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,583
Can I give you a ride though?

14
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,753
-Where to?
-Your house.

15
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,671
All the way to Seoul?

16
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,092
I feel bad
that you had to come all the way here.

17
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,388
Oh, it's fine.
You have an early start tomorrow.

18
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,641
Get some rest.

19
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,230
Uh…

20
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,900
But still, there's no way
that I could let you walk alone.

21
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,319
Why does he keep acting so sweet?

22
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,323
Oh!

23
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,165
Be safe.

24
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,416
I'll call you.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,835
Yeah.

26
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,014
-Take her home safely.
-Yes, sir.

27
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,232
You must be tired. Get some sleep.

28
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,985
I'll wake you up when we arrive.

29
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,987
Okay, thanks a lot.

30
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,632
Hey.

31
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,426
You wanted to talk?

32
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,596
Wow, this could become
one of the best scenes.

33
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,848
What does your girlfriend really do?

34
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,893
Oh, is she the thug
you said was teaching you?

35
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,604
-Yes, that's her.
-Whoa, that's wild.

36
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,566
I noticed earlier that she could do
the scene in a single take, probably.

37
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,152
She's good, huh?
She's pretty tough.

38
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,744
So, I was thinking…
The director would like her to…

39
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,851
I was too arrogant.
I underestimated him.

40
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,521
He's called
the "God of Romance," after all.

41
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,818
But you won't get anything out of me.

42
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,738
Because I'm the goddess of deception.

43
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,952
NAM KANG-HO

44
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,290
Huh! Hm! Hm! Hm.

45
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,044
Hello?

46
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,129
Did I wake you up?

47
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,214
Ah, no.

48
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,258
Just laying down, you know?

49
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,260
Ah.

50
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,139
Is something the matter?

51
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,349
Uh…

52
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,061
The director said he wants
to keep you on as the stunt double.

53
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,522
Oh my gosh, thank you!

54
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,320
I'll talk to the law firm
about my schedule tomorrow.

55
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,905
They'll probably be okay.

56
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,907
Thanks to you, I'm considered a VIP.

57
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,035
-Oh, is that so?
-Yeah, as the VIP's girlfriend.

58
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,912
We can keep it going if you'd like.

59
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,749
No. No!

60
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,793
Keep it going?

61
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,045
Like continue to be his girlfriend?

62
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,137
Well, then, I'll, uh…
I'll give you a ring.

63
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,393
Shit.

64
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,898
Mm. He's almost mine.

65
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,901
Poor little thing.

66
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,799
An entertainment company
is not that wealthy.

67
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,843
Don't let the looks deceive you.

68
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,139
You should be looking
for husband material, you crazy idiot.

69
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,188
It's not fair. Why is he so handsome?

70
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,564
Um, who is it?

71
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,025
Are you up?

72
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,110
Yeah, but why aren't you at work?

73
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,196
Are you really awake? It's Saturday.

74
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,365
-Oh.
-Come on out. Let's eat.

75
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,916
Really? Not a sample
but an actual published book?

76
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,628
That's right. So the publisher
picked up my book… Hi.

77
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,338
…out of 30 other ones.

78
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,757
Wow, amazing! Mom, congrats!

79
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,636
So, I'm wondering,
for an endorsement deal,

80
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,721
you think it's all right
to ask Kang-ho for that?

81
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,722
-Hi.
-Hi.

82
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,058
What, a celebrity endorsement?

83
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,143
That just seems…

84
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,312
I don't think asking would be that bad.

85
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,232
You didn't even tell me first
that you were dating Nam Kang-ho.

86
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,025
I had to find out from everyone else.

87
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,444
You're dating,
but you haven't even brought him home yet.

88
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,822
When have I ever brought home
a boyfriend before?

89
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,865
Oh, Mom. Are you mad?

90
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,410
Please don't be mad at me.

91
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,537
When your book gets published,
I'll throw you a party.

92
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,497
Mom, you're so cool. Bye!

93
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,208
Yeah, sure.

94
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,710
Have a good day!

95
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,757
Hey, my mom got a book deal.

96
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,176
It's picked up
by the culture center writing workshop.

97
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,470
Mm. Oh yeah? Wow.

98
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,018
-What?
-It's Do Won-jun, am I right?

99
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,397
I knew it.

100
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,692
You're a sucker for cute guys.
The way you look means one thing.

101
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,194
The man you last met
was Do Won-jun.

102
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,197
He is super good-looking,
and he picked you up at the airport.

103
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,660
He did that to keep tabs on you, right?
To shut your mouth.

104
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,665
Are you upset?

105
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,960
Look, Nam Kang-ho is
the type of guy that you could get. Me?

106
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,131
Yeah, we're in different leagues,
you and I.

107
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,716
Hey!

108
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,551
You break the hearts
of every guy you meet,

109
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,303
and I get my heart broken every time.

110
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,847
Obviously, I'm the one with issues.

111
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,848
Ah.

112
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,143
That's because I'm mean
and you're just too nice.

113
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,771
You don't spend a dime on yourself and let
all these men take advantage of you.

114
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,191
It makes me mad, that's all.

115
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,985
I'm sorry if I'd upset you.

116
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,530
But this Do Won-jun,
I don't know much about.

117
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,908
At least his intentions aren't pure.

118
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,494
Just look at how he talked me
into that agreement.

119
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,370
You don't know, so don't say anything bad.

120
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,165
You don't know this man.
It wouldn't hurt to be suspicious of him.

121
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,709
Sure, you're probably right.
What do I know?

122
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,921
Hey!

123
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,842
Yes, Mr. Ko. This is Yeo Mi-ran.
You have a second?

124
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,637
I also have
something to discuss with you.

125
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,056
The penalty is three times the amount.

126
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,225
Choi Soo-jin's actions
damaged the brand's image,

127
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,434
which led to a drop in sales.

128
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,853
And the cost to reshoot the commercial is…

129
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,440
…three billion won.

130
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,529
We can't change the penalty,
but we have to dispute the rest.

131
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,990
I wish I could go with you,

132
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,743
but I've had some bad blood
with one of their executives.

133
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,078
It's best I'm not there.

134
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,456
How much lower is a good defense?

135
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,626
The lower the better.
As much as you can. Hmm?

136
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,628
Let's see what you got.

137
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,259
-Oh, hey, really good stuff.
-Good work today.

138
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,427
-Good job today.
-Thank you. Have a good one.

139
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,222
Hi.

140
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,227
-Do you know what's the matter with Se-na?
-What do you mean?

141
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,853
Well, she's crying over there.

142
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,147
Her stylist doesn't know
what's wrong either.

143
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,653
Yeah. I'll see what's up.

144
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,033
Se-na.

145
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,997
Oh, hi.

146
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,667
Got something to share?

147
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,087
-I don't.
-Well, then what are you crying about?

148
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,381
Well, can I just be honest with you?

149
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,218
Okay.

150
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,386
Yesterday,

151
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,097
I was watching you.

152
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,099
With her.

153
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,351
I could tell it was genuine.

154
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,186
How does it feel?

155
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,813
Does it feel good?

156
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,399
Because you're breaking my heart.

157
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,738
-Se-na.
-Hmm?

158
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,786
Let's act like pros here.
What do you say? Know what I mean?

159
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,042
Don't keep your stylist waiting. Come on.

160
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,050
Is he really with that woman?

161
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,386
Oh no.

162
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,596
Damn it!

163
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,556
Why won't you pick up your phone?

164
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,475
Yeah, sorry, sorry.
I was kind of busy today.

165
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,894
Busy doing what?
Meeting your girlfriend?

166
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,313
No, I was shooting the film
and just got home.

167
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,899
-I'm out with my friends now.
-Yeah? With your friends?

168
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,110
-Take us out to eat.
-Sure. I said I'd buy you dinner, right?

169
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,195
We're so hungry.

170
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,072
I haven't eaten
since you promised us.

171
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,366
- We're starving.
-Take us out now.

172
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,450
Right now?

173
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,244
-Cheese!
-One, two, three.

174
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,081
It came out so well.

175
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,124
-It's great!
-You're so handsome.

176
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,169
-You're really gorgeous.
-Oh, you look so young.

177
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,921
You look like her brother, not her uncle.

178
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,339
Okay, eat up.

179
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,550
Next time when I get another chance,
I'll take you out to eat again.

180
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,177
Just take care of Ji-woo, yeah?

181
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,804
Brother is a bit much.

182
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,722
He's an uncle. An uncle.

183
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,768
Your girlfriend is
that lady from before, right?

184
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,686
Huh?

185
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,438
Oh. How did you know?

186
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,942
I could tell by her clothes.
She has the same clothes in the picture.

187
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,735
-The picture?
-We all saw it too.

188
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,530
Oh.

189
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,199
-Thanks for the food!
-Nice to meet you.

190
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,035
-Keep up your studies.
-Okay, goodbye.

191
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,036
Yeah, goodbye.

192
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,997
-Okay, yeah.
-Yeah. Okay, bye. Gosh.

193
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,375
-Bye, uncle.
-Yeah, you be safe. Bye.

194
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,173
How far are you going? Ah!

195
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,513
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

196
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,014
Whoo!

197
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,483
Oh, I'm getting the hang of this!

198
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,068
You're good!

199
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,486
Wait for me, wait for me!

200
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,752
-I got him, I got him.
-Why is it so hard to beat?

201
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,505
Come out, come out.
I'll cover you!

202
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,965
There's a zombie!

203
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,301
Die!

204
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,304
-Over here!
-Oh! Die, die, die, die!

205
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,557
Whoo!

206
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,184
They're dead!

207
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,977
Okay!

208
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,647
Wow, that was a close one.

209
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,400
Even in a VR game.

210
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,902
Ah, seriously.

211
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,029
You were awesome. That was so good.

212
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,908
Since they're a new company,

213
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,993
I charged them half
of what I normally would.

214
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:09,079
They want three billion?
And what, their sales dropped?

215
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,082
That's a stinking lie.
Those dirty bastards.

216
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,212
Are you still mad?
Do you want another round?

217
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,588
Kill some more zombies?

218
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,466
Do you have time? You're not busy?

219
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,176
Well, I'm always busy.

220
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,596
I don't know what trouble you'll get into.
That's why I'm watching.

221
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,890
Couldn't you just say
that you like hanging out with me?

222
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,267
'Cause I like hanging out with you.

223
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,894
I like hanging out with you too.

224
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,897
And, uh, let's keep playing.

225
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,483
As for the work, Ms. Yeo will handle it.

226
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,819
So there's nothing
we need to worry about, right?

227
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,113
Didn't you used to not trust her?
What's up with the change of attitude?

228
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,907
Well, Kang-ho likes her a lot.

229
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,410
At first, I thought she was
just another girl pestering him.

230
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,580
Then I guess Mr. Do must be lonely?

231
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,083
Since your best friend has a girlfriend.

232
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:55,960
I suppose so.

233
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:00,464
Why don't you go out with someone then?
Do you really not have anyone you like?

234
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,884
It's funny…

235
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,472
…I was like,
"I'll meet women once I make it,"

236
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,642
and then I started to feel
like I could meet even better women

237
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,727
if I made it huge.

238
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,107
I'll be against any girl
that you bring in front of me,

239
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,692
no matter what she has to say.

240
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,818
Oh, why?

241
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,946
'Cause I'm jealous.
She gets to have you all to herself.

242
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,118
Oh man. So that's why
you keep getting yourself into trouble.

243
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,497
You want me all to yourself
by making me worry.

244
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:37,960
Ooh! That's a good idea.
I'll just cause more trouble for you then.

245
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,920
Then your contract won't renew.

246
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,672
Mm.

247
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,632
I'll stay out of trouble, okay?

248
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,093
Once my divorce is finalized,

249
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:49,513
I'm going to find myself
a really nice guy. Better than you.

250
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,850
What, you want to find love again
even after being burnt?

251
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,394
It's not the love.
It's the people that are bad.

252
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,980
Yeah.

253
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,400
And it's out there.
You just gotta chase it.

254
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,988
Don't just waste your life away.
Find someone to love.

255
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,157
Hm.

256
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,705
Please take
all this down nice and clean.

257
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,125
And remove those over there too.

258
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,632
The fact that she was going through
a divorce had a negative impact on us,

259
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,841
but we looked past that.

260
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,470
But going to a detention center
after an intentional car crash?

261
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,930
That doesn't leave us many options.

262
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,264
We realize that as well.

263
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,600
We want transparency
regarding the damages.

264
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,854
We'll be needing your sales
and profit data for the past five years.

265
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,523
Uh, I don't think so.

266
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,194
I mean, do we have to disclose
our business profit rate?

267
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:49,406
If we don't settle and take this to court,
you'll have to disclose all that anyway.

268
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,868
Especially if your sales
aren't looking good. Here's the precedent.

269
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,829
"Considering the past five years
of tax returns, financial statements,

270
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,749
and accounting records,
despite the decrease in sales this year,

271
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,751
based on the recent economic trends,

272
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,836
the court does not find
any visible evidence

273
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,589
that the said celebrity
has caused sales to drop."

274
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,300
"We conclude that
the said celebrity's direct contribution

275
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,179
to the decline in sales cannot be proven
by any person here today."

276
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,516
As you're aware,

277
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,435
the court most likely will take
a conservative stance,

278
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,854
so we'll end up wasting
each other's resources,

279
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,439
and we wouldn't want that.

280
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,609
And even if you had
a partial win in the case,

281
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,197
which celebrity would want to work
for your company? Not a good look.

282
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,534
Oh my God. My precious baby!

283
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,081
Oh my Lord!

284
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,541
Sir, sir, sir, sir, sir.

285
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,167
She's not your precious baby

286
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,670
but Nam Kang-ho's little sweetheart.

287
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,630
That's right. Sorry, sorry.

288
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,716
You didn't have to say that.

289
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,844
This is the reason
why I don't hire female lawyers, you know.

290
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:56,598
-Mr. Yang is old-school.
-You're old-school. We're progressive.

291
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,558
Come on.

292
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,852
Honestly, how can I not be excited
right now?

293
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,063
She shaved off
two out of three billion on the case.

294
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,690
Yeah!

295
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,485
Shaving off the damages by half
isn't an easy thing to do, but she did it.

296
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,780
Ah! She shaved off billions
in just one swing!

297
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,282
That much in just one swing!

298
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:17,828
I always thought you had a beautiful face,
but your work's the most beautiful thing.

299
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,831
Now, with this outcome,

300
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,168
I'm sure Ms. Choi will give us
a bit extra, right? More than 20%?

301
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,754
She's not stingy
when it comes to contingency fees.

302
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,631
Maybe like 30%, I'm guessing?

303
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,009
That's right! At least 600 million!

304
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,802
-Yeah!
-Yay!

305
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,513
Yeah, well, then, what kind of bonus

306
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,265
should we give to Yeo Mi-ran?

307
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,226
-Bonus, sir?
-Tell us. Don't be shy.

308
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,395
Uh…

309
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,314
If you could allow it,

310
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,525
in terms of schedule,
more flexibility would help me out.

311
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,027
Flexibility?

312
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,361
Yeah.

313
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,907
Yes. I was in Kang-ho's movie
as Oh Se-na's stunt double for a scene,

314
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,284
and they want me to continue.

315
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,368
Oh Se-na?

316
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,288
You're doing that on top of being
Kang-ho's training partner?

317
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,791
It just kinda happened
that way.

318
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,835
If it's Oh Se-na…
…you don't even have to ask that!

319
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:12,091
Oh, if you could make her our VIP client
and have her come work with us,

320
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,885
I would truly appreciate it so very much.

321
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,804
Much appreciated.

322
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,514
-If she gets into trouble…
-Yeah.

323
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,265
…that will be the jackpot! Bingo!

324
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,184
That's right!

325
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,437
We hired ourselves someone
with the most amazing connections!

326
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,356
-A moneymaker!
-Lucky charm!

327
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,607
Oh my goodness!

328
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,859
A lucky charm! Our precious!

329
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,279
This job feeds
off the misfortunes of others.

330
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,997
That's it!

331
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,875
I can break this spell
with another cute face.

332
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,295
He may be quite good-looking
but not as cute as Nam Kang-ho, right?

333
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,677
Hey. You're home now.

334
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,803
Uh…

335
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,723
-Are you still mad at me?
-I wasn't mad.

336
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,102
But you know…

337
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,479
So Nam Kang-ho, we still haven't met yet.

338
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,274
-Huh?
-I mean, I'm your best friend and all.

339
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,442
If someone asks if I've met Nam Kang-ho,

340
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,154
it'll be weird to say
I haven't met him yet.

341
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:16,989
Uh…

342
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,369
Well, that's true, but…
Kang-ho is busy doing a movie right now.

343
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,455
Then, um, can I tag along
when you go in for your role?

344
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,709
When will I ever have a chance
to see something like that, hmm?

345
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,796
It's okay. It's fine if you don't want to.

346
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,882
Oh, no!

347
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,967
Of course. I'll ask.

348
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,385
Hello.

349
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,890
Yeah, it's cool.

350
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,145
I was worried about you being bored
on standby by yourself anyway.

351
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,105
Mm. She could keep you company here.

352
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,151
Shouldn't we buy a drink for everyone?

353
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,904
I feel bad not bringing anything.

354
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,405
Are you my manager?

355
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,408
Also, one thing, stay close to me
so I can keep an eye on you.

356
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,453
You're a bossy stunt double.

357
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,105
Cut!

358
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,863
You got rid of that prim and proper look.
A self-taught dirty fighter,

359
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,157
a back-alley thug! That's what I'm saying!

360
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,786
You okay?

361
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,043
Wow, that was amazing!

362
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,796
Yeah. Wow, excellent work. Yeah.

363
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,383
Being on set is so cool.

364
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,137
Oh!

365
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,222
There he is.

366
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,353
Wow, that's what he looks like
even when he's taking a break?

367
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,729
I know.

368
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,107
Why does he look that good all the time?

369
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,860
Wait, why is he here as well?

370
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,570
Hey. You all right?

371
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:25,242
Yeah. Well, at least you stay
out of trouble unlike someone I know.

372
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,410
Hm? Huh?

373
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,038
-Hey, isn't that Na-eun?
-Yeah.

374
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,623
I told Mi-ran to bring her.

375
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,875
She'll be bored
with all that standby time.

376
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,672
-How are you doing?
-Oh, how are you?

377
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,134
Wow, you're such an amazing girlfriend
for Kang-ho.

378
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:46,221
You even fill in for a stunt double
in his movie.

379
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,890
Oh, I'm flattered.

380
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,684
Uh, have you been… well too?

381
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,519
Yes.

382
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,688
Hello. Thank you for coming.

383
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:58,150
Thanks for having me here.
Meeting you is a privilege.

384
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,360
You know, actually,
I was gonna call you soon.

385
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,737
Is that right?

386
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,156
Yeah, we should grab a bite, you know.

387
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,575
We didn't get a chance to last time.

388
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,202
It's quite all right.

389
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,997
My lips are sealed,
so you don't have to worry.

390
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,833
Hm.

391
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,585
You're being so obvious.

392
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,338
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

393
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,422
-Ah, here.
-Brr!

394
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,965
-I need this coffee.
-Thank you.

395
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,342
-What are you getting?
-Tea.

396
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,052
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

397
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,222
-It's cold.
-Here, have some bread too.

398
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,349
Thanks a lot.

399
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,560
By the way, why is
his girlfriend standing in for Oh Se-na?

400
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,312
You know that's just nepotism.

401
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,689
Honestly, you don't need
a stunt double for that.

402
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,233
I think they just wanna spend
some more time together.

403
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,694
I heard she's a lawyer.
Doesn't she work?

404
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,529
Oh, never mind
about the girlfriend.

405
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,574
What's wrong with Nam Kang-ho?
He can't separate life and work?

406
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,910
You want me to even cover
the running scene?

407
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,246
Yeah. Oh Se-na, uh, runs a bit strange.

408
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,665
Kind of like this.

409
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,429
No way.

410
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,183
No joke. I'll block the scene
with you later, so stay here.

411
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,393
-Sure.
-All right?

412
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,562
Long time no see.

413
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,440
And you're…

414
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,944
Ah, the fan club president!

415
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,028
Yeah.

416
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,447
Any chance you have
a second to talk right now?

417
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,661
Do you know that people
who work here don't like you?

418
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,329
-That so?
-Yeah.

419
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,624
They've been saying that you're following
your boyfriend around at work.

420
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,214
I'm not following him around.

421
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,801
The director has asked me to help,
to handle Oh Se-na's stunt work.

422
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,595
Does anyone here
really consider you a stunt performer?

423
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,264
You're just Kang-ho's main squeeze.

424
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,183
Even if you genuinely did come here
for that reason,

425
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,978
in this business,
they don't care what the truth is.

426
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,439
It's all about
what everyone thinks of you.

427
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,649
You know those actors
who used to be at the top

428
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,359
and got ruined because of bad marriages?

429
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,279
One could say it's 'cause of
the unlikable women they got married to.

430
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,990
So are you saying that I'm unlikable?

431
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:13,368
I'm just telling you
to be careful not to be unlikable.

432
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,661
For the sake of Kang-ho.

433
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,372
You love him, don't you?

434
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,127
Oh well. You may not like hearing this,
but I'm sorry to overstep.

435
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,795
Actually, I'm not overstepping.

436
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,132
I can tell you things like this
because he could break up with you

437
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,469
whenever he wants to, but we, as fans,
will always be by his side.

438
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,137
Through thick and thin.

439
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,809
You know, his makeup
looks a bit unusual today.

440
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,686
-I guess that's on me.
-Dude.

441
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,022
All that glitters is not gold.

442
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,734
If he admitted it himself,
it means he really isn't all that.

443
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,819
This time you have
a lot of action scenes, so you…

444
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,071
Damn it, he's not all that.

445
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,241
But he is just so hot.

446
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,619
Can you help me tighten this a little?

447
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,002
He's walking over.

448
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,504
What do I do?

449
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,256
Don't come here. Don't come closer!

450
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,469
You thought it'd be fun,
but it's boring, right?

451
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,638
Oh, no, I'm having fun.

452
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,224
Listen, it's gonna be dinner soon.

453
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,559
The crew will be eating
from the food truck.

454
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,436
Wanna go out for dinner?

455
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,856
Hey, so, you seriously don't have
to worry about me, you know?

456
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,650
How can I not worry about you?

457
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,653
You're Kang-ho's girlfriend's best friend.
That makes you important to him.

458
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,112
Of course I gotta take care of you.

459
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:36,117
Huh, how about I come up
with some choices and see what you like?

460
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,371
Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Western.

461
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,039
It's your choice.

462
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,165
Mm.

463
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,168
Uh… anything less than 10,000.

464
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,169
What?

465
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,964
I'd feel uncomfortable
with anything more expensive.

466
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:52,884
Hello.

467
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,517
Have you eaten yet?

468
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,398
Does anyone here
really consider you a stunt performer?

469
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,400
You're just Kang-ho's main squeeze.

470
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,742
I feel this sense of duty
to change their minds.

471
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,787
I'm not doing for Kang-ho's image

472
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,247
but for the honor of women!

473
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,798
Stop right there! Get her!

474
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,567
Cut!

475
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,652
That was badass!

476
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,488
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was supposed to let them grab me.

477
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,240
You're running way too fast.

478
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,326
There's too much distance
between you guys.

479
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,995
Hey! Why are you guys so slow?

480
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,247
-You have to pee?
-Sorry, sir.

481
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,292
What? Stop pretending to catch her
and really catch her!

482
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,209
Yes, sir.

483
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,337
Your running form is way too pro.

484
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,797
Se-na isn't an athlete.

485
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,967
-I know, I'm sorry.
-Get it right!

486
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,136
-Yes, sir.
-One more time.

487
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,097
-We'll go again. Let's go again.
-All right.

488
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,810
I'm stuck here
with just him again.

489
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,228
It's killing me.

490
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,942
Here. Have some of this.

491
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,654
Seriously?

492
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,782
Even his hands look so good.

493
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:39,699
Here, this too.

494
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,242
I'll… I'll do it myself.

495
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,202
No, no, no.

496
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,080
Only one of us
can get our hands dirty.

497
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:45,997
Please eat.

498
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,048
Oh, are shrimp just not your thing?

499
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,135
Is this less than 10,000 won?

500
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:03,473
Uh… I told the restaurant
we're filming around the corner,

501
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,684
and they gave us
a discount on our food.

502
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,435
So we'd bring the crew.

503
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,603
You liar.

504
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,939
He is a liar.

505
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,982
At least his intentions
aren't pure.

506
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,026
Just look at how
he talked me into that agreement.

507
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,239
If I can't stop myself
from falling for this guy,

508
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:22,033
then I just need to stop him
from falling for me.

509
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,456
No, you must not like
the food at this place.

510
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,499
Mm.

511
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,920
You can be honest with me.
Exactly how much does this cost?

512
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:39,634
I already told you that I'd like it
to be less than 10,000 won each.

513
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,971
So I guess
you're not used to showing respect.

514
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,806
Uh, no, no.

515
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,435
I mean, this is
my first time treating you.

516
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,894
Ten thousand won seemed--

517
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,479
Ah.

518
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,232
So you don't think it's good enough?

519
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,194
A lunch typically costs
between 7,000 to 8,000 won.

520
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,656
You think 10,000 won is cheap,
don't you?

521
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,575
You think I'm stupid, huh?

522
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,493
This looks easily over 30,000 won.

523
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,537
Didn't you say it's not how it looks?

524
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,914
That on paper, you're broke?

525
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:15,378
Oh, it's totally okay to spend
the company's money. That's right.

526
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,465
Keep that up,
your business is bound to fail.

527
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:22,093
Oh no, what have I done now?
He hasn't done anything to me.

528
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:26,806
Oh, are you… referring
to what I said before about my business?

529
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,933
Is that what this is about?

530
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,103
You were worried about that?

531
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,108
Wow, you're so cute.

532
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,569
Aw, you're so sweet.

533
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,156
I'm not that sweet.

534
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,074
I don't worry about just anyone.

535
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,967
What's funny?

536
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,011
I mean, I'm not "just anyone,"

537
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,138
so I guess that's a good thing?

538
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,100
Seriously?
Did I just tell him that I like him?

539
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,311
Hey, come on, eat up.

540
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,188
I'm not struggling that badly.

541
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,907
-Hey! Stop right there!
-Stop right there!

542
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,991
Stop!

543
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,959
Cut! Cut! Okay, guys,
we'll set up for the next scene.

544
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,962
I didn't watch. I thought
you'd feel nervous if I were watching.

545
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,964
Did something happen?

546
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,800
There was a mistake,
but it wasn't a problem.

547
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,094
-You need me down there?
-No, no, no.

548
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,846
Just concentrate on filming your scenes.

549
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,681
-Okay, I will.
-Bye.

550
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:52,851
Hello there.

551
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,519
Uh…

552
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,479
Oh, hello.

553
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,567
I didn't properly introduce myself.
You're Kang-ho's girlfriend, am I right?

554
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,861
Uh… yeah.

555
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,154
I was so surprised
because you were so good.

556
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,699
Oh, I didn't do all that much.

557
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,993
But what shocked me even more was

558
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,204
that you and Kang-ho
are actually together.

559
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,372
Ah…

560
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,958
Uh, yeah.

561
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,345
Isn't he wonderful?

562
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,263
Huh?

563
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,267
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-You don't have to worry about me.

564
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,271
He's really good
at separating life and work.

565
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,774
He's someone you can trust.

566
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,155
He didn't tell you about me?

567
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:48,948
About you…

568
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,954
That we used to date.

569
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,667
Oh no. He really didn't tell you?

570
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,421
It's not like him
to hide things like that.

571
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,593
Oh, this is bad.

572
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:13,181
If he didn't tell you,
I shouldn't have said anything.

573
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,434
The thing is…

574
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,730
we were first loves.

575
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,775
But it was a very long time ago.

576
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,443
Oh Se-na.

577
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,737
"Every Man's First Love."

578
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,031
She's Nam Kang-ho's first love?

579
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,284
That's right.
"Every Man's First Love"

580
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,078
is your boyfriend's first love.

581
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,082
Oh, I see now.

582
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,166
I didn't know.

583
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,125
I'm so sorry.

584
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,461
No, no. There's no need.

585
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,712
Oh man.

586
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,174
I think he wanted to keep it a secret.

587
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,177
I don't think I was supposed to tell you.

588
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,471
I won't say anything.
Don't worry about it.

589
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,265
I messed up again.

590
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,979
I was terrible.
I did a lot of bad things to him.

591
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,486
I have a lot to be sorry about

592
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,279
towards Kang-ho.

593
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,620
She likes him.

594
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,915
She still likes Nam Kang-ho.

595
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,751
I'm not okay.

596
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,837
All right,
we're rolling.

597
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,052
-Hold it tight.
-Kang-ho, ready?

598
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,013
-Yes. A little more.
-Okay.

599
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,432
-Wire team, are you ready?
-We're ready!

600
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,183
All right, rolling!

601
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,353
Ready? Action!

602
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,233
You're taking
a moment to breathe.

603
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,777
You're slowly making your way up.

604
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,658
Yes, it's good. Good.

605
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,582
Okay, Kang-ho.

606
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,543
As you climb,
you're getting angrier.

607
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,174
You're climbing
faster and faster.

608
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,302
You're getting filled with rage!

609
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,679
You're climbing faster! Keep going!

610
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,016
Faster! More! Just a bit more!

611
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,691
Whoa!

612
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,251
What happened?

613
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,294
Huh? Ms. Yeo!

614
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,175
Ms. Yeo, are you okay?

615
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,802
Can someone help her?

616
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,930
Are you all right? Huh?

617
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,724
Wait a second. What happened to you?

618
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,268
Ow, that does hurt a little.

619
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,520
Oh, she's bleeding!

620
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,313
Call 911! 911!

621
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,148
911! Hurry up, hurry!

622
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,983
Get on my back!

623
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,080
He should've looked back
and stopped,

624
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,082
but he kept his eyes forward
and wasn't careful.

625
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,088
If she hadn't gone
to spot him,

626
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,257
everyone else would have fallen down too.

627
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,350
Oh shit!

628
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,687
If they had let go of the rope,
you'd have fallen straight down.

629
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,440
She must've noticed that and jumped in.

630
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,193
I mean, she could have died
from doing that, you know?

631
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,238
She's that foolish of a woman?

632
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,448
I think her shoulder's really injured.

633
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,955
This is gonna sting.

634
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,132
Hm, you can really handle pain.

635
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,183
-Are you okay?
-Huh?

636
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,936
Of course, yeah.

637
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,189
Why are you here? What about the shoot?

638
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,566
Who cares about that? Just look at you!

639
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,152
It'll take
more than this to kill me.

640
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,528
Actually, no.

641
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,198
You really could have died.
It's no laughing matter.

642
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,909
When someone's gonna die,
I'm supposed to stand and watch?

643
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,828
See? Look at her.
She knew exactly how dangerous it was.

644
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,415
Forget it.
My girlfriend is a very stubborn person.

645
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,417
Find someone else
for the rest of the shoot.

646
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,961
Wait, is it okay for the lead
to fire someone like this?

647
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,296
Can he do that?

648
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,798
If it weren't for me,
you wouldn't even be here!

649
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,384
You shouldn't have asked me to begin with.
Why'd you bring me here

650
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,470
and turn me into a coward? Am I right?

651
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,640
You want me to bail
'cause of a small injury? Uh-uh. No way!

652
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,851
-A small injury? How many stitches?
-Not that many.

653
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,519
How many have you got?

654
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,439
She got 14 stitches.

655
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,733
Fourteen stitches? Oh no!

656
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,110
So where are they right now?

657
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,947
He said
they were coming back to the set.

658
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,906
Huh?

659
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,368
I understand. I'll be there soon.

660
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,373
I'm really worried for her.
I knew she'd get hurt like this.

661
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,540
I'm sorry.

662
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,795
Working this gig for Kang-ho…
that's what got her hurt.

663
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,422
I apologize.

664
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,054
Mi-ran, are you okay?

665
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,764
Oh, what happened?

666
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,807
Are you all right?

667
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,809
Yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

668
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,395
You can't drive like this.
Sleep here tonight.

669
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,689
Yes, that'd be best.

670
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,400
With your injury,
it would hurt to be in a car right now.

671
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,776
That must suck.

672
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,444
Then I'll just lie on my belly.

673
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,613
-What?
-Let's go. You drive.

674
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:06,409
-Okay.
-Uh, you know… that's not a good idea.

675
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,161
You drank earlier. Your face is beet red.

676
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,330
Oh, that's right. I did have some beer.

677
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,792
Oh, what luck.
You'll be in charge of taking Na-eun home.

678
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:19,839
-Let's go. Don't just stand there!
-Oh, but… the hotel may be full.

679
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:20,881
I'm sorry.

680
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,430
How could there be
not even a single room left?

681
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,473
You've nothing to do with this, right?

682
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,061
What, do you actually think
I bribed the front desk

683
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,855
just so we could sleep together?

684
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,607
Why don't you say
I planned your accident too?

685
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,776
And got you hurt
so you couldn't drive home.

686
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,574
Are you doing okay?

687
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,075
Yes, I'm okay.

688
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,202
She's not okay.

689
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,830
She couldn't get in a car in this state.

690
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,833
So she'll sleep in my room.

691
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,796
You know, you didn't have to tell her
it's your room.

692
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,633
That's pretty bad.
I'm sorry that happened to you.

693
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,471
-It was just a few stitches.
-Fourteen is just a few, huh?

694
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,309
This woman,

695
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,103
she's for real.

696
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,398
She really does love Nam Kang-ho.

697
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,445
Um, I'll leave you to it then.

698
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,039
Why am I playing along
in this game?

699
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,292
Nam Kang-ho means nothing to me.

700
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,794
Se-na.

701
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,049
Could I…

702
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,887
Could I perhaps sleep
in your room tonight?

703
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,890
-They ran out of rooms here.
-What are you saying?

704
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:58,020
Think about it. You brought
your girlfriend on board as a stunt double

705
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,106
but also want her
to sleep in your room with you?

706
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,401
Uh, I'd be happy to share.

707
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,861
You can use my makeup remover
and lotion if you'd like.

708
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,696
-That'd be great.
-Hey.

709
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,243
What?

710
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,540
It's because I'm worried.

711
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,460
Stay in my suite.

712
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,004
Oh…

713
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:26,924
Stay in my suite.
