00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,854
♪ Love to hate you ♪

2
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,113
If we deny the romance rumor,

3
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,198
this makes it look like
Kang-ho forced a kiss on you.

4
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,868
And it would also make you appear…

5
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:40,665
…as though you allowed him to show
such an aggressive show of affection.

6
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:44,502
So, instead of making it seem like
two mature adults acted on pure impulse,

7
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,338
we should say
you two were already together.

8
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,382
What do you think?

9
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,635
A sham relationship with Kang-ho.
For three months.

10
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,725
Of course, I'm not asking you
to do this all for free.

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,521
If you go along with this plan,
I'll compensate you handsomely.

12
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,648
Did Mr. Nam Kang-ho

13
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,650
also agree to do this?

14
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,320
I don't do anything without his blessing.

15
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,700
A man who fulfills his desires
under the guise of fan service.

16
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,079
A man who calls
sexual harassment a romance.

17
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,999
A man who even silences anti-fans
with money and manipulation.

18
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,224
NAM KANG-HO HAS A SECRET GIRLFRIEND!

19
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,558
NAM ADMITS DATING?

20
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,560
WHO IS IT IN THE PHOTO? A CELEBRITY?

21
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,937
NAM'S GIRLFRIEND, NOT A CELEBRITY

22
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,522
NAM, NOT A FAN OF DATING CELEBRITIES

23
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,941
I thought you were killing the story.
What happened?

24
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,401
-Let's talk when you get here.
-You didn't even try?

25
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,488
-Let's just talk in person.
-Since when do you side with reporters?

26
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,044
What's that?

27
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,757
Wha…

28
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,643
-Was that a woman?
-Maybe she's an Olympian?

29
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,276
Huh?

30
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,531
How are you calling?
Aren't you all out of your free data?

31
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,367
NAM KANG-HO HAS A SECRET GIRLFRIEND!

32
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,618
This you?

33
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,328
Oh.

34
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,501
-So you and Nam Kang-ho, huh?
-Uh-huh.

35
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,839
Oh. You're dating the man
that you can't stand? You?

36
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,216
-Yeah.
-Ah.

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,386
So you're dating him
after he fired you? Is that right?

38
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,470
Yeah.

39
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,638
DATING AGREEMENT CONTRACT

40
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,931
Care to explain this?

41
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,474
Huh?

42
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,439
We used fax
to avoid email hacking,

43
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,441
and I still ended up
getting caught by her.

44
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,320
Being in a public relationship
with Nam Kang-ho for three months

45
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,405
will be compensated
in the amount of 100 million won.

46
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,699
The contract must remain
confidential indefinitely.

47
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,702
Additional compensation provided
in cases of defamation against Yeo Mi-ran,

48
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,622
such as negative comments,
doxing, and breakup responsibility.

49
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,207
Did she really…

50
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,960
…sell herself for money like that?

51
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,086
Huh?

52
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,715
Don't you think
you're being a little bit harsh?

53
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,676
Don't you think
you're being a little bit harsh?

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,846
You're getting paid to date him.
Few things could be worse.

55
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,141
But is the worse person
the one who takes money?

56
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,268
Or is it the one who's paying them off?

57
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,186
Huh?

58
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,271
Oh!

59
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,233
If this leaks, would it be
more damaging to the star actor

60
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,193
or more damaging to the lowly lawyer?

61
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,194
Yeah.

62
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,906
So, since there's a balance of power,
they get to say we're dating,

63
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,283
and I get to worry about nothing.

64
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,619
You're actually going through with it?

65
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,789
Kang-ho,
this may have started as a contract,

66
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,083
but I want you to turn it
into a real thing. Now look,

67
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,003
just forget about everything I said before
and just follow your heart.

68
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,256
Your body is telling you
what's in your heart.

69
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,175
Isn't this the first time
you're feeling like this since Oh Se-na?

70
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,595
You may never find another girl like this.

71
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,347
Kang-ho, don't lose her, man.

72
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:29,018
Think about it. A scandal that turns
into a relationship is super romantic.

73
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:29,936
That's true.

74
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,399
I might as well make it real.

75
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,317
But the longer it goes,

76
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,279
the tougher it is to quit.

77
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,325
FEMME FATALE VS HOMME FATALE

78
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,703
If you become his girlfriend,

79
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,455
it's only a matter of time
before everything about you comes out.

80
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,957
You'll be a laughingstock.

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,544
You won't be able to just live your life!
You won't be able to walk down the street

82
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,088
or just have casual flings
like you did before.

83
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,133
Is your privacy and freedom
really only worth 100 million won?

84
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,719
You're right.

85
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,015
I should've asked for 100 more.

86
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,725
Even if we'd met halfway at 150…

87
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,602
I could've made
another 50 million! Damn it!

88
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,522
Wow, when did you get so needy?

89
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,442
Needy? It's called hustling.

90
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,235
Make as much money
as you can while you can.

91
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,155
Hmm.

92
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,992
Nam Kang-ho?

93
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,579
-Huh?
-Yes, hello?

94
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,496
Don't do it.

95
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,374
Don't you think we should meet
before going through with this?

96
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,751
Couldn't agree more.

97
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,502
No, don't do it.

98
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,422
Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey!

99
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,175
Come on, don't do it.

100
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,179
If you aren't actually in love
with Nam Kang-ho, don't do it!

101
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,973
I'll expose this whole thing. Huh?

102
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,017
I'm confiscating this, so there!

103
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,744
Wow.

104
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,246
The contract can be reprinted.

105
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,042
What's that? Your dressed-to-kill outfit?

106
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,461
What do you think? Am I the one?

107
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:19,879
Uh-huh.

108
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,734
So could it be true,
that someone's watching us?

109
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,111
Maybe.

110
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,279
Then we should put on a show.

111
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,880
Your seat belt.

112
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,049
Uh…

113
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,760
My seat belt.

114
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,398
NAM KANG-HO - MOVIE/TV ACTOR
AGENCY: DOWON ENTERTAINMENT

115
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
AGENCY: DOWON ENTERTAINMENT

116
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,916
It means a lot that you're helping us out.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,460
Well, it is part-time work.

118
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,546
And it doesn't just pay well.
It pays really well.

119
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,048
We might as well continue

120
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,176
doing the fight training together
while we're at it.

121
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,052
Ah. Yeah, we should.

122
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,098
You're pretty today.

123
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,770
Wait, where are we going anyway?

124
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,508
How can I help you?

125
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,011
Oh, uh… I'd like
to speak with the president.

126
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,471
And what is it in regards to?

127
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,015
Could you tell him I'm a friend
of the attorney, Yeo Mi-ran?

128
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,434
To be honest, the two of us
are more like family, you know?

129
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,977
Please, wait here.

130
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,822
He's a work of art.

131
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,415
Hello, sir.

132
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,669
Who's that?

133
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,510
An actor?

134
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,637
A model?

135
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,604
-I heard you were looking for me.
-Oh, yes. I'm a friend of Yeo Mi-ran.

136
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,815
Yes. Yeo Mi-ran, the attorney.

137
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,192
Ah… I…

138
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,821
I'm sorry. I'm here to see
the president, not an actor.

139
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,116
Yes, I know.
I'm Do Won-jun. I'm the president.

140
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,785
Can I please just talk to the--

141
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,203
So, what can I do for you?

142
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,081
-You're really the president here?
-Yeah.

143
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,126
Why is the president
this handsome?

144
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,461
And the reason you wanted to see me is…

145
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,047
Oh. Oh, right.

146
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,216
Now, look. Just what exactly

147
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,427
are you doing to my friend?

148
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,351
Let's go discuss this in private.

149
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,728
Like where?

150
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,278
Where are we?

151
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,030
My second house!

152
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,698
It's my vacation home.

153
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,199
I'll show you.

154
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,246
Okay, hotshot.

155
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,964
These flowers are real.

156
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,716
-When did you do all this?
-Today.

157
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,062
It's day one of our relationship.
Have a seat.

158
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,920
So have you told Mr. Do about it yet?

159
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,588
Tell him what?

160
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,091
That I'm not actually your fan but your--

161
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,051
That you're not a fan but an anti-fan?

162
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,178
I haven't told him.

163
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,181
Guys don't share every little detail,
no matter how close they are.

164
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,517
Are you saying
that girls are like that?

165
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,690
-Are they?
-Anyway, I'm not actually an anti-fan.

166
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,900
I've never even posted a negative comment.

167
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,736
That's good to know,
that you don't hate me that much.

168
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,322
Since we'll have to hold hands
every now and again.

169
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:40,950
Ah.

170
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,452
Occasionally, we may have to hold hands.

171
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,662
Is that okay with you?

172
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,835
Yes, of course.
We've done a lot more than that already.

173
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,253
Ah.

174
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,380
You're right.

175
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,423
Mmm.

176
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,884
Thank you for such a fancy meal.
It looks amazing.

177
00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,969
Cheers.

178
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,975
To show
this much effort just for me,

179
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,310
maybe it wasn't just fan service.

180
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,688
To say
that she's not an anti-fan,

181
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,565
maybe my charm is starting to work.

182
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,817
Hmm.

183
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,985
CEO DO WON-JUN

184
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,320
I've been pretty good.
What about you?

185
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,531
Hmm.

186
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,660
Tell me something.
How'd you end up with that contract?

187
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,789
We live together.

188
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,125
And I just happened to see
the fax before she did.

189
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,376
Ah.

190
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,880
Mi-ran is truly a free-spirited person.

191
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,092
I can't let her give away her freedom
for a measly 100 million won.

192
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,635
"Measly"?

193
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,306
I saw the contract will be voided
if confidentiality isn't maintained.

194
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,725
Seeing as I know about it,
I guess the contract is void?

195
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,060
Actually, no.
She hasn't even signed it yet,

196
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,354
so we can just pretend
this never happened.

197
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,111
Well, how much more money
do you want from me?

198
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,113
What?

199
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,783
I'm uncomfortable telling you
personal matters since we just met,

200
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,119
but I've cashed out
my, uh, insurance policy,

201
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,163
my savings plan, and my crypto.

202
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,832
It's a bear market these days,
but I did it anyway.

203
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,211
You're the one paying the 100 million won
and not Mr. Nam Kang-ho?

204
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,630
Well, yeah. You read the contract.

205
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,299
It says it right there.
It's between me and Ms. Yeo.

206
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,383
A: DO WON-JUN
B: YEO MI-RAN

207
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,762
I need to take full responsibility.

208
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,347
If something were to go wrong,

209
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,225
I have to protect Kang-ho.

210
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,313
Well, if I scrounge up
everything else I have,

211
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,442
I don't know…
maybe another 20, 30 million?

212
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,820
Yeah, I mean, I think
I can probably manage that,

213
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,321
so I'll just have to--

214
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:46,367
Excuse you.
What are you even talking about right now?

215
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,828
What?

216
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,539
Do you think I came to ask
for more money, seriously?

217
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,917
I don't need the money.
I'm saying you shouldn't talk my friend

218
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,378
into doing something like this.
Some things can't be bought.

219
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:01,423
What's wrong with you?
Look, I will not just idly stand by

220
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,343
and watch my friend
get roped into this charade of yours!

221
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,888
Oh, sure. Of course.

222
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,975
My mistake. I guess I misunderstood you.

223
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,476
Sorry for that.

224
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,231
So you know,

225
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,943
I'm really hoping things
will work out for the both of them.

226
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,946
For Kang-ho and for Ms. Yeo.

227
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,325
My buddy Kang-ho has been lonely
for such a long time, and…

228
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,746
Well, anyway…

229
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,165
Once I actually got to know her…

230
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,211
…I realized that she's a great person.

231
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,380
And she also has

232
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,550
a really good friend looking out for her.

233
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,516
I have my parents,
older brother, and niece.

234
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,101
My mother and I don't get along.

235
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,145
I have my parents,
older brother, and his wife.

236
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,521
I don't get along with my father.

237
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,191
My name stands for "strong" and "hero."
I'm literally a stud.

238
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,611
Mine stands for "beautiful orchid."
I don't like my name.

239
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,280
I plan to legally change it,
but I haven't found a name I like yet.

240
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,407
-And when did we first meet?
-Let's say at the resort.

241
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,326
-That's actually kind of true.
-Our first kiss?

242
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,245
Let's make it the day from the photo.
I like that.

243
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,332
How should we address each other?

244
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,750
Oh, right.

245
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,419
Well, in the contract,
I noticed that I'm three years older,

246
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:24,173
so for me, "Oppa"?
"Baby" for you? Any thoughts?

247
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,760
Is that what you're into?

248
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,553
No, not even a little bit.

249
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,933
How about we… call each other "honey"?

250
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:35,935
Honey.

251
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,896
Honey.

252
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,273
You don't like it?

253
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,858
No, it's all right.

254
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,235
And why don't we get
a picture of the two of us together?

255
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,572
We both should have at least one photo
of us together, don't you think?

256
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,783
Mmm, good idea. Let's do it.

257
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,960
Um… should I do it? My arm is longer.

258
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,379
Go ahead.

259
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,421
All right.

260
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,551
Okay, here we go.

261
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,637
One, two…

262
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,389
Uh…

263
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,224
Oh jeez.

264
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,476
I think I closed my eyes.

265
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,269
-It came out a little weird.
-Mmm.

266
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,105
Let's take another one.

267
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,732
One, two…

268
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,568
Why do you keep changing
your pose at "three"?

269
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,488
-You're shaking the camera.
-Did I?

270
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,489
-Yes.
-Let me see it.

271
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,241
Let's take it again.

272
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,080
What was that? You didn't even count.

273
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,499
You look really cute in this one though.

274
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,002
How is that cute?

275
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,881
I'm sorry to tell you,
but you're actually really pretty.

276
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,636
The best way to disarm a woman

277
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,805
is to compliment her looks.

278
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,474
"Cute," "pretty."

279
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,810
They sound like compliments,

280
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,480
but they can also be used
when looking down on someone.

281
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,400
Well, we've exchanged information
and agreed on things.

282
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,778
Maybe people should see us together.

283
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,364
To add truth to the rumor, you know?

284
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,200
Together? Huh.

285
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,662
You mean, just openly walk around?

286
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,248
Hmm. Well, what would you like to do?

287
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,211
I rode in one of these for a movie once.

288
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,874
My cue.

289
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,459
You have your own pool cue?

290
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,921
It was a prize, actually.
For crushing it at the championship.

291
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,005
Hmm.

292
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,114
What's your usual score?

293
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,198
I don't know.

294
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,867
Anywhere between 500 and 1,000.

295
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,952
A thousand?

296
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,457
Seems to me
that I've got you under my spell.

297
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,388
Wake her up.
Wake her up and tell her to go in.

298
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,723
Don't look at her. Don't look at her.

299
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,852
How does it feel
to watch a girl sleeping next to you?

300
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,605
It makes you imagine things
and excites you, doesn't it?

301
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,485
There you go.

302
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,487
We're here. Wake up!

303
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,284
You did well today.

304
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,578
Go in and rest.

305
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,288
Uh…

306
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,540
Sure. Uh, thank you.

307
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,041
Good night.

308
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,710
Good night.

309
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,349
What was that?

310
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,311
Did my spell not work at all?

311
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,900
Or was he upset
that I was sleeping while he was driving?

312
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,933
I'm the one casting a spell!

313
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,984
NAM ADMITS
HE HAS A NONCELEBRITY GIRLFRIEND

314
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,990
NAM CONFIRMS RELATIONSHIP
WHO IS HIS GIRL?

315
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,619
What I had to endure
as Nam Kang-ho's girlfriend

316
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,663
was more than just my face in the news.

317
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,750
I'm sure that settling in to the company
must have been hard for you.

318
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,378
Was there anything
you found lacking at all?

319
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,505
Uh, no. Of course not.

320
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,464
Ah!

321
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,342
Aw, it's no wonder
she gets along with everyone.

322
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,136
Our Ms. Yeo here has
a super understanding personality.

323
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,640
Isn't that right?

324
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,934
What's with this royal treatment?

325
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,769
Did I get a bump in social status?

326
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,312
Oh, of course!

327
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,940
Why is Nam Kang-ho dating you? Huh?

328
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,525
Hang on a second.

329
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,528
That bastard isn't toying with you, is he?

330
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,614
I'm the one doing the toying.

331
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,866
Okay. Please just make sure.

332
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,753
What's this?

333
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,755
Lawyer Yeo Mi-ran was fair game,

334
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,425
but Nam Kang-ho's girlfriend
is a ticking time bomb?

335
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,927
Or that single women are doormats,

336
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,556
but if they have a boyfriend,
then they're difficult, yeah? Damn it!

337
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,601
I won't stand for that!
Even Cinderella must have felt like crap

338
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,980
once she realized that women envied her,
but no men envied the prince at all!

339
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,815
Anything else bothering you?

340
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,734
Huh?

341
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,821
Oh, that president or whatever
said that he'd do his best

342
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,073
to make sure your privacy isn't violated.

343
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,408
But be careful.

344
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,579
Mr. Do decided not to make
an issue about Na-eun

345
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,331
being aware of the contract,

346
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,709
because it'd be difficult
to hide that from a roommate, anyway.

347
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,086
He said that Na-eun
seems like a trustworthy friend.

348
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,005
NAM KANG-HO'S SECRET GIRLFRIEND

349
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,342
I should've stopped her
when I had the chance.

350
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,927
Once I actually got to know her,

351
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,138
I realized that she's a great person.

352
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:33,268
And she also has
a really good friend looking out for her.

353
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,362
If Kang-ho gets ruined by this,

354
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,198
I'll be ruined as well.

355
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,034
Help us out.

356
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,536
I'm counting on you.

357
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,965
I promised myself I'd lay off these men.

358
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:12,933
Um, hello?

359
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,519
Uh, is this Ms. Shin Na-eun?

360
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,232
Ah, yes.

361
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,900
This is she.

362
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,819
And who are you?

363
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,321
This is Do Won-jun.

364
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,742
I was kind of out of it the other day.

365
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,245
I wanted to see
if I could maybe treat you to a meal.

366
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,623
Oh, thank you,
but I'm actually headed for a flight.

367
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,750
Ah. Is that so?

368
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,252
Yes.

369
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,295
Okay, well, how long are you gone?

370
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,131
Uh, I'll be back tomorrow.

371
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,841
The director said
that he feels bad

372
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,552
about what you're going through.
And he really does like you,

373
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,138
but because of the investors
and the media…

374
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,515
Yeah. I understand.

375
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,769
Also, he's sorry
about having to go straight into filming

376
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,521
because of the delay in schedule.

377
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,191
I'm just curious, does the director
actually say those things himself?

378
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,570
It's just that
I've never actually seen him talk.

379
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,781
Oh, well, it's just obvious
through his body language.

380
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,868
Everyone who's worked with him,
they just know.

381
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,453
But how?

382
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,707
Oh, here he is now.

383
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,126
Ah, yes. How are you?

384
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,677
I'm sorry to have caused so much trouble.

385
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:44,524
Does he really have a girlfriend?
You're not playing me for a fool, are you?

386
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,737
I'm just wondering
how even you didn't know.

387
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,198
You suffered for no reason.

388
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,659
I know, right?

389
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,038
Kang-ho can be so prudent.

390
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,833
-I mean, to not mention it to me at all?
-I heard she's a lawyer.

391
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,587
-What's she like?
-She seems like a decent person.

392
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,590
Her roommate does as well.

393
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,801
-You met her roommate?
-Hmm?

394
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,430
-Uh-huh.
-Her roommate seemed nice to you?

395
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,015
Uh-huh.

396
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,892
Uh… uh, yes, she did.

397
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,852
She seems like a nice person.

398
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,731
-What?
-She pretty?

399
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,984
-Huh? Who?
-You know who.

400
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,612
Oh! The roommate.

401
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,989
I don't know.

402
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,575
She's all right.

403
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,160
You said she seemed nice.

404
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,121
Yeah, no doubt. Really nice.

405
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,623
Super nice.

406
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,841
-Here you are.
-Thank you so much.

407
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,135
Sure.

408
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,556
-What name should I write down?
-Uh… I'm Kim Min-seok.

409
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,432
Dear Min-seok…

410
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,812
-Thank you.
-Yes, thank you.

411
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,313
Yes, I'm Jang U-seong.

412
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,731
Jang U-seong.

413
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:08,900
-Thanks.
-Sure.

414
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,112
-You're really pretty.
-Aw, well, that's nice. See you out there.

415
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,446
Yes, of course.

416
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,409
-It's Jeong-kwon, Kim Jeong-kwon.
-Dear Kim Jeong-kwon…

417
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,494
I've been a fan
for the better half of my life.

418
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,412
No way.

419
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:23,164
It's true. Remember when you did
your first fan signing?

420
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,583
I actually was there too.

421
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,210
Wait, you were the kid
who held my hand, aren't you?

422
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:31,214
-That's right. I was the hand-holding kid.
-That's so crazy. Well, hello again.

423
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,220
-And now we're all working together.
-A dream come true, huh?

424
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,514
Well, I've been
a fan since I was 30.

425
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,724
Thank you.

426
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,447
Hey, you.

427
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,867
What do ya think?

428
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,747
Your stylist did okay, I think.

429
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,873
So I look pretty?

430
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,583
You look nice too.

431
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,757
I'm sorry about the other day.

432
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,509
-I was a little harsh on you.
-What?

433
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,347
Oh, saying that I was being gross, right?

434
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,183
It's nothing.

435
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,517
That was all my fault.

436
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,854
You weren't the kind of person
who could say such things,

437
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,189
but because of me…

438
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,901
I'm the one who's sorry. Not my best day.

439
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,113
And I hope I can turn you back
into that happily smiling man,

440
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,658
who I used to know so very well.

441
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,286
What's with the face?

442
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,955
I think you should just focus
on your acting for now, Ms. Oh.

443
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,707
I'm happy with my girlfriend,

444
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,959
and I'm smiling real bright,
but thank you.

445
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,044
Mmm.

446
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,672
You don't have to pretend
like that with me.

447
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:58,718
You don't think I would tell anyone
that your relationship's a fraud, do you?

448
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,011
Well, who's saying that?

449
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,430
I mean,

450
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,265
no one knows.

451
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,351
I just had a little hunch about that.

452
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,978
Won-jun's really good.

453
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,606
He found someone besides me so fast.

454
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,358
Well, you're wrong.

455
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,110
Either way, well-done.

456
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,738
Because I really wanted to do
this movie with you in any way possible.

457
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,287
He's totally going to jail.

458
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,127
Good morning!

459
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,807
Now, I'm sure I don't have
to say what everyone already knows.

460
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,227
But no one, I repeat, no one,

461
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,479
will be talking
about Ms. Yeo Mi-ran at all.

462
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,939
It is banned. Got it?

463
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,024
Yes, sir.

464
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,901
If anyone asks…

465
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,324
…she is decent,
skilled, and easygoing.

466
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,034
And that's all you get to say about her!

467
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,537
Don't talk about how well she drinks
or how she dances

468
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,290
or that she can knock down
a row of shots, pow, with a karate kick.

469
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,333
Nothing about how she's an expert fighter.

470
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,376
-Got it?
-Expert fighter?

471
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,878
-Oh wow.
-Is that true?

472
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,629
-She's pretty good.
-Oh, come on.

473
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,841
Oh. Her own honorable self
admitted it, okay?

474
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:20,759
"Honorable self?"

475
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,971
And Attorney Yeo Mi-ran
should refrain from doing

476
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,057
such things as substitute attorney work.
Isn't that so?

477
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,143
-Isn't that so?
-Substitute attorney?

478
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:33,938
Oh, you've never had to do that before,
huh? Well, that's good to know.

479
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,607
What is it, though?

480
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,525
Explain to her nicely.

481
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,987
He wants you to explain.

482
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,948
It's when you attend a court hearing
in place of another attorney.

483
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,825
-Ooh.
-Ma'am.

484
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,827
You just go there, show your face,

485
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,705
and say, "Please expedite it,"
or, "I'll have an answer next time."

486
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,957
And that's pretty much it.

487
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:53,875
Ah.

488
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,878
It's 100,000 won per case,
and people can't wait to do it.

489
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,296
Can't wait?

490
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:03,384
I mean, uh, since those opportunities
don't come up that much.

491
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,553
I swear, I've only done it one time, sir.

492
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,055
-For real.
-You little…

493
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,475
Now,
if the honorable Yeo Mi-ran here

494
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,393
has anything to add, please do.

495
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:16,231
For example, if you'd like to make
a request or a suggestion about something

496
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,690
you wish we'd improve on.

497
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,776
Hmm.

498
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,987
I find it a bit uncomfortable
to be addressed in such a praising tone.

499
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,073
So either use that tone with everyone

500
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,076
or just please address me
like everyone else. Hmm.

501
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,335
Wow!

502
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,161
Hey, what are you doing?

503
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,664
You make me blush.

504
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,917
Come on, let me down.

505
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,920
-Let me down.
-Cut!

506
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,256
All right, looks good!

507
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,259
Oh my gosh. She's pregnant.

508
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,054
-No way! Damn it!
-Oh, really? Congratulations!

509
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,430
-Yo.
-Yeah.

510
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,641
-That's so exciting!
-Seriously, man?

511
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,226
Where are we gonna find
a female stunt double out of the blue?

512
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,646
-Se-na's stunt double's pregnant.
-I don't know.

513
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,731
And the father is the stunt coordinator.

514
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,649
What?

515
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,234
Actually, when did you
start seeing each other?

516
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,696
Not that long ago.

517
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,865
And yet you managed
to already get her pregnant?

518
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,033
Wow.

519
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,578
Man, you're killing me, seriously.

520
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,088
Uh, no, ma'am.

521
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,090
I can do it myself.

522
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,716
Mmm.

523
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,262
So, apparently, this is the year
where I keep getting sucker punched.

524
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,557
Come on, you don't mean that.

525
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,186
My husband has been seeing
another woman too,

526
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,897
and a lawyer I trusted like my sister,

527
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,733
turns out she's with Nam Kang-ho now. Hmm.

528
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,904
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner,
but I wasn't at liberty to disclose.

529
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,282
Of course, of course. I know, I know.

530
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,326
I'm a celebrity too, you know.

531
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,829
It's not easy
to get a celebrity to really talk.

532
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,540
Unless she has friends she trusts, I mean.

533
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:27,380
Look, to be honest,
Nam Kang-ho and I don't talk much,

534
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,799
but I imagine
he knows some things I've said.

535
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,343
The two of you must have talked about me
at some point, right?

536
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,971
"She said to call her girlfriend.
She loves power trips."

537
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:39,308
Oh, not at all. I happen to take pride
in my profession as a lawyer.

538
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:43,688
Whatever it is, no matter how trivial,
I don't share client info with anybody.

539
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,605
So don't worry.

540
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,858
Well, if that's true, I'm glad to hear it.

541
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,902
But it's still kind of concerning.

542
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,947
Maybe I have to switch
my lawyer again.

543
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,575
I'll go from "Ms. Unpredictable"
to "Ms. Unbelievable," won't I?

544
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,202
Hold on. Do you think
being Nam Kang-ho's girlfriend

545
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,162
is that big of a deal?

546
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,830
As a lawyer, I'm just a lackey,

547
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,583
but as his girlfriend,
I'm some kind of royalty?

548
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,542
Wow.

549
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,962
I never knew I'd snag Mr. Right
and turn my life around so well.

550
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,971
I enjoy it when you talk back to me
like that. I feel less hurt.

551
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,559
Come on.

552
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,062
Hmm.

553
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,775
So… wait a second. At the party,
you two were already dating?

554
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,359
Uh…

555
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,405
-Yeah.
-So, before you were hired at Gilmu?

556
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,492
-Yeah.
-How did you even meet?

557
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,576
Was it arranged?

558
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,495
Ah, no. Uh…

559
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,622
By accident, at the resort.

560
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:48,628
We kind of ran into each other,
and he just started talking to me.

561
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,840
I fooled my own mom,
so why does fooling this lady

562
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,509
feel so much harder?

563
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,012
Okay, so, you were going to work at Gilmu
as your boyfriend's lawyer,

564
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,182
and then you were assigned
a difficult client like me instead.

565
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,391
Is that it?

566
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,103
No. No, I wasn't trying to do all that.

567
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,188
I just wanted to earn some money.

568
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,024
Of all the places I could work,
Gilmu offered the best salary.

569
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,902
Oh, don't give me that.

570
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,946
Being Nam Kang-ho's wife
would pay the most,

571
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,323
and you wouldn't have to do all this work.

572
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,158
You know,

573
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,245
I told you I've dated
a lot of guys, right?

574
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,914
A boyfriend can come and go
whenever they want to.

575
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:25,998
Well, husbands can too.

576
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,000
Mm-hmm.

577
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,335
Oh gosh, I'm so sorry.

578
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,297
Anyway,
I can't stand getting free meals and gifts

579
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,215
from guys like that.

580
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,884
That's why I never had anything
to give back after breaking up.

581
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,137
Oh! There was one time I did.

582
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,099
Nam Kang-ho always said
he'd never date anyone,

583
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,852
so you being together is a good thing!

584
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,398
Oh no.

585
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:54,485
Now my entire diet plan for the day
is ruined. I even managed to go to the gym

586
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,404
after I found out
my husband was cheating on me.

587
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,490
If I could do that,
I can stick to my diet plan now.

588
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,825
Let's go.

589
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,869
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

590
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,748
-What's the best way to sober up quickly?
-A poo!

591
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,377
Do you really think
I'd ask to go the bathroom together?

592
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,296
I guess not.

593
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,464
So gross.

594
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,383
Hmm.

595
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,685
Hi, honey.

596
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,648
Honey?

597
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,609
Oh, are you with someone?

598
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,526
Uh…

599
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,861
I'm with Choi Soo-jin.

600
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:37,862
Oh.

601
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,407
Well, I'd planned to make this
seem like a work-related call,

602
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,284
but I guess that'd be weird now.

603
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:47,205
So, I'll just ask,
what are you doing tomorrow? You busy?

604
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:48,915
-Not sure.
-Okay.

605
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,667
Well, I was wondering
if you could come to the set tomorrow.

606
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,253
-Why?
-We need a female stunt actress.

607
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,590
-Really?
-Yeah.

608
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,591
Okay. Cool!

609
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,427
Look how happy she is.
Jeez, she's gonna burst.

610
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,638
What time? Where do I go?

611
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,931
I'll text you.

612
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,182
Okay. Sounds good.

613
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:09,018
Oh my! You're naked.
Is Kang-ho okay with that?

614
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,691
Not completely, just topless.
We're getting a massage.

615
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,779
A massage?

616
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,864
Ah, well, then you have to get naked.

617
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,283
-Okay, talk to you later.
-Uh…

618
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,041
Moron.

619
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:35,211
"Then you have to get naked"?
"Then you have to get naked"?

620
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,546
What the hell are you even saying?

621
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,719
If you don't mind,
do you think I can come pick you up?

622
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,473
You guys were great today.

623
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,767
Mm-hmm. No, I mean it.

624
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,394
I'm waiting outside.

625
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,776
Good work, everyone. Take care.

626
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,279
-Thank you, sir. You too.
-Have a nice day.

627
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,240
Hey, do you know that man over there?

628
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,450
Is he a model?

629
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,703
-Maybe there's a video shoot?
-Or maybe an actor?

630
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,249
It's always been just a dream.

631
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,336
Such a man coming to see me
and waiting for me.

632
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,424
Everyone being jealous.

633
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,721
I'll see you all later.

634
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,848
Okay, bye.

635
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,229
Allow me.

636
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,026
You must be tired.

637
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:43,863
Not at all. Um, you came all this way.
Don't you have to work today?

638
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,281
I'm not that busy.

639
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,367
-Let's go.
-Okay.

640
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,120
Stupid!

641
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,964
I'm in an enclosed space
with a man like him.

642
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,383
This is crazy.

643
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,179
You wouldn't want to go into the city
and get some food… right?

644
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,264
You know, since you're tired?

645
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,099
Not at all.

646
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,268
You've come all this way already.

647
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,982
Oh, although, my uniform is kind of weird.

648
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,484
I think you look nice.

649
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,909
Looks like we'll hit some traffic,
so if you're tired,

650
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,661
go ahead and rest if you want.
I'll wake you when we get there.

651
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,246
Where are you taking me to?

652
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,458
-Your house.
-How do you know where to go?

653
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:41,545
It's in the contract,
Ms. Yeo's home address.

654
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,546
You live together.

655
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:48,135
Ah, you're quite meticulous, aren't you?

656
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:54,642
Are you keeping tabs on me
because I know about the contract?

657
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,645
Why? Because I picked you up?

658
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,732
Not at all.

659
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,775
Jeez.

660
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,736
It's just that I didn't give you
a proper apology the other day,

661
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,613
so I've been feeling kind of bad.

662
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:08,989
About what?

663
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,659
At first, I thought you
were just asking for money.

664
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,786
I misunderstood you. Sorry about that.

665
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,913
Ah.

666
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,748
The more I thought about it,
the worse I felt,

667
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,375
knowing how quickly I judged you.

668
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,211
Well, you know,

669
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,506
not everyone's like that, Mr. Do.

670
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,634
Very true.

671
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,637
They think an entertainment company
just prints money,

672
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,639
and they try so hard to take a slice.

673
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,807
But the truth is,

674
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,477
an entertainment company
is not that wealthy.

675
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,897
-Don't let the looks deceive you.
-Ah.

676
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,858
Is that so?

677
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,572
I didn't tell them
you were my girlfriend.

678
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,824
It might make them uncomfortable.

679
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,827
A female stunt worker's
hard to find.

680
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,496
They're always unavailable
because they work so much, you know?

681
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,458
And no one knows that better
than our stunt coordinator.

682
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:03,961
So, hey,

683
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,381
today is scene 38. Is that right?

684
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,717
Uh, what scene is that?

685
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,391
Let's go!

686
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,182
Cut! Cut, cut! Okay!

687
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,850
All right, that was good!

688
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,187
Whoo!

689
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,149
If you feel even slightly overwhelmed,
just say "stop," okay?

690
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,235
Don't wait for the "cut." Just say "stop."

691
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,153
Sure. Absolutely.

692
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:12,863
Don't you worry.

693
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,865
She knows what she's doing.

694
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,497
What do I have to do?

695
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,917
Hey, hurry up! There they are!

696
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,630
Get to the back, sir!

697
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,692
Boss!

698
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,069
Her lover Hyeok-su
has to go to jail for murder,

699
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:55,322
and it turns out
the actual murderer was his boss.

700
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,076
So, So-jeong
goes to the mob headquarters

701
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,327
to rescue her lover.

702
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,705
-What's this?
-Where is Hyeok-su?

703
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,290
-Come on, lady.
-Please spare Hyeok-su.

704
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,834
-He's not here!
-She can't meet the boss.

705
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,836
I know Hyeok-su didn't do it.

706
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,921
A gangster
throws her through the glass,

707
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:11,839
and she falls down.

708
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,185
Hey, Ms. Yeo!

709
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,063
-Are you okay?
-What do we do?

710
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,649
-Are you all right?
-Hey, 911! Call 911!

711
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,403
How did it look?

712
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,406
I tried to keep my face hidden
when I was rolling on the floor.

713
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,701
I did well, right?

714
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,248
I thought you were really hurt.

715
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,254
-Are you some kind of an athlete?
-Oh, no, just an office worker.

716
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,673
Ah. So working out is a hobby for you?

717
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,259
Yes. I also happen to love
action movies too.

718
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,137
Oh, do I sense a hidden master here?

719
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,889
Any particular kind of action?

720
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,933
I mean, if Michelle Yeoh is in it,
I'm there.

721
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:08,228
She can do hand-to-hand combat,
car chase. She does everything.

722
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,440
-So you're old-school, huh?
-Totally. Those were the days!

723
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,068
Nowadays, they use wires,
but back then people just jumped.

724
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,110
That's right.

725
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,237
-Exactly!
-Yeah!

726
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,782
They didn't use camera tricks or machines.
They did everything!

727
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:20,824
It's true.

728
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,327
Tae kwon!

729
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,750
Try to hit me.

730
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,085
-Yeah.
-What?

731
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,462
I just want to see how good
the hidden master is for myself.

732
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,008
-Where should I hit you?
-Anywhere you want to.

733
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,343
Come on.

734
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,930
Ooh!

735
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,771
Oh, dude, knock it off!

736
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,065
-Are you serious?
-Oh, it really hurts. It really hurts!

737
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,692
I'm serious. Whoa!

738
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,777
-How are you even that strong?
-Does it really hurt?

739
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,863
Well it's more about speed
than it is about my strength.

740
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,909
-Think it's funny? You try.
-I didn't see her hand move.

741
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,661
-My turn.
-Hey!

742
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:07,913
Here I come.

743
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:11,834
Whoa!

744
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,252
That's it!

745
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,130
What's that? What's that?

746
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,552
She almost fights better than your wife.

747
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,512
Wow, nicely done.

748
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,888
Who the heck are you?

749
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,266
You were a school bully, huh?

750
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,897
I'm the one who beat up
the school bullies!

751
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,150
Honey!

752
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,777
If you're done, you can go home now.

753
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,948
Uh…

754
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:46,034
She's my girlfriend.
Please look out for her.

755
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,749
Thought you didn't want them to know
because it'd make them uncomfortable.

756
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,500
Well, the more I thought about it,

757
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,170
I realized they'd feel more uncomfortable
if they found out later.

758
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,422
Yeah, I wish you'd told us sooner.

759
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:06,305
I'm sorry.
I acted without talking to you first.

760
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,517
It's okay.
They would have found out eventually.

761
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,107
I'm the one
who beat up the school bullies!

762
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,859
Honey!

763
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,487
It was bothering him.

764
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,740
You've fallen under my spell.

765
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,575
I think they're fighting.

766
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,703
I wonder what it would feel like
to fight someone that handsome.

767
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,211
Hmm. Didn't take long
for the news to spread.

768
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,258
How about we show everyone…

769
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,220
…how we say goodbye to each other?

770
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,351
Hmm.

771
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:57,105
Just as I thought,
no anxiety attack.

772
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,316
All right, well, I'll be going now.

773
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,736
-Mmm.
-Oh!

774
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,369
Is this enough,
or do you want to go a little longer?

775
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,710
Just a little longer.

776
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:32,891
Oh.
