1
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,854
♪ Love to hate you ♪

2
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,693
And for my final trick of the night…

3
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,610
Nice.

4
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,450
Whoa!

5
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,577
-Yay!
-Wow!

6
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,287
-So good.
-How amazing!

7
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,290
-I did good, right?
-Yes, as always.

8
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,333
Yes!

9
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,960
Oh!

10
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,795
It's Na-eun. Just a second.

11
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,132
Hm?

12
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,182
Doesn't it feel
like something's wrong here?

13
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,433
Yes, it does.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,685
Hey, what's up?

15
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,982
-Did I see it? See what?
-I'm on my way there right now.

16
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,485
Just don't go anywhere.
Stay right there, okay?

17
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,172
Mm, you know,
she always seemed like a party girl.

18
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,300
Ah, his reputation was spotless.
Now he's done for.

19
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,218
Unfortunate.

20
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,844
Now?

21
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,680
Don't forget the gay scandal.

22
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,516
That was just gossip.

23
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,977
He held out so long without a girl
and ended up picking the wrong one.

24
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,440
I knew I should've hired a guy…

25
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,776
…to take
those little bastards out.

26
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,528
Take off for now

27
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,364
and don't take any phone calls
or text anybody, all right?

28
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,325
And don't talk about this to anyone,
not even Ms. Yeo.

29
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,078
Hey! So you're implying
I cut her off? Is that it?

30
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,997
Oh, what? So you're saying
Nam Kang-ho had no idea?

31
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,502
Suppose that's actually true.
Mi-ran did absolutely nothing wrong.

32
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,419
Okay?

33
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,131
I get it. But don't contact Ms. Yeo!

34
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,287
Hey.

35
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,208
It's more fun if you let me win sometimes.

36
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,751
It's not over yet.

37
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,590
It is over.

38
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,925
A PASSIONATE GOODBYE

39
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,303
Well, if you haven't seen it,
don't bother.

40
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,471
If Dad freaks out about it,
just come over to mine.

41
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:04,434
Oh, big deal or no big deal,
I'll take care of it, so don't worry.

42
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,351
I got it, yeah?

43
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,570
Let's get out of here. These people
are shady and can no longer be trusted.

44
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,405
Oh, relax, would you?

45
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,908
We're gonna leave.

46
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,702
Actually, you shouldn't be alone.

47
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,870
Let's just go home.

48
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,123
She won't be alone.
Not with me by her side.

49
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:31,169
I should go. It'd be good
to have somebody there with you.

50
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,712
You'll stay here with him, right?

51
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:34,923
I'll take care of you.

52
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,468
No way! What if you sign
another life-ruining contract?

53
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,388
Okay, okay. All right, all right.
I got it. I got it. Hey, let go!

54
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,725
Okay, tonight, the four of us
will all stay together.

55
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,851
What?

56
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,479
If we're all alone,
we'll end up with bad thoughts

57
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,189
and misunderstand one another.

58
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,441
You're right. We should go to mine.

59
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,694
We can't do that.
It's obvious reporters will camp outside.

60
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,864
Did we do something wrong?
Why hide from them?

61
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,165
I told you so.

62
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,504
We can't just tell 'em to beat it.
They won't listen.

63
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,591
Okay. So where do we go now?

64
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,639
My goodness.
You sure drank a lot, didn't you?

65
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,474
I'm completely sober now, thanks to you.

66
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,147
What will you do now?

67
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,485
The more I think about it,
I think we should just kill those guys.

68
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,113
You know what I'm saying?

69
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,991
Don't worry. I'll kill them myself.

70
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,867
And it's still defamation
even if it's true.

71
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,161
And I'll cover
their victims pro bono right away.

72
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,872
It'll be
death by endless lawsuits.

73
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,042
I'll show them what they get,
messing with us.

74
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,753
Are you two staying together?
Is that what you want?

75
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,135
Uh, is there
a convenience store around here?

76
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,931
Why don't you come with me?
Let's give these two some space.

77
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,437
It's not like
you're going to let them keep dating.

78
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,815
That'd mean the end for Kang-ho.

79
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,527
But you knew that all along, didn't you?

80
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,030
Right now, Ms. Yeo
is in even bigger trouble.

81
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,200
Once they decide
Kang-ho's a victim, I mean…

82
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,830
…people will drag her through the mud,
and she'll just be trampled.

83
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,167
They won't stop
until she's completely ruined.

84
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,544
They're gonna have to end this

85
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,339
until things die down.

86
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,761
So let them enjoy
what time they have left with one another.

87
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,681
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,893
You didn't do anything,
so don't apologize to me.

89
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,689
Otherwise, I'll have to feel sorry too,
for ruining Nam Kang-ho's whole career.

90
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,485
I would quit acting
if it meant being with you.

91
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,198
Did you buy alcohol?

92
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,282
What?

93
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,700
Oh, of course.

94
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,037
It's not like we're gonna talk
over coffee at this hour.

95
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,748
Since we're all together,
why don't we enjoy?

96
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,919
Not me, not me, not me!

97
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,049
-Whoa, hey, that's too much!
-Cheers!

98
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:27,095
Down goes the alcohol!
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug!

99
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,306
Ah, look at that!

100
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,601
-Okay, here we go.
-High-rise! High-rise! High-rise!

101
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,395
-Eleventh floor! One!
-Ah!

102
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,437
-Two!
-Three!

103
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,522
-Four!
-Five!

104
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,439
-Six!
-Seven!

105
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,816
-Eight!
-Nine!

106
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,527
-Ten!
-Oh, seriously?

107
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,321
-Beer!
-This is unfair.

108
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,990
How long
will you make me do the shoulder dance?

109
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,159
Look at my shoulders. They're dislocated!

110
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,245
Please take me down to the 11th floor.

111
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,082
Baskin-Robbins, 31!

112
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,209
One.

113
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,961
-Two. Three.
-Oh my God!

114
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,546
Four.

115
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,548
-Oop.
-Five!

116
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,216
Skip, skip, skip, skip!

117
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,052
Seven.

118
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,012
Wow, she's really good at this, huh?

119
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,264
Six, seven, eight!

120
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,349
Nine, ten, eleven!

121
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,269
Cute, charming, 31!

122
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,437
Nine.

123
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,439
Ten.

124
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,567
Cute, charming, 31!

125
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,528
Nine!

126
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,321
I can't! I won't!

127
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,407
Sorry about this.

128
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,911
Oh, not too much.

129
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,670
How long do you think this will go?

130
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,006
They might be doing that on purpose

131
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,341
because they're worried
about what's to come.

132
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,678
-Oh, I'm getting full.
-Let's just leave them be for tonight.

133
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,472
What year is it? Whoo!

134
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,308
I guess you really can't handle your soju.

135
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,525
That's an interesting assumption.

136
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,653
I wouldn't assume that of you.

137
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,531
'Cause it's not true.

138
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,464
Ah, not sure I can call
a driver at this hour.

139
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,798
You're leaving right now?

140
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,258
I should.

141
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,221
Oh, looks like there aren't
any drivers around here.

142
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,640
Guess I'll just sleep in the car

143
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,016
until I'm sober.

144
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,020
Then head out of here, I guess.

145
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,146
The car?

146
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,440
No, what's wrong with you?

147
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,950
You know, if you want to,

148
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,244
you could sleep on the couch.

149
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,918
I would quit acting
if it meant being with you.

150
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,910
So the party eventually ended,

151
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,579
and things unfolded as expected.

152
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,626
THE SHOCKING LIFE OF NAM'S GIRLFRIEND

153
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,294
NAM'S GIRLFRIEND IS A CLUB ADDICT?

154
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,462
THE BEAUTIFUL ATTORNEY WAS…

155
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,758
Wait until I get my hands
on her, damn it! She's dead meat!

156
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,510
-Get her! Get her!
-Pow! Pow!

157
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,640
Hey, isn't that Yeo Mi-ran?

158
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,892
There she is!

159
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,854
Shit!

160
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,776
I warned you.

161
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,196
We won't permit
our honest and innocent Kang-ho

162
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,573
to date an unlikable woman.

163
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:44,203
If you were that kind of woman,
you should have just ended it sooner.

164
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,539
So are you planning on ending his career?

165
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,344
You know, what I really hate to see

166
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,223
is a bunch of women
letting go of their integrity.

167
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,933
What did she say?

168
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,729
-Oh, sure. Right, yeah. Wow.
-She's the one who dated multiple men.

169
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,233
Look at her.

170
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,998
Some of your advertisement clients
have already issued notice of penalty.

171
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,126
About 27.4 billion won in total.

172
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,296
Don't worry too much about that.
There's no way to prove a correlation

173
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,006
between sales and reputation.

174
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,760
They won't open their accounting books
just to prove that. Nah. No way.

175
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
They'll likely drop him
and cancel the deal.

176
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,432
They'll ruin his career
just to cover their tracks.

177
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,774
It's postponed. The studio backed out.

178
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,323
There will be
multiple lawsuits from the ad sponsors,

179
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,742
and the assigned attorney
can't work on the cases,

180
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,827
because she caused the scandal.

181
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,662
They're not going to go to trial.

182
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,957
Mr. Nam Kang-ho isn't at fault here,
so he's not liable.

183
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,709
Is that what a lawyer should say?

184
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,545
Guilty by association
may not apply in law,

185
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,839
but it does for client reputation!
This sound familiar?

186
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,843
"I am responsible for any rumors
I've caused with clients I represent"!

187
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,225
As stated, you'll have to prepare
three times your annual salary as penalty.

188
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,310
And if we fire you,
Nam Kang-ho will make a fuss,

189
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,062
and it won't look professional.

190
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,565
So I expect that you'll go, yes?

191
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,234
Shit.

192
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,021
-Hey.
-Are you on your way?

193
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,107
Should be there in ten.

194
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,370
You… made all this yourself?

195
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,748
Yeah. You've suffered
so much on my behalf,

196
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,084
this is the least I could do.

197
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,461
Have a seat while it's still hot.

198
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,478
This looks good.

199
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,814
Oh, Yeo Mi-ran's weak spot revealed.

200
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,401
When I'm being sentimental.

201
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,029
I'm tough on bullies and soft on the weak.

202
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,113
I know, I know.

203
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,490
That's my favorite thing about you.

204
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,793
How are your parents?

205
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,713
I should pay them a visit.

206
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,055
How should I greet them?
Happy and energetic?

207
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,517
Or maybe thoughtful and dependable?

208
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,230
Oh.

209
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,068
There is something. What do you think?

210
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,239
-Do you have anything to say about it?
-Okay, fine, it's not that bad.

211
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,574
Yes!

212
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,077
That's good coming from you.

213
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,538
Unless we break up,

214
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,791
the attacks on me will continue.

215
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,836
No matter how tough I am,

216
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,546
it'll eventually take its toll.

217
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,343
And you'll keep feeling guilty.

218
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,973
I also feel guilty that you can't work
on a project you want because of this.

219
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,643
And we can't take that risk.

220
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,938
If we hold out,
we'll eventually end up fighting,

221
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,481
so let's have a nice ending.

222
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,068
I'm sorry to bring this up so abruptly.

223
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,157
One of us must initiate,
and what must be done has to be done.

224
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,077
Did you meet Won-jun?

225
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,623
You know, if I had returned
the money back to you,

226
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,334
I might have felt a little better.

227
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,547
Never mind.

228
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,634
I'm really sorry
that I couldn't honor what I said to you,

229
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,262
that you'd be protected.

230
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,847
If you put it that way,

231
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,599
I couldn't protect Kang-ho either.

232
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,685
I'm the reason his ads got canceled.

233
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,731
Anyways, uh,

234
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,191
sympathy isn't why I called you here.

235
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,693
I…

236
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,950
I'm going to leave Kang-ho today.

237
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,661
You'll look out for him, won't you?

238
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,291
-Huh?
-Sorry, I just don't know what else to do.

239
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,293
If not that,

240
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,336
do you have a better idea?

241
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,384
-I'm sorry about all this.
-Oh, come on, please don't cry right now.

242
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,347
Just please, watch out for him, all right?

243
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:43,979
No, I… I know it's better this way.
And I know that it's selfish of me too.

244
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,148
I have an idea that might help us.

245
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,567
We could lie about us ending.

246
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:49,985
Wha…

247
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,612
Make them think we broke up.

248
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,740
Why should we have to break up?
Why should we let them do that?

249
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,492
The public doesn't need to know anything.

250
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,288
And nobody's getting hurt.
If anything, they don't deserve to know.

251
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,167
Nothing's worth losing you.

252
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,879
Is this really what we're doing?

253
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,298
We need the public to sympathize.

254
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,550
We can't lose
the advertisers and the movie.

255
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,096
I know. We could've just said,
"Nam Kang-ho didn't know. He was lied to."

256
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,514
Kang-ho was not lied to.

257
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,351
They broke up because of public opinion.

258
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,397
Mr. Do said to protect
Ms. Yeo as much as we can.

259
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,817
And that's exactly what we owe to Mi-ran.

260
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:36,532
This just in, new information
on Nam Kang-ho's girlfriend.

261
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,742
The two have broken up and separated.

262
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:43,455
A lot of people think that Nam Kang-ho
learned he had a promiscuous girlfriend

263
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,541
and, in the end, could not forgive her.

264
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,877
Looks like the people
were entirely wrong about it.

265
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,881
His girlfriend was actually the one
who wanted to separate the whole time.

266
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,883
Nam Kang-ho begged to stay together.

267
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,553
Contrary to what the public is thinking,

268
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,264
the girlfriend never hid
her past from him at all,

269
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,433
and Nam Kang-ho
knew everything from the start.

270
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,442
Kang-ho?

271
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,162
Kang-ho.

272
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,664
I'm fine.

273
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,207
You can go.

274
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,255
I know you won't find
another girl like her.

275
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,300
I even thought maybe you could

276
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,595
choose Mi-ran and give up acting

277
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,598
and just get out of the business.

278
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,394
I also thought hard
about whether I'm your friend or manager.

279
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,314
There's a lot to think about.

280
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,319
As your friend,

281
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,114
no matter what happens with work,
to me, you come before anything.

282
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,743
-Won-jun.
-Yeah, Kang-ho?

283
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,369
I said I'm fine.

284
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,787
So just go.

285
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,247
Okay.

286
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,501
Let me know if you need someone.

287
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,419
'Kay.

288
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:14,963
Yeah.

289
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,060
Oh, it's so hot.

290
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,311
That was good.

291
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,231
This place
isn't so safe after all.

292
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,565
Wanna get out of here?

293
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,442
Hm?

294
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,076
You can start eating
the gopchang first.

295
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,036
Oh, okay. Thank you.

296
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,258
Wow, look at this.

297
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,303
Mmm!

298
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,014
Oh man, gopchang on the grill is the best.

299
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,068
MISSED CALL

300
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,283
Na-eun.

301
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,829
Welcome.

302
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,546
I thought you weren't coming.
Do you wanna sit down?

303
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,507
Actually I can't drink
while wearing company uniform.

304
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,384
Is that so?

305
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,471
Give me a moment.

306
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,309
How much did you drink?

307
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,687
Uh, just that bottle.

308
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,232
Well, actually,
both of those bottles, yeah.

309
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,278
I stopped drinking once I spoke
to you on the phone, though, so…

310
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,949
I wanted to make sure I was sober…
so I could really talk to you.

311
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,330
-Oh, you didn't eat yet, did you?
-No, not yet.

312
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,124
Would you like to go somewhere else?
Is there a certain place you like?

313
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,751
It's all good.

314
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,295
Plus, you still have
all this food left on the table.

315
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,131
And… I'd rather drink than eat.

316
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,310
I appreciate you being here.

317
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,854
Hmm.

318
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,939
So why are you here drinking all alone?

319
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,649
It's just been hard recently.

320
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,986
I don't really have anyone to talk to,

321
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,322
except for you.

322
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,324
You're the only one.

323
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,244
I egged her on into dating him
and had her sign a contract

324
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,081
and got her all wrapped up with Kang-ho.

325
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,833
I had no idea I was this incompetent.

326
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,668
It's pitiful.

327
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,384
I owe an apology

328
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,260
to you too.

329
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,555
There's really no need.

330
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,685
And also,

331
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,855
it's not your fault, you know?

332
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,035
Mm.

333
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,662
Don't get so down.

334
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,831
I mean, you have to stay strong

335
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,332
to take care of Kang-ho.

336
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,462
All right, so we have
nothing to toast to, but…

337
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,637
We should get out of here.

338
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,222
Why don't you lead?

339
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,144
So should I just wait for you?

340
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,645
What do you want?

341
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,606
I was hoping we could stay here
a little longer, actually.

342
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,984
Okay.

343
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,320
-Do you usually wanna go home this fast?
-Not usually, I don't.

344
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,363
So what you got?

345
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,115
Um, karaoke bar?

346
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,283
Karaoke bar?

347
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,119
Yeah, I think I like that.

348
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,927
Hey, I'm in room two.

349
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,935
-Hey! Hey, over there.
-What?

350
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,355
-Isn't that Nam Kang-ho?
-That's Nam Kang-ho.

351
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,774
I know, right?

352
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,901
Ah.

353
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,986
Mmm.

354
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,989
-I was wrong about everything about you.
-Huh?

355
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:54,868
For starters, I didn't think
you were the type to be drinking alone.

356
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,703
This is a beautiful establishment.

357
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:00,207
You have to drink at a stall like this
to really appreciate alcohol.

358
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,628
A fancy lounge?
That's the worst, you know?

359
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,963
I'd rather just drink
at a tteokbokki restaurant. Ugh.

360
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,840
Huh? I love beer and tteokbokki.

361
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,842
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

362
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,720
Let's get that for round two. You with me?

363
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,971
Word.

364
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,267
Mm!

365
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,185
Mm.

366
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,151
That's perfection.

367
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,986
I know, right?

368
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,700
I decided to just stay friends with Grace.

369
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,036
Oh… I see.

370
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,206
Maybe we could go out again?

371
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,045
You know, just meet like this occasionally
and enjoy a meal together.

372
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,798
Think Mi-ran will be okay with that?

373
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,133
I guess not.

374
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,094
It'll be really awkward for everyone.

375
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,428
Unfair to them too.

376
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,139
You're right. I hear what you're saying.

377
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,060
Poor Kang-ho.

378
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,021
He doesn't even get to see
the woman that he loves,

379
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,524
and I'm able to see you
whenever I want. I mean…

380
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,361
I guess, since this is really it,

381
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,698
I'll just say what's on my mind.

382
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,493
I like you, Na-eun.

383
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,501
Oh, just stop.

384
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,421
We won't see each other again,
so why would you say that?

385
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:33,091
Ugh, stop saying silly things,
and let's end this on a good note.

386
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,343
Wait, I just confessed
my feelings for you.

387
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,595
How could you say that to me?

388
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,139
How could you be so heartless?

389
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,434
If we meet again in our next life,
you'll get your shot. Hm?

390
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,395
Next life?

It's 100%.
Wait till she comes out.

411
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,319
-Here she is.
-What's your name?

412
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,907
-Aren't you Ms. Yeo?
-I think it's her.

413
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,701
Uh, I am. Why do you ask?

414
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,663
-Come on, I told you.
-Oh my goodness!

415
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,831
-Wow, this is crazy.
-A karaoke date?

416
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,292
Man, Kang-ho's reputation
is gonna be ruined.

417
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,878
-They even released a statement.
-There he is!

418
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,546
Yo, is that Kang-ho?

419
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,591
Are you guys still together?

420
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,260
They didn't break up?
Wow, seriously?

421
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,680
Please, let us through.
Passing through.

422
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,556
Wow, how'd he end up
with a lady like that?

423
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,683
What did you say?

424
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,060
-Don't. Let's just go.
-Why don't you break up?

425
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,395
Let's get out of here.

426
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,646
Goddamn it!

427
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,071
What about it?

428
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,323
Is it that I dated around?

429
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,327
If you date one or two guys
and think you found the right one,

430
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,745
do you think you're right?

431
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,373
Aren't you rushing it?
At least I was careful.

432
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,583
Show some respect.

433
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,086
Let's go.

434
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,505
Wow, she has no shame.
She's so brazen.

435
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,549
Hey, Kang-ho, how does your leash feel?

436
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,342
At least I was careful.

437
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,636
Show some respect.

438
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,179
Let's go.

439
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,266
She really is something else.

440
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,894
I just can't believe
she'd say such a thing.

441
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,147
She should have apologized
when her lie was caught,

442
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,649
and this is what she does? She yells?

443
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,235
Yeah, sure, but let's say
that she's a gold digger.

444
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,905
Nam Kang-ho, is this really
what we should expect from you?

445
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,161
Mom.

446
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,750
How is it your fault?

447
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,961
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Sit back and tolerate abuse?

448
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,255
I'm sure your dad was also just worried.

449
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,133
You're his only daughter, Mi-ran.

450
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,885
But why does
he have to take it out on her?

451
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:25,096
My mom will just sit there and take it.
Don't go back home!

452
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,974
If you go back home after all that,
then he'll be even more mad!

453
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,227
And you? Are you doing okay?

454
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,145
Me?

455
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,314
I'm worried about you.

456
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,232
Well, what do you wanna do?

457
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:40,111
Even if I'm on your side,
I'm really upset about all this.

458
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,531
Why does my daughter
have to be humiliated 'cause of a guy?

459
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,285
If I can't go back, you can't go back.

460
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,333
The very least
you could have done was tell me.

461
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,084
I'm sorry.

462
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,670
I told you I'd protect you both,
and you know how much that meant!

463
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,672
But that wasn't enough for you.

464
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,467
Now you took Mi-ran's career,
and you threw it down the drain.

465
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,386
Won-jun.

466
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,390
What do I do now?

467
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:14,896
Do what you want.

468
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,901
You said you'd be there for me.

469
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,800
You came right on time.

470
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,593
Is the food cool by now?

471
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,053
Yes, enjoy your meal.

472
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,013
Go on, eat.

473
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,306
There's always more.

474
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,103
Soo-jin, are you sure
it's okay to be seen together?

475
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,314
I feel like people recognize who we are.

476
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,482
Okay, so what?

477
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,067
What can they say?

478
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,945
That some cheating woman
is hanging out with a succubus?

479
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,574
Yesterday, you were so proud,
so what's different now?

480
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,243
I don't wanna get you in trouble
because of me.

481
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,704
I think Won-jun
has enough to think about today.

482
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,838
I like Won-jun,
but I can't live like he wants me to.

483
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,882
It's not easy when others hate you,

484
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,843
but it's even harder
when you hate yourself.

485
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,305
Letting other people
make you live in fear like that?

486
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,640
What an awful thing to do.

487
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,729
Their opinions aren't going to change
whether I support you or not.

488
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:42,066
I just don't want you to be scared
like that. That's no way to be.

489
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,570
Hm. Mm?

490
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,325
-What's up, Sang-sup?
-Hello, Soo-jin.

491
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,036
Do you happen to know
where Ms. Yeo is right now?

492
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,956
Kang-ho just announced
that he's gonna hold a press conference.

493
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,083
And to be honest with you,
I'm really confused.

494
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,460
Did he say something to you?

495
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,755
-Uh, he's holding a conference?
-Wait, you didn't know he was going to?

496
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:10,762
NAM KANG-HO
MISSED CALL

497
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,148
He's here.

498
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,957
Hello.

499
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,334
I want to thank and apologize to everyone.

500
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,920
I know it was a short notice.

501
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,713
Is it okay if we stream this live?

502
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,758
Yes, absolutely. Go ahead.

503
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:52,470
Are you back with her again?

504
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,224
Are you back together,
or did you never break up at all?

505
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,434
Yes, that's correct.

506
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:03,189
There was no point in time
where I was separated from Mi-ran.

507
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,901
I'm sorry for lying to you all.

508
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,906
LIVE BREAKING NEWS!
NAM KANG-HO PRESS CONFERENCE

509
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,413
And if our relationship
disappointed all the fans

510
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,331
who have given me so much love,

511
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,749
I apologize.

512
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,380
But I can't give up
on the woman I love

513
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,009
just because I feel bad for my fans.

514
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:32,927
What?

515
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,639
-Oh wow.
-Oh, he crazy for real.

516
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,683
What did he just say?

517
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,476
He says he won't give up on her.

518
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,730
So I'd like to take this opportunity

519
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,440
and ask her to marry me.

520
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,866
If you're watching,

521
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,786
you said not to feel sorry
about our situation.

522
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,333
But I'm so sorry.

523
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,754
I'll make it up to you from now on.

524
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,798
So what do you say?

525
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,136
Honey.

526
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,471
Wait a second!

527
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,589
Nam Kang-ho is,
out of the countless men that I've dated…

528
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,593
the best man that I've ever met.

529
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,387
He's really a nice person.

530
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,224
And I will never forget someone that…

531
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,151
…would do so much for me.

532
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:17,281
No matter what people say,
I won't feel ashamed about it.

533
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,284
And I won't watch Mr. Nam Kang-ho
get hurt because of me either.

534
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,664
So…

535
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,214
You and I know this has to end.

536
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,174
What?

537
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,552
"Everyone grows apart in time."

538
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,390
I used to think
that was such a silly thing to say.

539
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,561
But it's true now.

540
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:48,896
Isn't it?

541
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,197
It's been great.

542
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,908
Let's make this our good ending.

543
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,456
Faced with the cold reality,

544
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,418
we had a passionate goodbye.

545
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,087
Wow, that woman was something else, huh?

546
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,131
Only Nam Kang-ho
could've handled someone like her.

547
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,217
Yeah? I personally thought
she was kind of brave.

548
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,178
You know, I kind of wanna date
someone like her.

549
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,138
That's right.
You can date someone like her.

550
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,056
But how can you marry a woman like that?

551
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,434
I heard that she dated lots of boys.

552
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,602
What's the big deal?

553
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,936
Adults don't like that.

554
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,023
My mom said you have to date around
to know if you found the right guy.

555
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,941
I think she did the right thing.

556
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,401
Nam Kang-ho is awesome!

557
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,861
I know.

558
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,911
Sir, aren't you going home?

559
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,039
You haven't left either?

560
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,126
-Hurry up and go home.
-Do you maybe want the light on?

561
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,461
It's fine.

562
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,378
All right.

563
00:36:59,133 --> 00:36:59,967
Hey, Sang-sup?

564
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,053
Uh, yes, sir.

565
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,350
-Give me a cigarette.
-Uh, yes.

566
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:11,771
That was it.

567
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,022
That's enough for you.

568
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,317
Things should be okay in probably…

569
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,278
…three months, I'd say.

570
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,115
Don't you think so?

571
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,829
Those assholes at Expose TV ruined this.

572
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,915
Man, they're gonna pay for this. Shit!

573
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,126
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

574
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,920
Hey, hey, you're really gonna kill
someone if you go there now.

575
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,171
Please, calm down.

576
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,943
Shouldn't I see him
at least once before I die?

577
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,486
You won't die from a cold.

578
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,530
Come here.

579
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,004
I never thought I'd feel this bad.

580
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,926
Why did I do that at a press conference?

581
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,017
That was the first time…

582
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,022
…I saw Mi-ran cry.

583
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,843
Jeez, those traitors, huh?

584
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,054
They couldn't hate her enough,

585
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,390
and now they hate us
'cause they feel bad for her.

586
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,808
All right.

587
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,019
Our platform's huge,
so this reveal will save us.

588
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,313
Are we going to top our viewership record?

589
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,357
Hello.

590
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,775
-Hey!
-Hello!

591
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:03,901
-Hey!
-Welcome!

592
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:04,902
My dude!

593
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:05,986
-Let's go!
-Welcome.

594
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,197
Have a seat. Nice to meet you.

595
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,240
Happy to be here.

596
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,741
Wait, what is he doing?

597
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,620
Oh, I don't know.
Hang up the phone and just watch it.

598
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,588
How will you prove
that you're the ex-boyfriend

599
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,007
of Nam Kang-ho's ex-girlfriend?

600
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,426
We were classmates at law school.

601
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,345
I'm sure all of our friends are watching,
so you can ask any one of them.

602
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,596
Yes, understood.

603
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,308
We understand that she was
quite famous back in law school, yes?

604
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,227
Oh my goodness. She was very famous.

605
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,521
-She was super popular.
-Popular with men?

606
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,022
Yeah, among the guys too.

607
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,983
In what way was she popular?

608
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:47,153
Instead of me,
why don't you hear from these people?

609
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,529
Jin-suh, what are you…

610
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,199
I found out later that the guy
was set to marry someone in a month.

611
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,660
I was really upset at first.

612
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,204
Well, Mi-ran seduced that guy
in that month's time

613
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,081
and crashed their engagement.

614
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,334
It was the most satisfying thing
in my whole life.

615
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,005
I heard
she doles out punishments to bad guys.

616
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,507
So I told her
that I'd been abused by a guy.

617
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,217
And I don't know how she did it,

618
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,053
but a few days later, he showed up
with bruises all over his face.

619
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,682
He was too embarrassed to admit
he had gotten beat up by a woman.

620
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,810
She was a real hero among the girls.

621
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,687
It's like
a version of philanthropy.

622
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,024
She's a gifted pickup artist,
and she uses it to administer justice.

623
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:28,235
I bet none of the guys who dated her
will come forward and admit it.

624
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,738
They all deserved exactly what they got.

625
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,698
But I am not like that.

626
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,784
I bet I was probably
the nicest guy among them.

627
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,829
-And that's why we still get along.
-Wait. Wait a minute.

628
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,831
Let's stop for a minute.

629
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,876
What is it? You said you would expose her.

630
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,838
Well, this is the truth.

631
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,257
No, I mean…
Hang on a second. Okay.

632
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,968
Okay, I believe
there's something wrong with the footage.

633
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,721
I did the video editing
all by myself.

634
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,515
That was squeaky clean, Mr. Seo.

635
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,143
Yeah, I'm pretty good, aren't I?

636
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,771
I underestimated men.

637
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,148
Even if they pose and bluff a lot,

638
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,235
the loyalty they showed me…
…was pretty awesome.

639
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,697
HER TRUTH, SHE WAS A REAL HERO
EXPOSE TV'S WITCH HUNT, IS IT OKAY?

640
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,615
NAM KNEW ALL ALONG

641
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,076
PROTESTS AGAINST NAM'S BREAKUP
SUPPORT CONTINUES

642
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,078
Oh wow!

643
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,539
They're all going crazy for you!

644
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,249
Wow.

645
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,626
But why isn't he calling?

646
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,505
There's no way he's lost interest already.

647
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,257
It hasn't even been a month.

648
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,263
-And why aren't you calling him?
-For what?

649
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:41,642
Oh, it's not like you to wait
for him to call. If you love this man,

650
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,727
you should call him back.

651
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,828
-What?
-Uh… Hey.

652
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:02,788
Hi.

653
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,456
Uh…

654
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,500
So did

655
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,253
you see the video?

656
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,380
Yeah.

657
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,924
Oh, so you did.

658
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,511
Are you doing okay?

659
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,722
Yeah. I guess.

660
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,599
This means it's over.

661
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,977
I was the one who wanted to end it,

662
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,521
yet I'm the one who can't.

663
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,649
-Where are you right now?
-Me?

664
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,651
Home.

665
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,153
Come outside then.

666
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,336
How long have you been out here?

667
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,380
Why did you call me?

668
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,717
You have a change of heart?

669
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,054
Well, my heart's never changed.

670
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,056
The circumstances did.

671
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,101
The circumstances changed?

672
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,396
Circumstances can always change,
so tell me this.

673
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,273
What's different now?

674
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,567
What changed?

675
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:14,943
What?

676
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:23,285
So… even with things having changed,

677
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,830
we're not seeing each other again?

678
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:27,873
What?

679
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,542
You're the one that closed the book.

680
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,879
Now you wanna continue the story?

681
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,675
Is that why you called me?

682
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,885
Then why are you here?

683
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:44,932
If you were going to tell me
it's over, why come all the way out here?

684
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,561
You're crying?

685
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,773
No, it's just… I was crying.

686
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:56,235
-Do you wanna get back together with me?
-No, I don't!

687
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,821
Wow, this is
even better than I expected.

688
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,989
Honey, this isn't a good look for you.

689
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,908
What?

690
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,244
So cute.

691
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,916
You had me beg for your love,
and then you broke up with me twice.

692
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,251
So I made it equal.

693
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,255
I think I did a pretty good job,
wouldn't you say?

694
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,549
What?

695
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,135
Oh, I missed you.

696
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,975
I missed you so much.

697
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,109
Ow!

698
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:40,237
Ow, why did you hit me?
You have no right to hit me.

699
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,406
-Ah!
-You think this is funny?

700
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,950
You have no idea how hard this was!

701
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,458
What, you think it wasn't hard for me?

702
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,711
I couldn't get out of bed.

703
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,797
Wow, the great Yeo Mi-ran is crying.

704
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,967
What am I, the first guy
to make you cry or something?

705
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,427
Shut up!

706
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,974
And don't ever tell me
you wanna break up again.

707
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,435
-I won't stand for it.
-I'll never say that.

708
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,063
I'll never leave you.

709
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,192
Okay.

710
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,902
I missed you.

711
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,820
Me too.

712
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,865
-You were so mean!
-Ow!

713
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,660
That's enough, ow.
It's gonna leave a bruise.

714
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:31,955
COURT

715
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,083
The plaintiff Choi Soo-jin
has the right to 50% of the property

716
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,085
gained during the marriage.

717
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,755
Also, the plaintiff's claim
that the defendant Park Jae-hyeong

718
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,466
disgraced her by false claims
of infidelity is upheld.

719
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,718
The act of defamation
and the spreading of false rumors…

720
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,930
-Tell us what you're thinking.
-What were things like in the courtroom?

721
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,057
Cleared of cheating accusations,
how does it feel?

722
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,143
It wasn't even partial victory but total.
Does the world feel different?

723
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,687
When I said I was innocent,
nobody wanted to listen,

724
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:56,855
and now look at you.

725
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,318
By the way…
One, two, three, four, five, six.

726
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,695
There's only six of you here?

727
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,699
When it was about me having an affair,
there were dozens of you.

728
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:12,746
You wrote over 200 articles,
but I win in court, and six is all I get?

729
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,958
Well, I guess you guys
are at least half decent.

730
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,584
So thanks for that.

731
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,213
I feel relieved and vindicated
to have my name cleared.

732
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,049
Any other sordid details you want from me?

733
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:27,052
I'd love to share, so yeah, call.

734
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,972
Okay, that will be all for today.

735
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,558
Oh, excuse me.
You're Ms. Yeo Mi-ran, right?

736
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,393
Are you planning
on marrying Mr. Nam Kang-ho?

737
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,894
Sorry, no comment.

738
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:36,812
Uh…

739
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,690
REAL ACTION NOIR

740
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:48,991
It was good.

741
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,869
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Wait.

742
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:55,497
Oh, come on.
Oh, you've met plenty of celebrities.

743
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,875
Oh Se-na isn't just a celebrity.

744
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,544
Wow, she really is
on a whole 'nother level than Lia.

745
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,839
-I'm more nervous than when I met Soo-jin.
-Let go and come on!

746
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,465
-Hey, wait!
-Hey, hey.

747
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,134
-Se-na.
-You're here.

748
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,094
These are my fellow attorneys from work,

749
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,762
and they wanted to say hi to you.

750
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:11,763
Ah.

751
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,265
Nice to meet you.

752
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,683
-Yes, hello.
-Hello.

753
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,686
I merely go where the light takes me.
You're so beautiful.

754
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,187
Mi-ran.

755
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,899
-Oh!
-Oh, you made it!

756
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,318
Sir, it's ready. Please go in.

757
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,611
Let's all go inside.

758
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,778
-Let's go.
-Mi-ran.

759
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,116
Have I seen you before?

760
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:35,787
Oh, it is you.
You're Mi-ran's ex, isn't that right?

761
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,456
Oh, yeah.

762
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,750
Wow, you have a great memory.

763
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,002
In that case,
you also work together, don't you?

764
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,921
Yeah, over at Gilmu.

765
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,798
It's nice that even after the breakup,
she's friends with you.

766
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:50,260
Oh, it wasn't a good breakup.
He cheated on her.

767
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:52,638
Facts.

768
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,057
Wait, I'm sorry. You cheated?

769
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,352
Oh my gosh. That's interesting.

770
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,191
Where is Won-jun?

771
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,903
I don't know.
He's been ignoring my call and texts.

772
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,536
Wow. Thanks so much.

773
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,498
You did an amazing job.
I'll enjoy the movie.

774
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:20,415
Thank you.

775
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,254
Sorry I'm late. This place is overflowing.

776
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,387
Are you and Kang-ho fighting or something?

777
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,223
It's hard to fight somebody
when they won't talk to you.

778
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,892
You're the one who's not talking, not me.

779
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,939
Is the script ready yet?

780
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,108
Yeah. Well, almost.

781
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,445
-The script for what?
-Won-jun's producing a film right now.

782
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,655
A film?

783
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,409
You didn't know? He's making a film noir.

784
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,289
Why didn't you say anything?

785
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,583
Oh, at one point,
you were gonna quit acting,

786
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,210
so there was really nothing to say.

787
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:08,797
When did I say I was done?
I don't wanna read it anyways.

788
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,136
Who's the male lead?

789
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,514
-NONYA.
-Come on, you're gonna be like that?

790
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,228
Why don't we switch seats?

791
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,438
Nah, nah, nah. No way.

792
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,691
God, seriously.
You were never my bro, huh? Go away. Go.

793
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,192
Get out.

794
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,277
Oh, uh…

795
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,710
It's been a minute.

796
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,212
Hm. Yeah.

797
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,966
Are we still in our current life?

798
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:17,115
-Oh, is that you?
-Oh, that's me! Right there!

799
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,869
-Is your back okay?
-Yeah. It's not real.

800
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,499
I'll tell them
you aren't the killer!

801
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,086
I need to talk to you after the movie.

802
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,174
I need you to trust me and stay here.

803
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,593
I hear you, clearly.

804
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,720
So please be quiet.

805
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,764
It's like killing a bug.

806
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,936
Yeah. "I'm not dead."

807
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,689
I'm not dead.

808
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,608
I think I'm gonna be okay.

809
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,902
She's not dead.

810
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,662
It's so sad.

811
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,807
Whoo!

812
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,604
-You were great.
-So sweet.

813
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,107
Did you like it?

814
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,025
Thank you. Yes. Good work.

815
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:38,572
-What did Mr. Do say before?
-Ah, well, not much. He wanted me to stay.

816
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,907
So is there still some trauma there?

817
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,450
What's so scary about it?

818
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,161
Hey.

819
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,413
You had a rough time, I suppose.

820
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,331
In actuality, hot guys can be nice.

821
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,921
Whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

822
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:58,592
Oh my.

823
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,555
What, is he imitating Richard Gere?

824
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,644
Is he out of his mind?

825
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:15,692
Oh, no.
I better step away. Oh!

826
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,777
Bro, what are you doing?

827
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,329
I never saw myself
doing anything this embarrassing…

828
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,124
but now I have good reason.

829
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:33,710
Ms. Shin Na-eun…

830
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,339
you're an amazing woman.

831
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,757
Oh! Oh!

832
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,598
Na-eun.

833
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:49,935
Be my girlfriend.

834
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,696
-What are you doing? Get off the ground!
-Say yes! Say yes!

835
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,865
Uh, I'm gonna need an answer from you.

836
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,868
I'm on the ground. My knees hurt.
I can't just get up.

837
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,079
Please, please, just please!

838
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,038
Oh, this man!

839
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,124
What he hates the most in this world
is doing embarrassing things.

840
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,753
Well, I know someone
who proposed and was denied.

841
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:17,671
Oh.

842
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,006
Say yes! Say yes!

843
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,633
If you insist, Mr. Do.

844
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,310
Na-eun.

845
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:34,896
So I guess we're, uh…

846
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:37,732
together now?

847
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,070
I would say so.

848
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,378
-You're so handsome.
-Oh, thank you.

849
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,963
-So cute together.
-Thank you.

850
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,506
-Be happy together.
-Thanks.

851
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,759
So what if you ask Na-eun

852
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,430
to get Won-jun to cast me in his movie?

853
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:11,516
Even if I don't actually do that,
he will come around soon.

854
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,145
When you're in love,
you become more generous.

855
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,896
Right?

856
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,399
-So, when are we getting married then?
-Hmm.

857
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:24,154
-Is that still your plan?
-Well, the breakup was canceled.

858
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,822
The proposal still stands.

859
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,992
What are you saying?
I told you I don't believe in all that.

860
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,704
Why?

861
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:36,291
Okay, so…
then you really wouldn't like to?

862
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,752
Oh, no, it isn't that I don't love you.

863
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,755
I don't like
the marriage culture of Korea.

864
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,923
The marriage culture of Korea?

865
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,676
Well, then we just won't live like that.

866
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,137
I wanna have about two kids.

867
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,555
I'm not getting married.

868
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:54,225
-Oh, just give it a thought, will you?
-You never listen to me.

869
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,310
I love you.

870
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,771
Another battle has begun.

871
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,565
A battle to tame and to not be tamed.

872
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:02,984
That was so good.

873
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,154
Oh, by the way,
Won-jun's meeting my parents this weekend.

874
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,324
-Seriously?
-Yeah. I showed my mom a photo.

875
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,242
She thought he was so cute,
and she freaked out.

876
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,452
Oh my God!

877
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,120
She was like, "I can't believe it!"

878
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,749
Oh, that's amazing!

879
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,379
Oh wow.

880
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,509
-Excuse me, sir. Sir?
-Huh?

881
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:28,885
Say you're sorry.

882
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:29,844
For what?

883
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,346
Oh.

884
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,973
Oh, I did it
'cause you're so pretty.

885
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,768
So very pretty. Hm.

886
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,646
Ah! You're just so pretty.

887
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,773
Oh, so pretty. So pretty!

888
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:42,816
Ah, so pretty.

889
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,984
You little punk! You can't say that.

890
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,363
-What's going on?
-What's wrong?

891
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,906
What's happening here? Huh?

892
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,742
This guy here,
he took his hand and was all like…

893
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,953
It was so weird.

894
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:55,995
What did he do?

895
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,873
You think you can do that,
and I'll let it happen?

896
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,166
Oh, excuse me.

897
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,502
-Damn, come on. Let's go.
-Oh, I'm sorry about that.

898
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,712
Oh, you're on thin ice, jazz hands!

899
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,132
-What's wrong with you?
-Do it again, I'll rip out your hair!

900
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,925
-Oh, it's okay.
-Ah!

901
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:12,554
Right. Women are easy prey,
and men are scary. Mm-hmm.

902
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:15,348
Come on. They're not gonna look down
on women anymore.

903
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,394
'Cause they're gonna pay.

904
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,603
Hey!

905
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,521
Honey!

906
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,772
-Get back here!
-No, please!

907
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,358
-Stop right there! Come here!
-Honey! No!

908
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:30,738
You bastards!
You're dead when I catch you!

909
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,367
-Why are you so fast?
-You made me this way!

910
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,703
-You're a good runner.
-Hey, you!

911
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:41,291
LOVE TO HATE YOU
