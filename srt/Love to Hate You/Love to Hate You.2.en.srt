♪ Love to hate you ♪

2
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,655
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,454
It was wrong of me.

4
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,166
PRESIDENT DO WON-JUN

5
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,626
And then?

6
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,713
Yeah?

7
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:50,258
If you whimsically apologize,
and I whimsically forgive you, that's it?

8
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,928
The director and the crew?
What about them?

9
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,138
Ah…

10
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,931
I'll say sorry to the others too.

11
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,808
Ah. How will you do that?

12
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,730
Mr. Yoon, what am I supposed to say?

13
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,774
You'd better bow down
to each and every crew member

14
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,275
the same way you just did now.

15
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,693
What?

16
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,785
If you don't do as I say,
I'll make sure you're done for.

17
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,579
BAD BOY

18
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,872
Did you see that look?

19
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,458
"If you don't do as I say,
I will end you."

20
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,043
-That's what it said.
-I know!

21
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,045
Now, do you see
what I've been telling you?

22
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,463
It was even worse then.

23
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,049
He treats the female lead this way?
"Mr. Romance?"

24
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,094
-I've had enough of it!
-That's what I'm saying.

25
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,430
That's why I did it.
You said, "Do as you please."

26
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,808
You did well.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,812
Hey, she caused that mess herself.
She deserves this and more.

28
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,606
-So how did you do it?
-Do what?

29
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,941
I reached out to Gilmu.

30
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,152
And they said the production company
would probably take legal action.

31
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,113
Nice.

32
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,990
Ugh, you little…

33
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,826
What, what, what? What's wrong?

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,497
I'm embarrassed just thinking about
what the Gilmu guys would say about this.

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,582
You only ever pick fights
with women, seriously.

36
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,584
"Mr. Romance" Nam Kang-ho turns out

37
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,921
to be insufferably nasty and petty.
That's probably what they'll think.

38
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,299
And it's not like you've met
any of the lawyers over there.

39
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,468
They're probably gossiping like crazy.

40
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,470
I'm not even sure
if we can keep this a secret.

41
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,058
How about I… take them out to lunch today?

42
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:23,935
What?

43
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,400
Gilmu Law Corporation.

44
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,278
Let me explain what they're like.

45
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,989
There she is!
There! There she is!

46
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,369
Hey! Hey, wait! Okay. Okay, please…

47
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,287
GILMU'S ATTORNEY

48
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,122
Were you
aware of the plagiarism?

49
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,082
Tell us how you're feeling.

50
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,962
We're innocent.

51
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,258
Our songwriter worked hard on it
for six years.

52
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,428
And we've been listening to it for a…

53
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,139
They specialize in entertainment
and represent celebrities.

54
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,098
GILMU'S REPRESENTATIVE

55
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,350
They have a clearly defined view on life.

56
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,103
"Kill two birds with one stone."

57
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,940
Party with the celebrities
and make money too.

58
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,451
Either they endure the shame,

59
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,786
or they just don't have any.

60
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,212
-Welcome.
-I'm here for the interview today.

61
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,672
-Ah, yes. Right this way.
-I appreciate it.

62
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,674
-Of course. Take care.
-You're welcome.

63
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,306
The biggest problem
is that this is an all-male law firm.

64
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,227
They do not hire female lawyers.

65
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,021
-Why is a woman here?
-She can't get the job.

66
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,277
-Are you Ms. Yeo Mi-ran?
-Yeah.

67
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,615
I know
they called me back as a formality.

68
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,992
And I'm here despite knowing that.

69
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,994
I'm that desperate right now.

70
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,748
The odds may be terrible,
but I can't help taking the chance.

71
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,439
Why are they all men?
I only saw one woman out there.

72
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,441
Uh, yeah, I know.

73
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,237
Uh, maybe they think we only hire men.

74
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,823
You should've said
female candidates only.

75
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,784
No. No way. We couldn't post that.

76
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,911
Oh jeez.

77
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,871
Uh, what was her last name?

78
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,499
I don't know.

79
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,251
Was it Jang Ji-yeon?

80
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,003
That wasn't it.

81
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,548
Hello.

82
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,967
He's a client at this law firm?

83
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,428
Because she thinks
that if she raises her value,

84
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,722
everyone will bid on her, right?

85
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,639
After all,

86
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,809
that's every woman's dream, I suppose.

87
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,105
If he hadn't smiled like that,
I might not have done it.

88
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,036
I mean, I did want to do it,
but it was purely on impulse.

89
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,746
Well, what's done is done.

90
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,623
A good poker face is
a basic requirement for a perfect crime.

91
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,543
Aw.

92
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,716
What now?

93
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,885
Laugh.

94
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,845
-Bro, come on.
-Laugh.

95
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,221
-What?
-Just laugh.

96
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,236
Here, I got you.

97
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,906
There you go!

98
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,991
Well, I hope you enjoyed my show.

99
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,340
Damn, that was embarrassing.

100
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,801
Why did I overdo it
with all that laughing?

101
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,763
It was painfully obvious I was trying
to cover up your humiliation. Ah, damn!

102
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,931
Know what?

103
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,435
They tried to take me out.

104
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,478
Uh…

105
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,940
Okay. Let's just forget about it.

106
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,817
It's plausible enough.

107
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,903
Catch a man off guard, and of course
he's gonna laugh awkwardly about it.

108
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,196
-Dude!
-Huh?

109
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,823
They tripped me, I'm serious.

110
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,741
Wait, hold on. The security cameras.

111
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,826
Check the footage.

112
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,661
Then what, huh?

113
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,373
They get to see you fall again,
and you get to see them laugh at you?

114
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,417
You want to do comedy now?

115
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,584
Cool, cool, yeah.

116
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,421
It's over. Let's just move on, okay?

117
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,964
Okay. Yeah.

118
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,264
But who would have done that?

119
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,769
Hello.

120
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,190
I'm sure you know
Ms. Choi Soo-jin, the acclaimed actress.

121
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,276
She is our VIP client,

122
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,236
so she will be conducting
your interview with me.

123
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,071
-I see.
-Please sit down.

124
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,291
So, tell us about why
you want to join our firm.

125
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,585
Why even bother asking that?
She's here for the money.

126
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,212
Yes. Absolutely.

127
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,798
What was your previous area of practice?

128
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,885
I've worked in many areas,
both civil and criminal.

129
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,095
Have you done divorce proceedings?

130
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,221
Huh?

131
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,142
Oh, yes. Absolutely.

132
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,310
How'd it go?

133
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,396
Winning and losing
are not so clearly defined in divorces,

134
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,023
but they were all partial victories.

135
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,484
-So I can say I've never been beaten.
-Mmm.

136
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,444
-Mm-hmm.
-Are you married?

137
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,072
-Uh, no.
-A boyfriend, then?

138
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,242
We actually just recently broke up. Uh…

139
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,162
They don't ask things like that
at job interviews these days.

140
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,332
Do you have a lot of experience dating?

141
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,753
Would it be bad if I said I have a lot?

142
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,796
Not at all.
It's better if you have a lot of those.

143
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,673
It means you're
well-suited to what we need.

144
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,426
Oh, absolutely.
I have a ton of dating experience.

145
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,428
To what extent? How many have you had?

146
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,765
I haven't kept count,
but excluding casual dates,

147
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,475
15 people?

148
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,101
Are you a player?

149
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,062
It's more like data collection

150
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,897
on different types of men
that are out there.

151
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,190
Oh!

152
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,400
Let's hear about your, uh, aspirations.

153
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,320
What kind of mindset
will you have once you're here?

154
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,532
Everyone says they will do
their best if they're hired, right?

155
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,035
Why don't you show us
some of your special talents?

156
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,078
Sorry?

157
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,957
That way I can see…
just how important this is to you.

158
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,042
I've done talent shows before,

159
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,044
but they've never gone super well.

160
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,430
Oh my.

161
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,575
Show of strength is a no-go.

162
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,618
If you'd rather not, we can move on.

163
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,453
No, please. I have something.

164
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:43,666
It's called… "You'll cringe so much
that you'll want to kill me."

165
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,756
I do feel like killing her.

166
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,187
Ah!

167
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:18,451
♪ I can see it now ♪

168
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:26,917
♪ This is the last love for me ♪

169
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:32,048
♪ Please don't hurt me anymore ♪

170
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,718
-Kill her!
-Kill…

171
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,970
♪ I hate to see… ♪

172
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,891
Uh, wait, are you streaming this?

173
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:42,808
Huh?

174
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,774
Thank you.

175
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,776
-Sure. Of course.
-Me too.

176
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,236
-Oh my gosh!
-No problem. Yeah, of course.

177
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,364
One, two, three.

178
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,199
His success rate is 100%, right?

179
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,076
-With me, one with me.
-For what?

180
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,746
-Sleeping with any woman he wants to.
-No way it's 100%.

181
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,874
Well, you're not at 10%,
so how could you imagine 100?

182
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,043
-Hey.
-One, two, three.

183
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,796
I got dumped
because I got caught cheating, okay?

184
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,047
We even got into the hotel

185
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,800
but then got caught
right in the hallway, man.

186
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,593
Okay. One, two, three.

187
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,429
-Why was your girlfriend at the hotel?
-It's not…

188
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,555
Oh my gosh.

189
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,057
Hey, it's not what you think.

190
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,559
I want a picture too!

191
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,896
So I heard you made a move on Lia
and got shot down bad.

192
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,316
No one knows,
but… it was the opposite.

193
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,904
Hey, are you kidding me?
Why on earth would Lia…

194
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,448
Wait, seriously?

195
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,701
Take a picture of us.

196
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,619
-May I hold on to you?
-Oh, sure, sure.

197
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,037
Thank you!

198
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,539
One, two, three.

199
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,127
One, two, three. One, two, three.

200
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,337
-Oh, thank you.
-Yes. Thank you.

201
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,922
-Thank you so much.
-Of course.

202
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,883
Oh, I ordered sushi for everyone,
if that's okay with you.

203
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,844
-Oh, yes. We love it.
-Great. Enjoy your lunch.

204
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,220
-Okay, goodbye.
-Take care.

205
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,848
-Thank you. You too.
-Bye.

206
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,392
He's such a sweet guy, isn't he?

207
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,644
You know, good-looking guys
are often nice too.

208
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,396
It's the average ones
that act up, isn't it?

209
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,356
You're right, you're right.

210
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,066
Yeah, that's what I mean.

211
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,317
Oh my goodness.

212
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,111
Thank you so much.

213
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,322
When the employees get to meet
a big star like Mr. Nam Kang-ho,

214
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,158
they feel… proud to work here.

215
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,075
I bet.

216
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,870
Ah, you ladies hit the jackpot today,
didn't you?

217
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,622
They aren't listening.
Oh, by the way, the chairwoman…

218
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,083
I mean, Ms. Choi Soo-jin is here.

219
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,836
-Really?
-Ah. Mr. Do.

220
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,382
-What brings you here?
-What are you doing here?

221
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,802
Oh… Uh…

222
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,972
Remember how I said I didn't think
my lawyer understood me very well?

223
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,476
Well, President Yang here says
he's going to hire me a new one.

224
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,394
A female one.

225
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,398
You're making it seem
like I forced you to.

226
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,275
That's true.

227
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,736
Hmm.

228
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,749
Did I take it too far?

229
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,051
Hello.

230
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,145
Do you work here?

231
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,940
Uh, no. I actually just came
for an interview.

232
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,441
Ah.

233
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,069
I thought you seemed okay earlier.

234
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,614
I was trying to play it cool…
because I was embarrassed.

235
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,867
In fact, it hurts so much
that I may have to go see a doctor

236
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,328
in case there's a fracture
or a muscle tear.

237
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,831
-You wouldn't be walking with a fracture.
-Oh, yeah?

238
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,501
Try doing this.

239
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,050
Can you do this?

240
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,348
Uh, ow.

241
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,309
Anyway, I don't think it's fractured.

242
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,936
A light contusion, at worst.

243
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,313
By the way, um,
you didn't record it, did you?

244
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,066
-What?
-Me falling down earlier.

245
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:20,860
No.

246
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,280
Jeez.

247
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,324
What kind of person do you think I am?

248
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,243
Look.

249
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,672
Hmm.

250
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,801
Well, I hope that you feel better soon.

251
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,475
 Going down.

252
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,814
She didn't record it,
but I know it was her.

253
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,650
If you wanted
a different lawyer, you should've told me.

254
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,070
Why would you… why would you come
all the way down here personally?

255
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,866
-You have to be careful about that.
-Well, I have Gil-mu's full support.

256
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,076
You're upset I came without you?

257
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,039
I wouldn't say upset. I just…

258
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,708
You can't just do things
without a discussion, okay?

259
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,084
Is that so?

260
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,962
No one tells me what to do,
but I'll always listen to you.

261
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,839
You know that.

262
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,966
Hey, Kang-ho.

263
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,259
Hi, Kang-ho.

264
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,928
We hardly ever see each other,

265
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,388
even though we're repped
by the same agency.

266
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,389
Hello.

267
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,391
Anyone interested in going for tea?

268
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,727
I have the rest of my day open.

269
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,103
-Let's go.
-Huh? Right now?

270
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,814
Mmm?

271
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,484
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

272
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,576
Ah!

273
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,955
Ah, you know what?
Spontaneous drinking is the best kind.

274
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,041
-I'll have another.
-You chugged that whole thing?

275
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,794
All right, well, have mine.

276
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,795
I didn't touch it.

277
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,463
Okay. Are you sure?

278
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,759
-I'm driving.
-Ah, right.

279
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,637
By the way, why do you suddenly want
a female attorney?

280
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,097
Oh…

281
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,849
The guys are always so busy
kissing up to me, they barely do any work.

282
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,561
You know women are busy flirting
and slack off on work too.

283
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,981
-What?
-Mmm.

284
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,359
So, then, I guess you don't even want
pretty girls flirting with you?

285
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,445
The pretty ones are the worst.
They think they can do whatever they want.

286
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,533
That's why you don't have a girlfriend.

287
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,369
Or, um, you haven't been dating at all.

288
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,745
Maybe you're… gay?

289
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,791
You can talk to me if you need to.
I like people like you.

290
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:44,753
They understand other genders so well,
and they usually have a lot of talent.

291
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,006
Oh, women always love gay guys.

292
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,926
Isn't it every woman's dream
to have a gay best friend, or am I wrong?

293
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,636
Sorry to disappoint you.

294
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,722
You don't have to be sorry.

295
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,891
It's not like I'm trying to become friends
with you or anything like that.

296
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,521
Oh, by the way,
when am I throwing the party for my award?

297
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,858
-Let's find a date soon.
-Tomorrow, you think? Tomorrow's good.

298
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,944
-What?
-Tomorrow? That's pretty short notice.

299
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,071
They don't call me
"Ms. Unpredictable" for nothing.

300
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,365
Anyway, I'm sure
that those who want to come

301
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,908
will find a way to come, as always.

302
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,077
Come on. Who would dare
turn down an invite from you?

303
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,037
There's one.

304
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,041
The one who makes an excuse
not to come out. Hmph.

305
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,627
He's in the same agency as me
and hasn't even shared a meal with me.

306
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,173
Kang Ho-dong once said that what makes
you a family is sharing a meal together.

307
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,302
Oh, right. Should I invite
the folks at the law firm too?

308
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,387
Isn't it about time
we did a company dinner?

309
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,556
For sure. That's a really good idea.

310
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,059
Wait. You know what?

311
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,729
I think that we should have
the two of you as cohosts.

312
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,565
Our staff are all busy,

313
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,109
and it'd be a hassle to host
two separate parties.

314
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,903
-It's perfect.
-Maybe some other time.

315
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,280
-Let her have hers first.
-Well, I don't like it either.

316
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,450
Our tastes are totally different.
I doubt you even know how to party.

317
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,118
Everyone approaches parties differently.

318
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,412
For me, my enjoyment isn't
the most important thing.

319
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,624
Right. But if I'm good,
to hell with everyone else, though, right?

320
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,459
Okay, that's enough.

321
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,629
That's good. Enough. Yeah?

322
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,174
The both of you can party as individuals.

323
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,094
And as soon as one
of your contracts expires,

324
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,846
please, you should find
a different agency to join.

325
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,475
I don't care which one it is.
You can both leave if you want to.

326
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,018
-Eh…
-Ooh…

327
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,978
-Won-jun, hey!
-Dude.

328
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,273
Oh, come on, we weren't fighting.

329
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,443
You know we both
tend to be direct when we talk.

330
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,487
We'll cohost, okay?

331
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,656
We're in the same agency, aren't we?

332
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,785
Oh, yeah, I could do that.

333
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,746
Mmm?

334
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,248
Bravo!

335
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,375
Mmm.

336
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,971
Can't I just show up right at the end?

337
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,514
To pay the bill?

338
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,480
If you don't knock it off with all that,
I'm gonna get really angry.

339
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,322
PRINCESS: JOHNNY'S AUTOGRAPH!

340
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,408
I thought Johnny was too busy to go?

341
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:23,620
He'll be there for sure. He's a good kid,
and he shows up anywhere you invite him.

342
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,540
Why? Did the little princess
request his autograph?

343
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,375
How'd you know?

344
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,751
You only make that face

345
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,837
when the little princess
send you a message.

346
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,340
Seriously, could you please try to be
as nice to other women as you are to her?

347
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,050
Even half as nice would be huge!

348
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,011
If you did that,
I wouldn't have to work so hard!

349
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,030
Don't you dare touch your savings.

350
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,781
I told you I'd pay the rent.

351
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,950
I won't.

352
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,287
I relieve stress
by putting money into my savings.

353
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,205
1,818 WON SENT

354
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,918
And please don't cause
any more trouble, okay?

355
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,377
We can't afford to be sued.

356
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,298
Relax, I'm just doing this to save money
on a gym membership, I swear.

357
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,966
Any word on a job yet?

358
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,846
Is it possible
this feeling of being nagged

359
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,765
stems from my own insecurities?

360
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:28,936
-Do you have any more interviews or not?
-Still waiting to hear from two places.

361
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,360
Where are you going?

362
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,238
-Convenience store.
-Convenience store?

363
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,366
Do you know how much more expensive
that is than a supermarket?

364
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,453
Relax. I'm not buying anything.
It's for a part-time job.

365
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,378
Yes, hello?

366
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,882
Seriously? Okay, I understand.

367
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,385
I appreciate it.

368
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,554
I totally got it.

369
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,934
-Which one?
-Gilmu.

370
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,352
Oh.

371
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,522
Why? It's Lee Jin-suh, I'm guessing?

372
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,400
Be excited. You said yes, right?

373
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,944
Of course. Why wouldn't I?

374
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,532
-But why did they pick me?
-Oh, come on.

375
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,575
You're an incredible lawyer!

376
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,912
You win cases, you're healthy,
and you're personable.

377
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,957
I've never seen another lawyer
so perfect in every way.

378
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,667
Ah, congratulations.

379
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,836
But you were just yelling.

380
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,587
Was I? When?

381
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,673
Ah! So, what are we eating?

382
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,842
We'll go shopping.
Do you want meat or sushi?

383
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,719
-Meat!
-And red ginseng?

384
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,559
I went up against all
of those guys and beat them all.

385
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,063
The one place that reached out
and grabbed my hand in my darkest hour.

386
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,775
As the first female attorney at Gilmu,
I'm going to do my best.

387
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,985
Let's go!

388
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:04,197
In order to enter into a contract with us,
you must first sign this agreement here.

389
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,532
Okay.

390
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:12,664
I will not mention to others
anything regarding the private affairs

391
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,915
of my clients.

392
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,542
If I violate the above terms,

393
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,045
not only will I be held liable
for civil suits,

394
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,672
but I will also pay
triple my annual salary…

395
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,090
Triple, triple!

396
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,925
…as payment for my penalties.

397
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,386
Are we in agreement?

398
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,387
Oh.

399
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,472
Yeah.

400
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,975
SIGNATORY YEO MI-RAN

401
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,145
Well, you've signed the contract,
so you're one of us now.

402
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,898
Which means we can talk more freely, no?

403
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,983
-Yes.
-Okay.

404
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,820
The confidentiality agreement
is effective as of this moment,

405
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,489
so keep that in mind.

406
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,573
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

407
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,534
The virtues you must possess
at this law firm are,

408
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,245
primarily, quick wits and understanding.

409
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,958
Our main clientele are celebrities,
and they are a very temperamental bunch.

410
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,752
Their ups and downs can be severe.

411
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:02,172
They don't even read the contents
of petition drafts. They're above that.

412
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,841
Just try to maintain
a friendly relationship,

413
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,844
take their side, give them your support,
and they'll completely trust you.

414
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,181
If they feel you're neglecting them,
though, the complaints begin.

415
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,808
Ah.

416
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,269
The worst of all is the lady
from your interview, Choi Soo-jin.

417
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,187
I see.

418
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,273
And from now on,
she'll be assigned to you.

419
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,737
Just do whatever she says,
whether it's related to the case or not.

420
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,031
Give her what she wants,
and everything will be fine.

421
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,867
-Yes, sir!
-Any questions?

422
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,952
Sir?

423
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,412
Questions for me?

424
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,998
Oh… You're President Ko Yong-woo,
aren't you?

425
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,625
That's right.

426
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,087
I'm sorry, but I thought Yang Gil-mu
was the president of this firm.

427
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,925
Wait, do you know someone here?

428
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,928
I just heard it somewhere.

429
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,933
Well, now that you're in our gang,
you should know who the leader is.

430
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:59,563
The man from the interview, yeah? That was
CEO Yang Gil-mu that you met with.

431
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,106
Ah!

432
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,066
On paper, he's the paralegal manager.

433
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,109
Ah.

434
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,903
-A non-lawyer ownership.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Something wrong?

435
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,281
Uh, no, sir.

436
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,827
Oh, are you done?

437
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,830
Uh, attention please, everyone!

438
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,373
Yeah, yeah.

439
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:23,962
I am pleased to announce that as of today,
our firm finally has a female attorney.

440
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,298
Uh, why don't you introduce yourself.

441
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,551
Hello, I'm Yeo Mi-ran.

442
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,429
I'm excited to…

443
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,308
…work with you all.

444
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,977
So, I would like to ask
for everyone's full support

445
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,815
to ensure that Ms. Yeo here
gets settled in as quickly as possible.

446
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,568
-Yes, sir.
-I'll give you a rundown. Over there…

447
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,569
How old is she?

448
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,947
-She's my ex-girlfriend.
-Lying through your teeth still, huh?

449
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,365
She was the one who left.

450
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,618
The hotel?

451
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,499
Okay. Would someone
please take Ms. Yeo for a company tour?

452
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,503
-Oh, Mr. Seo--
-Sir. Allow me.

453
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,840
-Okay, Mr. Lee.
-All right.

454
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,175
Oh, one more thing.

455
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,095
We have an all-hands dinner today
with Dowon Entertainment, okay?

456
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,348
I already drank yesterday too.

457
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,683
Oh, you can drink again.
Don't make a fuss about it.

458
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,026
Things weren't going well at my old firm.

459
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,155
So I decided to leave,
which wasn't easy at all.

460
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:36,993
I know it could be awkward for you,
but don't worry. I won't cause trouble.

461
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,787
Things must really be bad.

462
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,164
You never really cared for our firm.

463
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,334
Hang on. I actually said that?

464
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,377
You didn't have to.

465
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,421
I could tell. I couldn't tell
you were cheating on me, though.

466
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,591
And this is the nap room.
There isn't a women's one.

467
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,592
That's okay.

468
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,222
Uh, you know,
because I don't plan to sleep here.

469
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,654
This is the company gym.

470
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,408
Unfortunately, there's
no shower for women.

471
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,659
Oh.

472
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,160
If you wanna wash up…

473
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,870
…I'll be your security.

474
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,747
Okay, you got it.

475
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,790
The cafeteria.

476
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,792
Drinks and snacks are all free,

477
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,044
and you can bring in
all the booze you want.

478
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,797
Ooh. How nice.

479
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,757
-Have a seat.
-Sure.

480
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:38,847
Aren't you busy?

481
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,016
I'm a salaried lawyer. I'm never busy.

482
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,103
We don't care if the trial
gets delayed or goes on forever.

483
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,938
Thanks so much.

484
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,152
Did you sleep together that night?

485
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,119
Jin-suh.

486
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,706
Look, I apologize for suddenly popping up
in your life again,

487
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,958
but let's just try to stay coworkers here.

488
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,294
Mr. Lee, help me out.

489
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,546
-Help you out, huh?
-Yes. Please.

490
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,508
-You're a real jerk, you know that?
-I know that.

491
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,677
That's why
I keep asking you like this.

492
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,595
No problem.

493
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,765
-I'm a chill guy, after all.
-Yeah, you are.

494
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,726
Oh, this must be
like a classic Hollywood friendship, huh?

495
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,478
Oh, we'll see.

496
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,939
Take care.

497
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,741
What… friendship?

498
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,494
Huh.

499
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,245
I'm sorry.

500
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,832
I apologize for my past actions.

501
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,336
I apologize for my past actions.

502
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,090
-I apologize for my past actions.
-What's she doing?

503
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,549
Is she actually being nice?

504
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,243
Don't close your eyes.

505
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,185
Cut! Okay.

506
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,271
That was great.

507
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,024
-Any problems?
-No problems.

508
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,110
He's a beast on camera
and a gentleman when it stops.

509
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,945
Damn, my heart is pounding.

510
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,782
That kiss scene was so amazing.

511
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,826
So you're all good with Kang-ho, right?

512
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,162
Some friend he is.

513
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,122
That wasn't a kiss
he learned from a book though.

514
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,833
Kang-ho doesn't have
any scandals that we know about.

515
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,880
Oh my.

516
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,054
Damn it.

517
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,145
Oh, damn.

518
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,525
Not even my meds work for her.

519
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,906
He must have an upset stomach.

520
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,909
-He's gay.
-What?

521
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,702
Do you know what would happen

522
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,205
if this got out?

523
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,376
Maybe that's how he's avoided scandals.
That would make sense, huh?

524
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,419
Oh.

525
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,431
This way!

526
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:14,604
-Hurry, hurry. Yeah, yeah.
-Seat belts! Come on!

527
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,148
-Get in!
-Everyone's in. We're good.

528
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,442
Everyone's in. We're good.

529
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,782
Ms. Yeo. Drink.

530
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,909
-Drink it all. Drink, drink, drink.
-Whoo!

531
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,578
Ah!

532
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,581
Wow, that perks you right up.

533
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,125
I haven't been able to upgrade
my repertoire. What should I do?

534
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,336
Oh, don't worry about your repertoire.

535
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,422
Listen, just back them up
when they're doing their thing.

536
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,383
And always remember
to cheer them on, all right?

537
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,884
-Yeah!
-Yes, sir!

538
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,055
You know, our clients
really do bear their all to us lawyers.

539
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,890
Imagine how vulnerable they feel.

540
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,561
Especially as celebrities, you know?
Always afraid of some kind of scandal.

541
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,981
Just think, how degrading would it be
if they were the only ones feeling naked

542
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,482
and us lawyers were always composed.

543
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,400
Absolutely!

544
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,069
That's why we embarrass ourselves
every once in a while.

545
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,530
-That's right.
-It builds a tight bond of camaraderie.

546
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,283
-Talk to 'em!
-Is that thoughtful of us, or what?

547
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,409
Ah, yes.

548
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,077
But I'm a little concerned.

549
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,248
Uh… you think it will be
a tad too much for this lady?

550
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:18,334
To be honest,
I'm not really that ladylike at all.

551
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,836
Ooh!

552
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,881
Ah! In that case, we're upping the ante!

553
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,842
Ah! Let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

554
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,304
Come on, let's go. Whoo!

555
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,514

-All right, all right!

556

00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,104
-Hey, look at her, look at her.
-Oh, you've got moves.

558
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:41,149
You guys can't hold
a candle to me in anything.

Yeah, you know it!

Let's go!

Wait. Hey, have you met
Mr. Do Won-jun yet?

572
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,614
She's the first female attorney
Gilmu's ever hired.

573
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,532
Now Ms. Choi Soo-jin's her client.

574
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,620
That's right. I'm Yeo Mi-ran.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

575
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,080
It's a pleasure meeting you too.

-Look, I know you'll take good care of…
-Mmm.

577
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,424
…our dear Ms. Soo-jin.

578
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,134
Of course. I'll do my best.

579
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,344
Yes?

580
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,012
-I'm going to the men's room.
-Oh, yes!

581
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,152
Hey!

582
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,159
And that's for you!

583
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,872
-I saw your pink undies!
-Hey, what are you doing?

584
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,334
Talk to my agent. He'll get you a pair
of my pants. There's some in the van.

585
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,003
Great job!

586
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,296
Go, go, go!
Don't turn around. Just go.

587
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,257
Great! That's good.

588
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,427
All right, everyone.

589
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,012
Are we having a good time?

590
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,304
Yeah!

591
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,390
Just so you know, we are lawyers.

592
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,727
All right, let's keep that energy going,
because next up

593
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,186
is our newcomer initiation!

594
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,897
Why don't we all give her a hand?

595
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,275
Do what you did yesterday.
Do what you did yesterday.

596
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,236
-So good!
-Go, Ms. Yeo! Go, Ms. Yeo! Go…

597
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,155
I really did want to strangle her.

598
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,782
You know
the whole routine, don't you?

599
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,868
Of course you do.
You're a brilliant actress.

600
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,578
Yeah!

601
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,996
You can do it!

602
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,206
-You can do it!
-Oh!

603
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,208
-Yeah!
-Preemptive dominance.

604
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,794
I have to take charge
before they think I'm weak.

605
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,673
What are you doing?

606
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,761
-Calming yourself down because I was late?
-No.

607
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:18,264
What a relief.
As long as it wasn't me, right?

608
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,604
Someone in there
has seen you fall down, man.

609
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,024
That time you fell down
like a complete idiot.

610
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,650
So, then why are you out here?

611
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,069
I'm embarrassed.

612
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,362
I'm the one who fell down,
so why do you care?

613
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,782
Seriously, why did I overdo it
with the laughing?

614
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,286
Ah.

615
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,829
It was pretty awkward.

616
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,998
I'd be super embarrassed too.

617
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,168
Good for you, though.
Quitting acting was the right choice.

618
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,671
-Shut up and get inside.
-Yeah.

619
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,595
One of the worst things
a human being can go through

620
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,764
is the pain of embarrassment.

Yeah, yeah, Johnny, Johnny. Hey, look.
Kang-ho really wants your autograph, man.

674
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:00,027
He's been talking about it for days.
Get it before you forget.

675
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,280
And maybe do it outside.
Inside's a bit nuts.

676
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,533
-Be sure to write something good.
-Yes, sir. I understand.

677
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,118
He has a shoot on Jeju in the morning.

678
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,120
Send him straight home
when you get outside.

679
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,288
Okay.

680
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:17,420

Yeo Mi-ran! Yeo Mi-ran!

681

682
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,906
Yeah, see?

683
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,076
Did I pick the right person,
or what?

684
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,080
All right, everyone raise your glass.
Okay, cheers!

685
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,583
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

686
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,719
No!

687
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,512
Are you drunk?

688
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,558
Come on.

689
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,186
I'll see you later, Mr. Nam.

690
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,270
Yeah, you take care.

691
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,273
-Have a good one.
-Sure thing!

692
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,613
Baby, you are so cool.

693
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,911
-Be quiet!
-Huh? Huh?

694
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,539
There's no one here but us.

695
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,792
Mmm.

696
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,551
Oh, take it easy.

697
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,262
Sexually harassing a coworker.

698
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,180
What?

699
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,517
However, I'll let it slide
under one condition.

700
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,728
You and I are
strictly coworkers from now on, okay?

701
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,105
Huh, what?

702
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,860
Go wash your face.

703
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,574
-Ooh!
-Ah!

704
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,247
It's dirty here. Get up. Hey, get up.

705
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,456
Ah, jeez.

706
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,707
Hey.

707
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,959
Hey, hey, hey. Wake up.

708
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,420
-Wash your face.
-I won't wash my face, damn it.

709
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,338
I'm not washing my face.

710
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,340
Uh, what are you doing?

711
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,050
Uh…

712
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,470
-You just see if I wash my face.
-Hey, Mr. Lee.

713
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,140
Are you upset
because of your torn pants, huh? Huh?

714
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,476
That's why you shouldn't have lost
at rock, paper, scissors. Oh!

715
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,770
Jeez.

716
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,772
Ah, well,

717
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,233
so you embarrassed yourself
in front of your ex.

718
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:48,237
But you really livened up the mood.
I laughed so hard I split a seam.

719
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,698
Guess your pants…
…did too.

720
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,908
Did you even open
your fly before you peed?

721
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,785
Yeah.

722
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:55,953
Ugh, this guy.

723
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,248
Hey. By the way,

724
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,625
did things really end between you?

725
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,335
You…

726
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,837
What?

727
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,632
You look terrible.

728
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,514
Here, here, here. Where do you live?

729
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,183
I'll give you a ride.

730
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,100
Let's go!

731
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,518
I live pretty far.

732
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,936
Go home and rest, okay?

733
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,106
Hey, Yeo Mi-ran, I'm the one
who got this job for you.

734
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,861
I asked them to give me a female lawyer,
and that's why they hired you.

735
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,032
So do you think you should be
a good girl to me or not?

736
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,576
I was hired because I'm a woman?

737
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,453
So, now tell me where you stay.

738
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,373
-I need to go to the restroom.
-Oh, the restroom? The rest…

739
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,042
-You should go. Hurry up.
-Okay.

740
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,091
Whoa, whoa. Are you okay?

741
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,010
Not in the slightest.

742
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,553
But you know that.

743
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:58,224
I act like I'm having fun,
but I'm really not.

744
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,436
Aw, what's wrong, darling?

745
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,772
Huh? So you had a good time for a change.

746
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,608
-Mmm.
-Come on. Let's go, let's go.

747
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,445
-I can drive you home myself tonight.
-You will?

748
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,364
You really want to do that?

749
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,449
Do you feel like taking my car or yours?

750
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,786
Whichever one's closer.

751
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,377
I was so happy
that I had bested all those guys.

752
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,004
So this is what
reverse discrimination feels like.

753
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,594
Oh!

754
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:37,846
I'm sorry.

755
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,431
No need to apologize.

756
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,936
You weren't… waiting for me, were you?

757
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,062
What?

758
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,483
Oh, no. Why would I wait for you?

759
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,027
Well, it would definitely make
a lot of sense.

760
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,613
You know, because of
your… performance before.

761
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,456
Oh, look, that was just--

762
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,001
I think you have a knack
for getting men's attention, don't you?

763
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,713
-Huh?
-You even landed my attention.

764
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,549
It was you at the office, wasn't it?

765
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,014
I felt when your foot touched mine.

766
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,016
You must have felt
when my foot touched yours, no?

767
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,227
This man is a VIP client.

768
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,396
What do I do? Deny it to the bitter end?

769
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,357
If you deny it
to the bitter end…

770
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,318
Okay, I'm sorry.

771
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:38,198
The truth is, I stretched out my leg
at the wrong time that day.

772
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,409
I'm really sorry.

773
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,539
Lying to me won't help you out here.

774
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,793
But because you recognize
that I'm not a fool,

775
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,463
that means you aren't one either.

776
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,383
So, since you mentioned it…

777
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,721
did you really stretch at the wrong time?

778
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,931
-It wasn't intentional?
-What?

779
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:07,519
There are women who do anything it takes
to make sure you don't ever forget them.

780
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,188
It's true.

781
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,441
I see their faces, ask their names,
take pictures, and sign autographs.

782
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,985
And really, to be honest,
there are so many

783
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,320
that I can't remember every one.

784
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,115
But the ones who decide to hurt me
without a care in the world,

785
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,993
those are the ones
that I just cannot let go.

786
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,870
They really are pathetic.

787
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:29,667
Oh, I'm not like that. I was stretching
my leg, and it just happened to--

788
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,294
If that was the case,
you should have said you were sorry.

789
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,755
I'm attacking an innocent person?

790
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,757
Is that the point
you're really trying to make?

791
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,677
I would've dropped it
if you just apologized,

792
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,720
but if you really did nothing wrong,
then prove it.

793
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,806
Let's go check Gilmu's security footage.

794
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:47,142
That way we'll know once and for all
if it really was an accident.

795
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,228
Um, wait.

796
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,275
I'm really sorry.

797
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,652
I did it, okay?

798
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,738
Because I'm such a huge fan of yours!

799
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,873
It's just… I really like you.

800
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,170
I… I just wanted
to touch you once, that's all.

801
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,173
I'm so sorry.

802
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,759
Come on.

803
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,277
Here's a tip,
be more careful with your love.

804
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,988
You hear me? Okay?

805
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:43,782
Yes.

806
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,034
I will, I promise.

807
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,258
I'm not the first person
to throw away their dignity

808
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,010
just to put food on the table.

809
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,430
I've never confessed
my love to a man before,

810
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,807
so whatever happens… happens.

811
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,154
Where did everyone go?

812
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,807
I just know her type.

813
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,143
She pretends to be easygoing
and gets men to drop their guard.

814
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,062
Then she seduces and uses them.

815
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,400
-She says she's a fan of mine.
-Hmm?

816
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,903
But I think it'd be best
if she stays away from me.

817
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:03,821
Mmm.

818
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,075
Different woman, same problems, huh?

819
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,161
-Yeah.
-What about Ji-woo?

820
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,664
-You get along fine with her.
-I don't know anymore.

821
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,332
I can't stand these girls.

822
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:22,756
Hmm?

823
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,716
Dude, isn't that Ji-woo?

824
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,561
-Ji-woo.
-Hi.

825
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,356
-What are you doing out here?
-I was just, um… waiting for you.

826
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,025
It's been a while.
You look great.

827
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,153
Yo, you forgot this.

828
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,406
Are you hungry?

829
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,701
Why are you dressed so light?

830
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,246
Come here, let me give you a hug.
You must be freezing.

831
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,374
Let's go inside.

832
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,334
Okay.

833
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,173
See you around. Good night.

834
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,980
Have I been cursed somehow?

835
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,154
I can't stand these girls.

836
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,618
Yes!

837
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,494
Uh-oh. Oh!

838
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,296
Yes! At least they're outside now.

839
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:55,933
What's this?

840
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,686
Here. Have a good night.

841
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,525
Guys really are the worst.

842
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,332
POLICE

843
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,130
Seriously? Is he actually
the president in disguise?
