Just because you don't understand, resist it➡

194
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:20,627
The play stopped➡

198
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:29,957
There were times when the wind blew.

199
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:32,099
What did you say?

200
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,825
First of all, I owe you something.

201
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,099
That's why even if you suddenly say that.

202
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,726
What about elementary school?

203
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:45,396
I'm contacting my homeroom teacher.

204
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:49,396
While I was in the hospital

205
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:49,396
My younger brother will take care of me➡

206
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,693
for a while

207
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,693
Please let me study at home.

208
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:55,363
Talk to me like that...

209
00:08:58,264 --> 00:09:01,231
Later.

210
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:03,759
Is there one more thing I would like to ask you?

211
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:08,165
what?

212
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:11,858
Because I want a divorce

213
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:11,858
I would like to consult with you about this.

214
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:13,924
Huh?

215
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:13,924
Since when is things not going well?

216
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:15,627
Since when...

217
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:19,594
Well, maybe since I got married.

218
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:22,033
Then why sooner?

219
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:22,033
Didn't you consult me?

220
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:24,297
It's my problem.

221
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,297
Let's rely on the first time

222
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,297
Because I didn't think so.

223
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:28,264
Then why now...?

[Smartphone vibration sound]

225
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,561

Come again.

227
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:47,165
I will explain in detail at that time.

228
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:49,429
When can I leave the hospital?

229
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:51,264
Hehehe...right away.

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,099
I heard it from my mother.

231
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:59,792
I've been saying Hakkun since I was little.

He loves keema curry.

233
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:02,066
Ah, that's right.

234
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:05,726
If you eat this

235
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:05,726
It makes me feel better.

236
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:08,825
And there aren't that many tomatoes.

237
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:08,825
Don't crush it too much➡

238
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:12,000
That seems to be the point.

239
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:12,000
Ha~ I heard good things!

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,693
Teach me that!

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,693
Okay.

It's in there➡

250
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,528

Thank you.

253
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:42,594
What about your sister? Did we meet?

Ah.

255
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:47,033

It might cause trouble though.

260
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,825
There's no such thing.

261
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:57,957
Anzu-chan is a good girl.

262
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:01,528
Something suddenly happened to the child.

263
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:01,528
I'm glad it looks like it's done.

264
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:07,066
Who is your sister's husband?

265

The photo I showed you yesterday

288
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:12,165
Will it serve as evidence?

289
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,825
yes?

290
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:16,627
Is the photo usable?

291
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:16,627
Please check...

"Please check if you can use photographic evidence."

300
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:32,594
Apparently someone told me that.

301
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:35,099
What do you mean?

302
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:35,099
It's just as the word says.

303
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:37,858
Ah, sure➡

304
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:41,198
At that time, I just felt nervous.

305
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:41,198
I thought so.

306
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:43,693
I felt like I couldn't see my true feelings.

307
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:47,858
Does she really want to break up with him?

308
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:50,858
Or...

309
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,957
Is there another reason?

310
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:58,792

That means you're smiling➡

408
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:32,033
Looking at the camera wasn't a coincidence

409
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:32,033

I have to.
