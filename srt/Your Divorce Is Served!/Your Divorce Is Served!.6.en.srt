(First time) Yeah.

The only thing I'm sure of is that I

45

This means refusing this request.

That's why I want a divorce.

51
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:42,858
I'm sure it's a personality mismatch

52
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:42,858
It's a difference in values.

I can't forgive.

I understand how you felt at first.

However, Ryoko's point is also

61
00:01:53,462 --> 00:01:56,198
There might be.

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,363
It's very important.

191
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:54,462
is that so.

192
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,858
If so, please contact another lawyer.

193
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,858
I'll go for a consultation.

194
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:17,924
(♪〜)

195
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,660
First time drinking beer?

196
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,594
No matter how much I think about it

197
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,594
I don't know.

198
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:36,099
yeah?

199
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:36,099
Ryoko is➡

200
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,264
why the truth

201
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,264
Are you trying to hide it?

202
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:44,495
Well, before I say no, the other side

203
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:44,495
Because I gave up on you➡

204
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:46,660
It doesn't matter anymore.

205
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:52,429
of one's adultery

206
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:52,429
If the other party finds out➡

207
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:55,759
It will be detrimental to divorce

208
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:55,759
Does that mean you were trying to hide it?

209
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,264
Yeah

210
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,264
Well, I guess that's common.

211
00:08:58,264 --> 00:09:00,528
but

212
00:08:58,264 --> 00:09:00,528
My husband has already found out.

213
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:04,594
Ah... so you went back to your hometown?

214
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:08,297
Search well

215
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:08,297
I thought I'd included it.

216
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:12,297
As expected, the area around Mr. Enomoto is

217
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:12,297
Maybe I'm sensitive.

218
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:14,264
Or...

219
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:17,594
Ryoko's unfaithful partner➡

220
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:21,396
I don't want to be touched if it's Mr. Enomoto.

221
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:21,396
There was a reason.

222
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:24,858
Hmm? What do you mean?

223
00:09:24,858 --> 00:09:26,957
Is your hometown Kamakura?

224
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:30,297
Yeah. Near Yuigahama

225
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:30,297
I was living there.

226
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:34,561
Huh? Haven't you been to Kamakura for the first time?

227
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:34,561
Yes, in Ryoko's hometown.

228
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:37,693
Oh, and what about Mr. Enomoto➡

229
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:39,825
Are we the same age?

230
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:42,759
Huh? What do you mean?

231
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:47,396
What happened to Kamakura?

232
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:49,495
I'm sorry, I suddenly spoke out loud.

233
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:52,528
You woke me up.

234
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:52,528
Is there anything in Kamakura?

235
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:56,132
Don't put your head into work.

236
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:58,561
Hakkun Kamakura Do you know anything about it?

237
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:00,924
No, once

238
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:00,924
I've only been there before?

239
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:03,627
Then it's Anna's turn.

240
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:06,495
Well, Anzu-chan, do you know anything about it?

241
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:08,264
Ah.

242
00:10:09,528 --> 00:10:12,594
Anna's family home.

243
00:10:09,528 --> 00:10:12,594
Yeah?

244
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:15,891
It's Kamakura.

245
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:15,891
Ah, that's right! ?

246
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:18,066
Ah, that's right.

247
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:18,066
Yeah.

248
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:21,198
Take me out on weekdays.

249
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:23,396
If my sister finds out

250
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:23,396
I feel like I'm going to be blown away.

251
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:25,132
Hehehe… [lol]

252
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:27,264
You're Umi-kun's assistant today, right?

253
00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:29,264
It's work.

254
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:31,330
hey~.

255
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,099
What is "ne~"?

256
00:10:37,264 --> 00:10:39,165
I guess it's really here.

257
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:41,165
I don't know about that ➡

258
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:43,429
There are elementary schools in this area.

259
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:43,429
It's only here, right?

260
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:45,924
Yeah

261
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:45,924
I think class is already over➡

262
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:49,627
There aren't many people so it's an easy win.

263
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:49,627
What an easy win...

264
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:51,825
Well then, I asked for two people!

265
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,297
Okay.

266
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,297
Huh! There is a young sea here...

267
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:59,099
It's noticeable when you enter through the main gate.

268
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:59,099
I'll go from the side of the lunch room!

269
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:01,561
[Knocking on window]

270
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:01,561
Hakkun, let's go!

271
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,066
Wait a minute, Anna

272
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,066

274
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:06,198
Hey, oh, hey.

00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,066
Anna wait!

276
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,066

277
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,858
Take care.

278
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,858
A little ah.

279
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:24,396
(♪〜)

280
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:27,231
it's okay

281
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:27,231
Speaking of Anna's escort.

282
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:30,792
Hey?

283
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:30,792
Ah, just a moment….

284
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:35,429
It's Mr. Hayashi!

285
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:35,429
Huh… Huh?

286
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,396
He's Anna's homeroom teacher.

287
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,231
Huh? Hey, ah, hey!

288
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,231

289
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:42,528
(Hayashi) Ah, Mr. Owari!

290
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:45,792
Ah, ah, ah, Anna's uncle!

291
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:48,429
Um, this child's father is busy.

292
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:48,429
I took care of it for you➡

293
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:50,396
The sun is shining brightly today.

294
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:50,396
Blessed with sunny weather ➡

295
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:52,264
It's sunny today...

296
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:52,264
Ah, ah, uh….

297
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:54,495
in the locker

298
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:54,495
I left my drill behind.

299
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,660
I came to get it.

300
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,660
Oh, was that so?

301
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,858
yes. Excuse me.

302
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,858
Ah, please.

303
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:00,660
Excuse me.

304
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:00,660
What are you talking about? Hakkun.

305
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,330
Huh?

306
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:10,462
(♪〜)

307
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:14,396
I came here once to clean.

308
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:14,396
Hey.

309
00:12:14,396 --> 00:12:16,627
Here, here, quickly, quickly.

310
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:25,693
Well, in 1996

311
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:25,693

312
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:28,132

313
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:28,132
Whoa.

314
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:30,231
Good.

315
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:30,231
Okay.

316
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,198
Well, I'm not in Group 1...

317
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:40,066
2 groups….

318
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:42,198
３…。

319
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,000
Is that what I thought?

320
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:53,495
(Tomoki) Anna?

321
00:12:54,627 --> 00:12:59,198
[Sound of footsteps running towards you]

322
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:03,759
Anna: When are you coming to school?

323
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,594
It's boring.

324
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:07,594
(Anna) Let's go.

325
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:10,066
Mom will be discharged from the hospital soon.

326
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:12,396
I see.

327
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:14,924
Come quickly.

328
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:17,429
Let's go to the secret base again.

329
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:21,363
Yeah.

330
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:23,330
Well then.

331
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:30,891
(First) What is a secret base?

332
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:36,165
secret!

333
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:38,033
Could that child be Tomoki-kun?

334
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:38,033
It doesn't matter!

335
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:39,858
It doesn't matter

336
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:39,858
That's not an answer, though?

337
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:41,495
Hakkun It's so noisy!

338
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:41,495

(Umi) Hmm, I guess it's okay...

342
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:48,924

yeah? yeah? yeah? yeah?

344
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:50,891

yeah? a! a! a! cormorant! a! a!

346
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:53,693

00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:56,363
a~~~!

348
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:56,363
What do you think?

349
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:06,264
Ryoko-san, thank you for waiting.

350
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:10,330
(Ryoko) You...

351
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,924
Huh...why?

352
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,330
[Sound of door opening]

353
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:40,891
Satoshi Tokoro.

354
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:44,627
You are Ryoko

355
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:44,627
Breaking up with Enomoto-san➡

356
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:47,297
I want to continue as a couple like before.

357
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:50,363
Yes, to Mr. Iseya, the detective.

358
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:50,363
You were consulted.

359
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:54,891
(Tokoro) Eh...

360
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:54,891
However, Ryoko-san➡

361
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:59,594
Breaking up with Enomoto-san

362
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:59,594
I say it can't be done.

363
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:03,231
And I want to divorce you➡

364
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:06,099
He came to consult me.

365
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:09,825
Why can't I break up with Enomoto-san?

366
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,495
That is➡

367
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:15,594
two people are each other

368
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:15,594
Because it's my first love.

369
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:17,693
(Tokoro) is...first love?

370
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,693
The two of us are➡

371
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:23,891
We met when we were in elementary school➡

372
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:27,660
We started dating in middle school.

373
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,462
But➡

374
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:34,429
Originally, I decided to take over the family business.

375
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:34,429
Mr. Enomoto was ➡

376
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:38,462
With the person chosen by your parents

377
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:38,462
Getting married➡

378
00:15:38,462 --> 00:15:43,528
Forcibly in my early twenties

379
00:15:38,462 --> 00:15:43,528
I was forced to break up with Ryoko.

380
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:48,033
My feelings for Ryoko didn't go away

381
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:48,033
Mr. Enomoto➡

382
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:50,957
with marriage partner

383
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:50,957
Things aren't going well➡

384
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:55,297
Last year, I paid a large amount of compensation.

385
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:55,297
I'm getting divorced.

386
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:59,693
Ryoko also last year

387
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:59,693
Coincidentally, I met Enomoto-san again➡

388
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,561
The feelings I was holding back

389
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,561
It has flared up again.

390
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:10,330
(To) That kind of thing...

391
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:10,330
It's like I didn't know.

392
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,363
(Ryoko) I'm sorry.

393
00:16:13,825 --> 00:16:18,264
(To) I could understand the bond between the two.

394
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:20,825
But... Ryoko.

395
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:24,528
That's what I want to divorce.

396
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:24,528
Is that the real reason?

397
00:16:24,528 --> 00:16:41,528
(♪〜)

398
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:43,363
(♪〜)

399
00:16:43,363 --> 00:16:47,561
(♪〜)

400
00:16:43,363 --> 00:16:47,561
(Ryoko) I...

401
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:49,891
(♪〜)

402
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:49,891
A child...

403
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:52,033
(♪〜)

404
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:54,000
(♪〜)

405
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:54,000
I wanted it.

406
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,330
(♪〜)

407
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,165
(♪〜)

408
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,165
Children of loved ones➡

409
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:01,528
(♪〜)

410
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:01,528
I wanted to raise it.

411
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:12,429
(♪〜)

412
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:21,000
(Tokoro) Sigh….

413
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,726
(To) Understood. I'll leave you.

414
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:33,660
Please wait.

415
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,264
You are➡

416
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:39,957
I hurt my husband, Mr. Tokoro.

417
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:42,561
Are you aware of that?

418
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:46,264
(Ryoko) Yes.

419
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:48,858
Persist through pure love➡

420
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:51,924
Like a beautiful story

421
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:51,924
Although it may be talked about➡

422
00:17:51,924 --> 00:17:54,495
I don't think so.

423
00:17:54,495 --> 00:17:56,792
For your own happiness➡

424
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,693
To the person who cherishes you➡

425
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:02,462
I caused a deep wound.

426
00:18:02,462 --> 00:18:06,033
There's nothing more

427
00:18:02,462 --> 00:18:06,033
He did something cruel.

428
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:10,462
(Enomoto) I am also guilty of that.

429
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,363
As you said, it's the same crime.

430
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:17,693
If you want to stick to pure love➡

431
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:21,132
Please indicate the price.

432
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:23,759
(Enomoto) That is

433
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:23,759
Do you mean consolation prize?

434
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,099
(Tokoro) I don't care about money...

435
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,099
I understand how you feel.

436
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:30,924
Thoughts for my beloved Ryoko➡

437
00:18:30,924 --> 00:18:35,759
weighing money, etc.

438
00:18:30,924 --> 00:18:35,759
I can't do it.

439
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,264
Still, I have a suggestion.

440
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:42,957
Ryoko-san.

441
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:46,924
You and Tokoro-san➡

442
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:49,561
I'm sure you've never felt unhappy.

443
00:18:49,561 --> 00:19:02,792
(♪〜)

444
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:05,231
(Ryoko) Yes.

445
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:08,957
I have to meet Enomoto-san again➡

446
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:12,726
With the intention of getting along with Tokoro-san

447
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:12,726
Isn't it there?

448
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:17,396
(Ryoko) That may be true.

449
00:19:17,396 --> 00:19:22,495
Still, with Enomoto-san

450
00:19:17,396 --> 00:19:22,495
If you want to be together➡

451
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,198
To Tokoro-san➡

452
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:29,726
Thank you for your love and gratitude➡

453
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:31,693
Give it shape.

454
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:39,165
(Ryoko) I understand.

455
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:47,132
(♪〜)

456
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,990
(Sea) What happened after that?

457
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,066
(First) Mr. Enomoto

458
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,066
by paying a hefty compensation.

459
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:04,792
Ryoko and her son

460
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:04,792
I'm living.

461
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,627
I went to see how Tokoro-san was doing.

462
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,627
I was working sweaty.

463
00:20:06,627 --> 00:20:08,528
Even if I get a lot of money, I'll stay the same

464
00:20:06,627 --> 00:20:08,528
It's amazing to be here.

465
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:10,759
Ryoko and her son

466
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:10,759
It seems like things are going well.

467
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,825
When the three of us are walking hand in hand

468
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,825
Wow! It looked like fun.

469
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:18,528
Okay.

470
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:21,462
Huh? what up?

471
00:20:21,462 --> 00:20:25,165
I hope everyone can be happy this time

472
00:20:21,462 --> 00:20:25,165
I didn't think so➡

473
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:27,825
If you actually see it with your own eyes.

474
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,561
Yeah.

475
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,198
Mr. Tokoro

476
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,198
I hope you can spend your time peacefully.

477
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,165
Right.

478
00:20:37,297 --> 00:20:38,990
(Anna) What's the "dane"?

479
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,165
Hey, let's get into the adult talk.

480
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,165
Anna has nothing to do with it.

481
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:46,891
It's related! I was able to find a graduate school.

482
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:46,891
Who do you think you owe it to?

483
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:49,429
Ah, certainly!

484
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:49,429
No, there is no other way to check that.

485
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:51,330
There are other things too...

486
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:51,330
What method?

487
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,693
Well, I wonder what kind of method...

488
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,693
Hey hey hey….

489
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:56,990
Sure, hey, what method?

490
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:56,990
Anna You're using the wrong garbage, Anna.

491
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,660
What method?

492
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,660
a little bit.

493
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,099
(Lawyer 1) To Mr. Hatsu Otokita

494
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,099
By the way➡

495
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:03,924
(♪〜)

496
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:03,924
This is the fourth time he has received a disciplinary charge.

497
00:21:03,924 --> 00:21:07,099
(♪〜)

498
00:21:03,924 --> 00:21:07,099
Have you received a reprimand in the past?

499
00:21:03,924 --> 00:21:07,099
There are 3 times.

500
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,891
(♪〜)

501
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,891
Considering this previous history➡

502
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:13,264
(♪〜)

503
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:13,264
I believe that business suspension is inevitable.

504
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:13,264
Isn't it hard?

505
00:21:13,264 --> 00:21:15,066
(♪〜)

506
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,924

(♪〜)

517
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:30,165
Celebrating 10 years since we started dating...

518
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:30,165
(Yuki) Sorry.

519
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,990
(♪〜)

520
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,990
(Airi) Huh?

(♪〜)

522
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,330
(Yuki) I submitted a marriage registration.

523
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,132
(♪〜)

524
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,132
(Airi) Huh?

527
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,726

529
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:45,330
