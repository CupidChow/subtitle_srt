(Nishiuchi) Who is it? you.

375
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,330
My name is Hatsu Otokita, a lawyer.

376
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,726
(Aono) First time! What are you doing?

377
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,033

381
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:48,429
Many times in divorce cases

382
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:48,429
Have you won a large compensation?

383
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:50,561
This time from Mao Oikawa➡

384
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:54,462
Her husband Masahiro Nishiuchi's unfaithfulness

385
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:54,462
Because I was suspected➡

386
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:57,495
I received a request for divorce negotiations.

387
00:16:57,495 --> 00:16:59,957
Evidence of adultery

388
00:16:57,495 --> 00:16:59,957

389
00:16:59,957 --> 00:17:02,660
Please check with everyone

390
00:16:59,957 --> 00:17:02,660
It will be what you received.

391
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,363
(Nishiuchi) What are you saying?

392
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,363
That's not all.

393

Mr. Nishiuchi against Mr. Mao➡

394
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:11,660
There were times when he was violent.

395
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:11,660
(Reporters) Huh?

396
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,264
I suffered a distal radius fracture in July last year.

397
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:16,627
That means a broken wrist.

398
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:16,627
Due to several bruises on the whole body➡

399
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:18,891
I was diagnosed with a full recovery in one month.

400
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:21,561
This made me suspect infidelity

401
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:21,561
To Mao-san➡

402
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:25,033
The furious Nishiuchi committed violence.

403
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:25,033
This is due to shaking ➡

404
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:26,825
It deserves a charge of injury.

405
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:31,000
(Nishiuchi) Injury? What is that?

406
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't know!

407
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,891
(Nishiuchi) Hey Mao

408
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,891
What happened to you?

409
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:38,297
(Mao) Don't touch me!

410
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:42,957
(Nishiuchi) Saya From you too

411
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:42,957
Please explain to everyone.

412
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:45,000
I didn't invite you.

413
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,099
from you

414
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,099
He said he was trying to tempt me.

415
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,462
Mr. Nishiuchi, it's you➡

416
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:53,363
What you said now amounts to defamation.

417
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:53,363
(Nishiuchi) What!

418
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,693
you are that woman

419
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,693
As if it were an act of infidelity➡

420
00:17:55,693 --> 00:17:58,099
As if you were my opponent

421
00:17:55,693 --> 00:17:58,099
You said it that way.

422
00:17:58,099 --> 00:17:59,792
(Mao) That's what you said earlier.

423
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,264
some time ago? What do you mean?

424
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:05,495
To everyone earlier

425
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:05,495
What I have confirmed is ➡

426
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,264
All of them involve the person who committed adultery➡

427
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:09,066
What specifies

428
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:09,066
There shouldn't have been.

429

(Nishiuchi) That's why

430
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:10,726
I know!

431
00:18:10,726 --> 00:18:13,066
Because you are a party!

432
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:25,429
That means

433
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:25,429
You admit to cheating.

434
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:30,891

We have received a report of illegal activity.

The audio and video that was played earlier

440
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:41,957
This is proof of that.

441
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:45,132
For me, as evidence

442
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:45,132
I decided that it was sufficient.

443
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:48,792
Therefore, many years of mental pain
