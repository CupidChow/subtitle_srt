1
00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:06,693
(Voice of the sea) First time!

2
00:00:06,693 --> 00:00:10,891
first time! Wake up!

3
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:14,759
Hey, first time!

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,891
Wake up!

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,231
first time? Huh?

6
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:21,066
Ah, first time.

7
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,297
(First time) It's dazzling. It's dazzling.

8
00:00:27,297 --> 00:00:29,858
Yes, good morning.

9
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:31,924
Yes, wake up~ Good morning.

10
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:34,462
Yes, wake up, yes! yes!

11
00:00:34,462 --> 00:00:36,396
Yeah.

12
00:00:34,462 --> 00:00:36,396
Okay, wake up!

13
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:38,198
What?

14
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:38,198
Yeah….

15
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:39,957
Yes, wake up!

16
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,165
(2 people) Wow!

17
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,165
Hahaha… [lol]

18
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:46,462
a little bit

19
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:46,462
Isn't your sleeping habit really bad today?

20
00:00:46,462 --> 00:00:48,132
yeah~.

21
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:50,957
Ah! Hey, new toothbrush

22
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:50,957
I should have put it out!

23
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,693
Change it once a month

24
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,693
You're saying that, right?

25
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:55,891
How many months have you been using it?

26
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:55,891
It's okay, you can still use it.

27
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:59,198
No, it's perfect!

28
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:59,198
Look, it's dripping from your mouth.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,726
We have a consultation this morning, right?

30
00:01:03,726 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't be late.

31
00:01:03,726 --> 00:01:06,000
yeah.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,396
Also, look the client in the eye and talk to them.

33
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:11,165
Don't let your shyness be revealed.

34
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:13,396
Hmm, that's impossible.

35
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:13,396
Hehehe [lol]

36
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:16,759
Yes, Otokita's first teacher.

37
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:16,759
It's almost done.

38
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,099
So don't call me teacher.

39
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,099
Welcome, teacher.

40
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,165
yes.

41
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,165
yes.

42
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:28,198
(Nishiuchi) I apologize for the personal matter➡

43
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:30,231
Me and my wife Mao Oikawa➡

44
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:32,825
Best partner again this year

45
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:32,825
You chose it.

46
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:35,429
(Saya) Nishiuchi-san

47
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:35,429
congratulations!

48
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,462
[applause]

49
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:40,363
(Nishiuchi) No, no, I can tell it myself.

50
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:40,363
It's embarrassing.

51
00:01:40,363 --> 00:01:42,561
(Saya) Nishiuchi-san

52
00:01:40,363 --> 00:01:42,561
What are some tips for a happy marriage?

53
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,165
Please let me know.

54
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,165
(Nishiuchi) What are some tips?

55
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:45,462
Please let me know.

56
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:45,462
(Nishiuchi) What are some tips?

57
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:47,726
It's all thanks to my wife.

58
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:51,099
Even if there's nothing special

59
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:51,099
When I woke up in the morning, my wife was next to me.

60
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:53,099
(Aono) Of course, with Mao-chan.

61
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:53,099
Because we were able to get married➡

62
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:55,198
You must be happy.

63
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,198
Wow!

64
00:01:57,198 --> 00:01:58,858
I was surprised!

65
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:04,099
Mr. Hatsu, if you come to work

66
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:04,099
Please say "Good morning!"

67
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:06,066
yes.

68
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:09,759
Sigh...since the morning

69
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:09,759
I have a new consultation scheduled.

70
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,858
Please don't overdo it this time.

71
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:13,660
Next If you receive a reprimand➡

72
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,297
Business suspension

73
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,297
It might happen!

74
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:17,957
[Sound of knocking on door]

75
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:19,792
yes.

76
00:02:23,363 --> 00:02:25,264
(Aono) Eh.

77
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:27,429
Mao-chan?

78
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:36,429
(♪〜)

79
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:38,792
(Aono) Essay

80
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:38,792
I read it every month!

81
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,792
It was introduced last month

82
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,792
This yoga pose➡

83
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:46,099
I also do it for a change of pace.

84
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,297
Phew.

85
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,297
(Mao) Thank you.

86
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:51,264
(Aono) Huh...

87
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:55,891
(Aono) [cough cough]

88
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:55,891
Eh...the content of your consultation is ➡

89
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,693
about divorce

90
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,693
Is that okay?

91
00:02:57,693 --> 00:03:00,429
(Mao) Yes, Mr. Otokita➡

92
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:04,825
By winning a large compensation

93
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:04,825
I heard that you are famous.

94
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:10,330
(Aono) No ``teacher''.

95
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:10,330
(Mao) Huh? Ah... yes.

96
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,528
1 week later

97
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,528
Best Partner Award Winner➡

98
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:15,495
An interview is scheduled.

99
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:19,825
Until then, evidence of adultery

100
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:19,825
I want to confront him and get a divorce.

101
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:23,132
(Aono) Maybe next week. (Mao) Yes.

102
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:26,561
There's also the matter of children.

103
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:26,561
I was confused.

104
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:30,099
My cheating partner is on SNS

105
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:30,099
Look at the various things posted➡

106
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,165
I've finally reached the crossing point.

107
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,000
(Aono) Ah, my Otokita.

108
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,000
This is normal operation➡

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,693
Don't worry.

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,693
(Mao) Ah... yes.

111
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,132
Mr. Nishiuchi

112
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,132
Who is committing adultery➡

113
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:50,198
Are you sure?

114
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:52,759
(Mao) Yes.

115
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:55,165
Well….

116
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:57,561
This.

117
00:03:57,561 --> 00:04:00,693
Saya Mashima from my office

118
00:03:57,561 --> 00:04:00,693
It's SNS.

119
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:04,330
I was an assistant on Nishiuchi's program.

120
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:04,330
I'm appearing.

121
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:04,462
I was an assistant on Nishiuchi's program.

122
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:04,462
I'm appearing.

123
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,330
This hand is Nishiuchi.

124
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,792
(Aono) Huh?

125
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,792
How did you know?

126
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:12,066
(Mao) I have two moles.

127
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:12,066
There is no doubt that it is Nishiuchi.

128
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,792
(Mao) Oh, and...

129
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,528
This too.

130
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:21,759
in our home apartment

131
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:21,759
This is a photo taken.

132
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,495
On this day➡

133
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:26,429
My son and I were away on a trip.

134
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:28,792
(Aono) This too

135
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:28,792
How did you know?

136
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:32,330
(Mao) It's my home wallpaper.

137
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:32,330
(Aono) Huh?

138
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,891
With Mao-san

139
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,891
When your child is away ➡

140
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:38,000
At home with the person you were cheating on with?

141
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,264
(Mao) Probably.

142
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,264
(Aono) It's disgusting!

143
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:43,429
(Mao) This is not proof of infidelity.

144
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:43,429
Would you like to?

145
00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:45,891
(Aono) That's right...

146
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:48,924
As long as you have audio and video.

147
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:50,594
(Mao) Ah...

148
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:53,000
Nishiuchi is very cautious.

149
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,528
There was also an attempt to install a wiretapping device.

150
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,528
There was one➡

151
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,561
Things didn't go well...

152
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:01,528
When you doubt

153
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:01,528
People seem to have changed...

154
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:04,627
That is➡

155
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:07,330
Does it mean violence?

156
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,594
(Mao) Ah...no.

157
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:14,198
[Sound of tapping on desk]

158
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:17,000
(Aono) Even when there is no evidence

159
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:17,000
My Otokita is➡

160
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,891
Team up with an amazing detective➡

161
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:23,264
Don't worry, we'll collect the evidence!

162
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:27,000
(Mao) Well then, please accept it.

163
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:27,000
Can I have it?

164
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:33,693
Take the worst revenge on the person you betrayed.

165
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:35,594
And for you...

166
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:39,132
The highest reward.

167
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,858
Who is my current cheating partner, Saya Mashima?

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,858
Our relationship started last year➡

169
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,660
When giving birth for the second time

170
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,660
Don't come to the hospital➡

171
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,396
He had a secret meeting with Saya at the hotel.

172
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:03,759
Mao-san

173
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:03,759
I think I found it a while later.

174
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:08,429
A clean and innocent image

175
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:08,429
Even though I’m a caster➡

176
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:11,198
I mean, he was the scum of scum.

177
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,891
Yeah?

178
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:21,792
I'm having an affair

179
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:21,792
If you look at it after knowing➡

180
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,165
Everything seems like a lie.

181
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:36,495
(♪〜)

182
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:40,627
Yes, end your smartphone. Eat.

183
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:42,363
yeah.

184
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:50,264
Huh? Did you hate okonomiyaki?

185
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:55,462
People with high likability usually do something

186
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:55,462
There's a flip side.

187
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:59,066
Ou.

188
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:59,066
For example ➡

189
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:02,825
At first glance, it looks like it's burnt a nice color.

190
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:02,825

00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:11,264
I'm going out.

380
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:11,264
(Aono) Hey, hey, hey.

381
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:13,825
Hey... oh!

382
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:13,825
[Sound of door opening]

383
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:17,627
Medical certificate must be prepared before

384
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:17,627
It takes time ➡

385
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:19,330
I'll ask you to do something about it.

386
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,198
Just of course

387
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,198
The sooner the procedure is done, the better.

388
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:23,198
(Mao) Ah... that

389
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:23,198
As I said earlier➡

390
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:24,891
I'm about to give up...

391
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,660
Giving up is ➡

392
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,396
You are from Mr. Nishiuchi.

393
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,396
Because you're afraid of violence, right?

394
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:38,726
when you come to request

395
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:38,726
There was something I was about to say.

396
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:43,891
Nishiuchi is very cautious.

397
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:46,594
There was also an attempt to install a wiretapping device.

398
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:46,594
There was one➡

399
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:48,792
Things didn't go well...

400
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:52,132
When you doubt

401
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:52,132
People seem to have changed...

402
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:56,023
Did you experience violence at that time?

403
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:56,023
I heard it➡

404
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:58,066
you denied it.

405
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:04,099
That's what

406
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:04,099
It stuck with me for a long time.

407
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:07,099
And look at your SNS

408
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:07,099
I noticed.

409
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:13,132
I was subjected to violence by Mr. Nishiuchi.

410
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:13,132
Not speculation, but facts.

411
00:16:13,132 --> 00:16:15,891
It happened last summer.

412
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:22,726
violence from a spouse

413
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:22,726
It's difficult to make it public.

414
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:25,726
Just➡

415
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:30,297
atrocity crimes

416
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:30,297
Or if a crime of injury can be applied➡

417
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:33,462
a higher compensation

418
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:33,462
You can make a claim.

419
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:36,561
why are you

420
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:36,561
Were you unable to get a divorce?

421
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:40,165
Why is there still confusion?

422
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,165
It's about hurting your child.

423
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,165
It's because you're afraid.

424
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:47,594
Mr. Nishiuchi is a well-known person in the world.

425
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:50,198
Dirty topics become great material

426
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:52,990
commit adultery

427
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:52,990
He also raised his hand to his wife➡

428
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,957
It will be interestingly written.

429
00:16:55,957 --> 00:17:00,858
I love such slander

430
00:16:55,957 --> 00:17:00,858
I wonder if my child will take it?

431
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:03,099
I can understand such concerns.

432
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:05,726
But for your child

433
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:05,726
An existence that will absolutely protect you➡

434
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:07,429
You are here.

435
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:12,165
In the same way➡

436
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,990
You have me.

437
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,330
I will protect you.

438
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:22,990
more than this

439
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:22,990
You won't suffer.

440
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,297
If you want to become stronger➡

441
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:29,462
I'll have your back.

442
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:33,297
Just like your child➡

443
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:35,924

444
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:35,924
Please cherish it.

445
00:17:40,462 --> 00:17:42,957
Understood.

446
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:44,957
Let's go.

447
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:47,363
that!

448
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:52,297
thank you.

449
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:54,363
It's very reassuring.

450
00:17:54,363 --> 00:17:56,429
Ah...no...

451
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:06,693
(Sea) If it is difficult to approach Nishiuchi.

[Sound of knocking on door]

453
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:12,066
Excuse me.

454
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:12,066
(Saya) Yes.

455
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:14,957
Yaho~ How does it feel?

456
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:14,957
(Saya) I guess it's the same as usual.

457
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:16,627
Oh, is that so?

458
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:16,627
(Saya) Yeah.

459
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:18,924
How are you going today?

460
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:18,924
(Saya) I want to use this.

461
00:18:18,924 --> 00:18:21,363
Yeah. Ah, this!

00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:32,759
(Sea) Yes~ What do you think?

463
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:32,759
(Saya) It feels so good!

464
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:41,891
Maybe tonight

465
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:41,891
Because you might be invited➡

466
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:43,627
I'm glad you cleaned it up.

467
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:43,627
thank you.

468
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:45,330
Hey, nice date?

469
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,429
I mean, it's just the two of us on a date.

470
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,429
It's just that I get to meet you.

471
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:50,990
Oops?

472
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:50,990
Maybe there's a reason?

473
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,726
Hmm… [lol]

474
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:54,858
I'll listen to anything you want.

475

Yes, but it's okay.

In the meantime

478

He's the only one looking at me.

479
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:03,594
He's kind.

480
00:19:03,594 --> 00:19:05,561
I see.

481
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,528
Well then➡

482
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:10,924
So that you can see my eyes even in the dark

483
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:10,924
Should I add glitter or something?

484
00:19:10,924 --> 00:19:13,561
Is it okay?

485
00:19:10,924 --> 00:19:13,561
Fine, leave it to me!

486
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:23,099
Is this a talisman?

487

That's a huge number.

Anno?

493
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:35,363

They have the same role as straw dolls.

501

What, are the straw dolls that cursed?

502

Huh?

505
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:04,330
Is there anyone you want to curse?

506
