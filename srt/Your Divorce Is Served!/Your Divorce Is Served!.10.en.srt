00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:52,825
In such cases, as a lawyer➡

191
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:55,726
What judgment does the teacher make?

192
00:07:57,132 --> 00:07:58,957
(Owari) Child Guidance Center, etc.➡

193
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:02,165
It's in the right place

194
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:02,165
I think it will be a matter of consultation➡

195
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:05,363
Basically, parental authority

196
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:05,363
Because my father has it➡

197
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:07,396
First, the father and the counselor➡

198
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:09,693
A place to talk

199
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:09,693
It will be set up.

200
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:14,330
If that discussion

201
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:14,330
What do you do if it gets tangled?

202
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,231
(Owari) The counselor is a designated guardian.

203
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,231
Even if you try to file a complaint➡

204
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,000
That won't pass.

205
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,462
If a guardian cannot be designated

206
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,462
Other methods.

207
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,561
(Owari) Other methods include

208
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,561
Loss of parental rights.

209
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:31,759
Or file a petition for termination of parental rights.

210
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:31,759
I think I will.

211
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,759
but

212
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,759
Unless it's the worst case of abuse➡

213
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,759
The possibility of being recognized

214
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,759
It will be extremely low.

215
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,066
This is the current standard.

216
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:48,792
(Mao) Still, please continue your questions.

217
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:48,792
Do you have it?

218
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:51,165
Please stay until you are satisfied.

219
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:53,396
(Owari)

220
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:53,396
It was quite a long scene ➡

221
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:55,693
Everyone at the venue must be tired.

222
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:59,033
I won't take up your time

223
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:59,033
Just one last thing.

224
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,396
(Mao) Please.

225
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:04,792
I would like to give you my opinion as a lawyer now.

226
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:04,792
Thank you for talking➡

227
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,000
Well then➡

228
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,297
The most important thing as a father is

229
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,297
What do you think?

230
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:16,891
[Cough cough]

231
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:20,231
(Owari) That's...➡

232
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:25,924
Parents should think about their children's happiness.

233
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:25,924
Probably the best.

234
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:28,165
thank you very much.

235
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:39,231
(♪〜)

236
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:42,429
Mr. Owari.

237
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:47,891
The business suspension period will end next month.

238
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:47,891
I will return to work.

239
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:53,132
At that timing

240
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:53,132
Request from Kaede Owari.

241
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:56,000
About Anna's future

242
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:56,000
We will contact you.

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,957
What are you talking about? That kind of thing...

244
00:09:57,957 --> 00:10:03,561
Still, to the client

245
00:09:57,957 --> 00:10:03,561
So that you can understand➡

246
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,891
For Anna's future➡

247
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:08,462
I want to talk to you.

248
00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:12,066
That is the client

249
00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:12,066
Because that's what I wanted.

250
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:17,825
(♪〜)

251
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,693
(♪〜)

252
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,693
[sound of taxi door closing]

253
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:31,858
(♪〜)

254
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:35,891
Hmm, I'm getting nervous.

255
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:39,297
Anzu-chan, what I was thinking

256
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:39,297
I wish I could say that.

257
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:41,396
Ah.

258
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:43,363
Are you nervous for the first time?

259
00:10:43,363 --> 00:10:46,660
No, that's not it.

260
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,693
I'm sorry for getting you involved.

261
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,693
Yeah?

262
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:53,825
Anna is ours

263
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:53,825
If you decide to grow it➡

264
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:56,132
life at sea

265
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:56,132
I might change it.

266
00:10:56,132 --> 00:11:00,891
So was this good?

267
00:10:56,132 --> 00:11:00,891
I have some doubts.

268
00:11:00,891 --> 00:11:03,363
what? that.

269
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:09,000
I am a family with Hatsu and An-chan.

270
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:09,000
Because that's what I want to be.

271
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,594
That hesitation is a hindrance.

272
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:16,924
Yes, and this too.

273
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:29,099
Okay, let's go.

274
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:46,099
(♪〜)

275
00:11:46,099 --> 00:12:03,099
(♪〜)

276
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:10,000
(♪〜)

277
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,396
(♪〜)

278
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,396
(Aono) Shhh!

279
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:20,000
(♪〜)

280
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,033
(First time) Client Kaede Owari is➡

281
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:29,066
He is no longer in this world.

282
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:34,528
But when I was alive I

283
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:34,528
I was asked to represent my divorce.

284
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:41,825
This is➡

285
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:45,165
In case something happens to my sister➡

286
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,693
It was entrusted to me.

287
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:51,594
You will raise Anna

288
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:51,594
Notes that make you feel anxious➡

289
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:53,891
Not suitable as a guardian

290
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:53,891
Photo evidence➡

291
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:56,660
Many were saved.

292
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:02,429
Anna-san

293
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:02,429
Pushed away by you➡

294
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:05,891
This is a photo of the injury.

295
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:08,330
There is also a medical certificate.

296
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:14,891
you say it's discipline

297
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:14,891
Sometimes he even raised his hand.

298
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:19,924
When you do poorly on a test

299
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:19,924
As a punishment➡

300
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:24,363
Anna is taking a bath

301
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:24,363
It seems that they even drained the water.

302
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:26,792
That too in the middle of winter.

303
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:31,594
The record is with the date➡

304
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:34,231
It was left in the cloud.

305
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:39,528
(Owari)

306
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:39,528
What's wrong with parents disciplining their children?

307
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,297
Me too...

308
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,297
You too➡

309
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:46,264
My parents have always treated me like that.

310
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:51,198
And according to my parents' wishes

311
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:51,198
I became a lawyer.

312
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,264
But such a path➡

313
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,858
Anna wants it too

314
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,858
Do you think so?

315
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,693
No matter how much evidence we collect,

316
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:05,363
Make decisions in accordance with the law➡

317
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:07,891
What doesn't affect

318
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:07,891
I understand.

319
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:15,000
But I departed, leaving my beloved daughter behind.

320
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:15,000
Much to my sister's chagrin➡

321
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
somehow

322
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I want to clear up my mind.

323
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,660
[Knocking sound]

324
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:33,594
(Owari) Anna.

325
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:41,528
Owari-san, today is Anna-san's.

326
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:41,528
It's my 10th birthday.

327
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:46,000
In the family court

328
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:46,000
Approximately over 10 years old➡

329
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,924
Children's wishes are respected

330
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,924
Of course you know that.

331
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:56,066
Before confirming Anna's intentions➡

332
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:59,099
There's something I want you to hear

333
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,132
Radio) (Kaede's voice) Anna.

334
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:09,924
(Anna) Mom.

335
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:13,099
Radio) (Kaede's voice)

336
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:13,099
We promise to be together forever➡

337
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:16,264
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

338
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:18,033
Radio) From Anna's friends➡

339
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:22,594
a little earlier

340
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:22,594
I have to say goodbye.

341
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:27,528
(Kaede) I'm also very disappointed in your mother.

342
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:32,429
Radio) (Kaede's voice) Anna is really

343
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:32,429
I'm proud of my daughter.

344
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:36,396
radio) From my mother

345
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:36,396
There are some places that are solid.

346
00:15:36,396 --> 00:15:42,363
Radio) It's reliable.

347
00:15:36,396 --> 00:15:42,363
I've always thought that.

348
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:48,627
Radio) Anna I thought I wanted to do it.

349
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:48,627
It's okay to make a choice.

350
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:51,825
radio) but you are still

351
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:51,825
Because they are children➡

352
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:56,000
If you have any trouble

353
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:56,000
Rely on the first.

354
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,231
Radio) Umi-kun also talks about Anna.

355
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,231
Because he loved me➡

356
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:03,726
I think it's okay to indulge without hesitation.

357
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:06,594

358
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:09,363
Hatsu and Umi-kun➡

359
00:16:09,363 --> 00:16:13,000
Because I'm on Anna's side

360
00:16:09,363 --> 00:16:13,000
Don't worry.

361
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:18,429

362
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:24,231
Radio) (Kaede's voice) Thank you for being born.

363
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:24,231
thank you.

364
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:32,957
Radio) (Kaede's voice) I want to meet you.

365
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:32,957
Mom was really happy.

Radio) (Kaede's voice)

367
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,099
Anna becomes a grandmother➡

368
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:41,495
After fulfilling your life➡

369
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:44,957
I hope to see you again

370
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:44,957
looking forward to it.

371
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:50,594
(Kaede) Until then, forever

372
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:50,594
Because I'm watching over you.

373
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:58,198
(Kaede) From now on, I will continue to do so.

374
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:58,198
That I love Anna➡

375
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:00,726
Don't forget.

00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:15,660
Mr. Owari.

378
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,693
You are at a lecture➡

379
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:20,363
As a father, my child's happiness

380
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:20,363
Things to think about➡

381
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:23,066
You said it was the most important thing.

382
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:26,825
You too really

383
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:26,825
You've noticed, haven't you?

384
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:30,726
To Anna, what kind of life do you want?

385
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:35,759
choose for yourself

386
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:35,759
I should tell them what I can do.

387
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:41,132
That's for Anna

388
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:41,132
That I'm happy.

389
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
(Owari) My method is➡

390
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,825
Does that mean he was tormenting the two of them?

391
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:06,924
(Owari) Still, the way I was raised

392
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:06,924
I don't think it's wrong.

393
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:10,165
for my daughter's education

394
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:10,165
Strictness is necessary.

395
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:13,528
That stance is

396
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:13,528
I can't change it.

397
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:16,198
You already know, right?

398
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:22,033
Mr. Owari.

399
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:25,429
If you can't change.

400
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:36,825
(Owari) Anna.

401
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:42,561
you are so much

402
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:42,561
Do you hate living with your father?

403
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:50,792
I don't like it...➡

404
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:54,825
That's not it though.

405
00:18:54,825 --> 00:19:00,066
But I wonder if I'm doing something wrong.

406
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:06,231
My heart was always pounding.

407
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:21,000
sorry.

408
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,429
sorry.

409
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,627
(Owari) Why are you apologizing?

410
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:30,858
sorry.

411
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:36,528
(Owari) Who does Anna want to live with?

412
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:41,924
(Owari) Don't apologize anymore.

413
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:45,891
Because I'm not angry.

414
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:49,066
Please tell me your honest feelings.

415
00:19:49,066 --> 00:20:06,066

416
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:11,363

I want to live with Hakkun and Umi-kun.

That's how I wake up every morning

423
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,198
Could you please stop?

424
00:20:53,198 --> 00:20:55,726

It's still early for a date.
