This constitutes adultery.

Even though I'm a lawyer, it's because of the rules.

Why is it the first time?

00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:49,363
Ah, this is my part-time job.

192
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:49,363
I suddenly became unemployed➡

193
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:51,099
I brought her with me.

194
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:54,000
Let me get to work right away.

195
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:54,000
Excuse me.

196
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,462
Excuse me.

197
00:07:56,462 --> 00:07:59,726
Okay. Oh, hold the cardboard in your right hand.

198
00:07:56,462 --> 00:07:59,726
Yes, yes.

199
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:01,627
The roll is on the left...

200
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:01,627
Yes Yes Yes.

201
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:03,561
Where you can move easily.

202
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:03,561
yes.

203
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:11,396
As you know➡

204
00:08:11,396 --> 00:08:15,297
I am now

205
00:08:11,396 --> 00:08:15,297
I cannot act as a lawyer.

206
00:08:15,297 --> 00:08:17,264
From here on, I'm talking to myself.

207
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:22,561
I am➡

208
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:25,099
I am dissatisfied with the marriage system.

209
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,825
Article 24, Section 1 of the Constitution.

210
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:34,726
``Marriage is only about the consent of both sexes.''

211
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:34,726
Established based on ➡

212
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:38,957
that husband and wife have equal rights

213
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:38,957
As a basic ➡

214
00:08:38,957 --> 00:08:41,198
Through mutual cooperation➡

215
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:43,363
must be maintained.”

216
00:08:45,363 --> 00:08:51,231
Because it is written as ``bisexual.''

217
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,165
That's all I am.

218
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:58,099
Everyone here➡

219
00:08:58,099 --> 00:09:00,660
I've felt the same pain.

220
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,759
Because I understand the pain➡

221
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,297
I'm worried about you two.

222
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:11,231
As if it were my own.

223
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:18,924
Proceeding with settlement negotiations

224
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:18,924
I can't do it➡

225
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:21,000
Mr. Yuki.

226
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,891
Why➡

227
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:26,132
A long time of 10 years

228
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:26,132
To Airi, who I lived with➡

229
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,495
Did you get married in silence?

230
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:31,297
I want to know that.

231
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:36,858
To Airi

232
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:36,858
The fact that I couldn't talk about it➡

233
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:39,495
That's Airi

234
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:39,495
Because it will hurt you.

235
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:46,957
(♪〜)

236
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:53,132
(Yuki) Because I'm tired of fighting.

237
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:54,891
(Airi) Huh?

238
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,891
(Yuki) Airi and I➡

239
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,330
There is an eight year age difference.

240
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,033
That means 8 years.

241
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:08,396
I'm better

242
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:08,396
I've had a lot of experiences.

243
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:10,462
What does it mean➡

244
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:13,231
Both the lawyer and Umi-kun➡

245
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:15,858
Because we share the difficulty of living➡

246
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:17,858
You get it, right?

247
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:20,495
(Airi) But you said so!

248
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:20,495
If it's with me➡

249
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,099
Someday I'll be accepted for marriage

250
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,099
I can do my best until it comes!

251
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:27,297
(Yuki) Airi is young.

252
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:30,759
(Airi) Huh? What is that...

253
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,561
(Yuki) What do you think marriage is?

254
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:36,264
(Airi) That's...

255
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:41,000
(Airi) With someone you like

256
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's accomplish this together for the rest of our lives➡

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,792
Isn't that an oath?

258
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:48,396
(Yuki) I used to think so too.

259
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:52,594
That's why we live in a society that doesn't accept same-sex marriage.

260
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:52,594
I was angry➡

261
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:55,297
I have to change

262
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:55,297
I was thinking.

263
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,297
(Yuki)But➡

264
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:01,264
As the years go by➡

265
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:03,825
My way of thinking has changed.

266
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:05,825
(Airi) What do you mean?

267
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:09,429
(Yuki) To get married ➡

268
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:12,660
Love is

269
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:12,660
I guess it's not necessary➡

270
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
I started thinking.

271
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,660
(Airi) Hey

272
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,660
I don't understand it!

273
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:25,924
(Yuki) 20s 30s and ➡

274
00:11:25,924 --> 00:11:27,891
Amidst the hardships of life➡

275
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:29,825
Find friends too➡

276
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:33,396
Tomorrow I'm sure

277
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:33,396
Inspire me to be better than I am now.

278
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:36,396
I've relied on that for emotional support.

279
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:40,792
(Yuki) I understand.

280
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:43,858
I am➡

281
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:46,660
It's not that strong.

282
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:51,858
(Yuki) I'm different from Airi.

283
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:55,066
(Airi) That's it...

284
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:57,495
(Yuki) That feeling

285
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:57,495
Continuing forever➡

286
00:11:57,495 --> 00:12:01,330
the institution of marriage itself

287
00:11:57,495 --> 00:12:01,330
When it doesn't matter ➡

288
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,132
It happened about my grandmother.

289
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:08,330
What was important at that time was➡

290
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,528
your grandmother

291
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,528
It was to reassure me.

292
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:14,099
While drinking with childhood friends➡

293
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:18,231
Let's register the marriage and make her happy.

294
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:20,594
Even for joking suggestions➡

295
00:12:20,594 --> 00:12:23,198
I agreed without hesitation.

296
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:28,198
We still have romantic feelings for each other

297
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:28,198
Although it's zero.

298
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:33,297
That's why I feel comfortable

299
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:33,297
I think it might be good

300
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:37,396
(Airi) That's why

301
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:37,396
Even if you don't get married.

302
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:40,594
(Yuki) To fall in love

303
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:40,594
I'm tired.

304
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,264
With that in mind

305
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,264
My heart is not in turmoil➡

306
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:48,066
Have a safe married life

307
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:48,066
I started asking for it.

308
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,726
(Airi) It's me

309
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,726
Does that mean you don't feel safe?

310
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:52,792
Are you saying I can't go?

311
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:52,792
(Yuki) I didn't say that.

312
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,726
(Airi) I'm telling you!

313
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,099
(Airi) It's up to you.

314
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:02,462
That's too selfish!

315
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,627
(Airi) Hey.

316
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:24,099
(Airi) If

317
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:24,099
If same-sex marriage was recognized➡

318
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:26,528
were we doing well?

319
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:30,165
(Yuki) I don't know about that.

320
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,297
(Yuki)But➡

321
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:38,759
I wanted to marry Airi

322
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:38,759
It's true.

323
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,957
(♪〜)

324
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:45,693
(♪〜)

325
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:45,693
(Airi) It's like that until the end

326
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:45,693
They say horrible things.

327
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:48,429
(♪〜)

328
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,165
(♪〜)

329
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,165
(Yuki) I'm sorry.

330
00:13:50,165 --> 00:14:03,165
(♪〜)

331
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:07,066
(♪〜)

332
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:07,066
(Yuki) I will pay the full amount of compensation.

333
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:09,099
(♪〜)

334
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:09,099
For Owari lawyer➡

335
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:12,264
(♪〜)

336
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:12,264
If you accept the settlement

337
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:12,264
I'll tell you.

338
00:14:12,264 --> 00:14:29,924
(♪〜)

339
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:32,792
(♪〜)

340
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:32,792
[Sound of door opening]

341
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:38,759
(♪〜)

342
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:41,165
(♪〜)

343
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:41,165
[sound of door closing]

344
00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:49,792
(♪〜)

345
00:14:49,792 --> 00:15:06,792
(♪〜)

346
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:13,957
(♪〜)

347
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:16,858
(Yuki's voice)

348
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:16,858
a little bit! Because it's hard to write.

349
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:18,627
(Airi's voice) Huh? Let's write together.

350
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:18,627
(Yuki's voice) Hey, hey?

351
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,396
(Airi's voice) I can't see. I can't see.

352
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,396
(Yuki's voice) Wait a minute, wait.

353
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:24,858
I can't see it!

354
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:24,858
(Airi's voice) It's already a mess!

355
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,000
(Yuki's voice) Just a little more

356
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,000
Go there!

357
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,033
(Airi's voice) This is difficult...

358
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:35,363
(♪〜)

359
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,429
(Umi) Yuki-san was cool.

360
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:45,759
Because if you show me even a little love➡

361
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,099
Airin

362
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,099
I felt so bad for her.

363
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,660
It doesn't mean love is gone

364
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,660
Isn't it?

365
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,297
We've been together for 10 years.

366
00:15:56,297 --> 00:16:00,495
without saying too much

367
00:15:56,297 --> 00:16:00,495
I'm glad I broke up with you.

368
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:02,462
But...

369
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,396
The reason why I feel distant➡

370
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:09,165
The country's system is

371
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:09,165
That's cruel.

372
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:12,330
(First time) Still fighting

373
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:12,330
You shouldn't give up.

374
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:16,132
I understand that you're tired➡

375
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:19,330
The feeling of blaming Yuki-san

376
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:19,330
