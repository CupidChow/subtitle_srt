1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,759
(Kaede) Because I want a divorce.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,759
I would like to consult with you about this.

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,627
<From my sister Kaede

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,627
I received a request for divorce defense➡

5
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:12,792
Hatsu Otokita and Detective Umi Iseya➡

6
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:15,132
He was in charge of Kaede's daughter➡

7
00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:17,165
There was a reason>

8
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:19,330
(Kaede) That girl

9
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:19,330
When you talk back a little ➡

10
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,627
Push it away and put your ear on the corner of the shelf

11
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,627
Hit it hard➡

12
00:00:22,627 --> 00:00:25,033
I lost my hearing for a while.

13
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:27,858
(Owari) My educational policy is so

14
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:27,858
Don't you like it?

15
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:31,594
Who will decide the future path of my child?

16
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:31,594
It's a parent's responsibility!

17
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:34,297
(Kaede) Only for that person

18
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:34,297
Don't give Anna away.

19
00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:38,033
＜Just then, at the beginning

20
00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:38,033

22
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:41,396
<Furthermore>

23
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:43,231
(Anna) Mom!

24
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:45,330
mother!

25
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,330
mother….

26
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,396
(Owari) Anna I'm going home.

27
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:55,726
(first time)

28
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:55,726

[whimper]

30
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:07,627
(Sea) Anzu-chan!

31
00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:09,660
Umi-kun...?

32
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:14,693
I didn't have anything else to do...

33
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:17,528
I was wondering if you're okay.

34
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:19,759
I see.

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,429
I'm glad you contacted me.

36
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:25,660
Will you stop by as a family restaurant?

37
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:25,660
Shall we have some parfait?

38
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,495
My father

39
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,495
I'm keeping an eye on it with GPS.

40
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:35,561
I can't take a detour.

41
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:39,264
Is that so?

42
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:42,693
Eh, then

43
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:42,693
I can't even go on a date with Tomoki...

44
00:01:42,693 --> 00:01:47,132
Ah, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

45
00:01:42,693 --> 00:01:47,132
I don't feel like that.

46
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:49,000
sorry.

47
00:01:52,264 --> 00:01:54,693
Hakkun, how are you?

48
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:56,528
yeah~….

49
00:01:56,528 --> 00:01:59,528
Well, I'm fine.

50
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:01,924
I see.

51
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:01,924
But➡

52
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:05,264
In the life with An-chan

53
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:05,264
Because I'm used to it.

54
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:08,330
Me too, for the first time somehow➡

55
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,231
I guess it's a bit darker.

56
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,858
I see.

57
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,858
Yeah.

58
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:20,363
Umi-kun.

59
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:20,363
yeah?

60
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:35,759
It's nothing.

61
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:40,561
It's okay if you don't have anything special to do.

62
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:40,561
Please contact me again.

63
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,198
Me too for the first time➡

64
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,033
Always about Anzu-chan

65
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,033
Because I think so.

66
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:51,825
Yeah.

67
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:51,825
bye bye.

75
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:32,858
I met An-chan.

(♪〜)

77
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:36,627
I don't feel like doing anything

78
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:36,627
I understand, though➡

79
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:38,297
(♪〜)

80
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:38,297
I need to eat some.

(♪〜)

82
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:39,957
Leave me alone.

85
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:47,462
I'll leave it there.

(Kaede) First Yes.

89
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:24,396
Open it.

90
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,693
Isn't it nice?

91
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:31,495
I went to many shops.

92
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:31,495
Because I looked for it.

93
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:41,198
joy as always

94
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:41,198
You're the kind of person who doesn't show it to your face.

95
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:47,297
The tie, of course, by myself.

96
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:47,297
Now you can tighten it, right?

97
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:50,924
no.

98
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:54,000
Huh?

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,957
So today is special, right?

100
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:02,528
Huh? Why?

101
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:05,660
It's special!

102
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,792
yes.

103
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:11,264
The tie is

104
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:11,264
I can't tighten it properly➡

105
00:05:11,264 --> 00:05:14,099
It's a popular point.

106
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:17,759
If I can find someone I like someday

107
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:17,759
Have it tightened.

108
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:25,726
Yeah.

109
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,429
yes.

110
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:30,660
Yes, yes.

111
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:30,660
yes.

112
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,396
yes!

113
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:34,594
Over there, over there.

114
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:34,594
Ah….

115
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:40,165
Yeah! Feels good.

116
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:46,132
first time.

117
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:48,924

00:05:52,363 --> 00:05:55,000
What a job➡

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,033
It's so cool!

122
00:05:58,264 --> 00:06:01,891
When my sister says something➡

123
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:04,825
It's light, isn't it? [laughs]

124
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,528
But➡

125
00:06:08,528 --> 00:06:11,198
At first, it's easy to feel other people's pain➡

126
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:13,693
I'm a little worried though.

127
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:18,165
To those who asked me for the first time

128
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:18,165
Please answer honestly.

129
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:20,594
Even if you don't say that

130
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:20,594
I understand.

131
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:22,693
Okay.

132
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:27,660
(Kaede's voice) Congratulations on your opening!

135
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:48,528
good morning.

136
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:53,495
good morning.

137
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:58,429
Sorry about yesterday.

138
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:02,132
What do you mean?

139
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:16,495
(♪〜)

140
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:20,198
What happened when I opened my office?

141
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:20,198
Remember me.

142
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:24,594
I became independent in my mid-20s.

143
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:27,627
People around me say it's reckless➡

144
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:30,561
That's what I was told.

145
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:30,561
Yeah.

146
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,957
But at times like that➡

147
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,165
In my sister's words

148
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,165
I was supported.

149
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:44,231
I think being a lawyer is a calling.

150
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:47,462
Hey.

151
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:50,858
But my sister also has no basis for such a thing.

152
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:50,858
I don't think it was.

153
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:53,693
But at that time, like that

154
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:53,693
For what you said.

155
00:07:56,528 --> 00:08:00,462
I thought that might be the case.

156
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:03,462
What are the words of a loved one➡

157
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:07,033
What gives me more power than words

158
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:07,033
Yes, there is.

159
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:15,231
That's why I will continue to be your sister.

160
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:15,231
I have to live my life without shame.

161
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:22,693
(♪〜)

162
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:26,693
Anzu-chan, are you okay?

163
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:35,033
I liked this➡

164
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:38,429
I'm trying to give it as a present

165
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:38,429
That's what I was thinking.

167

168
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:51,924
very soon

169
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:51,924
I will disappear from this world.

170
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:55,693
So➡

171
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:58,825
My only regret➡

172
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:02,165
About Anna➡

173
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:05,231
I would like to entrust it to you for the first time.

174
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:11,792
This is➡

175
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:14,264
Your sister's will?

176
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:19,495
Radio) After I’m gone ➡

177
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:23,759
Leaving Anna in Owari

178
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:23,759
I'm not worried.

179
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,033
That person is

180
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,033
If there's something you don't like➡

181
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,660
It can be high-pressure at times.

182
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,726
Every time, I protected Anna.

183
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:37,165
But even if I want to get divorced ➡

184
00:09:37,165 --> 00:09:39,198
Because that person is an expert➡

185
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:42,132
It's difficult to get custody

186
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:42,132
I knew it➡

187
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:45,330
There was nothing I could do.

188
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,297
that's why….

189
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:52,033
I➡

190
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:55,396
The family I couldn't give to you➡

191
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:58,066
Could you make one for me?

192
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,660
To that child➡

193
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,495

198
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:20,165
It will be advantageous for divorce➡

199
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:22,957
I have left evidence.

200
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:26,561
In case something happens to me➡

201
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:29,099
I want you to see that.

202
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:35,033
Your sister is➡

203
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:38,396
Anzu-chan

204
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:38,396
You wanted to ask us.

205
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:41,528
Yeah.

206
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:43,792
But I can't do anything as it is now.

207
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:46,792
Yeah….

208
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:49,033
If➡

209
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:51,594
While your sister is still alive➡

210
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:53,660
What if we were officially divorced?

211
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,726
Then the story will change.

212
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:01,033
After the divorce was finalized, the parent passed away➡

213
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:03,099
The other parent➡

214
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:06,528
I'm not suitable as a guardian.

215
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:06,528
If certified➡

216
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:09,198
It should be possible to move it away from Owari.

217
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:14,066
Not suitable as a guardian...

218
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:19,132
But to certify

219
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:19,132
It must be quite difficult.

220
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:23,099
Even if it's difficult➡

221
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,825
This is your first time being close to a client, right?

222
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:36,000

223
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,099

Even though I was injured like this➡

229
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:06,594
Did you know the first time?

230
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:10,627
Ah, when I went to visit you at the hospital

231
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:10,627
I heard it.

232
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:13,231
Then more

233
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:13,231
I wish you would tell me sooner.

234
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,231
Listen, what are you going to do?

235
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,231
There's nothing you can do about it.

236
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,528
I'll protect An-chan.

237
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:21,429
Children are in a better position than me.

238
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:21,429
Raising your hand to the weak➡

239
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:23,759
no matter what the reason is

240
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:23,759
There's no way I'll forgive you.

241
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,957
I know that, but

242
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,957
Legally, you can't do anything.

243
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,429
They said it would be fine if I took custody away...

244
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:34,957
It's not easy.

245
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:40,000
Recently➡

246
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,231
Between parents and grandparents➡

247
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:45,528
fight for child custody

248
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:45,528
There was a precedent.

249
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,594
The high court also said that grandparents

250
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,594
I wish I could have been the custodian➡

251
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:56,528
The Supreme Court denied that

252
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:56,528
After that➡

253
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:59,660
This Supreme Court decision

254
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:59,660
It has become the standard.

255
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,132
Eh, that's it...

256
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:07,594
Well then, that's what it means, right?

257
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:11,264
Even relatives

258
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:11,264
Does that mean I can't become a guardian?

259
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:13,132
Ah.

It must be hiding!

263
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,099
yes?

264
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,099
You understand, right?

265
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:26,264
Something like taking someone away without permission...

266
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:26,264
Anna isn't there.

267
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,759
At a time like this

268
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,759
Haven't you come back?

269
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:33,693
Let me confirm.

(Tomoki) Yes.

272
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:06,198
(Anna) Fine, eat it all by yourself.

273
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:10,594
If you don't eat, you won't feel well.

274
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:16,099
I'm not feeling well.

275
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:16,099

What's the point?

284
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,198
What method?

285
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,198
Hey, what kind of method?

286
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:42,264
Look behind the sea

No.

When I'm with my dad

Apparently the two are together

315
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,660

I didn't have to apologize to you so violently

351
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,792
(Hayashi) With grandmother

352
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,792
We live together.

353
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:52,429
He's old, so I'll take him home.

354
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:52,429
I'm supposed to send it to you.

355
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:55,561
(Owari) Take care of your children properly

356
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:55,561
Because it is a family that cannot be managed➡

357
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:57,264
Become a child without common sense!

358
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:59,528
There's no way to say that!

359
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:59,528
(Owari) Let's go!

360
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,462
It's not possible...

361
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:15,858
Anzu-chan, I want to run away from home

362
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:15,858
You hated living with your father.

363
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:18,528
I was being assaulted like that.

364
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:23,033
Contact during this time

365
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:23,033
It was an SOS after all.

366
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:29,000
Somehow, An-chan was taken from Owari.

367
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:29,000
Can't you separate me?

368
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,792
Custody is in Owari➡

369
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:34,132
If Owari

370
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:34,132
Even if you file for divorce after death➡

371
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:36,825
Blood relationship with the child

372
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:36,825
It's impossible because it doesn't change.

373
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:40,462
Yeah…

374
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:40,462
I wonder what An-chan wants to do.

375
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:43,825
Tell your sister about Hatsu and Anzu.

376
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:43,825
He asked me to help him.

377
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:47,693
What do you think about that bow tie?

378
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:47,693
I guess it sent a message.

379
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,528
I'm going to see Owari.

380
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:53,660
It is difficult to appoint a guardian.

381
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:53,660
I know, but➡

382
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,792
There's no way things can stay like this.

383
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,363
(Owari) Last night you

384
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,363
I got involved.

385
00:19:13,363 --> 00:19:15,297
(First time) No.

386
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:23,297
I can't believe you're coming to visit my office.

387
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:23,297
That's rare.

388
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:25,066
What are the requirements?

389
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,099
I'm talking about Anna.

390
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,891
Oh.

391
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:32,099
My sister asked me to do it.

392
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:34,462
Please protect Anna.

393
00:19:34,462 --> 00:19:37,726
She said something strange.

394
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:40,528
I have a father, so why come to you?

395
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:40,528
I wonder if he said that?

396
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:43,023
My sister is.

397
00:19:43,023 --> 00:19:46,891
Anna's future

398
00:19:43,023 --> 00:19:46,891
I was worried.

399
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:50,561
that's why

400
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:50,561
When you can't take care of yourself ➡

401
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:53,594
He entrusted Anna to me.

402
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,462
Anna's designated guardian

403
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,462
I'm thinking of filing a complaint.

404
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:02,924
I was wondering what you were going to say.

405
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:02,924
Is that so?

406
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:06,990
Even though I am under restraint➡

407
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,330
If you are also a member of the legal profession➡

408
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,792
If you fight it in court

409
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,792
There is no way such a claim would hold true➡

410
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,594
You know.

411
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:18,528
My sister is➡

412
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:21,165
He was someone I could always rely on.

413
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:26,264
The only person who understands me➡

414
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:29,660
When things don't go well with those around you

415
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:29,660
My sister always helped me.

416
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:37,396
I am➡

417
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:39,924
I loved my sister.

418
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:45,429
I owe so much to you➡

419
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:47,825
As you know➡

420
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:51,330
My sister is patronizing about things like that.

421
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:51,330
That's not my personality.

422
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,495
And yet➡

423
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:56,792
When I realized I was dying ➡

424
00:20:56,792 --> 00:21:00,561
Say you owe me something

425
00:20:56,792 --> 00:21:00,561
It was my first time asking for a favor.

426
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:02,396
(♪〜)

427
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:02,396
What do you want to say?

428
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:08,759
(♪〜)

429
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:11,726
(♪〜)

430
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:11,726
To that extent➡

431
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:14,231
(♪〜)

432
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:14,231
About Anna

433
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:14,231
I was worried.

434
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:31,231
(♪〜)

435
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:34,528
(♪〜)

436
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:38,396
(♪〜)

437
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:38,396
I can't talk to my sister anymore.

438
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:41,627
(♪〜)

439
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:41,627
But the feeling of regret

440
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:41,627
I am receiving it.

441
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:45,165
(♪〜)

442
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:45,165
I am aware that it is difficult➡

443
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:47,429
(♪〜)

444
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:47,429
I'm going to fight you.

445
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:55,132
(♪〜)

446
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,660
“Delivering a delicious divorce”

447
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,660
I want to see you again.
