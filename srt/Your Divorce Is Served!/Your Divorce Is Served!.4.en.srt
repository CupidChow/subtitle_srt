As long as you say you want to believe ➡

190
00:07:57,132 --> 00:08:00,363
No matter how much I try to persuade

191
00:07:57,132 --> 00:08:00,363
It doesn't resonate.

192
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:05,000
How to break the spell of monsters

193
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:05,000
I wish there was.

194
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,660
(Anna) Hmm...

195
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,561
Ah, sorry

196
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,561
You woke me up.

197
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,528
I'll be there soon.

198
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:12,330
Huh? Are you arriving yet?

199
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,495
How can you say it's not over anymore?

200
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,495
I thought I was walking.

201
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,165
I want to do this a little more.

202
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,825
Huh?

203
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:22,363
Because Hakkun's back

204
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:22,363
It's warm.

205
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:24,033
That's nice.

206
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:26,627
Me too Hakkun

207
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:26,627
I want you to give me a piggyback ride.

208
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:29,330
No! Umi-kun, you’re an adult, right?

209
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,660
Gyu~!

210
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,660
Oh, it hurts.

211
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,297
You know, even adults carry me on my back.

212
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,297
There are times when you want to have it, right?

213
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:37,363
yeah? Shall I say it again?

214
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:39,033
Hey, stop it, ocean.

215
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:39,033
Hey.

216
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,693
Even as an adult

217
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,693
I want you to give me a piggyback ride.

218
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:42,858
TV) Request for divorce and ➡

219
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:45,924
To Mr. Nishiuchi

220
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:45,924
I will request 100 million yen in compensation.

221
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,462
(Lawyer) I will give you an opportunity to defend yourself.

222
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:54,627
If you have something to say

223
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:54,627
Please tell me.

224
00:08:55,924 --> 00:08:59,033
at that spot

225
00:08:55,924 --> 00:08:59,033
The person who did such a thing was ➡

226
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:02,330
I'm still not wrong

227
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:02,330
I think so.

228
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,825
The client is also a talent➡

229
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:08,396
that there is a risk

230
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:08,396
Even if you know➡

231
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:11,825
I committed adultery on that occasion.

232
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:11,825
I agreed to make it public.

233
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,330
Why?

234
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,627
It was built by Mr. Nishiuchi➡

235
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:22,726
called the ideal husband

236
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:22,726
In front of the image➡

237
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:26,132
Even if you appeal, they will crush you

238
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:26,132
Because I made a decision.

239
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:32,033
and live broadcast

240
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:32,033
By exposing it to the public eye➡

241
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:34,924
other victims too

242
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:34,924
Because I thought I could save it.

243
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:41,462
[Sound of running footsteps]

244
00:09:41,462 --> 00:09:43,132
(Mika) It's late though!

245
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:44,792
(Ayaka) I'm sorry.

246
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,957
(Mika) Has it progressed? The matter of alimony.

247
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:48,627
(Ayaka) No...

248
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:51,726
(Mika) Please proceed properly.

249
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:57,099
(Mika) But somehow

250
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:57,099
I'm tired of it.

251
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,396
(Mika) Yes! Hey

252
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,396
I thought of something more interesting.

253
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:05,165
(Mika) With my husband

254
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:05,165
You cheated on me➡

255
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:07,132
Based on the photographic evidence➡

256
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:09,825
I will also demand alimony from my husband.

257
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:09,825
What?

258
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:11,495
(Ayaka) Huh?

259
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:13,825
(Mika) You know.

260
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:16,561
Ayaka to my husband

261
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:16,561
Are you interested?

262
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:18,231
(Ayaka) No, that's it...

263
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:20,396
(Mika) But you can't do anything.

264
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:23,660
I'll set it up for you!

265
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:29,231
(Mika) So hurry up and meet my people.

266
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:29,231
Have a physical relationship.

267
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,033
Radio) (Mika) Also from my husband

268
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,033
I'll leave you with a generous alimony.

269
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,594
That sucks.

270
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,594
Radio) (Mika) I'll give it to you afterwards.

271
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,429
(Lawyer) But what you did.

272
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:42,594
for self-protection

273
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:42,594
Don't get too close to the client.

274
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:45,429
do you say that?

275
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:48,825
It is better to protect the morals of lawyers.

276
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:48,825
Is it important?

277
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:55,033
I don't need anything like that➡

278
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:58,000
I think that was for the best.

279
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:03,363
All you need to do is be close to the client➡

280
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,363
My morals.

281
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,924
(Takuma) Phew.

282
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,495
(Takuma) Phew.

283
00:11:17,396 --> 00:11:19,231
(Takuma) What did you do?

284
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:21,858
(Mika) I didn't do anything.

285
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:25,594
Hey, wait a minute~

286
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:25,594
We're busy though.

287
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:27,561
If you're going to make me wait, I'll go home.

288
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,165
(Aono) If I need one more person.

289
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,165
I'll start right away.

290
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:31,825
[Knocking on door]

291
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,165
(Aono) Yes!

292
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:35,858
Is it Tatsuya Nimura?

293
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:35,858
(Tatsuya) Yes.

294
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:38,792
(Aono) I've been waiting for you. Please.

295
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:38,792
(Tatsuya) Ah...

296
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,660
(Aono) Please, please...this is it.

297
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,660
(Tatsuya) Ah...

298
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,594
Ah!

299
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:46,924
(First) Let's get started right away.

300
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:48,957
From Ayaka Nimura the other day➡

301
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:51,594
The husband Tatsuya and Mika

302
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:51,594
Due to adultery➡

303
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:53,264
There was a demand for compensation.

304
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:54,924
(Tatsuya) Oh, what? (Takuma) You...

305
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:58,858
This is a seemingly common act of infidelity.

306
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:58,858
It seems like a case➡

307
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:00,891
Actually, it's a little more complicated.

308
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:02,660
This case.

309
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,396
The person pulling the strings behind me was➡

310
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:07,462
Mika, right?

311
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:12,198
(Mika) Huh? On what basis?

312
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,858
Ayaka-san told me everything.

313
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,528
(Tatsuya) Ah...

314
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:23,264
(Tatsuya) Ha...

315
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:26,000
(Mika) What do you mean?

316
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,792
Mr. Lawyer, about me.

317
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,792
Are you trying to fit it in?

318
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:30,759
Mr. Mika.

319
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,330
you are married

320
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,330
Were you satisfied?

321
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:37,726
(Mika) What? suddenly.

322
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:41,957
Takuma-san is a workaholic and mostly

323
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:41,957
I'm not at home. Isn't that so?

324
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:43,825
(Takuma) Yes?

325
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:47,924
Mika doesn't care about his family.

326
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:47,924
Tired of married life with my husband➡

327
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:50,792
Like looking for inspiration.

328
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:53,429
Ayaka's husband

329
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:53,429
Seduce Tatsuya➡

330
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:57,528
committed adultery.

331
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:57,528
(Takuma) You invited me! ?

332
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,858
but

333
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,858
The relationship has also become rut➡

334
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:03,132
the scene of my affair

335
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:03,132
Take a photo➡

336
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:06,066
To collect compensation from Tatsuya-san.

337
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:06,066
I had an idea.

338
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:07,726
(Takuma) Seriously?

339
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:10,198
It's crazy. (Mika) What?

340
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:12,132
Even you are Ayaka.

341
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:12,132
If you tell me you like it➡

342
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:14,891
I'm trying to follow you

343
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:14,891
You did it!

344
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,396
(Mika) What did that girl say?

345
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,396
I don't know though.

346
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:23,594
Some people accepted the invitation

347
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:23,594
Isn't that bad?

348
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:28,330
Hey Tatsuya. (Tatsuya) No...

349
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:28,330
(Takuma) Hahaha… [lol]

350
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,165
You're amazing.

351
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:32,759
But why like this?

352
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:32,759
Did something weird happen?

353
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,165
That's Ayaka and Mika.

354
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,165
It is due to the relationship.

355
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:40,033
(Mika) What? What do you want to say?

356
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:44,066
This is my guess➡

357
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:47,033
When I met Mika,

358
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:47,033
Probably not showing his true self➡

359
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:49,429
As we become closer

360
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:49,429
If it’s Ayaka-san➡

361
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,726
I guess they thought it was easy to put together.

362
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,726
Is it different?

363
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:53,693
(Mika) Huh...

364
00:13:54,726 --> 00:13:59,264
Mika-san and Ayaka-san

365
00:13:54,726 --> 00:13:59,264
It's a good thing that you don't go against me➡

366
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:02,297
I will get that compensation as well.

367
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:02,297
I guess he meant it.

368
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:03,957
(Aono) That's terrible...

369
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:06,792
Everything is Mika Shiozaki.

370
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:09,231
It's obvious that you set it up.

371
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:12,924
(Mika) What?

372
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:15,561
So is there any evidence?

373
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:17,792
Bring it out! Proof!

[(Mika) With my husband

375
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:21,660
You cheated on me➡

376
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,561
Based on the photographic evidence, my husband also told me

377
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,561
How about asking for compensation? ]

378
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:27,231
[(Ayaka) Huh? ]

379
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:27,231
(Mika) Hahaha... [Laughs] Don't be silly.

380
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:29,297
[(Mika) So hurry up and meet my people.

381
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:29,297
Have a physical relationship]

382
00:14:29,297 --> 00:14:30,957
(Takuma) Oh...

383

[(Mika) From my husband too

384
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:34,132
I'll leave you with a generous compensation.]

[(Mika) I'll give the rest to you]

386
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:39,462
(Mika)Moooooo!

387
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:45,000
(Mika) Well, if it gets found out already.

388
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:45,000
Can't we help it?

389
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,066
Moooooo!

390
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:51,264
A lot of money soon

391
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:51,264
I almost got it!

392
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:53,000
Don't be silly.

393
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,660
(Takuma) Why is that...?

394
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,396
(Mika) The world! What I don't like

395
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,396
Because there are so many!

396
00:14:58,396 --> 00:15:01,462
I wish I could get married and be happy

397
00:14:58,396 --> 00:15:01,462
Isn't it a delusion?

398
00:15:01,462 --> 00:15:03,924
But you guys➡

399
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:06,495
Love each other➡

400
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,231
Have you entered into a marriage relationship?

401
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,231
Isn't there?

402
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:13,627
(Mika) Huh?

403
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:16,528
Everyone is really

404
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:16,528
Haven't you noticed?

405
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:19,000
Love can't last.

Money is important in life!

408
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:28,660
I won't let you down with money.

409
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,594
(Takuma) If marriage is a fantasy

410
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,594
I'll break up with you right away.

411
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:38,396
Marrying you is my life

412
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:38,396
I thought that was the biggest flaw.

413
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:42,231
(Takuma) But.

414
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:46,726
Even 1 yen for you

415
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:46,726
I have no intention of doing it!

416

[Door opening/closing sound]

417
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:57,693

418
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,594
(Mika) Huh.

419
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,495
To a woman with no merits like that➡

420
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,297
Why bother?

421
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,297
Even though I'm calling out to you.

422
00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:08,396
Just be grateful.

423
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:13,858
(Mika) Well, even if we're together

424
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:13,858
It was boring though.

425
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:17,528
Because of that woman

426
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:17,528
I have to face such terrible things.

427
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,099
It seems that it is.

428
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:23,660
nevertheless

429
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:23,660
Are you saying we're friends?

430
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:27,891
(Mika) Oh?

431
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:33,792
(Tatsuya) Ah...

432
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,099
(Mika) What?

433
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,429
Were you guys Guru?

434
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,297

436
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:50,957
I thought we were friends.

437
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:53,033
(Mika) Eh!

438
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,792
I've never done that before

439
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,792
I've never thought about it though.

440
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,429
(Mika) What?

441
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:06,924
You want to make me the bad guy?

442
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:11,066
Usually when this happens

443
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:11,066
There are many people who side with the weak.

444
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:13,660
But come on.

445
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,759
The cause is the person being bullied

446
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,759
Isn't there?

447
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:20,825
(Mika) You

448
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:20,825
Because I won't say anything!

449
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:24,165
Even this is getting interesting

450
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:24,165
You'll gradually heat up!

451
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:26,264
It's your fault!

452
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:31,066
(Umi) Even if that argument is accepted...

453
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:35,957
(Ayaka) I...➡

454
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:39,561
What kind of person is Mika?

455
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:39,561
I knew it.

456
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:41,231
What about (Mika)?

457
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:44,033
(Ayaka) I know

458
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:44,033
I was nearby.

459
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:45,726
Why?

460
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:51,561
(Ayaka) Being alone again

461
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:51,561
Because I was scared.

462
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:59,231
(Ayaka) I am aware of my own weaknesses.

463
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:59,231
I know it's the cause.

464
00:17:59,231 --> 00:18:04,330
If you don't like it, you should just say you don't like it.

465
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:10,297
I have to become stronger before

466
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:10,297
I also know that I can't proceed.

467
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:18,726
(Ayaka) I live my life

468
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:18,726
Because I don't want to give up.

469
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:23,033

476
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:47,363
How did you feel when you took the picture?

477
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:49,627
As you can imagine, there are not many.

478
00:18:52,627 --> 00:18:55,462
But I use that heartache as sustenance➡

479
00:18:55,462 --> 00:18:59,132
Use this as evidence➡

480

(Ayaka) To Tatsuya and Mika

489
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:36,858
Because of mental suffering.

490
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:42,924

No, I'll keep it separately.
