1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,924
(First time) I will request 100 million yen as compensation.

2
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:07,924
＜Partners both in public and private life＞

3
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:13,924
<To be legally bound

4
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:13,924
The two of us are incomparable➡

5
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:17,165
someone who suffers from a partner's betrayal

6
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:17,165
Let's be of help➡

7
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:20,594
team up

8
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:20,594
Undertook divorce defense

9
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:22,759
I will protect you.

10
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:26,033
<If it is for the benefit of the client

11
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:26,033
For the first time, any means necessary ➡

12
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:27,924
Being sued in a past case➡

13
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:30,825
was subject to disciplinary action>

14
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:33,462
<Meanwhile, from my first sister Kaede➡

15
00:00:33,462 --> 00:00:35,198
Divorce consultation>

16
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:37,792
(Kaede) I want to break up with you soon.

17
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:37,792
as soon as possible.

18
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,726
Even if something happens to me➡

19
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:42,165
Only for that person

20
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:42,165
Don't give Anna away.

21
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:46,264
(Owari) Even though I'm here

22
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:46,264
I can't believe I asked Hatsu-kun to take care of my daughter.

23
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:49,462
I sometimes think about my wife

24
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:49,462
There are times when I don't understand.

25
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:53,759
<Will it really be Kaede's feelings at first?

26
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:53,759
Can you respond?>

27
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:06,561
(Airi) Yuki.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,165
(Airi) Look.

29
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:13,627
(Airi) Ja~!

30
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:15,891
I found it at a flea market in Paris.

31
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:18,066
I thought it would suit Yuki.

32
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:20,858
(Airi) Try opening it.

33
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,957
(Airi) Look, isn't it nice?

34
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:29,363
Celebrating 10 years since we started dating...

35
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:29,363
(Yuki) Sorry.

36
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:31,660
(Airi) Huh?

37
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,396
(Yuki) I submitted a marriage registration.

38
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:36,165
(Airi) Huh?

39
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:39,726
(Yuki) Airi

40
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:39,726
While I was on a business trip overseas.

41
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:42,099
With a childhood friend.

42
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:45,462
(Airi) What are you kidding?

43
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:48,462
(Yuki) It's not a joke, it's true.

44
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:50,396
(Airi) With that guy

45
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:50,396
Were you dating?

46
00:01:50,396 --> 00:01:52,099
(Yuki) No. (Airi) No?

47
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,759
If it's different

48
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,759
You won't submit a marriage registration!

49
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,594
It also depends on

50
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,594
What about marriage registration?

51
00:01:59,594 --> 00:02:02,198
(Yuki) Airi.

52
00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:03,891
Listen to the story...

53
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,660
[sound of ring falling]

54
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,660
(Airi) I don't want to hear anything!

55
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:14,033
(♪〜)

56
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,099
(♪〜)

57
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,099
[Door opening/closing sound]

58
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:24,099
(♪〜)

59
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:26,132
(Anna) Umi-kun yet?

60
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:28,000
(Sea) Ah, sorry, I'm going now!

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,858
Yes, hello.

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,858
Oh Airin?

63
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,561
long time no see!

64
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,627
yeah? Yeah.

65
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:46,297
picture?

66
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:48,363
Good! Thank you for waiting.

67
00:02:48,363 --> 00:02:51,726
It's already late!

68
00:02:48,363 --> 00:02:51,726
The movie is about to start!

69
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:55,198
That's the thing...

70
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:59,099
I have a bad feeling about something.

71
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:03,561
(Aono) Hmm!

72
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:09,726
I was forced to go to work

73
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:09,726
Anna-chan is having a hard time too.

74
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:13,363
Why are you an adult?

75
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:13,363
I guess he won't keep his promise.

76
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:16,462
A movie I've been looking forward to for a long time

77
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:16,462
I was going to see it!

78
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,924
Yeah. I changed my plans➡

79
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:22,231
Comes with popcorn and juice

80
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:22,231
It's revenge.

81
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:25,066
Churros too.

82
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:25,066
(Aono) [slobbering sound]

83
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:27,165
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

84
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,528
Good, please.

85
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:32,165
(Airi) Hello.

86
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:35,132
Please make time for me

87
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:35,132
thank you.

88
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,759
This is Airi Fujimae.

89
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,759
My name is Otokita and I am a lawyer.

90
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,495
What is Airin?

91
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,495
We met at an event.

92
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:42,363
I just got a call suddenly.

93
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:45,066
I want you to quickly introduce me to you.

94
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:45,066
Because I say it.

95
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:48,099
(Airi) Umi-kun's partner is

96
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:48,099
I heard you're a lawyer.

97
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:51,099
This person is the only one

98
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:51,099
That's what I thought.

99
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,462
Yesterday, I returned home from a business trip.

100
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:57,132
Sigh...I never expected something like this to happen.

101
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:57,132
I can't believe I'm awake.

102
00:03:57,132 --> 00:03:59,924
(Aono) What is this?

103
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:02,198
(Airi) We've been together for a long time

104
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:02,198
I have a lover. (Aono) Hmph.

105
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:04,330
(Airi) I

106
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:04,330
Since I was 20 years old➡

107
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,726
live together

108
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,726
It's already been 10 years.

109
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:09,231
(Aono) 10 years!

110
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:09,231
If we were together that long➡

111
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:11,330
Aren't you already in a common-law marriage?

112
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,594
What is common law marriage?

113
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:16,594
Anna, please go over there.

114
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:18,264
(Airi) What is a common-law marriage?

115
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:20,033
Just not registered ➡

116
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,660
It's no different than being married

117
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,660
I'm talking about relationships.

118
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,891
Hey.

119
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,297
(Aono) So? (Airi) So…➡

120
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:34,099
me for 3 months

121
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:34,099
I was on a business trip overseas.

122
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:37,693
When I returned home...she...

123
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:39,792
(Aono) A girlfriend?

124
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:44,066
(Airi) I was married.

125
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:44,066
(Aono) Haaah...!

126
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:46,330
(Airi) And with a man.

127
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:46,330
(Aono) Eh...

128
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:52,198
(Airi) Since she was a child

129
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:52,198
To your grandmother➡

130
00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:56,132
"I won't die unless Yuki gets married."

131
00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:56,132
Apparently he grew up hearing that.

132
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:59,264
in a little old house

133
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:59,264
“You shouldn’t be single”➡

134
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:02,660
Apparently it's in the family precepts.

135
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:02,660
(Aono) A curse called a family precept has appeared.

136
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,660
Curse is too strong a word.

137
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,660
(Aono) Is that so?

138
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,957
(Airi) While I was on a business trip

139
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,957
My grandmother was hospitalized for a long time➡

140
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:10,957
It seems like it's about to get dangerous.

141
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:13,264
Apparently he was saying it all the time, even on his hospital bed.

142
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:15,099
"When are you getting married?"

143
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,165
(Aono) Grandmother

144
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,165
To reassure you➡

145
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:20,726
Does that mean you have submitted a marriage registration?

146
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:20,726
(Airi) Yes.

147
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:23,891
``Did you register properly?

148
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:23,891
Let me confirm.''

149
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,693
It's enrollment harassment...

150
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,891
The two of you

151
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,891
What is the partnership oath?

152
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:30,957
(Airi) I started doing this three years ago.

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,132
(Airi) black and white

154
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,132
I want to be clear.

155
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:36,429
Same-sex marriage is not allowed➡

156
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:38,660
After only 2 months of marriage➡

157
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,891
A common-law marriage that lasted 10 years➡

158
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:44,660
Which is acceptable?

159
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:44,660
I want to fight.

160
00:05:47,924 --> 00:05:51,363
Systems established by local governments and national laws.

161
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:55,264
Which is acceptable?

162
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:55,264
That's true.

163
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:58,495
I think it's quite difficult.

164
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:00,198
Is there a chance of winning?

165
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:03,495
in past precedents

166
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:03,495
Even if it is a same-sex common-law marriage➡

167
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:05,891
Claim for damages due to adultery ➡

168
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:09,132
an acceptable judgment

169
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:09,132
There were times when I was let down.

170
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:13,759
If the other party accepts the common-law marriage

171
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:13,759
That claim should be accepted.

172
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,924
Are there many such things?

173
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,924
No, just this case law.

174
00:06:16,924 --> 00:06:19,792
I see...

175
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:24,528
I think I understand.

176
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:24,528
If the law is not amended➡

177
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:27,132
In today's Japan

178
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:27,132
We can't get married.

179
00:06:29,363 --> 00:06:31,066
first time?

180
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:34,429
No, this kind of case

181
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:34,429
I have never accepted one➡

182
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:38,462
I have no choice but to fight. This is➡

183
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:40,858
to our way of life

184
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:40,858
Because it's related.

185
00:06:43,693 --> 00:06:45,858
Okay….

186
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:48,033
(Owari) Your

187
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:48,033
Because it was just a wish➡

Anna to Hatsu-kun

189
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,891
I left it there➡

190
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:53,792
It's about time.

191
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:56,264
(Kaede) Anna to you

192
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:56,264
I have no intention of leaving it there.

193
00:06:56,264 --> 00:07:00,033
(Owari) Leave it with me? Fufufu…

194
00:06:56,264 --> 00:07:00,033
You say something strange.

195
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:02,033
Hospitalization is prolonged

196
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:02,033
The choice of words...

197
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:04,033
(Kaede) Please divorce.

198
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:08,099
(Owari) Huh….

199
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,000
They say they have something to talk about.

200
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,000
If you're wondering something.

201
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,495
(Kaede) Divorced.

202
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,495
I have custody.

203
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:17,198
(Owari) What are you talking about?

204
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:19,495
(Kaede) Anna

205
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:19,495
I want to get away from you.

206
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:23,264
(Owari) My educational policy is so

207
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:23,264
Don't you like it?

208
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:26,528
Who will decide the future path of my child?

209
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:26,528
It's a parent's responsibility!

210
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:30,165
(Kaede) A parent's responsibility is that child.

211
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:30,165
To live like that child➡

212
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:32,462
Stay close and watch over me!

213
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:40,858
(Owari) Is that all you want to say?

214
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:42,825
Let me just say this.

215
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:45,693
There will be no divorce and I will have custody of Anna➡

216
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:47,891
Don't forget that I have it too

00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:19,231
Ah yes, what kind of person are you?

226
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:19,231
Yeah.

227
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:21,792
I guess I'm the exact opposite type of Airin.

228
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,759
Look, it's Airin.

00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,198
Much better than Airin.

237
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:39,924
Hey.

238
00:08:39,924 --> 00:08:42,000
But that kind of couple

239
00:08:39,924 --> 00:08:42,000
That's rare.

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But it's my first time

241
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The types are completely different➡

242
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,759
Although there is an age difference➡

243
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,264
That way it will last longer

244
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,231

I hope not.

That's to be expected.

I'm going to work now, so

272
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,594
At that time.

273

Moooooo! That's it

274

It's going beyond my expectations!

275
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:05,693
What do you mean?

276
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:08,759
My agent is attorney Yu Owari.

277

We have determined that we are in a common-law marriage➡

282
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:23,726
Yuki's marriage is➡

283
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:27,132
Inflicted mental pain on Airi

284
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:27,132
This constitutes adultery.

285
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:31,594
Therefore

286
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:31,594
I will request compensation of 2 million yen.

Otokita's argument➡

291
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:49,099
Because it was acknowledged

292
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:49,099
Is that okay?

293
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:54,726
(Owari) Yeah.

294
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:57,594
Those claims are correct.

295
00:10:57,594 --> 00:11:00,429
They were definitely in a common-law relationship.

296
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:05,231
However, they were in a common-law relationship.

297
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:05,231
That's a story from the past➡

Who submitted the marriage registration➡

300
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,726
This is the story after the common-law marriage was dissolved.

301
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:12,429
(Airi) Huh?

302
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:15,198
(Owari) The relationship between the two

303
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:15,198
This is a story after the bankruptcy➡

304
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:17,066
It does not constitute adultery.

305
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:20,033
So there will be no problem.

306
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:25,594
Attorney Owari: That's true.

307
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:25,594
Isn't that an outrageous argument?

308
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:28,363
(Owari) Now, I would like to ask you a question.

309
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:32,330
Currently, we are still in a common-law marriage.

310
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:32,330
It is said to be continuing➡

311
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,363
Can you prove it?

312
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:38,165
it is….

313
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,231
(Owari) If it cannot be proven

314
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,231
The conclusion is obvious.

315
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:48,528
(Airi) That's why even now

316
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:48,528
The relationship between Yuki and I continues...

317
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:51,495
(Owari) Igawa-san, is that so?

318
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
(Yuki) No.

319
00:11:58,231 --> 00:12:02,330
(Owari) During the common-law marriage period, Mr. Igawa

320
00:11:58,231 --> 00:12:02,330
Proof that you committed adultery➡

321
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,462
It seems like it can't be done after all.

The two of us three years ago

323
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:09,924

None other than that.

That's what the teacher said

331
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:21,297
Do you understand it the most?

332
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,594
you two are fine

333
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,594
We were, and still are, in a common-law marriage.

I thought it was (Airi).

352
