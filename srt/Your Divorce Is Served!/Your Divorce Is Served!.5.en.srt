To be noticed＞

16
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:35,627
(Lawyer) I will give you an opportunity to defend yourself.

17
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:37,297
(Anna) Dad!

18
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:41,099
<One day, I met my first niece.

(Kaede) Because I want a divorce.

24
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,792
I would like to consult with you about this.

25
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:52,858
(Owari) Isn't Anna causing trouble?

26
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:57,924
I'm here to take care of my daughter.

27
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:57,924
I can't believe I asked Hatsu-kun.

28
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,792
I sometimes think about my wife

29
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,792
There are times when I don't understand.

30
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:01,330
(♪〜)

31
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:05,858

32
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:10,264
(Kaede) Wow.

33
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:12,231
Huh? Did Anna make this?

34
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:16,066
Eat what I made with Umi-kun.

35
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:18,330
Eh...

36
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:29,297
delicious.

37
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,165
good.

38
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:54,561
(♪〜)

39
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:57,693
copper? Try living with the first ones➡

40
00:01:57,693 --> 00:01:59,825
Have you ever had any trouble?

41
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,594
yeah~….

42
00:02:01,594 --> 00:02:04,165
Ah! Hakkun ➡

43

mom's

44
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,726
It was as I said.

45
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:09,561
It makes a mess right away.

46
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,924
Also, I don't wake up at all in the morning.

47
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,495
on second thoughts.

48
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,495
Yeah.

49
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:18,858
Ah! But yeah

50
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:18,858
Umi-kun is like his mother➡

51
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:23,462
I'm good at cooking and cleaning.

52
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:23,462
I feel like something is going well.

53
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:27,528
yes. That's a good combination.

54
00:02:27,528 --> 00:02:29,594
I think so.

55
00:02:31,924 --> 00:02:33,891
thank you.

56
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:47,066
Cooking meals with Umi-kun

57
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:47,066
It's fun, but...

58
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,627
Mother➡

59
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,924
When can I leave the hospital?

60
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:54,726
A little more.

61
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,297
Please be patient.

62
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:04,858
What if something happened to Anna?

63
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:04,858
If you have any trouble➡

64
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:09,231
Hatsu and Umi-kun

65
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:09,231
I think it will solve the problem➡

66
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,759
I'll talk to you about anything.

67
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,792
Got it.

70
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:18,297
Got it.

71
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:18,297
[Sound of knocking on door]

72
00:03:19,363 --> 00:03:21,429
Ah, Umi-kun!

73
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:23,462
I wish it were slower.

74
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:26,198
(Sea) I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

75
00:03:26,198 --> 00:03:29,165
Anna

76
00:03:26,198 --> 00:03:29,165
Because you came to pick me up.

77
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:31,264

Yes, please leave it to me.

86

I only ate one bite.

91
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,693
Was it not delicious?

92
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:13,726
It's a waste

93
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:13,726
I couldn't eat it all.

94
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:17,330
Now's the time to enjoy it slowly

95
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:17,330
I think he eats everything.

96
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:22,264

97
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,660
There's someone.

98

It's true.

99
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:37,231
What is it?

100
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:40,627
Um... do you need something?

101
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:45,396
(Tokoro) Ah...um...here.

102
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:45,396
Are you compatible with the detective agency?

yes. If you like, please do.

104
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,891
Ah, sorry.

Please be careful where you step.

107
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:51,759
It's urgent.

Ah, that's right.

00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:09,495
Hehehe… [laughs] Yes.

116
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:14,726
in the middle of work

117
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:14,726
Did you come?

118
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:18,066
Huh? Ah... yes.

00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:22,495
I run a small factory

120
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:22,495
We also have the eyes of our employees.

121
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:24,726
A little late lunch

122
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:24,726
Tell me you'll eat it➡

123
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:26,396
It came out.

124
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:28,066
Certainly➡

125
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:31,759
I'm going to the detective agency.

126
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:31,759
It's hard to say.

127
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,363
Occupations that I would prefer not to be involved in if possible

128
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,363
I am aware that I will be in the top five.

129
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:38,891
Oh no, that's it...

130
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:38,891
Hahaha... [lol] If you'd like, please do.

131
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:41,264
Ah yes….

133
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,066
yes.

134
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:53,858
It's embarrassing though➡

135
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:56,429
My wife is cheating on me.

136
00:05:57,495 --> 00:06:01,099
What to break up with a cheating partner

137
00:05:57,495 --> 00:06:01,099
Is it possible?

138
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:05,165
yeah~…

139
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:05,165
I don't think there's anything I can't do.

140
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,165
No, that...

141
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,165
Do you want me to break up with you?

142
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:11,924
I think my wife is being cheated on.

143
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:11,924
Are you being fooled?

144
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:19,924

I'll ask you.

148
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:26,297
(Ryoko) Yes.

149
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:28,660

Reason for wanting divorce

156
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:39,132
As for the reason?

157
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,759
(Ryoko) There is a mismatch in personality.

158
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,792
(Aono) Personality mismatch.

159
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,792
Is there anything else specific?

160
00:06:49,693 --> 00:06:52,363
(Ryoko) It's a difference in values...

161
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:55,330
(Aono) Ah~ Difference in values

162
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:55,330

Yes, I see.

164
00:06:57,264 --> 00:07:01,297
First, let's talk about family structure.

165
00:06:57,264 --> 00:07:01,297
Please let me know.

166
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:04,033
(Ryoko) My family...

It's just my husband and me.

168
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,891
I don't have any children.

169
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,693
(Aono) Hmm...I understand.

170
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:13,264
What about living separately now?

171
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:15,165
(Ryoko) No.

172
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:17,000
(Aono) About divorce

173
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:17,000
What about discussions?

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,825

What about what you think?

178
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:25,099
(Ryoko) I don't think you've noticed.

179
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:28,561
(Aono) Ahhh...

180
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:31,561

Yeah? Are you sure about that?

186
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:46,627
I've seen it several times.

187
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:53,000
Here it is.

188

The person next to me is my wife Ryoko.

191
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:05,066
Show me this photo➡

192
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:08,297
Maybe I should check with myself

193
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:08,297
I thought so.

194
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:11,693
I don't have confidence that I can speak well.

195
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:13,561
I understand.

196
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:16,957
Yeah….

197
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:21,033
whether or not you are being fooled

198
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:21,033
I won't know until I try to find out.

199
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,924
If you really were cheating➡

200
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:28,858
After separating the two...

201
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:31,891
Same as before

202
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:31,891
I want to live here.

203
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:34,165
That is➡

204
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:38,033
I've had an affair

205
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:38,033
Do you mean flush it with water?

206
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:40,693
Yeah.

207
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:42,495
Anzu-chan.

208
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:42,495
Yeah?

209
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,594
Ah, An-chan.

210
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,594
I'm about to go out for work➡

211
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:47,396
Can I stay home?

212
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:47,396
Yeah.

213
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,693
from now

214
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,693
Can I bake you a pound cake?

215
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:51,363
Ah, okay, but➡

216
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,792
Because the oven gets hot

217
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,792
Be careful not to get burned.

218
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:56,759
Are you okay.

219
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:56,759
Also, study properly.

220
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay.

221
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Ah, that's right.

222
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah?

223
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,099
Even if someone visits the detective agency

224
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,099
It's okay if I'm away.

225
00:09:04,099 --> 00:09:06,396
That's An-chan's job.

226
00:09:04,099 --> 00:09:06,396
Got it.

227
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:08,099
Well then, I'll go.

228
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:08,099
Take care!

229
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:09,891
Woohoo.

230
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:17,363
(Clerk 1) Welcome.

231
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:17,363
(Clerk 2) Welcome.

232
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,462
(Customer) That's right.

233
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,462
(Ryoko) Today, for dinner.

234
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,066
(Customer) Well then, I'll take this.

235
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,066
thank you.

236
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,891
(Ryoko) No, no.

237
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,891
Thank you as always.

238
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:28,594
(Customer) Yes, see you then.

239
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:28,594
(Ryoko) Again.

240
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:34,561
Um, sorry.

241
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:34,561
yes.

242
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:36,528
Um, sorry.

243
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:36,528
yes.

244
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:38,429
I'm looking for okra.

245
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:40,165
okra?

246
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:40,165
yes.

247
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:40,825
Here it is.

248
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:42,198
Here it is.

249
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:44,231
It's okay now.

250
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:44,231
Oh, is that so?

251
00:09:44,231 --> 00:09:46,462
There's some pretty good stuff in there.

252
00:09:44,231 --> 00:09:46,462
Hey.

253
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,594
Domestically produced in Kagoshima Prefecture.

254
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,594
Yes, yes.

255
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:52,132
Thick and sweet

256
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:52,132
It's delicious.

257
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:54,231
It's certainly thick.

258
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:54,231
That's right.

259
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:56,396
If you like.

260
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:56,396
thank you.

261
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:03,528
I guess the president's office is on the top floor after all.

262
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:05,363
I guess the president's office is on the top floor after all.

263
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:08,594
Hey, it's here...

264
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:10,033
Hey, it's here...

265
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:12,627
[Camera shutter sound]

266
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:19,000
[Camera shutter sound]

267
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,561
He's more handsome in real life

268
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,561
Wow...

269
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:32,099
(♪〜)

270
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:35,330
Is it a Cinderella story?

271
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,759
Maybe I'm just being fooled...

272
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:43,924
today

273
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:43,924
I've been looking into the situation of the two of you.

274
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:47,627
Mr. Enomoto is after all

275
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:47,627
Because I'm the head of a top-notch company➡

276
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:50,792
Quite

277
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:50,792
It was an unapproachable atmosphere.

278
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,132
(Tokoro) That's right...

279
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,132
From now on➡

280
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:56,660
Is Ryoko being deceived?

281
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:56,660
Isn't that so?➡

282
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,396
I will look around Mr. Enomoto➡

283
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:03,132
I have just one suggestion.

284
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:03,132
yes.

285
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:05,660
If he really cheated ➡

286
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,528
If a lawyer comes in, based on the evidence➡

287
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:09,825
a large compensation

288
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:09,825
You can make a claim.

289
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:11,627
So divorce...

290
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:15,132
I have no intention of getting divorced.

291
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,165
I don't need alimony either.

292
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:19,462
I don't want to break up

293
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:19,462
What you're talking about is➡

294
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:21,396
I'm aware of that, but...

295
00:11:21,396 --> 00:11:25,165
My wife and I will continue

296
00:11:21,396 --> 00:11:25,165
I want to live together.

297
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:28,891
Because I love my wife.

298
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:35,957
Please let us part.

299
00:11:35,957 --> 00:11:39,000
(♪〜)

300
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,033
(♪〜)

301
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:50,528
(♪〜)

302
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:54,198
(Kaede's voice) Because I want a divorce

303
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:54,198
I would like to have that consultation.

304
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:56,693
when I have time

305
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:56,693
Come again.

306
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:58,792
I will explain in detail at that time.

307
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:03,000
(Owari) That's right.

308
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:03,000
Isn't Anna causing trouble?

309
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,957
I'm here to take care of my daughter.

310
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,957
I can't believe I asked Hatsu-kun.

311
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:11,099
I sometimes think about my wife

312
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:11,099
There are times when I don't understand.

313
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,132
After (the first) divorce, Anna...

314
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:17,726
(Aono) Yes?

315
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:17,726
home.

316
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,792
What is it?

317
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:22,429
What is it? ?

318
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:24,231
What is it...

319
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,924
(Sea) I'm home.

320
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,924
(Anna) Welcome back.

321
00:12:28,924 --> 00:12:31,627
Oh, it was baked well.

322
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:35,528
Hehehe… [lol]

323
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:35,528
Anzu-chan is definitely a genius.

324
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:37,264
Right?

325
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:40,693
This time mom

326
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:40,693
Will you eat a lot?

327
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:45,264
Tomoki-kun says it's delicious.

328
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:45,264
That's what he told me.

329
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,462
Tomoki-kun...? picture?

330
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:52,198
What is Tomoki-kun?

331
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:52,198
Anzu's boyfriend?

332
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:54,495
No, it's not like that.

333
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:56,594
That's a lie. Is it true?

334
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:56,594
Yeah.

335
00:12:56,594 --> 00:12:58,330
TRUE?

336
00:12:56,594 --> 00:12:58,330
Yeah.

337
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,165
It's too early for a boyfriend!

338
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,165
That's good!

339
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:01,957
I heard that she had a boyfriend when she was in elementary school.

340
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:04,858
First love doesn't always come true

341
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:04,858
It's like a miracle, right?

342
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:09,297
Tomoki-kun’s favorite cake too

343
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:09,297
I want to give it to my mom.

344
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:11,066
Ah….

345
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:14,264
Also, your sister

346
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:14,264
I wanted to meet you for the first time.

347
00:13:14,264 --> 00:13:17,396
I'm waiting.

348
00:13:14,264 --> 00:13:17,396
I understand.

349
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,198
Yeah.

350
00:13:20,264 --> 00:13:24,066
yes.

351
00:13:20,264 --> 00:13:24,066
(Kaede) What?

352
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:26,627
Ha! Huh?

353
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:29,363
Pound cake?

354
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:29,363
Did Anna make this?

355
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:33,858
That's right.

356
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:33,858
Eh, amazing! Looks delicious!

357
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:36,561
I'll eat it later.

358
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:38,429
Yeah….

359
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:42,825
Okay.

360
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:47,198
Let's eat some parfait and wait.

361
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:51,759
it's okay.

362
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,198
After the first and important talk is over➡

363
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,891
mother

364
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,891
Eat cake slowly.

365
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:03,099
Hey, can you eat this?

366
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:06,693
I don't have much of an appetite.

367
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:08,627
picture?

368
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:11,264
when that kid comes back

369
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:11,264
If you haven't eaten➡

370
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:13,132
Because I feel sorry for her.

371
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,099
Well, that's fine though.

372
00:14:26,462 --> 00:14:28,594
Oh delicious.

373
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:31,759
Hahaha… [lol]

374
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:37,033
There's also something about Anna➡

375
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:41,396
The divorce happened after my sister left the hospital.

376
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:41,396
Even after I calm down...

377
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,363
I want to break up quickly. as soon as possible

378
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:58,627
That person.

379
00:14:58,627 --> 00:15:00,924
Since Anna was young➡

380
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:04,396
Say discipline

381
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:04,396
I had to raise my hand.

382
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:07,132
picture? That's the first time I've heard of that.

383
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:10,660
Every time I say "stop"

384
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:10,660
I said it strongly...

385
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:15,594
3 months ago➡

386
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:18,165
That kid

387
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:18,165
When you talk back a little ➡

388
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:21,462
Push me away...

389
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,594
Hit your ear hard against the corner of the shelf➡

390
00:15:23,594 --> 00:15:27,264
I lost my hearing for a while.

391
00:15:27,264 --> 00:15:29,891
Until that child becomes an adult

392
00:15:27,264 --> 00:15:29,891
Let's be patient.

393
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:33,033
I'll protect that child

394
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:33,033
That's what I was thinking...

395
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:38,726
I have to leave as soon as possible.

396
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:41,462
why

397
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:41,462
I married someone like that.

398
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:46,000
The timing was good.

399
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,264
I wanted to have a child soon➡

400
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:53,198
Owari is getting married

401
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:53,198
I only see it as a status➡

402
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:55,858
Because it was a dry type.

403
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:58,792
At that time, I thought this would be easy.

404
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,924
Well, originally

405
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,924
Does that mean there were no romantic feelings?

406
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:07,858
For giving me Anna

407
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:07,858
I'm grateful though.

408
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:17,396
If something happens to me

409
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:17,396
Just don't give Anna to that person.

410
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:20,561
Hajime please protect Anna.

411
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:20,561
No, nothing in particular...

412
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:22,330
Promise me.

413
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:30,396
(♪〜)

414
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:32,627
Did you talk to your sister?

415
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,627
Ah.

416
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,495
Anna's father➡

417
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:40,792
I knew I was a failure as a father.

418
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,066
Is the father disqualified?

419
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,858
Why with that guy?

420
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,858
I guess he got married.

421
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:50,231
It's true about your sister

422
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:50,231
I don't understand.

423
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:53,231
That's not the first time you've said that.

424
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:53,231
picture?

425
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:57,099
Because your sister

426
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:57,099
Is this your first client?

427
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,924
Being close to the client

428
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,924
It's supposed to be a creed.

429
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:03,000
Even though I don't have any romantic feelings

430
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:03,000
Getting married➡

431
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,528
It would be impossible to ask you to understand.

432
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:09,957
For what reason do you want to get married?

433
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:09,957
Isn't it different for each person?

434
00:17:09,957 --> 00:17:15,660
The case I have now

435
00:17:09,957 --> 00:17:15,660
My client's wife is having an affair.

436
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,462
My husband found out about it➡

437
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:20,330
Because I forgive everything, with the person I was cheating on with.

438
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:20,330
I want you to break up with me➡

439
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,363
That's what I'm saying.

440
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:27,000
Because the other party is the president of a major company.

441
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:27,000
There's a possibility that you're being deceived.

442
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,693
demanding a large compensation

443
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,693
What if I get divorced? Even if I suggest it➡

444
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:33,099
because i love my wife

445
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:33,099
I feel like I have no intention of breaking up➡

446
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,858
It's unwavering.

447

Does that mean you accept it?

[Sound of wine bottle being roughly placed]

451
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,462

452

first time?

453
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:49,957
why

454
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:49,957
I guess that's how you think?

455
00:17:49,957 --> 00:17:52,297
Do you easily forgive someone who has betrayed you?

456
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:55,165
Just that pure

457
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:55,165
Don't you love your wife?

458
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:57,528
I understand though.

To the person who violated it

462
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:03,330
An appropriate punishment...

463
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,330
That's the point.

464
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,924
The first bad thing.

Whatever it is ➡

468
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:12,363
I'll never forgive you.

469
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:15,627
I think I understand.

470
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:15,627
If the law is not amended➡

471
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,594
In today's Japan

472

It's going to be tough.

475
