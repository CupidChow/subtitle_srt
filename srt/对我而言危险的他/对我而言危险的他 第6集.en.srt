[Episode 6]

4
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,000
H-help me.

5
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,610
Where is the list?

6
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,160
I've given you the bag.

7
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,020
Help me.

8
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,510
I'll ask you again.

9
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,560
Where is the list?

10
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,150
It's...

11
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,180
In my underwear pocket.

12
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,930
There is a small silver flash drive.

13
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,810
The list of all overseas assets of LH Star is in it.

14
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,329
It is all for you.

15
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,579
It is all for you.

16
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,170
Help me!

17
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:27,730
Help me!

18
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,930
Help!

19
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,840
Take this.

20
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,200
From fixed assets to transactions,

21
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,390
they didn't do itemized liquidation.

22
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,210
It shows how chaotic the company was

23
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,610
while President Zhuang was seriously ill.

24
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,980
No.

25
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,430
I can't stand it. I'm going crazy.

26
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:50,950
Boss.

27
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,900
Although I play with digitals,

28
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,550
I play with computer digitals,

29
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,610
not these numbers.

30
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,940
How about this?

31
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,200
Kill me

32
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,090
to cheer you up.

33
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,990
How about this?

34
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,670
I'll ask some friends who deal with capital

35
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,430
to help you.

36
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,570
-They... -All of these are business secrets of LH Star.

37
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,740
The four of us

38
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,490
can't read all of these.

39
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,550
We don't need to do calculations

40
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,810
about all these lists.

41
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,800
We just need to find out

42
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,750
loopholes in bond covenants of these projects

43
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,680
or to mobilize the funds

44
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,240
to pay off the bank debts.

45
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,420
In this way, LH Star's bonds crisis

46
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,490
will be solved.

47
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,580
How much time do we have?

48
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,250
Three days.

49
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,140
10 a.m. Monday

50
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,470
is the deadline for repayment of Overseas Bank.

51
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,680
I don't mean anything else.

52
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,110
I saw your hand sprained today.

53
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,380
I'll apply some medicine for you.

54
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:43,909
I won't die.

55
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,220
Don't underestimate this sprain.

56
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,950
It takes 100 days or so to heal.

57
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,080
If you don't cure it,

58
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,140
it will become a chronic disease.

59
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,340
I have hundreds of

60
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,760
such injuries on my body.

61
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,050
Don't waste time.

62
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,590
Hundreds of?

63
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,170
What have you been through?

64
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,320
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

65
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,670
The most important thing now

66
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,280
is to find the loopholes of the bonds crisis

67
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,270
and to solve the problem within the group.

68
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,150
We have less than 40 hours left.

69
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,040
The one-way frozen amounts are from

70
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,030
Page 121 to Page 170.

71
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,210
The fixed assets are from

72
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,470
Page 85 to Page 110.

73
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,270
As for the previous projects,

74
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,220
they haven't finished calculating.

75
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,010
They've finished half.

76
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,220
Most of them are at the end of this list.

77
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,710
You can read financial statements?

78
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,260
No.

79
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,150
I just sorted them out in order.

80
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,240
I thought if there is a direction,

81
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,570
we can read them faster.

82
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,160
In the contract of overseas bonds,

83
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,850
I think you should pay attention to some things.

84
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,600
Which page are they on?

85
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,620
It should be on Page 139.

86
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,740
Let me help you.

87
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,710
Yes, it is here.

88
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,350
This is it.

89
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,210
This thing...

90
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,600
♫Tick-tock, the second hand goes♫

91
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,179

92

I said too much.

♫Every moment it turns♫

94
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,690

124
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,030
Did I miss it?

125
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,000
Or did boss do it too fast?

126
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,910
I just got a coffee.

127
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,110
Oh no.

128
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,530
I'm severely hurt by their PDA.

129
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,020
Boss is so good at it.

130
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,400
Isn't he known as

131
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,550
an eligible bachelor of all time?

132
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,830
It's only been a few days,

133
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,510
and he even had physical contact.

134
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:27,950
No.

135
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,790
He was the passive one.

136
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,110
You can't go in.

137
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,900
Why not?

138
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,670
What do you think?

139
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,020
Bachelors better not go in.

140
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,600
I told you not to go in.

141
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,660
Are you also dazzled by Boss's PDA?

142
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,420
Seriously.

143
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,500
He's really grown up.

144
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,300
What's with that look?

145
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,620
I can't finish it.

146
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,620
Yuan Shuai.

147
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,600
Where is he?

148
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,470
I searched the whole company but I couldn't find him.

149
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,150
Isn't he

150
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,000
working in our company?

151
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,870
I wanted to invite him

152
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,440
to be the model of the male lead in my comic.

153
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,830
Are we not going to meet each other

154
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,230
for the rest of our lives?

155
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,810
My male lead.

156
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,820
I need you.

157
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,230
Handsome guy.

158
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,170
Do you remember me?

159
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,900
The action I just did

160
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,150
doesn't mean I'm a strange person.

161
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,780
I...

162
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,770
I just wanted to ask you...

163
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,670
What are you doing?

164
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,230
We met in front of the meeting room last time.

165
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,760
I'm an intern in Secondary Design Studio.

166
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,600
I'm Rao Meina.

167
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,110
Well...

168
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,410
Are you working here too?

169
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,910
What's your name?

170
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,570
I wanted to tell you...

171
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,940
Yuan Shuai.

172
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,660
Stop!

173
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,940
Stop asking why.

174
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,780
I've been there and met him

175
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,350
and gave him 48 hours to contact me.

176
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:08,830
Look.

177
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,830
He ignores me.

178
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,720
Are you dissatisfied with him

179
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,450
or is he dissatisfied with you?

180
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,860
How dare he?

181
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,720
The people chasing your sister

182
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,610
can line up from the House of Tang to my studio, okay?

183
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,050
I went to see him for your sake.

184
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,770
Yes.

185
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,530
Thank you for your hard work.

186
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,560
Anyway,

187
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,310
Lin Mufan is quite capable.

188
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,520
All these years,

189
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,640
he is the first man who made my sister angry

190
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,700
to get even with me.

191
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,900
Brother.

192
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,710
I went to see him anyway.

193
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,490
It's obvious that

194
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,290
he doesn't want to leave LH Star.

195
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,970
Money and business marriage

196
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,670
are not appealing to him.

197
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,330
So I think

198
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,750
we should give up on this ignorant man.

199
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,560
Doesn't a man who ignores both money

200
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,820
and business marriage

201
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,930
seem more challenging?

202
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,190
When we hold

203
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,570
both him and LH Star in our hands,

204
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,860
do you think there'll be

205
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,320
any more opponent for Luminous?

206
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,590
Brother.

207
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,190
What do you mean?

208
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,050
You'll know then.

209
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,440
President.

210
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,930
Do you not like it?

211
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,820
The kids are not here.

212
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,900
I really have no appetite.

213
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,430
Mufan is busy with the next round of design.

214
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,040
Mr. Zhuang

215
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,860
went to meet his friend.

216
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,180
As for Missie and Mr. Yan...

217
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,040
Missie and Mr. Yan

218
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,880
are in the company,

219
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,030
sorting through the list of all overseas assets.

220
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,830
I heard

221
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,560
there are many itemized trades

222
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,640
that were not recorded clearly.

223
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,170
They need to reconsolidate and recalculate.

224
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,530
It takes a lot of time.

225
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,180
It must be hard for these kids.

226
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,460
When is the deadline of repayment

227
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,490
to Overseas Bank?

228
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,680
There're less than 40 hours left.

229
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,340
That is

230
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,240
the day after tomorrow.

231
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,080

I'm done.

234
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,140
My charity union will hold an event out of town tomorrow.

235
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,880
I have to go out for a few days.

236
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,990
You are still working on that unprofitable union?

237
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,270
Someone has to do it even if

238
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,599
it is hard and unprofitable.

239
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:06,930
Go ahead.

240
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,300

242

Ms. Zhuang and Mr. Yan,

243
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,930
the Legal Department just received

244
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,660
the latest repayment notice from Overseas Bank.

245
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,080
If we can't complete the repayment

246
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,810
before 10 a.m. tomorrow,

247
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,750
the bank will freeze all our fixed assets.

248
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,890
Then the issuance deposit will...

249
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,850
I found a way.

250
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,620
The Finance Department

251
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,670
immediately submits all major expenses of overseas companies' transactions

252
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,070
to the Legal Department.

253
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,550
The Operations Department

254
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,430
immediately compares the repayment dates and installment terms

255
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,630
in the bond contracts of Overseas Bank.

256
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,390
The Marketing Center re-accounts

257
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,450
the purchase and sale plan of LH Star.

258
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,500
And the financial manager

259
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,610
immediately reports to the president office

260
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,970
all money flow in the Group.

261
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,030
The Legal Department immediately applies to Overseas Banks

262
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,870
to investigate the bubble economy in large transactions.

263

Apply for installment repayment.

264
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,650
Redeploy large cash flows in the Group and

265
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,800
start emergency payment.

For books and poems

337
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,710
I've read,

338
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,000
I remember them longer and more clearly than others.

339
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,700
So this time,

340
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,180
I just read

341
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,930
all the list,

342
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,450
and remembered the money for overseas deals

343
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,080
and by comparing them,

344
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,040
I found the bubbles in the money.

345
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,980
As for the installment terms,

346
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,030
when I was in college,

347
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,070
I attended a lecture by a visiting finance professor,

348
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,030
so I went back to go through

349
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,860
the contract.

350
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,540
It's really not that I'm good at Economics.

351
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,060
I just have a good memory.

352
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,390
You did well.

353
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:40,990
Really?

354
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,500
Much better

355
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,410
than I expected.

356
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,990
Actually,

357
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,400
It is nothing.

358
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,610
I just wanted to help you

359
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,460
and the company

360
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,030
share the worries.

361
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,060
♫I've never felt lonely♫

362
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,120
♫Because of your company♫

363

365
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,610
♫Fate goes round and round♫

366
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,050
♫It turns into endless expectations♫

367
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,910
♫I think you'll like it♫

368
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,750
♫Plant petals under the sun♫

369
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,700
♫I'm attracted to you like this♫

00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,630

371

♫When you look at me♫

379
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,660
♫Meteor has crossed the most beautiful night sky♫

380
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,180

♫I've never felt lonely♫

382
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,550
Xinyan.

383
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,850
Grandpa.

384
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,710
Why are you up so early?

385
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,100
The company's affairs have been resolved,

386
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,910
so I slept well.

387
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,310
That's why I got up early.

388
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,570
I know.

389
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,010
Thank you.

390
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,160
Not at all.

391
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,260
You and Yan...

392
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,980
Yan Xingcheng?

393
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,340
Yes.

394
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,360
Your little fiance.

395
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,530
He is handsome

396
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,430
and has a good personality.

397
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,920
Aren't you going to get engaged and get married soon?

398
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,370
I'm waiting

399
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,140
to have a great-grandchild.

400
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,370
Grandpa,

401
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,470
you were talking about the company.

402
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,730
Why did you mention

403
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,940
about our engagement and marriage?

404
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,670
Alright, I won't talk about it.

405
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,320
Grandpa.

406
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,580
Where are you going? Let me take you there.

407
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,040
Okay.

408
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,240
Push me to the greenhouse.

409
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,640
Greenhouse?

410
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,760
Xinyan.

411
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,220
You were very young when you left home.

412
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,510
You don't remember

413
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,810
this beautiful greenhouse

414
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:19,090
was painted and decorated by your father.

415
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,420
It's so beautiful.

416
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,190
So this is the greenhouse.

417
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,580
The flowers here bloom on time.

418
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,620
They were planted by your mother.

419
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,830
This was the witness of your parents' love.

420
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,590
It's also the warmest

421
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,270
and most beautiful place of the House of Zhuang.

422
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,230
What a pity.

423
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:49,950
What a pity?

424
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,480
Help me to get down.

425
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,250
Watch out.

426
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,860
When your parents were here,

427
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,690
there were

428
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,420
various kinds of roses.

429
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,730
In summer,

430
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,430
the courtyard is full of fragrance.

431
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,940
Since your parents left,

432
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,940
the plants here

433
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,740
withered with them.

434
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,490
Here no longer grows a branch,

435
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,830
nor has a flower.

436
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,530
How could this happen?

437
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,470
Grandpa,

438
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,300
please leave the greenhouse to us.

439
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,240
To you?

440
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,830
You left the company to us,

441
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,270
we've handled such a serious

442
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,070
bonds crisis.

443
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,830
If you leave the greenhouse to us,

444
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,550
by the end of summer,

445
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,680
we will make this place full of flowers.

446
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,480
Good, good.

447
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,740
Yan Xingcheng.

448
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,900
Come and plant flowers with us.

449
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,310
Yan Xingcheng, don't go.

450
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,120
Wait.

451
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,270
Bye, grandpa.

452
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,690
Yan Xingcheng, wait.

453
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,490
-Slow down. Come on. -Stop!

454
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,510
Stop!

455
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,540
You can't catch me.

456
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,970
Mom, he's bullying me.

457
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,020
Come on!

458
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,720
Come and bully me if you dare!

459
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,570
What are you doing?

460
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,530
Are you just sitting here?

461
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,130
Or what?

462
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,520
Or what?

463
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,150
Here.

464
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:44,960
Here.

465
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,490
Here.

466
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,410
We have so many work to do.

467
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,410
We are all working.

468
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,070
Do you think it's appropriate

469
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,690
sitting here alone?

470
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,580
Of course.

471
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,710
Excuse me.

472
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,510
Since you're not working,

473
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,510
don't disturb us.

474
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,610
I need to work now.

475
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,030
You won't be able to grow any flower here.

476
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:58,990
I told you

477
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,280
you won't be able to grow any flower here.

478
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,770
What's wrong with you?

479
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,680
It's fine if you don't help.

480
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,140
You're sitting here comfortably,

481
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,680
and you're throwing cold water on us.

482
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,640
You didn't even do it.

483
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,780
How do you know that?

484
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,020
You didn't even plant it.

485
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,290
How do you know it can't bloom?

486
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,130
I just know.

487
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,580
What I know is that

488
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,050
as long as you work hard,

489
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,700
you'll be rewarded.

490
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,010
Mr. Yan.

491
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:47,940
How is it?

492
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,010
Would you help us now?

493
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,820
Or

494
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,430
you want to taste the fragrance of mud again?

495
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,280
What are you doing?

496
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,810
Yan Xingcheng, put me down!

497
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,010
Yan Xingcheng, put me down!

498
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,490
Put me down!

499
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,740
I was inspired by the fashion elements from Paris.

500
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,070
Say one more word and I'll throw you to bed.

501
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,250
♫I'll hug you like this♫

502

♫The ring finger means you and me♫

♫The ring finger means you and me♫

540
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:57,710

I'll show you

542
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,340
the new CEO

543
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,710
of LH Star.

544
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,720
Yan Xingcheng.

545
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,080
Today, at the company...

546
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,410
Ms. Zhuang.

547
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,030
Mr. Yan.

548
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,120
Bad news.

549
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,630
Mr. Tang, the CEO of Luminous Jewelry Group

550
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,870
who has been competing with us in the market,

551
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,200
is coming to our company

552
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,620
with his men.

553
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,380
Mr. Tang?

554
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,950
What's his purpose?

555
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,080
It seems that Mr. Tang brought

556
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,670
a patent certificate for design.

557
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,570
He said that the products

558
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,850
we just sent to the international jewelry exhibition

559
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,910
copied from their original designs.

560
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,630
He asked us to

561
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,990
recall all the products

562
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,920
and pay a huge compensation to their company.

563
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,510
Ms. Zhuang Xinyan.

564
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,260
No.

565
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,100
I should call you

566
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,500
the new President Zhuang.
