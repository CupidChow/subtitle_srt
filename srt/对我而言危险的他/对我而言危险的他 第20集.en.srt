[Episode 20]

4
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:25,880
Dad.

5
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,490
Are you serious?

6
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,250
In the accident of Yan Yi's parents,

7
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,039
is the truck driver's surname

8
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,050
Shen?

9
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,050
Yes.

10
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,940
Under the local police's mediation,

11
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,690
we reached a three-party agreement

12
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,289
with the transport company.

13
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,840
I signed the agreement.

14
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,680
I clearly remember

15
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,850
the opposite driver's name is

16
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,310
Shen Hongliang.

17
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,729
Shen… Shen Hongliang.

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,600
If I remember correctly,

19
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,580
he had a daughter

20
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,020
named Manning.

21
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,090
I really love

22
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,620
Manning.

23
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,480
But the more sincere I am,

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,290
the more desperate I am.

25
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,990
Let's stop here.

26
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,530
No.

27
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,579
You can't blame Manning.

28
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,570
17 years ago,

29
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,140
she was just about seven years old.

30
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,190
You can't ask her to bear the consequence

31
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,450
just because her parents made a mistake.

32
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,130
So,

33
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,500
did you really do it?

34
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,680
I...

35
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,079
I just wanted to be

36
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,990
a qualified man

37
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,510
to save my sick wife.

38
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,350
But I didn't expect

39
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,190
her medical expenses

40
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,790
would be such a huge expense.

41
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,020
Her illness

42
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,690
can only go to the best specialized hospital

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,690
and get the best doctor for surgery.

44
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,370
That's why

45
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,450
I went abroad.

46
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,290
They told me

47
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,410
a friend from China

48
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,579
wanted to cheat a foreign insurance company.

49
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,470
They said that

50
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,420
I just need to drive a truck to collide the car.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,460
Then they would help me find the best doctor.

52
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,800
That day,

53
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,690
I drove

54
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,460
to follow the car for about three hours.

55
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,960
I thought

56
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,810
I just deceived the insurance company abroad.

57
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,250
I made up my mind

58
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,720
at a big turn.

59
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,950
So you hit them.

60
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,490
No.

61
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,410
I didn't.

62
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,550
I didn't.

63
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,150
I didn't know there was a family in the car.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,910
Calm down.

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,709
If you want to hate,

66
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,860
it's enough to hate me.

67
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,529
If you want to have a bone to pick,

68
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,790
just take it up with me.

69
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,790
Please don't hurt Manning.

70
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,840
Xingcheng.

71
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,070
Dad.

72
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,230
What's wrong?

73
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,690
What happened?

74
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,170
I'll go take a look.

75
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,300
Manning.

76
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,320
Yan Xingcheng.

77
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,640
What's wrong with you, Yan Xingcheng?

78
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,090
Turn around. Look at me.

79
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,180
What happened between you and dad?

80
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,540
Tell me what happened.

81

We'll solve it together.

82

Don't worry.

I won't give up on our relationship...

85

Let's break up.

86
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,770
What did you say?

87
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,030
I said let's break up.

88
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,570
Yan Xingcheng,

89
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,380
Are you testing me?

90
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,380
Do you want to test who I will choose

91
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,540
between you and dad?

92
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,840
It doesn't need to be tested.

93
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,450
I can give you an answer now.

94
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,550
Why?

95
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,130
You have to give me a reason.

96
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,110
I want a reasonable reason.

97
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,159
You can't prevaricate or lie.

98

Let alone saying you love someone else.

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,100
♫Calling me. How I wish it was you calling me♫

175
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:28,450
♫Shout out to set me free♫

176
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,720
♫You love me♫

177
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,070
Hello.

178
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,410
Hello, boss.

179
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,630
Where are you now?

180
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:44,930
The beach.

181
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,210
Boss.

182
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,820
What's wrong with your voice?

183
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,800
Did something happen?

184
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,930
What is it? Just say.

185
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,710
It's not a good thing.

186
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,040
Zhuang Jiakai and Yang

187
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,090
brought many people back to LH Star Group.

188
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,610
And the group system suddenly notified

189
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,230
the equity confirmation meeting was rescheduled to tonight.

190
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,710
The majority of shareholders confirmed their attendance.

191
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,700
They should be on their way.

192
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,140
Boss,

193
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,080
Zhuang Jiakai dared to advance the meeting.

194
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,720
I'm afraid

195
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,810
he has more than one card in his hands.

196
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:07,560
Got it.

197
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,000
How about this, boss?

198
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,130
Can you make it back?

199
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,000
I'll go to the House of Zhuang first

200
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
to invite President Zhuang.

201
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,890
Because of his action,

202
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,180
I'm afraid it's not just about the equity confirmation.

203
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,800
It's just Zhuang Jiakai.

204
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,620
Grandpa doesn't need to show up.

205
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,800
-But Boss, Zhuang... -You and Yuan Shuai

206
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,570
don't need to attend the meeting tonight.

207
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,570
Without my order,

208
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,190
you can't enter LH Star.

209
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,930
-Why? -Listen to me.

210
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,720
They came prepared.

211
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,270
I need you

212
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,840
prepare for warning and plan B outside.

213
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,640
Tell Yuanshuai not to act rashly.

214
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,810
In the private meeting,

215
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,140
anything could happen.

216
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,660
I'll face them.

217
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,270
Okay.

218
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,110
Fang Xiang.

219
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,380
Call Rao Meina

220
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,340
and ask her to go back to accompany Manning.

221
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,250
Shen Manning?

222
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,150
What's wrong with her?

223
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,090
Let me ask you.

224
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,820
Did you do something to these flowers?

225
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:17,830
Flowers?

226
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,060
Are you talking about

227
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,100
my works?

228
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,730
So...

229
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,870
It turns out

230
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,790
all these years of non-flowering

231
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,900
is all your work.

232
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,480
I think

233
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,640
you think too much.

234
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,270
The soil in the greenhouse is added with something.

235
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,470
I'm afraid it won't be able to grow any grass.

236
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,220
How could you...

237
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,150
Hit me!

238
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,510
Hit me!

239
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,170
Just like when I was a kid,

240
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,850
you made my face swollen

241
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,250
and locked me in the greenhouse.

242
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,380
This vicious place

243
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,830
will never bloom.

244
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,560
Zhuang Caixuan.

245
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,730
Why did you do that?

246
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,500
Why did you destroy the greenhouse?

247
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,880
Why did you destroy the House of Zhuang?

248
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,230
Who in the House of Zhuang has done you wrong?

249
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,430
What has the House of Zhuang done to you?

250
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,569
Why?

251
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,260
Why do you always hurt others?

252
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,480
Dad.

253
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,050
I call you dad

254
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,790
because you are

255
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,070
my biological father.

256
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,130
Otherwise,

257
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,250
the House of Zhuang,

258
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,250
and everyone in the House of Zhuang,

259
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,690
who act worthy of me?

260
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,360
Who?

261
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,890
Please review

262
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,810
this report word for word.

263
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,280
Why has everyone stopped?

264
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,850
Do you have any objections

265
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,680
to the amount of your own shares?

266
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,430
If anyone objects,

267
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,580
I can confirm them for you in person.

268
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,120
Don't worry.

269
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,750
There will be no less,

270
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,050
and no more.

271
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,130
Move!

272
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:19,960
If I don't,

273
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,840
what can you do to me?

274
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,590
Today is the private meeting

275
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,140
of equity confirmation of LH Star.

276
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,190
The one who holds the largest amount of shares

277
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,410
will be the final owner of LH Star.

278
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
And this position

279
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,260
will belong to him.

280
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,670
Do you think you are qualified to sit here?

281
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,370
Are you qualified

282
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,140
with such a small share

283
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,320
of you and your father?

284
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,070
Stop kidding.

285
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,840
A damn thing made by grandpa.

286
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,860
What can it prove?

287
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,050
My mother has it too.

288
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,380
Miss Zhuang Meixuan's personal seal.

289
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,180
Did it disappear many years ago?

290
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,130
This seal can determine

291
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,260
the large amount of shares of Ms. Zhuang Meixuan, right?

292
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,820
With the seal and Mr. Yan's identity,

293
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,270
the shares of Blue Sea...

294
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,140
This seal

295
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,070
represents all the shares of my mother

296
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,170
in LH Star Group.

297
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,230
Now I have the seal.

298
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:05,860
So,

299
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,700
who is the real owner

300
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,810
of LH Star?

301
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,870
You're really my wise cousin.

302
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,800
You even found

303
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,090
the personal seal of my Auntie Zhuang Meixuan,

304
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,620
which was lost 17 years ago.

305
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,190
I really want to thank my cousin.

306
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,530
Thank him

307
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,280
for confirming the major equity of LH Star

308
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,350
and helped the whole group

309
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,930
eliminate the controversy of all rights.

310
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,380
However,

311
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:44,790
do you really think

312
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,030
with this seal,

313
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,720
you'll get

314
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,280
the full amount of the large shares of LH Star?

315
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:53,730
What a pity.

316
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:56,890
Cousin.

317
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
This seal

318
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,990
is invalid.

319
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,360
Isn't this nonsense?

320
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,870
Right?

321
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,970
Come on.

322
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,590
Cousin.

323
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,870
Please read

324
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,490
this document carefully.

325
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,100
Four hours ago, Overseas Police

326
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,360
officially announced that 17 years ago,

327
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,380
the Chinese woman, Zhuang Meixuan who fell into the sea

328
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,820
in the costal bus accident,

329
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,650
has been missing for too long,

330
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,010
and the case prosecute period has expired.

331
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:41,520
So,

332
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,110
Zhuang Meixuan died.

333
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:46,590
What?

334
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,620
You're so calm

335
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,370
after hearing your mother's death.

336
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,420
Should I applaud you,

337
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,300
my dear cousin?

338
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,160
It's not a matter of who is owing who.

339
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,280
This is the House of Zhuang.

340
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,920
We are a family.

341
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,010
I thought I heard it wrong.

342
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,930
After so many years,

343
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,780
in your eyes,

344
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,810
I'm a family.

345
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Caixuan.

346
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,270
Thank you.

347
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,920
We don't have to be a family.

348
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,750
Zhuang Caixuan.

349
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,730
I brought you back from your mother.

350
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,380
You're a member of the House of Zhuang.

351
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,680
No one is against you

352
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,050
or hurt you.

353
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,960
Don't always put yourself

354
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,330
against everyone.

355
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,120
Now,

356
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,760
you're doing charity

357
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,420
and promoting kindness and love outside.

358
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,410
Can you share more kindness with your family?

359
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,370
Can you take love to the House of Zhuang?

360
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,450
You even mentioned charity

361
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,930
and doing public service?

362
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,450
Why did I leave the House of Zhuang?

363
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,510
Why did I never step into LH Star Group?

364
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,450
Why did I hold

365
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,480
the Charity Union that no one cares?

366
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,020
Dad.

367
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,840
Do you really not know?

368
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,580
I was forced by you.

369
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,380
Do you think

370
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,800
I don't want to work in LH Star?

371
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,880
Do you think I don't want to compete with Meixuan?

372
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,230
Am I really worse than her?

373
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,740
But do I dare?

374
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,840
Do I dare to step into LH Star?

375
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,710
I didn't let you work in LH Star Group

376
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,130
because...

377
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,210
That's because...

378
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,030
Because you want to leave the whole LH Star Group

379
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,830
and the House of Zhuang to her.

380
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:57,840
No.

381
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,370
No.

382
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,230
Don't deny it.

383
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,190
In your heart,

384
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,440
are there Jiakai and me?

385
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,180
Never.

386
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,120
You only care about Meixuan.

387
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,460
Even today,

388
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,240
even though Meixuan's daughter died,

389
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,890
you still wanted Yan Xingcheng to come home.

390
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,710
Why?

391
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,130
Why?

392
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,180
Why did he take everything from LH Star?

393
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,060
How can he make people believe

394
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,760
that he is your grandson?

395
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,420
Dad.

396
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,300
Well.

397
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,350
Shen.

398
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,630
Shen, what are you doing?

399
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,840
Manning.

400
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,470
Where are you going?

401
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,340
Can't you sit down and explain?

402
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,340
Huixin.

403
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,210
Over the years,

404
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:41,990
Manning and I

405
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,170
are sorry for you.

406
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,940
From now on,

407
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,190
live a good life with Meina.

408
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,220
Just...

409
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,050
Just forget about us.

410
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,690
Why did you say that?

411
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,790
Shen.

412
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,810
Shen!

413
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:06,840
Manning.

414
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,980
Can't you wait until Meina comes back?

415
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,070
I'm sorry, aunt.

416
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,560
You...

417
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,320
Aunt.

418
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,590
Please apologize to Meina for me.

419
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,980
Goodbye, aunt.

420
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,610
Manning.

421
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,310
Let's go, sir.

422
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,200
What's going on?

423
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,100
I'm going to call Meina.

424
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
I want to call her.

425
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,780
I'll go upstairs to find Manning.

426
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,090
Then I'll be right back.

427
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,350
I'll wait for you here.

428
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:20,500
Manning.

429
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:21,930
Manning.

430
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,490
I'm Lin Mufan.

431
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,400
I need to talk to you urgently.

432
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,170
Manning.

433
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,450
Anyone there?

434
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,130
Shen Manning.

435
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,590
Are you here for Maning?

436
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,400
What happened?

437
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,620
She and her father have packed their luggage.

438
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,670
They just left.

439
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,580
What?

440
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,590
Hello, brother. What's up?

441
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,240
Linlin, where are you?

442
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,880
I'm in front of Shen Manning's house.

443
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,500
Why are you going to the Shen Family?

444
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,360
Come back soon.

445
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,990
I came with Mufan to find Manning.

446
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,490
He said he wanted to see her.

447
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,050
What's wrong?

448
00:28:59,050 --> 00:28:59,910
What happened?

449
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,100
This time, it's a big deal.

450
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,840
The House of Zhuang

451
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:04,830
is screwed.

452
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,550
This official statement from police

453
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,130
has confirmed all the shares under your mother's name

454
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,050
can't be misappropriated without permission

455
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,070
because of this personal seal.

456
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,300
Besides,

457
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,400
due to the case of Zhuang Xinyan of dubious background,

458
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,600
the House of Zhuang is still suspicious of your identity.

459
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,840
This means

460
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,840
you

461
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,670
have no right

462
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,390
to appear in LH Star.

463
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,120
Yan Xingcheng.

464
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:52,900
Yan Yi.

465
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,680
Yan Yi!

466
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,690
Do it!

467
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,510
I want to see

468
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,100
if you dare to do it in front of so many people.

469
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,760
Do you dare?

470
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,400
Come on.

471
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,220
Come on.

472
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,130
President Zhuang?

473
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,780
What's wrong with President Zhuang?

474
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,330
Dying?

475
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,300
Turn off the equipment.

476
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,220
What are you doing?

477
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,520
Sir,

478
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
please calm down.

479
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,430
Why didn't you save him?

480
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,600
Please calm down.

481
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Please calm down.

482
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,010
Why did you withdraw the equipment?

483
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:43,510
Calm down.

484
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,660
What happened to my grandpa?

485
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,130
What happened to my grandpa?

486
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,290
Sir, calm down.

487
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,910
What happened to my grandpa?

488
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,440
He has a large area of myocardial infarction,

489
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,620
intracranial bleeding

490
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,280
and trauma.

491
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,630
It's too late.

492
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,260
Why?

493
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:00,870
Send him to the hospital.

494
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,520
President can't be moved anymore. -Send him to the hospital.

495
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,020
Yan Yi!

496
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,050
Yan Yi!

497
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,340
Calm down.

498
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,930
Grandpa is fine.

499
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,200
He is fine.

500
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,810
He is dying.

501
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,850
What are you talking about, Uncle Guangyi?

502
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,180
My grandpa will be fine.

503
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,320
Doctor, please.

504
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,220
Please save him.

505
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,680
I beg you. Please save him.

506
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,760
-Doctor. -Yan Yi.

507
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,150
Sir.

508
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,870
Calm down.

509
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,740
Calm down.

510
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,670
It's too late.

511
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,630
We can.

512
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,650
I said we can save him.

513
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,450
Enough.

514
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,110
One will die eventually.

515
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,410
If you keep doing this,

516
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,960
it won't help.

517
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,150
Auntie, what do you mean?

518
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,600
Because

519
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,350
you are not qualified to stay in this house

520
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,680
or

521
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,780
to stay in the House of Zhuang and LH Star, fastly.

522
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,560
What do you want to say?

523
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,900
Just say it.

524
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,280
You are not the person of the House of Zhuang.

525
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,630
What did you say?

526
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,080
Say it again.

527
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,290
Do you think you're the son of Ms. Zhuang Meixuan

528
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,730
and Yan Yi?

529
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:06,870
Maybe

530
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,900
you are an illegitimate son

531
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,530
of Yan Yi and another woman?

532
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,430
Manning.

533
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,710
I have something important

534
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,180
to tell you.
