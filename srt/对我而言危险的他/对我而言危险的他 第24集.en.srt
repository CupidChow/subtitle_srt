00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,310
Do you think

5
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,300
I'm afraid of what you did?

6
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,150
This oil painting

7
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,990
is a wall in your heart.

8
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,430
You hid yourself behind this wall

9
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,440
and peeped at everyone in the House of Zhuang.

10
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,260
And you used it

11
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,150
to suppress me.

12
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,160
You knew I had deep sea phobia.

13
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,440
You also knew my parents' car accident.

14
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,590
You clearly knew

15
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,820
that accident

16
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,480
was caused by you.

17
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,760
You not only made up evidence for my son,

18
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,060
but also wanted to drag me into this,

19
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,630
and blamed me

20
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,410
for your parents' death.

21
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,860

Do you have the data

from the overseas police 17 years ago?

25
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,870
There's nothing.

26
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,370
How dare you make irresponsible remarks

27
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,040
and accuse your elder.

28
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,470

Of course not.

33
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,950
Once everything is done,

34
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,640
you should leave immediately.

35
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,970
Don't stop for a second.

36
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,950
Aren't...

37
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,060
Aren't we going to apply for insurance?

38
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,390
But if I leave like this,

39
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,860
it would be a hit-and-run.

40
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,210
Shut up.

41
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,010
Do what you should do.

42
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,790
Or if anything happens,

43
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,440
it will be all your fault.

What if Zhuang Xinyan's car accident

55

It's also the last letter.

I've left you 17 years.

81
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,130
I always thought

82
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,650
you could come to me

83
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,180
and admit your mistakes.

84
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,520
But I didn't expect

85
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,880
after 17 years,

86
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,340
I still haven't

87
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,530
waited for you to wake up.

Caixuan.

89
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,780
Admit your mistake.

90
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,950
Admit that

91
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,670
you were jealous of your sister's ability

92
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,740
and your sister's family's happiness.

93
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,010
That's why you followed them abroad.

94
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,510
At the most inappropriate time,

95
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,280
pushed their family

96
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,230
into the sea.

97

Uncle Lin and I

98
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,950
knew the truth back then.

99
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,559
You thought you did a perfect job.

100
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,270
But,

101
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,020
don't forget that

102
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,419
I'm your father.

103
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,570
How can I not know what you're thinking?

104
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,410
How can I not know

105
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,850
your jealousy,

106
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,830
anger and hatred

107
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,040
of your sister's family.

108
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,600
Hatred

109
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,150
is not the reason to kill.

110
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,220
You hurt your sister,

111
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,870
causing Xingcheng to wander about destitute.

112
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,300
You made Xinyan lose her parents.

113
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,170
But...

114
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,780
But...

115
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,380
I've already lost a daughter.

116
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,830
I can't lose you,

117
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,320
the youngest child in my family.

118
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,190
So,

119
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,050
I hid everything

120
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,490
against my will.

121
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,230
For 17 years,

122
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,040
I've been supporting the House of Zhuang

123
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,000
and hiding this big secret for you.

124
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,490
Lin and I

125
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,740
prayed that you could wake up soon.

126
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,940
But I was wrong.

127
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,420
Not only did I not get your confession,

128
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,350
but I helped you get worse.

129
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,180
You not only hurt Xinyan,

130
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,420
but also targeted Xingcheng who came back.

131
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,240
Caixuan.

132
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,530
Shut up!

133
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,960
Shut up!

134
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,910
Even if

135
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,470
I treated you harshly when you were young,

136
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,440
but the House of Zhuang has been treating you as family.

137
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,060
Why did you do that?

138
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,680
Why must you destroy the House of Zhuang?

139
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,350
Does it make you satisfied?

140
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,710
Caixuan.

141
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,060
Turn around.

142
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,990
Turn around.

143
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,240
No.

144
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,510
You have no idea what I'm doing.

145
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,300
You don't even know about the reason why I did that.

146
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,590
It was...

147
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,110
It was you.

148
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,560
It was all your fault.

149
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:16,970
You...

150
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,040
You don't deserve to be my father.

151
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,920
You don't deserve it.

152
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,560
Do you want to know the truth?

153
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,910
You want to know the truth, right?

154
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
I did it.

155
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,080
I did it.

156
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,610
I did it.

157
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,470
The car accident 17 years ago

158
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,080
and Zhuang Xinyan's death

159
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,490
were all done by me.

160
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,060
So what?

161
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,150
Caixuan.

162
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,720
I don't want this House of Zhuang.

163
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,030
I want

164
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,880
all the people here

165

I hate the House of Zhuang!

168
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,930
Mom! Mom!

169
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:57,950
Go away!

Mom! Mom!

171
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:06,930
Xingcheng.

172
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,210
Mufan.

173
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,040
Go home now.

174
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,510
Also,

175
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,740
call the police.

176
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,710
Ms. Meixuan.

177
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,620
Don't move. Caixuan, I'll do it.

178
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,880
-No need. -Don't move.

179
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,890
-Let me. -Let me.

180
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,340
Don't hurt your hand.

181
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:53,740
Are you okay?

182
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,500
I'm fine.

183
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,790
What happened?

184
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,270
I didn't mean it.

185
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,490
Why are you so stupid?

186
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,990
Go!

187
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,160
Go!

188
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,710
You all deserve to die!

189
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,750
You...

190
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,520
Why did you grow flowers?

191
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,610
Who told you to grow?

192
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,760
You deserve to die!

193
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,080
I hate you.

194
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,010
Mufan.

195
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,130
Dad, I'm back.

196
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,610
Is everything okay at home?

197
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,240
It's a mess.

198
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,840
There is no turning back.

199
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,230
Did you call the police?

200
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,100
I did as you said.

201
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,140
Also,

202
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,640
Tang Lin's brother

203
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,980
found someone for us.

204
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,180
I think you must be surprised.

205
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,740
A person?

206
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes.

207
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,900
My brother spent a lot of manpower and resources

208
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,700
finding

209
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,730
the person in charge of the overseas incident.

210
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,190
And through these people,

211
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,450
we reorganized the whole story.

212
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,840
Among these fragmentary clues,

213
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,190
we found a woman

214
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,210
who was rescued by the locals

215
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,940
like Yan Xingcheng.

216
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,050
But she didn't have ID card

217
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,490
and was unconscious,

218
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,710
so she was sent to a welfare institution.

219
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,010
Due to the international repatriation a few years ago,

220
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,320
we were able to

221
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,270
find her

222
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,040
in an unknown nursing home across several cities.

223
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,890
Ms. Meixuan?

224
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,580
Ms. Meixuan!

225
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,510
Stop!

226
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,620
That's flowers we just planted.

227
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,140
You all deserve to die.

228
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,320
Why did you come back?

229
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,910
Why did you come back?

230
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,000
Why didn't I

231
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,060
-kill you? -Xingcheng.

232
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,150
-Stop! -Manning!

233
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,280
Don't come near me!

234
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,750
Don't touch her!

235
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,380
Let go!

236
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,550
If you come any closer, I'll kill her.

237
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,400
Calm down.

238
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,500
Calm down.

239
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,700
Don't do this.

240
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,910
I want you to die!

241
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,000
I want all of you to die!

242
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,120
Auntie.

243
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,330
Calm down.

244
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,480
You're targeting me.

245
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,990
I'm the one you want to kill.

246
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,820
Let her go!

247
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,290
Take it up with me.

248
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,930
As long as you let her go,

249
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,730
my life will be yours.

250
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,120
Stop acting like you love each other so much.

251
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,970
I hate you.

252
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,330
I hate you for being hypocritical.

253
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,170
There is no love in this world.

254
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,750
There is only hatred.

255
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,850
I'll kill her first

256
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,200
before I kill you.

257
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,490
Caixuan!

258
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,240
Zhuang... Zhuang Meixuan.

259
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:42,840
Caixuan.

260
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,890
Why did you fall down?

261
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,680
Come.

262
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,080
Get up.

263
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,340
It's okay.

264
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,540
I'll talk to Dad for you.

265
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,290
He won't blame you for breaking his glass

266
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,050
or blame you for failing the exam.

267
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,890
Impossible.

268
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,660
Caixuan.

269
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,980
Look at you.

270
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,340
You're dirty.

271
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,450
Didn't I tell you

272
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,770
as long as you stay at home,

273
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,880
no one will bully you.

274
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,840
No.

275
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,420
Haven't you already...

276
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,690
Dad will protect you.

277
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,780
I will protect you too.

278
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,910
Come.

279
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,600
Let me help you up.

280
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:31,950
Come.

281
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,920
You've already...

282
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,060
What?

283
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,820
Did you do something wrong?

284
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,600
Don't be afraid.

285
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,550
No one will blame you.

286
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,650
After all you are my closest sister.

287
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,390
I know

288
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,950
you've been resenting that

289
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,710
why dad gave birth to you with your mother outside,

290
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,840
but he brought you back to the House of Zhuang alone.

291
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,180
You blamed dad for teaching me

292
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,410
how to run a company

293
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,830
but puting you out of the picture.

294
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,220
Caixuan,

295
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,120
why didn't you tell me

296
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,080
you have so many dissatisfaction?

297
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,650
If you tell me,

298
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,710
I'll tell you that

299
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,190
actually, dad have already prepared everything for you

300
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,830
and founded a new company for you.

301
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,580
In his heart,

302
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,610
you've always been his beloved little daughter.

303
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,970
I also treat you as my beloved sister.

304
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,130
You're the one I should cherish.

305
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,710
No.

306
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,820
Impossible.

307
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,840
You're all lying to me.

308
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,280
You never treated me as your family.

309
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,940
You're lying to me.

310
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,440
You are lying to me.

311
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,080
-Xingcheng. -You're lying to me.

312
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,060
Caixuan.

313
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,670
It's OK.

314
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,190
Let go of me!

315
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:06,870
Don't be afraid, Caixuan.

316
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,680
-No! Go away! Go away! -Caixuan.

317
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,460
Caixuan, don't be afraid. I'm here.

318
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,310
I'm here.

319
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,280
Go away.

320
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,550
I'm here, Caixuan. I'm here.

321
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,380
Let go of me!

322
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:19,600
Caixuan.

323
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,120
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

324
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,620
I didn't lie to you.

325
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,330
Neither did Dad.

326
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,310
It has always been with you that the House of Zhuang is complete.

327
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,980
With you,

328
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,420
the House of Zhuang can be a complete home.

329
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,950
Sister.

330
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,950
Sister.

331
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,420
We are a family.

332
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,840
-We're family. -Yes.

333
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:22,880
Don't cry.

334
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,920
CEO,

335
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,500
I need to confirm with you

336
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,330
the details of

337
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,350
the establishment ceremony of LX United Group

338
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,580
and the press conference.

339
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,310
Give it to me.

340
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,130
Excuse me,

341
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,140
are you the CEO of Celine Fashion Studio,

342
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,970
Miss Tang Lin?

343
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,070
Are you kidding me again?

344
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,990
Are you Miss Tang?

345
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,360
My father, Lin Guangyi, and your brother,

346
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:30,980
Mr. Tang Qi

347
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,680
invited me to meet you.

348
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:39,940
Hello.

349
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,140
Mr. Lin Mufan.

350
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,390
I'm Tang Lin.

351
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,330
Nice

352
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:45,890
to meet you.

353
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,230
After my comic, Legends of Wolf King,

354
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,090
went online on the platform,

355
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,430
it reached 1,000,000 hits

356
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,150
in ten days.

357
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,830
The editor-in-chief of the comic department

358
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,020
called me in the morning

359
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,720
to sign me, a legendary author

360
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,990
Rao Meina,

361
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,450
at a record-breaking price.

362
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,920
I am going to become

363
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,670
an outstanding figure in the comic industry.

364
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,270
In the end,

365
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,710
you just answered "huh".

366
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,090
OK.

367
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,630
Meina is the best.

368
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,370
You're too insincere.

369
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,470
Here.

370
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,180
Open your mouth.

371
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,140
Listen,

372
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
don't try to please me in this way.

373
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,310
My dream is...

374
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,640
Let's eat first.

375
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,800
Otherwise,

376
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,130
you'll choke again.

377
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,540
You've got sauce on your lips.

378
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,440
Let me see.

379
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,940
Is this your next work?

380
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,510
I understand the male lead very well.

381
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,980
But he is...

382
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Listen to me.

383
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,540
You're not a wolf this time.

384
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,290
You're a heroine who is actually a man and dresses as a woman

385
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,490
to break into the enemy's camp bravely.

386
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:08,980
Rao Meina.

387
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,960
Don't you like it?

388
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,690
♫I'll hug you like this♫

389

♫And kiss you like this♫

390

You won't be angry after I kiss you, right?

391
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,060
♫I'll cooperate with your willfulness♫

392
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,630
My heroine.

393
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,360
Nana.

394
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,780
♫I want to watch shooting stars with you♫

395
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,210
Wait for me, Nana.

396
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,110
Let me send you home.

397

♫I want to learn the secret of love with you♫

♫The ring finger means you and me♫

400

Xingcheng, come here.

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,020
What's wrong?

414
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,830
Look.

415
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,290

432

Xingcheng.

433
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,450
I seem to have had

434
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,630
a long dream.

435
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,570
There were difficulties

436
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,120
and pains,

437
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,340
but also melancholy and sweetness

438
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,270
It's not just your dream.

439
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,900
It's also been a long dream of mine for 17 years.

440
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,700
Can you let it go now?

441
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,360
Those pains,

442
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,890
and the past

443
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,620
are gone.

444
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,700
I don't have to live in the nightmare of fear anymore.

445
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,450
And I don't have to remember

446
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,590
the rainy night.

447
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,990
Now, I just

448
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,530
want to protect and cherish everything around me,

449
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,540
my family,

450
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:37,690
my lover

451
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,170
the one who loves me and the one I love.

452
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,760
I feel the same way as you.

453
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,390
I also want to cherish

454
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,710
everyone around me,

455
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,890
cherish every second of my life.

456
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,860
No matter what hardships and trials

457
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,050
we may encounter in the future,

458
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,790
as long as you're by my side,

459
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,050
everything is worth it.

460
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,409
Xingcheng,

461
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,780
I love you

462
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,730
♫Tick-tock, the second hand goes♫

463
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,739
♫Every moment it turns♫

464
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,260
I love you too.

465
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,429
♫Right now♫

466
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,130
♫How are you doing?♫

467
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,739
♫I always think about you♫

468
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,389
♫When I wake up from my dreams♫

469
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,790
♫All stubbornness♫

470
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:56,230
♫Broke down in an instant♫

471
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,710
♫If I give up everything♫

472
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,520
♫And take the risk♫

473
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:08,600
♫Will you come back to me♫

474
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:13,030
♫And go back to the beginning of the story?♫

475
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,150
♫If I'm brave♫

476
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,090
♫Maybe in the parallel world♫

477
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,680
♫My tomorrow♫

478
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,550
♫It is connected with you again♫

479
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,570
♫We are♫

480
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:39,090
♫No longer like parallel lines♫
