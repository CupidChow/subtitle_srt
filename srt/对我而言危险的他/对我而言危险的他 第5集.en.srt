[Episode 5]

4
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,260
It's a bit late today.

5
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,140
Let's talk

6
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,310
tomorrow.

7
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:38,490
Let's live together.

8
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,930
I will live with you

9
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,140
in this room.

10
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,890
24 hours,

11
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,759
we'll be together.

12
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,190
24 hours?

13
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,810
Why?

14
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,560
You are the only heir to LH Star and the House of Zhuang now.

15
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,960
You must have someone by your side 24 hours a day

16
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
to protect and confirm your safety.

17
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,710
Also,

18
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,740
there will be a shareholders meeting next week for LH Star.

19
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,070
You need to have some industry knowledge,

20
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,640
in case you make mistakes

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,210
in front of so many people again.

22
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,870
I...I was careless that time.

23
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,730
Why do you remember it for so long?

24
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,120
And how can we live together?

25
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,190
Why not?

26
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,980
There's only one bed.

27
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,579
You can sleep on the sofa,

28
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,400
in the bathtub, dressing room or

29
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,690
on the carpet.

30
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,910
You want me to sleep on the carpet?

31
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,490
Otherwise,

32
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,560
do you want to sleep with me?

33
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,320
W-who wants to sleep with you?

34
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,550
Why not?

35
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,170
We're engaged anyway.

36
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,300
Who said that?

37
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,470
We didn't have an engagement ceremony.

38
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,110
Are you reminding me that

39
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,100
I should ask the House of Zhuang

40
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,170
to have an engagement ceremony with you right away?

41
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,040
No, I'm not.

42
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,829
Sorry, boss.

43
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,130
Sorry to bother you.

44
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,930
But it's okay.

45
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,150
You can ignore me.

46
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,230
Go on.

47
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,540
W-what are you doing?

48
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,270
Helping my boss move.

49
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:03,820
M...

50
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,040
Move?

51
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,160
From now on,

52
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,150
don't let the sun go down on your anger as a couple.

53
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,160
Missie,

54
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,200
be tough on our boss.

55
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,140
He never complains about...

56
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,130
hurt.

57
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,780
Bye, boss.

58
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Good night, boss.

59
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,220
You must remember

60
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,530
all the business affairs of LH Star clearly too.

61
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
But don't worry.

62
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,810
I'll help you.

63
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,700
I won't let anything go wrong

64
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,440
during the shareholders meeting next week.

65
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,310
Besides,

66
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,530
you can live according to the rhythm of your life.

67
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,770
Don't worry about me.

68
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,470
Are...

69
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,780
Are you sleeping here?

70
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,680
I...I didn't mean anything else.

71
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,200
I...I mean...

72
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,690
I don't sleep much.

73
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,140
Don't worry about me.

74
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,800
Go to sleep.

75
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,290
Are you reminding me that

76
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,830
I should ask the House of Zhuang

77
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,140
to have an engagement ceremony with you right away?

78

♫I've never felt lonely♫

79
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,810

117
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,800
Yan Xingcheng.

118
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,200
What's wrong, Yan Xingcheng?

119
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,640
Water, water.

120
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,580
Yan Xingcheng, can you hear me?

121
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,260
Water, water, water.

122
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,770
Yan Xingcheng.

123
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,780
Don't come near me

124
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,160
when I am asleep.

125
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,580
An old friend's sister.

126
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,520
Arrange time to meet her.

127
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,690
It is not only for yourself,

128
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,490
but also for LH Star

129
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,770
and your deceased mother.

130
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:52,550
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,930
I think I mistook you for someone else.

132
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,190
You were not mistaken.

133
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,900
Your father's friend

134
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,290
is my brother.

135
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,890
I'm sorry.

136
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,280
I thought...

137
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,940
You thought I followed you into your life

138
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,700
since our cooperation didn't work out last time.

139
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,350
When my brother mentioned you,

140
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,930
he said you were good at socializing.

141
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,630
It seems to be true.

142
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:37,900
But...

143
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:38,960
I refuse.

144
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,490
You're not my type.

145
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,820
I have no intention

146
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,180
to fall in love with you.

147
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,510
So no matter how we spend time together,

148
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,630
we can never be together.

149
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,240
You rejected me last time.

150
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,130
So this time,

151
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,070
I said it first.

152
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,790
Good.

153
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,430
I had no intention either.

154
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,630
I'll get going first then.

155
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,110
But the rejection in life

156
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,270
doesn't mean you're rejected at work.

157
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:03,580
Mr. Lin,

158
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,740
my fashion studio and I

159
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,720
are still interested in your jewelry design.

160
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,480
If possible,

161
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,580
I hope you can leave Ocean Star

162
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,840
and cooperate with me.

163
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,050
I thought

164
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,270
I told you very clearly last time.

165
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,050
That was the last time.

166
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,510
The situation is different this time.

167
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,800
As far as I know,

168
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,290
LH Star is now in an overseas crisis.

169
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,670
It is still hard to say if the new Miss Zhuang

170
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,420
can control the whole LH Star Group,

171
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,660
would she have the energy to support your design?

172
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,780
Mr. Lin,

173
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,690
your goal is not just this small LH Star Group,

174
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,610
but an international award in the design industry, right?

175
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,810
LH Star cannot give it to you now.

176
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,200
It is only me can.

177
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,600
Give you another chance.

178
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,070
Please answer me

179
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,710
within 48 hours.

180
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,650
48 hours.

181
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,840
It is when LH Star's shareholders meeting ends.

182
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,110
Why are there so many people?

183
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,600
There seems to be a big meeting.

184
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,710
Does it mean the big boss,

185
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,310
his boss and all other bosses would all be here?

186
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:04,730
No.

187
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,830
I need to pull myself together.

188
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,410
[Rao Meina, Assistant Intern of Secondary Design Studio]

189
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,770
That girl overestimated herself.

190
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,740
She even wants to take the position of

191
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,000
LH Star's CEO from you.

192
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,970
She is just daydreaming.

193
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,840
Look at how arrogant they are.

194
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,800
What have they done to the group?

195
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,560
Even if Ms. Zhuang Meixuan is here,

196
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,710
I'm afraid...

197
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,620
she can't escape their scheme.

198
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,100
Right.

199
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
I'm afraid that

200
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,530
LH Star is going down.

201
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,160
President Zhuang is too hasty.

202
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,420
He entrusted such a big group

203
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,540
to a young girl in her early twenties.

204
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,320
Because she is

205
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,260
the biological daughter of the former Miss Zhuang, Zhuang Meixuan.

206
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,560
So what?

207
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,800
She hasn't been in China for more than ten years,

208
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,120
and has no industrial management experience.

209
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,410
If we let her be the CEO of LH Star Group,

210
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,730
I'm afraid she would ruin our Group.

211
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,700
Don't say that.

212
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,940
She's coming...

213
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,330
So what?

214
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,600
I would say the same in front of her.

215
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,970
The position of LH Star's CEO...

216
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,730
Wait.

217
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,540
Are you going to sit here?

218
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,910
Do you know that

219
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,160
not anyone can sit on

220
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,450
this position?

221
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,140
If she can't sit here,

222
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,500
can you?

223
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,790
Of course this position is not

224
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,829
for anyone.

225
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,700
But as the heir of LH Star Group,

226
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,930
who was appointed by President Zhuang,

227
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,869
It's only natural for Ms. Zhuang Xinyan

228
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,200
to sit on this position.

229
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,720
Of course we know

230
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,540
that Missie was appointed

231
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,770
by President Zhuang.

232
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,440
But LH Star Group now

233
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,580
is in a critical crisis

234
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,660
of overseas bonds.

235
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,520
For someone

236
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,550
with no industrial management experience,

237
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,550
can Ms. Zhuang Xinyan lead the group

238
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,910
go through the crisis?

239
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,510
If she can save the group,

240
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,900
she should be able to take this position.

241
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,060
If Ms. Zhuang Xinyan

242
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,840
just want to take the throne,

243
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,280
but cannot help the shareholders

244
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,980
to protect this realm.

245
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,980
I'm afraid

246
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,060
nobody would agree to

247
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,000
let her have this position.

248
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:06,940
Look.

249
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,230
It's just the beginning.

250
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,630
They are already giving her a hard time.

251
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:12,990
Xingcheng,

252
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,130
since I've returned to the House of Zhuang today,

253
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,240
I surely have the guts to sit here.

254
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,790
Since I dare to sit here today,

255
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,060
I'm confident to lead LH Star to

256
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,260
overcome the difficulties.

257
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,650
Please rest assured, shareholders.

258
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,630
From now on,

259
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,080
I will protect LH Star for you.

260
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,950
At the same time,

261
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,290
Mr. Yan beside me

262
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,470
will join the group with me.

263
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
We will work together

264
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,600
to bring LH Star back

265
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,430
to the top of the industry.

266
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,770
This is not...

267
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,690
This is not...

268
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:36,990
Shen...

269
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,950

Did I do well?

308
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,910
Well done.

309
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,360
In order to fully control LH Star,

310
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,820
we need to subdue these shareholders first.

311
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,540
So next,

312
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,780
solving LH Star's

313
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,690
overseas bond crisis

314
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,140
is the first big thing

315
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,760
you have to accomplish here.

316
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,560
I?

317
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,310
Ask the secretary

318
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,020
to send all the information

319
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,200
of overseas bonds.

320
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:49,780
Qiao,

321
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,270
send all the violation documents

322
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,940
of LH Star's overseas bonds

323
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,200
to the CEO's office.

324
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,190
Now.

325
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,850
I didn't expect this girl to be so bold.

326
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,810
Mr. Zhuang.

327
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,410
Don't worry.

328
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,350
She won't

329
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,100
take Ocean Star away from you so easily.

330
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,670
Do you have any ideas?

331
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,150
There are many ways.

332
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,380
What about the financial manager in charge of overseas bonds?

333
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,880
The detailed list of all overseas assets is missing.

334
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,570
Detailed list?

335
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,560
I went to the Finance Department to get all the statements last time.

336
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,690
They are different.

337
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,900
Financial statement

338
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,680
is very different from

339
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,150
detailed list of overseas assets.

340
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,150
Only that list

341
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,090
recorded

342
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,980
all transactions

343
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,980
of LH Star's

344
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,530
oversea industries.

345
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,030
All the information handed over

346
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,240
were fudged.

347
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,050
We only saw the big picture,

348
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,030
not the details.

349
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,530
Once they are detained by foreign banks,

350
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,720
all the assets

351
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,770
will be gone.

352
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,000
I'll call the Finance Center.

353
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,700
Don't move.

354
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,490
Fang Xiang.

355
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,160
Boss.

356
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,470
The financial manager in charge of overseas stock

357
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,120
has applied for a month's pay leave.

358
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,620
His flight departures at one o' clock this afternoon,

359
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,350
to go abroad.

360
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,920
I'll go with you.

361
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,770
Are you at the airport yet?

362
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,970
Hurry up and leave.

363
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:01,880
Sir,

364
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,120
go to the airport with full speed.

365
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,250
I'll pay you double.

366
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,160
Okay, boss.

367
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,390
I can do it.

368
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,600
You don't have to go.

369
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,390
I want to go with you.

370
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:31,850
Let's go.

371
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,590
Sir, hurry up.

372
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:45,940
Boss.

373
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,970
I am already at my full speed.

374
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,380
Hurry up.

375
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,590
Sir.

376
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,400
Turn around.

377
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,460
Hurry up.

378
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,110
Hello, boss.

379
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,010
Fang Xiang.

380
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,230
Have you checked the online car I asked you to check?

381
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:35,750
Yes.

382
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,850
The plate number is 889.

383
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,920
The pick up spot is at 70 meters outside the LH Star Building.

384
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,410
Departure time was 21 minutes and 19 seconds ago.

385
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,510
The route is going second ring from the second exit of Zhengyang Street

386
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,140
to the highway,

387
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,510
and entered the airport highway.

388
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,910
Boss.

389
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,180
It's him.

390
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,650
Sit tight.

391
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,300
Over there.

392
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,920
Sit tight.

393
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,520
Hurry up.

394
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,050
Over there!

395
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,230
Stop!

396
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,160
Driver, stop him!

397
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,770
-I'll pay you more. -Stop!

398
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:13,850
Stop!

399
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,720
Mr. Zhuang.

400
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,920
Just sit tight.

401
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,860
As long as Mr. Zheng gets to the airport safely,

402
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,510
everything will be easy.

403
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,220
What if he can't make it?

404
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,910
What if the list falls into their hands?

405
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,600
There's no such thing.

406
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,070
Mr. Zheng promised me

407
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,480
he hid the list well.

408
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,320
Don't think that easily.

409
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,210
Zhuang Xinyan is easy to deal with.

410
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,510
But the man she brought back...

411
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,470
This man?

412
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,020
I felt something strange.

413
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,820
How strange?

414
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,640
I feel that

415
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,850
I've seen him somewhere.

416
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,510
Also,

417
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,150
he and Zhuang Xinyan

418
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,030
don't seem like a proper couple.

419
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,230
It seems that

420
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,300
they are showing to us on purpose.

421
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,100
That's right.

422
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,350
Right.

423
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,820
I don't think they're a prospective couple either.

424
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,350
Hurry up.

425
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,870
Find out everything about this man

426
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,390
thoroughly.

427
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,530
Understood.

428
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,100
Also,

429
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,490
besides the list of overseas assets,

430
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,580
we need to make other plans.

431
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,550
We can't let this girl

432
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,580
to be the CEO easily.

433
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:40,920
Okay.

434
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,180
Stop!

435
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,100
Don't run!

436
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,950
Don't follow me.

437
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,030
I didn't do anything.

438
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,290
I just want to go abroad

439
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,710
to see my wife and children.

440
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,150
If you didn't do anything,

441
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,280
why did you run away?

442
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,010
I ran because you chased me.

443
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,360
I really didn't do anything.

444
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,070
I was just paid

445
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,850
a hundred thousand more.

446
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,410
More?

447
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,990
Did you receive it from someone else?

448
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,770
Who gave you the money?

449
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:12,710
I didn't.

450
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,800
I really didn't.

451
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:14,960
Please let me go.

452
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,630
Please let me go, Missie!

453
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,500
Since you know I'm Ms. Zhuang Xinyan,

454
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:20,820
give me the list

455
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,710
of overseas bond assets!

456
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,790
What overseas assets?

457
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,570
Hand is over to me,

458
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,820
I'll let you go.

459
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,440
Missie,

460
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,080
it really wasn't me.

461
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,280
This has nothing

462
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,490
to do with me.

463
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,310
They just want me to leave.

464
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,500
I beg you.

465
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,310
Please let me go.

466
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,360
Please let me go.

467
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,180
I beg you.

468
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,930
I beg you.

469
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,330
Please let me go.

470
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,430
Okay.

471
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:50,810
Okay.

472
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,120
I will give it.

473
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,120
I will give it.

474
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,450
I will give it.
