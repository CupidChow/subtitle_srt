[Episode 21]

4
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,140
An hour.

5
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,560
What are you doing?

6
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,910
Boss said

7
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,729
not to go in.

8
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,580
But I'm worried.

9
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,720
About what?

10
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,270
If Zhuang Jiakai formed an alliance with the Group

11
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,270
to deal with Boss,

12
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,860
Shen Manning

13
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,410
and Rao Meina will all get involved.

14
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,680
Rao Meina.

15
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:03,720
Look.

16
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:15,800
Mom.

17
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,620
How about this?

18
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,820
Close the shop first.

19
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,750
I'll go home and call Manning now.

20
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,480
Don't worry.

21
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,680
What happened?

22
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,040
Top management of company is having a closed-door meeting.

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,970
No outsiders are allowed to enter.

24
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,329
No entry?

25
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,329
Why?

26
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,320
That is Meina.

27
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:40,920
Hey,

28
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,470
Meina.

29
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,930
Are you in the company?

30
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,270
I'm in the company.

31
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,520
My mom just called me

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,670
saying something happened to Manning.

33
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,870
I was about to go home.

34
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,280
Meina,

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,329
you need to think a way to

36
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:51,790
get out from the back door.

37
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,110
Your name is Rao Meina?

38
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,760
Are you from the Secondary Design Studio?

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,400
Meina,

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,340
run!

41
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:01,700
Stop!

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,550
Oh no.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,890
What should we do?

44
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,090
I know a safe passage.

45
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:09,820
Let's go.

46
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,180
Okay.

47
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,380
What did you say?

48
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,130
You said my dad

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,720
and Yan Xingcheng's parents...

50
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,280
They...

51
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,670
I know this

52
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,110
hurt you.

53
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,190
But it is all true.

54
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,630
He and your life

55
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,279
were entangled 17 years ago.

56
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,010
With something like this happened to

57
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,540
the House of Zhuang and LH Star,

58
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,740
You can't just leave.

59
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,490
If

60
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,180
I have evidence

61
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,000
to question about your identity as the heir.

62
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,430
You have no right

63
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,980
to keep the House of Zhuang

64
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,320
and LH Star in your hands.

65
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,690
Mom,

66
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,760
really?

67
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,230
Meixuan,

68
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,800
Yi is so naughty and immature,

70
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,890
but you treat him like your own.

71
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,890
I'm sorry to you

72
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,000
and Xinyan.

73
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,860
I'm sorry to both of you.

74
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,930
From now on,

75
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,600
I will treat you well

76
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,630
and take good care of you and your daughter.

77
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,020
So,

78
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,700
I'm not the extra person in this family.

79
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,270
It is you.

80
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,070
We've released the recording to the public.

81
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,600
You can't stay in the House of Zhuang anymore.

82
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,830
Do you think I'll suspect

83
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,430
my father and mother because this?

84
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,780
You...

85
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,880
Grandpa.

86
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,460
Grandpa!

87
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,690
Grandpa.

88
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:01,760
Grandpa.

89
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,760
Grandpa.

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,930
Grandpa.

91
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,240
Grandpa.

92
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,260
Old president.

93
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,320
Old president!

94
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,040
Manning.

95
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,990
Don't do this.

96
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,700
If you keep doing this,

97
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,660
uncle will be sadder.

98
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,140
Manning.

99
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,010
Don't talk.

100
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,210
I want to be alone.

101
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,700
It is raining.

102
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,170
Will we

103
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,150
be locked here forever?

104
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,289
Did something big happen?

105
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,770
Your boss?

106
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,770
My mom just called me and said Manman has left.

107
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,480
Why?

108
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
Did they break up?

109
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,350
What happened?

110
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,560
Tell me, Yuan Shuai.

111
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,020
Don't keep it to yourself.

112
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,170
Tell me everything.

113
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,100
I'll listen to everything you say.

114
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,710
Will you listen

115
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,500
to everything I say?

116
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,480
I...

117
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,090
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,010
Why are you apologizing?

119
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,540
I hurt you

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,600
before.

121
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,550
I know you like me.

122
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,730
But you're not in my plan.

123
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,300
I came back here

124
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,570
to help boss fulfill his wish.

125
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,330
Before I finish the task,

126
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,480
other things are extra

127
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:45,640
to me.

128
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,190
Stop talking.

129
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,060
I understand.

130
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,980
Do you understand?

131
00:09:59,090 --> 00:09:59,610
Yes.

132
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:01,940
It is

133
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,290
just like before,

134
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,800
not to follow you anymore.

135
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,070
Actually,

136
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,120
you don't have to say it again

137
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,780
to hurt me.

138
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,420
Meina.

139
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,490
Yuan Shuai.

140
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,240
From now on,

141
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,710

Don't worry. I'm here.

I came to pick you up.

178
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,840
What happened?

179
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,710
LH Star Group

180
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,580
has changed the top leadership again

181
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,030
and announced to cut off all the cooperation

182
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,490
with our company.

183
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,200
What about all the cooperation we just started...

184
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,190
All cooperation

185
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,580
will be terminated immediately.

186
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,270
Besides,

187
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,410
the former President of LH Star,

188
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,290
Mr. Zhuang,

189
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,440
passed away.

190
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,600
-What? -What?

191
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,720
What did you say?

192
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,540
Grandpa.

193
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,290
What is wrong with him?

194
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,140
The official obituary has been released.

195
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,280
According to internal information,

196
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,610
the current CEO, Yan Yi,

197
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,220
was expelled for unknown reasons

198
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,420
from the House of Zhuang and LH Star too.

199
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,500
The current CEO, Yan Yi,

200
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
his identity of heir is suspicious,

201
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,300
deprive his position as the CEO of LH Star and

202
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,630
expel him immediately.

203
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,960
He is not allowed to step into the House of Zhuang again.

204
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,970
I have to save someone first.

205
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,620
Wait for me.

206
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,120
Brother.

207
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,670
Yan Xingcheng,

208
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,660
do you want to elope with me?

209
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,640
♫I remembered your smile again♫

210
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,740
♫Long time no see♫

211
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,020
I object to this engagement.

212
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,700
I object

213
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,600
♫I was longing for a hug in my dream♫

214
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,950
to marriage which only for the sake of business.

215
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,510
♫But the dream could not be true♫

216
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,710
Promise me today that

217
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,750
you must hold me tight,

218
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,620
♫What I said to myself♫

219
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,020

220
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,750
♫Have you heard it?♫

221
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,890
This is all I want, and

222
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,680
I've never loved you.

223
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,850
♫The past taught people to grow up♫

224
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,680
I will never forgive you for my whole life.

225
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,920
♫I would not listen♫

226
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:53,500
♫Thinking about your face If you're just hibernating♫

227

♫Missed your face and wanted to pay you back♫

229
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,579
The subscriber you dialed

230
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,500
cannot be connected for the moment,

231
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,020
please...

232
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,319
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment...

233
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,410
Manning.

234
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,380
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected...

235
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,450
Manning, don't do this.

236
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:37,900
Dad.

237
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,040
Dad.

238
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,730
I'll talk to you later.

239
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,180
The subscriber you dialed cannot...

240
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,070

241
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,100
Sorry.

242
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,700
We've searched several places.

243
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,230
My brother also sent people to LH Star to look.

244
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,390
He is not there.

245
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,710
Manning,

246
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,120
don't worry.

247
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,140
I'll find a way to go back to the House of Zhuang and take a look.

248
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,160
I will also attend the funeral of President Zhuang

249
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,650
myself.

250
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,750
I just informed Fang Xiang and Yuan Shuai.

251
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,950
They'll be here soon.

252
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,340
Trust me.

253
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,790
We will find him.

254
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:07,930
Manning,

255
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,020
did you hear us?

256
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,790
We will find Yan Xingcheng.

257
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,680
Yan Xingcheng

258
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,600
will be fine.

259
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,160
Where are you going?

260
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,220
I want...

261
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,530
I want to find him.

262
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,410
It is dangerous outside.

263
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,360
We don't know what will happen to the House of Zhuang and the LH Star.

264
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,560
If you go there now...

265
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,380
I'm going to find him.

266

Only I can find him now.

270
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,180
He won't disappear

271
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,540
only if I go and look for him.

272
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,640
I must

273
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,620
find him.

274
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:18,980
But you...

275
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,390
Fine.

276
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,930

282
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,810
I've searched all the places we've been,

283
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,880
but you were not there.

284
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,000

285
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,000

can you please come back?

289
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:05,840
Manning,

290
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,390
have you found him?

291
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,770
If there's no news,

292
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,120
come back first.

293
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,200
We'll help you find him.

294
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,070
We'll find him for you.

295
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,020
I will find him.

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,570
Hang in there, Yan Xingcheng.

352
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,830
Boss! Boss!

353
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:39,640
Yan Xingcheng.

354
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,040
♫And take the risk♫

355
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,900
Family members, stay out!

356
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,220
We don't know

357
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,680
if he was hit hard in the deep sea,

358
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,140
or it was the panic attack.

359
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,470
But according to the current data,

360
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,070
he is in a deep coma.

361
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,160
Whether he can wake up

362
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,190
depends on his will.

363
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,010
Xingcheng,

364
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,210
it is me.

365
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,100
Xingcheng, can you hear me?

366
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,520
I will always be with you

367
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,760
and protect you.

368
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,380
I will always be by your side

369
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,240
and never leave you.

370
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,410
Xingcheng,

371
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,490
if you can hear me,

372
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,460
please answer me.

373
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,130
Xingcheng,

374
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,670
you must wake up.

375
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,140
You must wake up soon.

376
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,880
Dad.

377
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:17,740
Don't go.

378
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,370
Dad!

379
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,710
Mom, don't go.

380
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,210
Don't go!

381
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,820
Don't go!

382
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,420
Dad, don't go!

383
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,880
Mom, no!

384
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,240
No!

385
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,160
Don't go!

386
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,150
Don't go!

387
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,680
Grandpa, don't go. Please.

388
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,110
Don't go.

389
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,780
Grandpa!

390
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,310
No!

391
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,210
Grandpa!

392
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,920
Grandpa, don't go.

393
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,410
They all left.

394
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,940
Why are you still here?

395
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,980
You should go.

396
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,420
No!

397
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,190
Let go of me! No!

398
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,370
Xingcheng, what's wrong? Xingcheng.

399
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,010
Xingcheng.

400
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,160
Doctor! Doctor!

401
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,390
Come here quickly!

402
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,650
Come on. Hold his foot.

403
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,880
Hurry up!

404
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,000
♫I remembered your smile again♫

405
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,100
♫Long time no see♫

406
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,960
♫I was longing for a hug in my dream♫

407
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,870
♫But the dream could not be true♫

408
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,980
♫What I said to myself♫

409
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,110
♫Have you heard it?♫

410
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:37,210
♫The past taught people to grow up♫

411
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:42,280
♫I would not listen♫

412
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:50,860
♫Thinking about your face If you're just hibernating♫

413
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:55,659
♫Give me one more moment♫

414
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:04,230
♫Missed your face and wanted to pay you back♫

415
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:10,010
♫Why not forever?♫
