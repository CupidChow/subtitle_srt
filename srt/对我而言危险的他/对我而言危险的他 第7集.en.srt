[Episode 7]

4
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,720
Did you see it clearly?

5
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,160
This is the original works our group created

6
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,560
together with the world-famous designers

7
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,520
three months ago.

8
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,229
We've applied an exclusive patent for it worldwide.

9
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,830
But on the exhibition page of the jewelry show,

10
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,700
I found your works

11
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,740
was exactly the same as ours.

12
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,000
Ms. Zhuang.

13
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,570
I really want to know

14
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,720
whether you and your team

15
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,910
admire our Luminous Group too much,

16
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,650
or

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,380
you want to give us a frightening surprise

18
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,380
in the International Jewelry Show.

19
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,320
Mr. Tang,

20
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,470
is there any misunderstanding?

21
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,090
The evidence and design drawings are all here.

22
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,330
Ms. Zhuang.

23
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,250
Do you still think this is just a misunderstanding?

24
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:18,980
Similar product designs

25
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,410
are commonly seen.

26
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:24,990
Mr. Yan,

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,329
you mean

28
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,020
the product plagiarism

29
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,840
is allowed by the leadership of your company, right?

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,700
Let me tell you.

31
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,110
The reputation of the domestic design industry

32
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,540
is ruined

33
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,730
by people like you.

34
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,320
Mr. Tang, don't misunderstand me.

35
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,970
LH Star has always respected original works.

36
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,380
It's impossible for us to plagiarize works form other companies

37
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,380
in the International Jewelry Show.

38
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,440
Besides,

39
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,190
the show is not open yet.

40
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,690
The recommendation page is only for reference.

41
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,030
What makes you think

42
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,990
the works we recommended

43
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,690
must be exactly the same as

44
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,090
the patent design of Luminous Group?

45
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,760
I've long heard that

46
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,250
there is a very powerful person by Ms. Zhuang.

47
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,970
I've heard so much about you.

48
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,210
The works that have been displayed at the jewelry show

49
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,710
can be turned into non-existent

50
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,930
in your months.

51
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,050
OK.

52
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,610
I'll give you a chance.

53
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,090
When the jewelry show opens,

54
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,150
I'd like to see

55
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,650
what kind of goods you will offer

56
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,780
under the nose of international purchasers.

57
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,070
I forget to tell you

58
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,590
that if you still take out the works

59
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,140
in this series,

60
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,370
then I'm sorry,

61
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,820
we won't

62
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,390
go easy on you.

63
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,160
They're not young, but arrogant enough.

64
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Zhuang Cheng'an was no match for me.

65
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,130
They haven't grown up yet.

66
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,550
How can they defeat me?

67
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,250
This time,

68
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,650
I'll devour the whole LH Star.

69
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:14,750
What?

70
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,790
Are you reluctant to leave?

71
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,660
No, I'm not.

72
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,820
You are my sister.

73
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,120
You can't  hide it from me.

74
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,670
From the moment you entered,

75
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,270
you've never been interested in negotiation.

76
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,600
What were you looking at?

77
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,500
That man?

78
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,500
Brother!

79
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,830
What kind of person do you think I am?

80
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,400
Handsome

81
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,159
and cool men,

82
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,470
I have seen them a lot.

83
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,830
This man is different.

84
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,800
He has a girlfriend already.

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,720
So what?

86
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,970
Can't I get him?

87
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,850
I don't believe

88
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,720
there's a man I can't gain in this world.

89
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,720
You're indeed my sister.

90
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,159
So domineering.

91
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,520
From now on, I'll leave him to you.

92
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,050
And you can leave the company to me.

93
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,230
I'd like to see how long LH Star

94
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,680
will be able to compete with us.

95
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,020
Let's go. Get in.

[LH Star]

97
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,050
I'll ask Qiao

98
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,320
to summon all the directors of the design studios.

99
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,720
Let's check

100
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,980
which design studio launched the works.

101
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,520
No need.

102
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,120
Why?

103
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,230
Fang Xiang has checked the backstage of the jewelry show.

104
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,200
The series sent by our Production Department

105
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,130
is exactly the same as theirs.

106
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,310
How is that possible?

107
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,940
This is a commercial trap.

108
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,070
Someone may disclose our design drawings,

109
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,940
or even

110
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,730
bribed our designers

111
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,320
to deliberately hand in a design

112
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,600
that has been registered copyright

113
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,620
to the Production Department of LH Star

114
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,100
and made an exhibit piece.

115
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,750
Their purpose

116
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,330
is not this series of exhibits.

117
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,890
What is their purpose?

118
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,420
LH Star.

119
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,080
But this is just a series of exhibits.

120
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,290
How can they get our group

121
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,520
just because of this?

122
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,200
One month ago, Industry Regulatory Association

123
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,660
issued a copyright anti-plagiarism order.

124
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,760
All companies which got involved in the domestic

125
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,240
especially international copyright lawsuits

126
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,300
will be blacklisted in the industry.

127
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,610
Before these lawsuits are lifted,

128
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,630
the Industry Regulatory Association

129
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,940
will limit these companies' listing rights,

130
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,020
as well as their right of circulation

131
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,980
and export.

132
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,800
Our company has just experienced overseas crisis.

133
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,690
Once we are added to this blacklist,

134
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,420
our right of export and shipping will be limited.

135
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,040
Our market occupation rate will also decrease,

136
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:47,620
right?

137
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,370
So will the stock price.

138
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,180
Their ultimate goal

139
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
is to lower the stock price of LH Star

140
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,940
and buy a great amount of its shares.

141
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,760
After the debt crisis,

142
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,530
all the funds were deposited overseas.

143
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,460
Once the stock price plunges,

144
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,150
LH Star won't be capable of fighting with them.

145
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,460
In the end, we can only watch the stock price collapse,

146
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,480
and give up the  whole company.

147
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,960
Were the debt crisis,

148
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,710
capital flow,

149
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,310
and the copyright dispute

150
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,440
all planned by them?

151
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,620
Yes, of course.

152
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,040
This is the business war.

153
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,340
Even a little flame

154
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,410
will

155
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,310
eventually lead to the huge disaster.

156
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,720
Do we still have a chance?

157
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,000
Can we file a copyright counterclaim

158
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,520
or make a complaint to the Industry Regulatory Association?

159
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,320
It's useless.

160
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,750
Since they came here,

161
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,060
all of our ways had been blocked.

162
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,170
Then we have to see LH Star become other's?

163
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,510
I hate these sneaky behaviors most.

164
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,010
Bribery and suppression are unfair.

165
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,210
Come at us if you dare.

166
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,500
Right, Yuan Shuai?

167
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,210
Let's

168
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,410
start from the source.

169
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,630
The source?

170
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,980
Since they started from the exhibits,

171
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,660
and want to drag the whole LH Star into the mire,

172
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,640
we'll start with this series of exhibits

173
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,900
to solve this problem.

174
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,090
But the exhibit has been sent to the jewelry show.

175
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,890
Get it back.

176
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,720
As long as we can recall the series of exhibits back,

177
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,480
and redesign a new series of exhibits

178
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,390
before the show,

179
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,559
Luminous Group won't have the chance

180
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,419
to file a complaint and a lawsuit.

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,210
As long as LH Star doesn't get involved in copyright disputes,

182
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,049
it won't be blacklisted.

183
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,590
Then naturally, there is no risk of stock price decline.

184
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,940
Do you know how long it will take

185
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,210
for the revision of the whole series of exhibits?

186
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,590
It's better than

187
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,750
leaving our own fate to others.

188
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,470
Back then,

189
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,860
you didn't want your fate

190
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,760
to be controlled by others,

191
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,490
so you took me back, didn't you?

192
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,360
We've gone so far together.

193
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,640
We can't let a series of exhibits

194
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,120
destroy the whole LH Star.

195
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,060
Let's do it.

196
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,470
Recall it.

197
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,170
Protect the LH Star.

198
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,180
Okay.

199
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,180
I'll recall the exhibit back.

200
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,110
Find a trustworthy designer

201
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,290
and redesign it.

202
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,590
Wait for me.

203
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,330
We'll make a new one when I'm back,

204
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:45,770
OK.

205
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:47,790
Fang Xiang,

206
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,380
go get some 3D printers.

207
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,490
Is it the laser metal printing?

208
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,840
Don't worry.

209
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,930
You can get

210
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,020
as many as you want.

211
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,080
Three is enough.

212
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,030
But you have to be quick.

213
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,690
No problem.

214
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,400
Take care.

215
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,420
Wait for me.

216
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,100
It's you.

217
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,220
Do you remember me?

218
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,920
We met last time.

219
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,030
I'm Rao...

220
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,680
Wait.

221
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,580
I have a favor to ask.

222
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,740
I really need your help.

223
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,840
Let's go.

224
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,290
What?

225
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:53,710
Get in.

226
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,170
I'm not finished.

227
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,400
I'm not getting in.

228
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,070
-Let's go. -I'm not going.

229
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,840
I'm not going.

230
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,670
I'm not going!

231
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,330
What are you waiting for?

232
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:04,800
Get in.

233
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,110
Ms. Zhuang.

234
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,780
You asked me to find the most trustworthy

235
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,360
director of the design studios for you. Here he comes.

236
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,180
This is Mr. Lin.

237
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,160
He's the director of Second Design Studio of our group.

238
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,830
He is also the most trusted and reliable person

239
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,230
of the former President.

240
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,610
Ms. Zhuang.

241
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Is there anything

242
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
I can help?

243
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,330
The exhibit we sent to the jewelry show

244
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,080
was complained of copyright objection by Luminous Group.

245
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,850
Now we've decided to recall the exhibit

246
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,000
and redesign it.

247
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,310
But our time is very limited.

248
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,950
Mr. Lim.

249
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,140
Can you help me?

250
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,700
It's better than

251
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,900
leaving our own fate to others.

252
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,220
Back then,

253
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,810
you didn't want your fate

254
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,340
to be controlled by others,

255
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,170
so you took me back, didn't you?

256
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,640
We've gone so far together.

257
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,960
We can't let a series of exhibits

258
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,420
destroy the whole LH Star.

259
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,630
Recall it.

260
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,210
Protect the LH Star.

261
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,060
Yuan Shuai.

262
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,840
Turn left.

263
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,630
Yuan Shuai.

264
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,290
Turn right.

265
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,870
Stop.

266
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,760
If you keep driving like this,

267
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,180
I'm gonna throw up.

268
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,750
Are you surprised?

269
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,660
Is it exciting?

270
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,690
Sit tight.

271
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,220
We'll take you to fly.

272
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,920
Why hitting my head?

273
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,670
Boss asked us to hurry

274
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,640
not to pick up girls on the way.

275
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,890
I'm not!

276
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,890
She's been chasing you for days.

277
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,720
Actually, she's

278
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,580
picking you up.

279
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,220
Who said I wanted to chase him?

280
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,750
I just want to know him

281
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,610
and make him

282
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,560
the male lead of my next comic book.

283
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,400
The male lead?

284
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,030
What do you do?

285
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:41,850
I am

286
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,310
an intern designer of LH Star,

287
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,470
and an illustrator of Romance Comics.

288
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,560
What do you think?

289
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,420
You haven't heard of it, have you?

290
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,360
Forget it.

291
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,260
Yuan Shuai.

292
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,120
Boss asked us to get the printers.

293
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,780
It will be so boring on the way.

294
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,340
There's a little girl

295
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,640
swinging about in the backseat now.

296
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,370
Isn't it fun?

297
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,810
Fun?

298
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,430
What's wrong with you?

299
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,810
Let's...

300
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,370
go!

301
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,730
The company has been in chaos

302
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,730
recently.

303
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,720
Although we didn't launch

304
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,490
new series,

305
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,300
we did have some new designs accumulated.

306
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,030
They can be used as a reference.

307
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,040
Isn't this too simple?

308
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,940
It's an international jewelry show this time.

309
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,080
There will be many overseas purchasers.

310
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,470
If the main series can't reach

311
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,520
the usual level of LH Star's products,

312
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,720
it might affect the revenue of the year.

313
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,560
What's wrong?

314
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,030
I suddenly feel

315
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,190
you're like the Xinyan I knew when you were young.

316
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,970
Mr. Lin.

317
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,050
I'm the new president of the group.

318
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,930
I invited you here

319
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,910
to help me with

320
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,260
the exhibition crisis.

321
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,580
I don't want you to bring

322
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,450
any other emotions to work.

323
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,160
I'm sorry.

324
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,000
Ms. Zhuang.

325
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,060
This task is urgent.

326
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,800
And it's confidential.

327
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,150
I'm afraid you might have to stay in my office

328
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,560
for the time being.

329
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:55,600
But I believe

330
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,740
with your talent,

331
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,990
you can save the whole LH Star for sure.

332
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,950
I'll do my best.

333
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:02,860
Dad.

334
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,170
You're back.

335
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,810
Why are you sleeping here?

336
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
The night dew is heavy lately.

337
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,859
Be careful not to catch a cold.

338
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,490
I feel much better now

339
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,160
after my last hospitalization.

340
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,720
Besides,

341
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,369
the company is in a mess now

342
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,480
because of my illness.

343
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,030
These kids are working overtime every day

344
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,560
to clean up the mess.

345
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,720
I can't sleep in peace.

346
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,000
Since they are back,

347
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,200
it's their business.

348
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,380
Let them handle it.

349
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,580
Please take care of yourself.

350
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,520
I made this in by myself

351
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,290
for you and your sister.

352
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,680
One represents you,

353
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,310
and the other represents  your sister.

354
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,930
I wished that you two

355
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,220
could help and support

356
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,950
each other forever.

357
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,140
However,

358
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,840
since Meixuan passed away,

359
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,510
I've never seen this rose brooch again.

360
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,930
Where's yours?

361
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,410
Do you still have it?

362
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,230
I don't really remember.

363
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,790
You know,

364
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,180
I don't like these things.

365
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,400
If not,

366
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,950
I would have asked you to let me work in LH Star.

367
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,490
This brooch should be in my jewelry cabinet.

368
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,700
I'll look for it

369
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,900
and bring it to you.

370
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,090
No need.

371
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,180
Your sister is gone.

372
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,920
If I see it,

373
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,980
I'll just be sad again.

374
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,760
All right.

375
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,790
I'll go rest in my room.

376
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:21,690
What?

377
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,980
Are you serious?

378
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,000
What?

379
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,300
Can't I be serious?

380
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,490
I want to know

381
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,190
what kind of charm he has.

382
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,240
He could make my sister fall for him

383
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,020
at the first sight.

384
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,290
What's the difference between Lin Mufan and him?

385
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,380
The difference is huge.

386
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,090
He has a background of seven countries.

387
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,090
Isn't it amazing?

388
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,160
It's said that he's the distinguished guest of several big families.

389
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,290
Isn't it legendary?

390
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,220
Most importantly,

391
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,420
his background is unknown,

392
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,280
and his origin becomes a mystery.

393
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,700
Even his love story with Ms. Zhuang

394
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,650
leaves no clue for others to check.

395
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,790
Designer Lin of LH Star

396
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,350
is no match for him.

397
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,430
So

398
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,520
you've investigated him?

399
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,640
As you can see,

400
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,150
I could find out nothing.

401
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,730
I can only find out the things he and Zhuang Xinyan did

402
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,430
after returning to China.

403
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,990
All his background, actions,

404
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,780
and trajectories overseas,

405
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,470
except the legends from some social medias,

406
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,800
nothing else was found.

407
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,340
He seems to be a man

408
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,420
who suddenly appeared in this world.

409
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,390
So perfect.

410
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,530
So mysterious.

411
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,470
Only a man like him

412
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,130
can attract

413
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,000
my attention.

414
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:49,830
Brother,

415
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,030
how about we make a bet?

416
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:54,950
Sure.

417
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,650
What do you want to bet?

418
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,410
Well...

419
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,520
Let's bet

420
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,830
whether he can handle

421
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,860
the trap you prepared for him this time.

422
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,820
If he can solve the crisis

423
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,030
of LH Star,

424
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,330
he deserves my love.

425
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,380
But if he fails with LH Star...

426
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,890
The news has been released.

427
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,580
And the reporters are arranged.

428
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,540
Okay, go ahead.

429
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,520
Okay.

430
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,560
Mr. Lin,

431
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,310
if we use some

432
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,560
trend elements in Fashion Week for reference,

433
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
what do you think?

434
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,080
Actually,

435
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,240
I don't like to use trend elements.

436
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,310
There are trendy styles and colors

437
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,230
in the fashion industry every year.

438
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,670
But the designs based on them

439
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,600
are usually temporary and boring.

440
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,160
If you want the works to last long,

441
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,520
we must create

442
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,420
our own style.

443
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,030
Like many years ago,

444
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,380
there was a high-end brooch

445
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,330
of LH Star,

446
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,220
which had the extremely rare style of

447
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,290
twin roses.

448
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,040
Ms. Zhuang.

449
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,420
What's wrong?

450
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,400
Nothing.

451
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,190
So,

452
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:47,120
you also want to use the style of twin roses,

453
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,790
right?

454
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,740
You know this painting?

455
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,670
When I studied abroad,

456
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,230
I heard of it.

457
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,450
It was the work of a famous professor when he was young.

458
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,450
It's very famous.

459
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,720
Yes.

460
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,570
So,

461
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,240
you want to change our designs

462
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,910
into the pattern of roses?

463
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,960
I want to use the concept of twin roses

464
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,200
and add twin roses patterns

465
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,640
into all the existing exhibits.

466
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,200
In this way,

467
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,080
our works

468
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,370
will not only be unique,

469
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,280
but also different from any other exhibits

470
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,120
in the jewelry show.

471
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,320
Good.

472
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,760
I've asked someone to get the 3D laser printers.

473
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,450
After your design drawings are finished,

474
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,410
we can go to the Production Department

475
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,370
and print it out.

476
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,410
Once the exhibit is recalled,

477
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,670
we can make the new version immediately.

478
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,320
I think the curvature can be revised a little.

479
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,680
This is the gesture of an art student.

480
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,260
My surname is Shen.

481
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,590
My name is Shen Manning.

482
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,560
I'm a senior student

483
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,760
majoring in design in Arts Department.

484
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,620
Ms. Zhuang.

485
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,600
Bad news.

486
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,460
Although Fang Xiang and Yuan Shuai had sent the 3D printers

487
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,840
to the Production Department,

488
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,410
there were suddenly a lot of reporters at the door.

489
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,230
They seem to know

490
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,600
that our jewelry has a copyright dispute

491
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,330
with famous designers abroad.

492
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,040
They all wanted to see Mr. Lin.

493
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,880
They also wanted to interview you.

494
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,410
How did the reporters know?

495
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,160
The show hasn't started yet?

496
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,460
I don't know.

497
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,260
Someone must have released the news.

498
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,940
It's Monday tomorrow.

499
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,480
The stock market will open.

500
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,410
Luminous Group?

501
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,010
We agreed to make a decision

502
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,900
after the show.

503
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,220
Why are they so eager to take actions?

504
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,480
For business competitions,

505
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,010
they can do everything.

506
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,700
I'll go down and take a look.

507
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,360
I'll try my best to block them.

508
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,050
But these designs...

509
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,840
Don't worry, Ms. Zhuang.

510
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,190
I've sent them to the Production Department.

511
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,190
My assistant will help finish them.

512
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,260
We're from Financial News.

513
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,370
As a listed company,

514
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,230
disclosing internal financial crisis to the shareholders

515
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,360
is justifiable and necessary.

516
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,540
Please let us meet your president.

517
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,490
Or let us meet

518
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,580
the director of your design studios.

519
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,810
The stock market will open tomorrow morning.

520
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,010
We must report the truth of the company.

521
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,730
Let us in! Let us in!

522
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,280
Let us meet your president.

523
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,630
Or let us meet the director of the design studios.

524
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,190
Let us in! Let us in!

525
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,360
I'm the director of the Second Design Studio of LH Star.

526
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,370
If you have any questions,

527
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,240
feel free to ask me.

528
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
Mr. Lin Mufan.

529
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:57,920
Mr. Lin.

530
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,600
Did LH Star plagiarize works of foreign designers

531
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,330
-at the jewelry show? -Mr. Lin.

532
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,250
Is LH Star involved in the copyright lawsuit?

533
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,040
Is it blacklisted by the Industry Regulatory Association?

534
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,440
Please tell us the truth.

535
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,140
I'm sorry.

536
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,920
Everything you said just now

537
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
is all rumor.

538
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,710
Mr. Lin.

539
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,890
Mr. Lin.

540
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,760
Just say a few words.

541
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,490
Is LH Star in financial crisis?

542
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,130
LH Star will never

543
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,020
do such a thing.

544
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,590
Our image has always been positive.

545
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,200
We don't need to explain much.

546
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,130
Why don't you let us

547
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,250
interview the new CEO, Ms. Zhuang?

548
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,840
Why are you rubbernecking?

549
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,730
It's none of your business, OK?

550
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,690
You even want to interview Ms. Zhuang?

551
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,220
You should at least get through my boss first.

552
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,630
What a sweet girl.

553
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,400
She knows I had a long journey,

554
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,760
so she wants to treat me an ice cream.

555
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,300
Yuan Shuai,

556
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,530
Have some ice cream.

557
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,940
He's a cool guy.

558
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:10,830
He won't eat it.

559
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,260
Yuan Shuai.

560
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,460
Is it tasty?

561
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,300
Cheers.

562
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,220
You two...

563
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,390
LH Star can't cover up its financial crisis like this.

564
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,480
Please let us in.

565
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,560
Mr. Lin.

566
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,990
Just say a few words.

567
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:23,870
Say something.

568
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,700
What happened?

569
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,560
What happened?

570
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,540
Why is the alarm ringing?

571
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,270
I don't know.

572
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,040
What happened?

573
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,750
Fire!

574
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,500
Fire!

575
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,720
What happened inside?

576
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,960
Hello, what happened inside?

577
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:56,890
Hello.

578
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,130
Qiao.

579
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,960
What's wrong?

580
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,130
There's smoke everywhere

581
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,100
in the corridor.

582
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,890
I think it's on fire.

583
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,510
I was checking accounts with some colleagues.

584
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,570
And I rushed downstairs after hearing the fire alarm.

585
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,290
On fire?

586
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,270
Which floor?

587
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,390
It should be on the floor of the Production Department.

588
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,810
If the Production Department is on fire,

589
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,760
in order to protect raw materials,

590
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,130
all the doors will be locked automatically.

591
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,990
The raw materials should be fine.

592
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:22,890
Oh no.

593
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,760
The president's office is located above the Production Department.

594
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,890
Where's Ms. Zhuang?

595
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,160
I'll call her right away.

596
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,050
Mr. Lin.

597
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,100
It's on fire.

598
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,300
What about the exhibits made by LH Star?

599
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,160
Fang Xiang, switch to our system and open the doors.

600
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,560
Yuan Shuai, come with me.

601
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,250
Let me go! Please let me go!

602
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,800
Mr. Lin.

603
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,090
Please say a few words, Mr. Lin.

604
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,100
Tell us the truth.

605
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,680
Mr. Lin.

606
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,290
Please say something, Mr. Lin.

607
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,200
Boss, watch your step.

608
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,330
[Yan Xingcheng]

609
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,240
Shen Manning.

610
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,210
Yan Xingcheng.

611
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,290
Help me.

612
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,890
Manning!

613
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,210
Boss.

614
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,830
The combination lock is not working.

615
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:13,980
Manning.

616
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,770
Manning, can you hear me?

617
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,160
Shen Manning.

618
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,180
Yuan Shuai.

619
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,510
Go find someone to help.

620
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,520
Manning.
