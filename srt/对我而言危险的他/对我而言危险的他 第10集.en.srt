[Episode 10]

4
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,759
I have bypassed the central control program

5
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,590
and I am looking for a way to cut in.

6
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,850
But if we cut in rashly,

7
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,390
not only will it lead to automatic locking,

8
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,310
but it may even get us in trouble.

9
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,870
Then we'll just sit and watch?

10
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,750
We can only pray that

11
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,850
the password and fingerprint of the encrypted door

12
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,710
can help Missie get through this.

13
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,020
What's the password?

14
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,789
President Zhuang's birthday?

15
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,160
No.

16
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,710
President Zhuang's birthday is a public secret.

17
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,040
It can't be used on such an encrypted door.

18
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,430
Would it be

19
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,900
the founding date of LH Star?

20
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,890
Sorry.

It's not the time when LH Star was founded.

25
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,680
Would it be Zhuang Xinyan's birthday?

26
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,000
Xinyan is the most beloved granddaughter

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,200
of President Zhuang.

28
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,980
It is very likely to

29
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,420

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,160

35
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,270
Ms. Zhuang, you don't even remember

36
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,640
your own company's password?

37
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,760
Didn't President Zhuang tell you

38
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,260
or are you

39
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,570
not qualified to know?

40
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,890
Miss Tang.

41
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,570
What?

42
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,980
You're at LH Star.

43
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,990
Watch your language.

44
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,440
It's not Grandpa's birthday,

45
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,440
not Xinyan's birthday,

46
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,950
not the time when LH Star was founded.

47
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,690
What kind of time

48
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,810
would be set as the password

49
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,530
of the storage warehouse?

50
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,580
The date when Xinyan's parents were born?

51
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,780
Their wedding date?

52
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,910
Hurry, make a call.

53
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,230
The password is 1121.

54
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,500
Or the time when they were abroad...

55
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,970
So her phone password

56
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,220
was the date of her parents' accident.

57
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,880
Ms. Zhuang,

58
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,100

66
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,510
please input your fingerprint.

67

Don't bother anymore.

Don't you think

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,450
you went too far today?

88
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,980
Mr. Lin, your words

89
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,810
also went too far.

90
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,400
You've never thought of working with LH Star

91
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,640
and my studio.

92
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,170
You did everything today

93
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,900
just to torment the House of Zhuang

94
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,260
and to cause a big trouble in LH Star.

95
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,990
Lin Mufan,

96
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,450
you've really crossed the line.

97
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,680
Don't say things you shouldn't

98
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,250
just because my brother and Uncle Lin

99
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,180
are old friends.

100
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,830
What about you?

101
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,130
What you did today

102
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,590
was what you should do?

103
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,630
Wan't it?

104
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,030
Ms. Zhuang, Ms. Zhuang Xinyan,

105
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,680
whom you have been defending,

106
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,450
and whom the whole company of LH Start respects,

107
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,220
may not be surnamed Zhuang.

108

Tang Lin.

109
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,160
You are not grateful for my cleverness

110
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,600
and my generous help.

111
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,570
Instead, you're criticizing me.

112
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,500
What do you mean?

113
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:45,760

for decades.

117
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,080
And you helped guard the House of Zhuang for over ten years.

118
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,920
The lofty Ms. Zhuang,

Zhuang Xinyan,

120
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,010
may be a fake.

121
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,300
You guessed it.

122
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,350
Since Xinyan came back,

123
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,330
President Zhuang has confirmed.

124
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,660
Her blood type and DNA

125
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,100
have been verified by the House of Zhuang.

126
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,360
How could she be a fake?

127
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,510
President Zhuang has confirmed?

128
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,780
You heard it yourself?

129
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,150
You saw the DNA test?

130
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,990
Since you didn't see it with your own eyes,

131
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,460
or hear it with your own ears,

132
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,740
why do you believe it?

133
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,850
What about you?

134
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,780
Who are you to suspect Xin...

135
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,520
Ms. Zhuang's identity?

136
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,700
With nearly billions of assets of LH Star,

137
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,010
with such conditions,

138
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,180
anyone with greedy ambition can be drawn

139
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,380
-to do anything unbelievable. -No way.

140
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,890
Xinyan won't.

141
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,050
You were the only person who went abroad

142
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,450
to pick Zhuang Xinyan up.

143
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,350
Did you see the real Zhuang Xinyan?

144
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,110
Do you really believe the current woman

145
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,700
is the real Zhuang Xinyan?

146
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,440
President Zhuang and my dad sent me to pick you up.

147
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,490
Tell the principal

148
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,130
and come back to the House of Zhuang with me.

149
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,180
My surname is Shen.

150
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,510
My name is Shen Manning.

151
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,650
You must have found the wrong person.

152
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,620
What's going on?

153
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,250
She looks exactly

154
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,700
just like me.

155
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,400
You don't believe it

156
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,310
because you like her.

157
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,850
I don't.

158
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,030
You do.

159
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,000
I can see it in your eyes.

160
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,000
Because you like her,

161
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,160
you ignore her anomalies.

162
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,300
But Lin Mufan, please wake up.

163
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,950
If she really is fake Zhuang Xinyan,

164
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,620
you and Uncle Lin will not only lose

165
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,580
the House of Zhuang you've guarded for decades,

166
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,340
but also be dragged into her whirlpool

167
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,600
and be doomed forever.

168
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,750
No.

169
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,210
No way.

170
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,000
If she dares to pretend to be Zhuang Xinyan,

171
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,860
she must have an ulterior motive.

172
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,390
I will expose her.

173
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,420
And I will make Yan Xingcheng come to me.

174
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,500
Tang Lin.

175
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,450
Don't be like this.

176
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,110
We should find a time

177
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,700
to gradually investigate it.

178
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,230
I'm not doing this with you.

179
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,960
You're not my peer.

180
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,050
Tang Lin.

181
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:30,780
Listen to me.

182
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,140
Lin Mufan,

183
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,270
This is my own business.

184
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,040
I'll take care of it myself.

185
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,210
Also,

186
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,410
don't

187
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,380
come to me anymore.

188
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:44,700
Tang Lin.

189
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,240
Tang Lin.

190
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,630
♫Tick-tock, the second hand goes♫

191

You are tired.

202
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,530
Let me carry you upstairs to rest.

203
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,420
♫And take the risk♫

204

♫No longer like parallel lines♫

210
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,920
Are you still leaving?

211
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,620
Can you

212
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,870
stay with me

213
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,540
and wait for me to fall asleep

214
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
before you leave?

215
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:01,810
Okay.

216
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,930
This afternoon,

217
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,850
at the entrance of the storage warehouse,

218
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
I really thought I couldn't make it.

219
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,440
Sorry.

220
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,940
We were not ready.

221
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,370
It had nothing to do with you.

222
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,890
Tang Lin was targeting me.

223
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,760
But

224
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,350
Tang Lin is suspecting my identity, right?

225
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,230
Did she

226
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,330
find out our secret?

227
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,750
I've known Mr. Lin Mufan

228
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,050
from your Secondary Design Studio for a long time.

229
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,400
I like his designs very much.

230
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,730
I hope Ms. Zhuang can call him up here.

231
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,970
The three of us will meet in person.

232
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,270
I don't think so.

233
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,670
Right.

234
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,150
If she had found out,

235
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,690
she wouldn't just come to the company to seek cooperation

236
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,590
or ask me to open the encrypted door.

237
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,220
Luckily,

238
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,500
I figured out the password to the encrypted door today.

239
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,430
Luckily, my cornea is from Xinyan.

240
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,290
Yan Xingcheng.

241
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,230
You

242
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,620
hated me, right?

243
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,520
Xinyan had such a big accident

244
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,540
because she came to my rescue.

245
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,050
In the end, she left and

246
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,530
I survived.

247
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,300
If she hadn't come to save me,

248
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:47,200
♫Every time I look out of the window♫

249
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,540
these wouldn't have happened.

250
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,550
♫I hope I can see you♫

251
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,880
She didn't need to donate her cornea to me.

252
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:58,240
♫The night breeze is cool♫

00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,300
Xingcheng.

345
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,570
Did you hear me?

346
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,790
Yan Xingcheng.

347
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,590
Follow me.

348
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,250
Follow me.

349
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,620
Yan Xingcheng.

350
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,060
♫I remembered your smile again♫

351
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,530
Yan Xingcheng.

352
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,160
♫Long time no see♫

353
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,420
Follow me.

354
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,000
Follow me.

355
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:21,010
♫I was longing for a hug in my dream♫

356
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,930
♫But the dream could not be true♫

357
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,040
♫What I said to myself♫

358
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,140
♫Have you heard it?♫

359
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,880
What should I do?

360
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,650
I'm still on the blacklist.

361
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,680
My call cannot get through.

362
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,220
My WeChat was also blocked.

363
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,900
How about this?

364
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,110
I'll hack her phone.

365
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,350
No.

366
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,510
I can't do this.

367
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,470
By doing this...

368
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,590
Just bomb her phone.

369
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,800
Bomb it?

370
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,140
She will lose her phone.

371
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,150
You will lose your worries.

372
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,160
Are you out of your mind?

373
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,430
How dare you bomb a girl's phone

374
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,890
after being blacklisted?

375
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,790
Can we still make up if I do that?

376
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,570
My life would be over.

377
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,530
So what?

378
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,520
I can't explain it to you.

379
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,220
Boss.

380
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:22,850
Boss.

381
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,710
What took you so long?

382
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,040
Is everything settled?

383
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,290
Yuan Shuai,

384
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,570
take your passport

385
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,530
and go to the airport.

386
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,600
Take the earliest flight

387
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,260
to fly back.

388
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,560
You must see Dr. Tai

389
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,950
and take him away immediately.

390
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,260
Yes.

391
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,870
Did our plan leak?

392
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,370
Why does Dr. Tai have to...

393
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,230
Not yet.

394
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,270
But it doesn't mean it won't in the future.

395
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,630
Tang Lin and Luminous Group are definitely prepared.

396
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,300
We must be fully prepared.

397
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,980
We can't let her find

398
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,520
any flaws.

399
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,010
Otherwise, all of us

400
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,100
will be wiped out.

401
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,080
Be careful.

402
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,820
Shen.

403
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,200
Luckily, you helped me.

404
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,290
Otherwise,

405
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,340
I can't handle

406
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,260
such a big deal alone.

407
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,810
Who bought so many drinks?

408
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,740
It's a big company's staff welfare.

409
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,600
They give out small benefits

410
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,010
to win people's hearts.

411
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:26,860
I heard

412
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,350
it's where Nana works.

413
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,960
Maybe I can meet her.

414
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,960
Meina is a good girl.

415
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,030
She's not like my daugther.

416
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,530
I've raised her for 20 years for nothing.

417
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,070
Don't think about those unhappy things.

418
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,400
Here.

419
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,110
Hurry up and deliver the goods.

420
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,250
Take the orange juice.

421
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:43,780
Let's go.

422
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,550
OK.

423
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,350
Let's go.

424
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:45,880
Let's go.

425
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,260
Let's go.

426
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:47,940
Let's go.

427
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,670
What kind of dream

428
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,340
would make a person like him

429
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,870
become like that?

430
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,850
My work isn't going well.

431
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,050
My comics aren't going well, either.

432
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,890
There were those two people called...

433
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,010
Why do I suddenly think of them?

434
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,950
Especially

435
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,150
that Fang Xiang.

436
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,840
He's the worst jerk.

437
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,280
Meina.

438
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,160
Meina.

439
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,730
Meina. Meina.

440
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,750
Don't go away!

441
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,960
Give me two minutes.

442
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,820
Let me explain.

443
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,610
It's working hours.

444
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,010
I don't have two minutes.

445
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,490
One minute.

446
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:39,780
No.

447
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,710
30 seconds.

448
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,580
Ten seconds.

449
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,870
That day, I...

450
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,260
Ten seconds is over.

451
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,040
So short?

452
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,160
To me,

453
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,340
it is.

454
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,000
Wait.

455
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,640
Just one sentence.

456
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,590
I was too impatient that day.

457
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,470
I was afraid that Boss's engagement banquet would be ruined.

458
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,130
And you were shouting on the side

459
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,520
So I asked Yuan Shuai to carry you out.

460
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,870
But you bit Yuan Shuai

461
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,780
and it hurts...

462
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,810
I was too careless.

463
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,350
I didn't know what to do.

464
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:09,680
So...

465
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,210
Fang Xiang.

466
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,620
Is this your attitude to apologize?

467
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,170
Don't you think my life is too long

468
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,030
so you want to make me die of anger?

469
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,230
Who apologizes

470
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,720
by putting the blame on another person?

471
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,570
And this...

472
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,470
Did I force you?

473
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,590
No.

474
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,520
I've never seen anyone

475
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,550
applogize in such an insincere way.

476
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,100
Meina.

477
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,630
Mr. Lin.

478
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,160
Ms. Zhuang.

479
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,370
I'm here

480
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,890
because the Design Department

481
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,230
has to determine the plan for the next project.

482
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,910
There're several Haute Couture collections

483
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,840
that I would like you to take a look.

484
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,250
New products for next collection?

485
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,430
I don't know much about this.

486
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,830
You may have to wait for Vice President Yan.

487
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,520
Let me take a look first.

488
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,360
No way.

489
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,620
She is Zhuang Xinyan.

490
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,720
She can't be that girl.

491
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,090
And she wouldn't lie to me.

492
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,130
Do you really believe that the current woman

493
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,860
is Zhuang Xinyan?

494
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,210
Ms. Zhuang.

495
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,680
If you think

496
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,670
there's something wrong with the draft,

497
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,070
you can correct directly

498
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,620
and add notes.

499
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:44,580
Okay.

500
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,490
I think the lines of this picture

501
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,800
are too simple.

502
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,840
We should rebuild this curve

503
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,930
and these.

504
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,420
Let's go.

505
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,140
President Zhuang wants to see you

506
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,060
right now.

507
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,000
What happened to grandpa?

508
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,420
The car is waiting for you downstairs.

509
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,000
This project...

510
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:30,870
I'll handle it.

511
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,690
[Staff Welfare]

512
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,570
Come on.

513
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,950
Staff welfare.

514
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,900
For free.

515
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,890
-Come on. -Thank you.

516
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,770
It's free. It's free.

517
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,920
It's company welfare.

518
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,050
Feel free to take it.

519
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,810
Come one. It's free.

520
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,440
-Thank you. -Here.

521
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:58,820
Thank you.

522
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,020
The company welfare.

523
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,650
When I think that Nana is in such a good company,

524
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,580
I feel so...

525
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,020
Shen,

526
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,470
I'm afraid it won't be enough later.

527
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,770
Bring in all the rest in the car.

528
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,400
Okay.

529
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,520
This old man

530
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,490
keeps everything to himself.

531
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,170
My life...

532
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,280
Nana.

533
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,670
Nana.

534
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:36,680
Mom?

535
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:40,750
Mom.

536
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,050
Why are you here?

537
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,030
The labor union of your company

538
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,240
ordered over ten boxes of drinks

539
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,770
from our convenience store

540
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,430
and asked me to send them

541
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,070
as staff welfare.

542
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,340
So I brought Shen here.

543
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,070
Company's labor union?

544
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,820
Your company is so nice.

545
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,030
When I think of you

546
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,820
working in such a good company,

547
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,270
I feel relieved.

548
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,100
Mom.

549
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,429
But

550
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,790
there is no labor union in our company.

551
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,929
Impossible.

552
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,250
We have received money via the payment code

553
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,510
on our public account.

554
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,670
They even transferred a few yuan extra.

555
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,380
Really?

556
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,139
Well...

557
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,550
It's free. Come on.

558
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,630
Give it to me.

559
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,450
Nana.

560
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,800
Look at that person.

561
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,950
Is she Manning?

562
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,400
Isn't she studying abroad?

563
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,300
Why is she here?

564
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,610
Did she lie to us

565
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,150
and Shen?

566
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,050
Mom.

567
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,650
She's not Manman.

568
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,660
She is the president of our company.

569
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,810
She is surnamed Zhuang.

570
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,620
Her name is Zhuang Xinyan.

571
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,170
She's just someone

572
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,950
who looks like Manman.

573
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,270
You mean she is...

574
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,400
Ms. Zhuang.

575
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,810
Are you going out?

576
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,310
I'm waiting for you.

577
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:43,950
It's okay.

578
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:44,880
Calm down.

579
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,740
-But they are my...-Go ahead.

580
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,350
Don't look.

581
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,740
Don't look.

582
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,920
I know what you want to do.

583
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,240
Then you should know

584
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,450
what I've guessed.

585
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,290
It doesn't matter.

586
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,400
Then tell me everything

587
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,780
I should know.

588
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:41,830
Okay.

589
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,180
But not here.

590
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,470
Do you dare to come with me?

591
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,720
Manning?
