It was already dark and cloudy that morning.

I clearly remember

136

Xinyan fell down

00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,970
My dad was holding her

00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,750
and wanted to take her to the hospital for dressing the wound.

140

But when they got to the door of the villa,

Auntie Zhuang Meixuan and Mr. Yan's car

142
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,580

on their way to the tour of overseas branches.

144
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,850
Mr. Yan was reported dead on the spot.

145
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,400
Ms. Zhuang Meixuan was missing.

146
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,250
Their son, Yan Yi...

147
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,580
Xinyan passed out from crying.

148
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,140
But President Zhuang immediately ordered

149
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,540
to send her abroad alone.

150
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,950
No one knows

151
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,780
where she was.

152
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,380
She came back later

153
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,550
with her fiancÃ© who has never been seen,

154
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,570
sitting firmly in the position of president of LH Star.

155
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,570
I admire the new president with courage.

156
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,560
But the biggest problem is

157
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,580
she's not surnamed Zhuang.

158
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,140
If she's not surnamed Zhuang,

159
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,530
what's her surname?

160
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,840
It doesn't matter what her surname is.

161
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,640
What matters is you.

162
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,310
Me?

163
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,510
Why did you bring her back?

164
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,610
Why did you push her to this position?

165
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,220
You forced an innocent girl

166
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,960
to take such a big responsibility for Xinyan.

167
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,900
It's not fair for her.

168
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,000
When did this world ever be fair?

169
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,240
You shouldn't have let her take the responsibility

170
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,360
of yours.

171
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,150
Say it again.

172
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:13,960
I won't be afraid

173
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
even I need to say it a hundred times.

174
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,120
But what about you?

175
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,920
Do you dare to

176
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,900
take the ring off your hand?

177
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,850
Yan

178
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,260
Yi.

179
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,670
To cover the scar,

180
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,050
I've been wearing it for 20 years.

181
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,890
So are you ready to give it back to me?

182
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,260
Stop!

183
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,920
Catch me!

184
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,090
Stop running!

185
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,190
Hurry up!

186
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:19,940
Give it to me.

187
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,050
Stop running!

188
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,130
You can't catch me.

189
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,020
Give it back!

190
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,970
Call for help!

191
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,410
Call for help!

192
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,920
Let me go!

193
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,500
You can't solve any problems

194
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,850
by keeping me here.

195
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,220
Even if I don't reveal your identity,

196
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,550
both the House of Zhuang and LH Star

197
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,400
-will know it sooner or later. -What if I kill you?

198
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,160
Yan Yi,

199
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,620
you can't do this.

200
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,170
If something really happened to Xinyan,

201
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,640
you should tell the House of Zhuang honestly,

202
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,240
instead of getting the Shen Manning involved.

203
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,030
How do you know Shen Manning?

204
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,180
I met her in an arts university abroad.

205
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,940
Although I don't believe in doppelganger,

206
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,250
Manning is innocent.

207
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,560
She shouldn't have been involved

208
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,290
in such a dangerous situation.

209
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,080
If you want to do something,

210
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,940
you can tell me.

211
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,290
I can help you find Xinyan.

212
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,310
She's dead!

213
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,950
Do you think I don't want Xinyan back?

214
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,220
I'm not willing to drag a stranger into the House of Zhuang.

215
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,620
Do you think I don't want to tell grandpa

216
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,360
that I'm back?

217
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,500
I can't!

218
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,490
If everyone knows Xinyan is dead,

219
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,740
what will happen to the House of Zhuang?

220
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,500
What will happen to LH Star?

221
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,110
They killed Xinyan.

222
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,070
If I don't find the mastermind,

223
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,000
someone else will be hurt too,

224
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,530
including me,

225
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,780
or maybe you.

226
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,810
That's impossible.

227
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,460
No way.

228
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,470
Let go of me!

229
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,120
I want to see the President Zhuang.

230
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,180
I want to see my dad!

231
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,320
You can't see anyone.

232
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,780
No one

233
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,120
can escape from this whirl anymore.

234
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,670
No one!

235
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,850
What's wrong?

236
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,600
What are you doing?

237
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,620
Why did you shout so loudly?

238
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,970
You are still peeping!

239
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,910
Who wants to peep at you?

240
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,790
Be gentle.

241
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,340
Be gentle.

242
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,120
All right.

243
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,570
All right, get up.

244
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,690
Doctor.

245
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,350
How is it? Is it serious?

246
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,109
Very serious.

247
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,550
If you're late a bit,

248
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,079
the wound will heal itself.

249
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,140
But rabies vaccine is still needed.

250
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,579
Wait.

251
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,040
Do I need an injection?

252
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:18,960
Doctor.

253
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,170
How many injections altogether?

254
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,369
Three shots in total.

255
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Let's take the first vaccine today.

256
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,069
Okay.

257
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,890
Today? Now?

258
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:27,300
Yes.

259
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,920
Can we...

260
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,540
No.

261
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,820
What are you doing?

262
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,530
For the injection of course.

263
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,340
Who told you the vaccine will be on your butt?

264
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,340
Your arm, please.

265
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,400
Are you done?

266
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,130
No.

267
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,390
So slow.

268
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:10,770
Come here.

269
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,190
Time to get the injection.

270
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,630
Come here.

271
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,170
Hurry up.

272
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,480
Are you done getting dressed?

273
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:24,960
Yes.

274
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,620
Wait.

275
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,250
I have something embarrassing to say.

276
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,220
What?

277
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,420
I'm scared of it.

278
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:46,860
Hurry up.

279
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,340
Are you going to get it or not?

280
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,230
I haven't had you injected yet.

281
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,980
You haven't?

282
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:00,890
Doctor.

283
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,640
Hurry!

284
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,660
Meina!

285
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,180
Wait for me.

286
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:14,700
Meina!

287
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,030
I can't walk any further.

288
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,450
The shot hurts so much.

289
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,150
The vaccine is supposed to injected on your arm.

290
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,320
I got it wrong.

291
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,670
No wonder

292
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,710
my arm hurts more.

293
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,790
I think the injection is on your right arm.

294
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,580
Meina.

295
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,950
Let me say one sentence to you.

296
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,010
Just one sentence.

297
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,730
One sentence?

298
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,620
I...

299
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,710
OK, that's enough.

300
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,440
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,680
I shouldn't have been too rashly that day.

302
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,910
I kissed you on purpose

303
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,310
for not letting you talk.

304
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,160
No matter what the reason is,

305
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,020
I didn't give you enough respect.

306
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,010
It's my fault.

307
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,460
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,450
Yuan Shuai and I

309
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,400
came back to help Boss.

310
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,780
Sorry.

311
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,210
I can't tell you the things in details.

312
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,110
But please trust me.

313
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,000
I want to know you.

314
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,600
And I'm serious about making friends with you.

315
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,010
Can you forgive me?

316
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,250
I...

317
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,580
I don't know what you're hiding,

318
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,540
but I'm not interested.

319
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,760
But

320
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,350
when my mom and Uncle Shen went to the company today,

321
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:04,920
I suddenly realized

322
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,650
we were not from the same world.

323
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,460
I was angry about what you did that day.

324
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:09,900
But...

325
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:13,730
Forget it.

326
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,290
Fang Xiang,

327
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,470
we shouldn't be friends.

328
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,120
Why?

329
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,050
You can't even be friends?

330
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,620
Because

331
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,700
I don't want to see you anymore.

332
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,710
Why can't we meet?

333
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,200
Don't you understand?

334
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,370
I don't want to fall for you anymore.

335
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,890
I don't want to be sad alone

336
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:37,920
when you leave.

337
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,240
Alone?

338
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,580
Meina.

339
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,960
We aren't leaving.

340
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,460
The person I like is Yuan Shuai.

341
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:31,970
Grandpa.

342
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,440
Kid.

343
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,430
Come here.

344
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,200
Grandpa.

345
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,830
Why are you up so late?

346
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,440
What about you?

347
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,720
You're still wandering around at this hour.

348
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,450
I couldn't fall asleep,

349
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,580
so I just want to walk around.

350
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,110
What?

351
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,230
You can't even sleep tight

352
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,510
without him?

353
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,390
No... Not like that,

354
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:03,950
Grandpa.

355
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,630
We...

356
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,590
Why didn't the flowers we planted a few weeks ago

357
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,270
grow?

358
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,890
They won't grow.

359
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,500
The efforts we put this season

360
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,140
will be in vain again.

361
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,660
Why?

362
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,790
Is it because we are too busy

363
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,950
to take care of them?

364
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,570
Or...

365
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,500
No.

366
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,480
It's dreary here.

367
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,130
Dreary?

368
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,800
This family is always full of dark tides.

369
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,870
People always have their own thoughts.

370
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,930
Without sunlight,

371
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,940
no one can breathe.

372
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,840
In this kind of environment,

373
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,940
no one can breathe,

374
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,120
let alone these plants.

375
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,350
Grandpa.

376
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:08,910
Flowers

377
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,950
will only bloom in the sun.

378
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,710
We can't force them.

379
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,360
Why do we have to force them?

380
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,540
No.

381
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,230
With sunshine

382
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,500
and water,

383
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,940
you won't wither.

384
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,230
You want this one?

385
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,570
I want to water the flowers.

386
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,410
â«Tick-tock, the second hand goesâ«

387
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,420
â«Every moment it turnsâ«

388
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,100
â«Right nowâ«

389
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,800
â«How are you doing?â«

390
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,420
â«I always think about youâ«

391
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,070
â«When I wake up from my dreamsâ«

392
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,460
â«All stubbornnessâ«

393
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,910
â«Broke down in an instantâ«

394
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,390
â«If I give up everythingâ«

395
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,200
â«And take the riskâ«

396
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,270
â«Will you come back to meâ«

397
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:43,710
â«And go back to the beginning of the story?â«

398
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,830
â«If I'm braveâ«

399
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,770
â«Maybe in the parallel worldâ«

400
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,360
â«My tomorrowâ«

401
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,220
â«It is connected with you againâ«

402
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,060
â«Tick-tock, the second hand goesâ«

403
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,080
â«Every moment it turnsâ«

404
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,790
â«Right nowâ«

405
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,230
It's OK now.

406
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,490
â«How are you doing?â«

407
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,770
Not yet.

408
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,110
â«I always think about youâ«

409
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:35,850
I...

410
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,200
This part of my hair.

411
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,340
And also here.

412
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,760
â«When I wake up from my dreamsâ«

413
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,530
My hair's still very wet.

414
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,160
â«All stubbornnessâ«

415
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,600
â«Broke down in an instantâ«

416
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:52,200
â«If I give up everythingâ«

417
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,310
â«And take the riskâ«

418
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,190
â«Will you come back to meâ«

419
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:04,220
â«And go back to the beginning of the story?â«

420
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,820
â«If I'm braveâ«

421
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,830
â«Maybe in the parallel worldâ«

422
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,300
â«My tomorrowâ«

423
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,740
â«It is connected with you againâ«

424
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,080
â«We areâ«

425
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:30,940
â«No longer like parallel linesâ«

426
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,610
What are you doing?

427
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,150
Nothing.

428
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,280
It's late. Why aren't you going to bed?

429
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,600
I will.

430
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,080
I'll go to bed now.

431
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,650
Uncle Guangyi.

432
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,880
Long time no see.

433
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,760
I came to see you on behalf of my brother.

434
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,120
I was wondering

435
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,870
when your brother can bring you to see me.

436
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,000
I didn't expect you to come over first.

437
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,540
My brother is always troubled

438
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,820
by the work of our company.

439
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,150
I don't want to come with him

440
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,310
and hear him nag

441
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,600
about business again.

442
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,240
I do want to hear him talk about business.

443
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,030
It's been so many years,

444
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,870
the relationship between LH Star and Luminous should be ameliorated now.

445
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,870
You also think

446
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,620
we should ameliorate our relationship?

447
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,160
President Zhuang.

448
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,020
I'm Tang Lin.

449
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,680
I'm here to apologize on behalf of my brother.

450
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,090
You won't kick me out, will you?

451
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,540
I am just wondering who this girl is.

452
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,910
It turns out to be the beloved daughter of the Tang Family.

453
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,370
President Zhuang.

454
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,180
Although my brother

455
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,170
has always wanted to

456
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,160
compete with LH Star in business,

457
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,600
in his heart,

458
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,740
he admires you

459
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,770
and LH Star so much.

460
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,870
We usually meet in various meetings.

461
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,480
Well,

462
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,430
I brought some gifts today

463
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,110
to visit you.

464
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,170
You won't kick me out,

465
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,750
right?

466
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,320
You're a guest when you're here.

467
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,670
How can I kick a guest out?

468
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,000
You're so nice.

469
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,470
I'll visit you

470
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,840
and Uncle Guangyi more often,

471
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,430
okay?

472
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,470
Not a problem.

473
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,450
Tang Lin.

474
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,450
Why is she here?

475
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,090
Be good.

476
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,860
Let go.

477
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:49,920
Good girl. Here.

478
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,860
You brat.

479
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,550
All you do is playing.

480
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,070
Can't you help me with the house chores?

481
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,110
You're not as good as Manning at all.

482
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,080
Juicy Orange.

483
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,540
Come on.

484
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,590
Go playing over there.

485
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:06,950
Mom,

486
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,080
can you stop mentioning Manman?

487
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,580
Look at Uncle Shen.

488
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,290
She's studying abroad.

489
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,920
I wonder what he's worrying about.

490
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,740
Does he really think that Ms. Zhuang

491
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,320
as his daughter?

492
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,290
How can you be sure she's not?

493
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,400
Her grandpa said so.

494
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,010
Why do we still need proof?

495
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,340
I've never seen a naive person like you.

496
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,070
You didn't get any useful experience from life..

497
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,450
Make yourselves at home.

498
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,400
Is this the Last Supper?

499
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,250
Otherwise,

500
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,320
is this a blind date party?

501
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,320
It's a pity that I have a girlfriend already.

502
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,880
Or, is this beauty prepared for

503
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,760
your grandson-in-law?

504
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,560
It's fine if this is a blind date party.

505
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,929
Maybe I can meet someone I like here.

506
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,800
Today is just a family feast.

507
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,139
Linlin visits us on behalf of her brother.

508
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,500
It's a way to resolve the competitions

509
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,710
between our two companies over the years.

510
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,909
As elders,

511
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,030
I should show our hospitality.

512
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,020
Thank you, Uncle Guangyi.

513
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,170
I should thank you.

514
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,719
Linlin brought a lot of gifts today.

515
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,429
Since everyone is home today,

516
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,429
I asked the kitchen to cook them all.

517
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,050
Mom.

518
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,830
Why are they all mangoes?

519
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,060
You are not earning money but mangoes?

520
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,860
You're talking nonsense again.

521
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,590
Yesterday,

522
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,110
two college students came to do the questionnaires.

523
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,440
They insisted on asking

524
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,650
our daughters' likes

525
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,730
and dislikes.

526
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,840
I filled in the form

527
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,940
with your and Manning's preferences.

528
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,450
Later,

529
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,880
they gave me two boxes of mangoes.

530
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,840
I haven't seen

531
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,720
such polite young men for long.

532
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,840
Social surveys?

533
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,850
How can someone do that kind of investigation?

534
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:29,480
Yeah.

535
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,660
Maybe it's

536
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,840
the pre-market research of that gum company again.

537
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,440
It's impossible for them to give mangoes.

538
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,930
You knew Manman was allergic to mango.

539
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,220
I remember one time when she was young, she almost died

540
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,520
because of mangoes.

541
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,370
What?

542
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,780
Don't you like it?

543
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,890
I heard that when you were young,

544
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,500
your favorite food was mixed rice with fruit.

545
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,400
I specially asked people to pick the biggest and best

546
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,630
mangoes from Hainan.

547
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,000
It looks like Miss Zhuang is not going to

548
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,880
make peace with us.

549
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,510
Or do you really have specific reasons

550
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,830
that you can't tell others?

551
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,250
Dr. Tai.

552
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,420
Dr. Tai!

553
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,770
Hurry!

554
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,330
The medical record room...

555
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,300
They're taking

556
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,800
the two girls' medical records and death certificates.

557
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,550
Dr. Tai!

558
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,760
Dr. Tai!

559
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,130
Got it.

560
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,310
Okay.

561
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,810
I'll wait for you to come back.

562
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,330
Miss Zhuang hasn't eaten it yet.

563
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,780
It seems that you really don't like fruit meal.

564
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,510
How about...

565
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,710
I will get allergic if I eat too much of them!

566
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,590
I will get sick.

567
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,920
Manning is allergic to mangoes.

568
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,870
But you're not.

569
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,470
Hurry up and eat them up.

570
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,140
I'll eat it.

571
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,270
After all, this is my favorite fruit rice.

572
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,530
And Miss Tang prepared it in person for me.

573
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,410
Of course I will eat it.
