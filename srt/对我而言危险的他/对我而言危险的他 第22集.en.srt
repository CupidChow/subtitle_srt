[Episode 22]

4
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,610
Xingcheng.

5
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,539
Everything is fine now.

6
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,020
I'll be by your side from now on.

7
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,870
No one will get close to you

8
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,620
and no one will hurt you.

9
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,200
Xingcheng.

10
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,400
I'm here.

11
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,070
Xingcheng.

12
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,710
Do you hear me?

13
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,130
Don't go.

14
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,340
Follow me.

15
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,050
Xingcheng.

16
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,950
Xingcheng.

17
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,130
Do you hear me?

18
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,680
Don't go.

19
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,260
No matter what happens in the future,

20
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,960
I will always

21
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,370
be in your life.

22
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,750
Why did you cover it?

23
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,860
I saw it.

24
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,920
Manning's design manuscript?

25
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,870
It is just the unfinished first draft.

26
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,910
You're so focused.

27
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,570
I thought it was

28
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,040
a premium design draft.

29
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,460
It turns out that Mr. Lin

30
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,610
is not fond of the design,

31
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,210
-but the... -Tang Lin.

32
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,520
Let's be honest.

33
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,070
You still like her.

34
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,210
I don't even know

35
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,420
how I feel about

36
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,390
Shen Manning.

37
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,120
Maybe in Overseas Arts University,

38
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,080
when she ran to me

39
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,120
through the glow of the setting sun.

40
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,710
I thought

41
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,210
I liked her.

42
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,110
But since she and Yan Xingcheng returned to the House of Zhuang,

43
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,300
I watched them step by step

44
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,520
fell into deeper vortex,

45
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,320
I didn't know

46
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,810
how I felt about her.

47
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,000
She was totally different from

48
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,290
the person I imagined.

49
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,390
Although they are both bright

50
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,830
and kind,

51
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,430
Shen Manning is stronger

52
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,110
and tougher.

53
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,590
Indeed.

54
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,510
Both of them

55
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,250
are not common.

56
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,900
A person like her who is persistent,

57
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,740
tolerant

58
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,980
and beautiful

59
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,900
never belongs to me.

60
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,880
Just like her design draft,

61
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,420
it is destined to be together

62
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,720
with Yan Xingcheng.

63
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,920
I didn't believe

64
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,520
that people are meant to be together.

65
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,610
Until I accompanied them all the way,

66
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,030
I believe

67
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,590
Shen Manning and Yan Xingcheng

68
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,270
are destined.

69
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,430
Even I have figured it out.

70
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,120
Do you still want to trap yourself in there?

71
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,420
How about I

72
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,520
give you a good chance?

73
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,350
A good chance?

74
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,710
VS-level International Design Competition.

75
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,490
How did you get it?

76
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,310
I applied to the committee

77
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,430
with your name.

78
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,040
They directly classify your resume

79
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,950
to the finals.

80
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,240
Really?

81
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,060
I told you long ago.

82
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:17,690
Mr. Lin,

83
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:18,920
I have faith in you.

84
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,750
You heartless girl.

85
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,960
You didn't reply my WeChat

86
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:07,750
nor answer my calls.

87
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,300
What is wrong with you?

88
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,420
Why are you running?

89
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,850
Am I that scary?

90
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,280
No.

91
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,150
Fang Xiang.

92
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,540
Hello.

93
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,990
Did you eat something wrong today?

94
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,750
No.

95
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,289
I just ate those on the table.

96
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,100
That is all.

97
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,490
Don't...

98
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,330
What is this?

99
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,180
You drew this?

100
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,540
Prince of the Wilderness.

101
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,140
Is this

102
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,300
me?

103
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:28,610
It is cute.

104
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,090
Right?

105
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,340
You also think it is cute, right?

106
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,510
What do you mean?

107
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,940
What are you drawing?

108
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,110
Wolf King and his legends.

109
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,250
Although I have no right

110
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,990
to interfere with your drawing,

111
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,610
why did you draw Boss,

112
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,700
Yuan Shuai

113
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,360
and me?

114
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,150
Because they are handsome.

115
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,450
Look.

116
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,240
Wolf King, Yan Xingcheng,

117
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,830
and Wolf General, Yuan Shuai

118
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,690
travelled

119
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,300
thousands of kilometers aross the wilderness.

120
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,160
By themselves, they have built

121
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,520
a world that is uniquely theirs.

122
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,700
This is a legend among legends!

123
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,220
The two of them are handsome.

124
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,490
What about me?

125
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,270
You?

126
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,100
You are here.

127
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,320
-Just this... -Calm down.

128
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,960
Let me explain.

129
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,200
You are the only bloodline left by the former Wolf King.

130
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,000
You are the Prince of the Wilderness who is evolving.

131
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,740
You met Wolf King and Wolf General accidentally

132
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,750
and became close.

133
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,520
But you were assassinated by the villain.

134
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,320
So Wolf King and Wolf General

135
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,650
stepped on countless villains' corpses

136
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,780
to the palace

137
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,460
and saved you who was vulnerable.

138
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,970
He...

139
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:46,990
saved

140
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,010
me who was vulnerable?

141
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,160
You are the center of the story.

142
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,930
Everyone is around you.

143
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,870
Don't lie to me.

144
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,210
I'm so tall.

145
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,730
You drew me like a baby.

146
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,470
Although it is cute,

147
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,870
the two of them can't

148
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,000
be more handsome than me.

149
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,340
They are indeed more handsome than you are.

150
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,760
Stop drawing.

151
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,910
Give me back my sketchbook.

152
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:19,950
Give it back!

153
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:20,610
-Give it to me. -No.

154
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,060
Give it to me.

155
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:22,890
No.

156
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,400
Give it to me.

157
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,440
What are you looking at?

158
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,520
Change it!

159
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,070
I will.

160
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,310
Mr. Baby Wolf,

161
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,450
I'm changing you now and

162
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,840
I am making you look wiser and more powerful.

163
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,030
If you don't change it nicely,

164
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,940
I won't let you off!

165
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,160
So you also like to cut them open

166
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,150
when you eat hamburgers.

167
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,430
I thought I was the only one who had this habit.

168
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,630
I'm not that pretentious.

169
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,100
I cut it for you

170
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,350
so that you won't taking choking as an excuse

171
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,560
to not changing the drawing.

172
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:41,990
-Come on. -Fang…

173
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:48,860
How is it?

174
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,110
Is it good?

175
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,070
Xingcheng.

176
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,040
It is time for your medicine.

177
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,270
The doctor said

178
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,360
you haven't fully recovered.

179
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,860
I'm afraid you won't feel well at night

180
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,430
if you stop taking medicine.

181
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,400
Let's take the medicine.

182
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,600
Xingcheng.

183
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,050
Xingcheng, don't do this.

184
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,800
Tell me

185
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,600
if you have something.

186
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,220
Tell me everything

187
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,570
in your heart.

188
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,670
Don't keep it to yourself.

189
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:04,890
Xingcheng.

190
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,210
Look at me.

191
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,490
Look at me.

192
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,420
Xingcheng.

193
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,490
I beg you.

194
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,530
Don't do this.

195
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,560
I'm worried about you.

196
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,090
Xingcheng.

197
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,970
[He is not in a good state. I want you to come here to have dinner together with him.]

198
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,930
♫I remembered your smile again♫

199
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,230
♫Long time no see♫

200
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:02,090
♫I was longing for a hug in my dream♫

201
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,970
♫But the dream could not be true♫

202
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,150
♫What I said to myself♫

203
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,240
♫Have you heard it?♫

204
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:29,480
♫The past taught people to grow up♫

205
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,440
♫I would not listen♫

206
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,630
♫Thinking about your face If you're just hibernating♫

207
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,780
♫Give me one more moment♫

208
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,380
♫Missed your face and wanted to pay you back♫

209
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,860
♫Why not forever?♫

210
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,610
♫I hate my jokes before♫

211
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,000
♫How much time is delayed?♫

212
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,950
Let me tell you, Meina.

213
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:24,840
This is very delicious.

214
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,950
Look, does it look like you?

215
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,650
Stop drawing.

216
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,050
Come, Tang Lin, have a seat.

217
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,780
Are you cold?

218
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,830
I'm fine.

219
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,590
Sir,

220
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,040
I have a question.

221
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,520
I don't know if I should ask.

222
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,950
Are you two...

223
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,630
-No. -Yes.

224
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:55,890
-Yes. -No.

225
00:18:59,010 --> 00:18:59,490
Well.

226
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,590
Why didn't I notice

227
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,810
that the two of you are so interesting?

228
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,390
You didn't even know what I wanted to ask

229
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,300
before one of you said "Yes",

230
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,260
and the other said "No".

231
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,180
Of course I knew what you wanted to ask.

232
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,280
About relationship, no.

233
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,150
About work, yes.

234
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:10,780
Is that clear?

235
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,440
You're indeed a noble miss

236
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,860
and the CEO of the studio.

237
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,230
Your logic is very clear.

238
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,330
But I might never fully understand it in my life.

239
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,080
However,

240
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,750
my Simba of the Wilderness needs a sister.

241
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,520
I can draw you in it.

242
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,180
Don't draw.

243
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,120
I said no!

244
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,880
What sister?

245
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:40,930
If you continue,

246
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,270
I'll break off with you.

247
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,690
Really?

248
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,560
I'd love to.

249
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,500
I must draw.

250
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,650
Stop drawing.

251
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,590
Then I'll draw on your face.

252
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,450
Who would draw on people's face?

253
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:55,880
On my face?

254
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,470
Let me draw an eye shadow for you.

255
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,060
No.

256
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,630
Yellow eye shadow.

257
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,530
No, then you draw here.

258
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,270
-You draw here. -I'll draw it.

259
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,070
Make it look cool.

260
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,420
That's impossible.

261
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,490
Then stop drawing.

262
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,810
Sorry

263
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,740
for keeping you waiting.

264
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,240
Cheers! Cheers!

265
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,700
The VS-level International Design competition

266
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,070
you just mentioned

267
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,990
is a high-level jewelry design competition.

268
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:31,870
Yes.

269
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,960
Mufan

270
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,060
got the qualification of the highest level.

271
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,980
The highest level?

272
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,650
Let me tell you.

273
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,090
When I was in college,

274
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,110
I heard from the professor that

275
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,630
getting the highest level of qualification means

276
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,750
skipping the preliminary and second exams.

277
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,970
Mr. Lin,

278
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,280
congratulations.

279
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,510
You can go straight to the final.

280
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:52,740
Manning,

281
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:53,960
I think

282
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,170
you can give it a try.

283
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:57,470
Me?

284
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,550
I think Mufan's suggestion is good.

285
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,590
Are you interested in joining the competition?

286
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,510
You can register in my studio.

287
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,270
I'll sign you up.

288
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,470
Thank you.

289
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,440
I didn't expect that

290
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,320
I just helped Mr. Lin

291
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,520
do some closing work,

292
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,620
then I was affirmed by the boss of the studio

293
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,220
and the design director.

294
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,880
But

295
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,290
I want to spend some time

296
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,040
with Xingcheng.

297
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,320
So, Mufan

298
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,360
should go.

299
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,500
Manman.

300
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,260
I haven't eaten anything yet and

301
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,390
you already fed me a pot of PDA.

302
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,320
Eat up.

303
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,940
Are you trying to choke me with food?

304
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,370
Or do you want to choke me to death with water?

305
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:06,530
Thank you.

306
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,020
Let's have another toast.

307
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,550
Cheers!

308
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,430
Cheers!

309
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,660
Cheers.

310
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,020
Are you tired?

311
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,360
I'm sorry. Are you mad at me?

312
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,110
It is cold, isn't it?

313
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,930
Your hands are so cold.

314
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,580
Let's get a coat.

315
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,910
You really stuffed it?

316
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,610
Let's go.

317
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,740
I'll get him a coat.

318
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,210
Cheers.

319
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,810
Come on. Cheers.

320
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,300
Cheers.

321
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,090
Cheers!

322
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,690
Cheers! Cheers!

323
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,410
Cheers, designer.

324
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,400
Fang Xiang,

325
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,250
Slow down.

326
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,600
How can I catch up with you?

327
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,280
Handsome Fang.

328
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,590
Wait.

329
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:17,910
Your legs are so long.

330
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,430
How can I catch up with you?

331
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,650
Give me the sketchbook.

332
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,710
I just finished drawing.

333
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,850
I haven't kept my manuscript.

334
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,210
How about this?

335
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,260
I'll go back

336
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,400
to change your persona

337
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,470
and make you look like your boss.

338
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,010
What do you think?

339
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,530
Please.

340
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,130
Actually,

341
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,280
I don't care

342
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,980
whether you draw me as a baby wolf,

343
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,760
or a weak and bullied image.

344
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,850
Whatever.

345
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,370
As long as you are happy,

346
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,080
I'm fine with anything.

347
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,360
Meina.

348
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,460
I have a question to ask you.

349
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,820
What is it?

350
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:07,780
Well,

351
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,890
do you still like Yuan Shuai?

352
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,160
I…

353
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,090
It is OK.

354
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,670
Yuan Shuai is excellent.

355
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,880
He is handsome.

356
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,030
He is cool.

357
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,980
He knows boxing.

358
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,660
He can give you a sense of security.

359
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,440
It is normal that you like him.

360
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,620
I...

361
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,620
Yuan Shuai is good,

362
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,470
But

363
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,730
do you think you are inferior to him?

364
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,150
You're smart,

365
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,270
humorous,

366
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,800
tall,

367
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,070
and cute.

368
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,680
You care about others' feelings.

369
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:57,890
Besides,

370
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,910
you're a top computer player.

371
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,170
Meina.

372
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,600
Do you really think

373
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:05,700
I'm not bad at all?

374
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:09,760
Fang Xiang.

375
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,290
You are not bad at all.

376
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,560
Nana.

377
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,170
No matter what you think,

378
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,560
today,

379
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,440
I have something to tell you.

380
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,170
What is it?

381
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,230
Nana.

382
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,190
I like you.

383
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,180
I like you.

384
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,250
I like you.

385
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,670
I like you for

386
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,900
100 times more than you could imagine.

387
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:43,900
1,000 times.

388
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,390
I can protect you

389
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,440
and take care of you.

390
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,630
As long as you are happy,

391
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,730
I can do anything.

392
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:50,950
So,

393
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,780

You saw it?

450
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,670
What?

451
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,270
Them.

452
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,620
Tang Lin.

453
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,810
I have a question for you.

454
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,150
When Manning took Yan Xingcheng

455
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,090
away from you,

456
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,810
how did you feel?

457
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,330
Do you want to hear the truth or lie?

458
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,600
The lie

459
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,250
is that I didn't care.

460
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,630
The people chasing me are lining up from here

461
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,450
to a hundred thousand miles away.

462
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,540
The truth is that

463
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,250
it hurts.

464
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,160
Because

465
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,560
when you really love someone,

466
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,290
but you have to understand

467
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,590
you need to give up,

468
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,630
it really hurts.

469
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:57,850
But

470
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,990
this pain can make you understand

471
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,800
the true meaning of love,

472
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,170
right?

473
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,120
Besides,

474
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,010
have you forgotten what you said to me?

475
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,490
What I said?

476
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,180
There are countless things in life

477
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,060
that are not as good as they should be.

478
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,300
If you can't love someone you want to love,

479
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,270
it is just one of them.

480
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:33,680
I didn't expect

481
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,270
you still remember.

482
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,990
Of course I do.

483
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,910
After you told me these,

484
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,730
I realized

485
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,530
life is vast

486
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,390
and the world is vast.

487
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,330
Instead of letting yourself fall into

488
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,190
such a bad situation,

489
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,820
why don't you look up at the world

490
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,980
and your life?

491
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,010
Only then will you realise

492
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,150
when you move forward,

493
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,940
you might see a different view

494
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,040
and meet different people and lives.

495
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:03,520
Xingcheng.

496
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,780
I didn't find a thick coat.

497
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,760
Xingcheng.

498
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,100
[Funeral of former president of the House of Zhuang was completed. LH Star Group changed ownership again]

499
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,470
Xingcheng.

500
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:43,850
Xingcheng.

501
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,200
Xingcheng.

502
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,520
What are you thinking?

503
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,230
Everything that happened.

504
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,170
It is all in the past.

505
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,130
Really?

506
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,570
My parents passed away.

507
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,260
Xinyan was gone too.

508
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,780
LH Star fell into someone else's hands.

509
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,450
Even grandpa

510
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,840
also left.

511
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,350
I don't know why it became like this.

512
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,100
I've waited for so many years.

513
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,790
I've made full preparations.

514
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,909
I thought when I came back,

515
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,760
I could get everything I wanted back.

516
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,090
But in the end,

517
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,060
what I wanted to protect

518
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,230
are all gone.

519
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,320
Don't think like that.

520
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,540
It was not your fault.

521
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,560
Don't be trapped in it.

522
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,500
If I was the one who died

523
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,030
in the car accident 17 years ago...

524
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:00,830
Yan Xingcheng.

525
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,240
Don't say that.

526
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,530
I know.

527
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:22,920
Today...

528
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,010
Today, grandpa's funeral

529
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,370
has shocked you a lot.

530
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,130
But

531
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,130
there are many people around you.

532
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,810
By your side,

533
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,360
you have Fang Xiang,

534
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,250
Yuan Shuai,

535
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,600
Mufan,

536
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,450
and Tang Lin.

537
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,570
You didn't lose everything.

538
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,150
You didn't lose.

539
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,640
You still have us.

540
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,170
You have me.

541
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,890
Grandpa is gone.

542
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,240
I feel sad too.

543
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,040
But are you sure

544
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,790
you want to remain depressed

545
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,430
and give up?

546
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,260
I...

547
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,290
I'm sorry

548
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,460
about my dad.

549
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,680
But are you going to give up like this?

550
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,030
Are you going to give up

551
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,790
and give away the House of Zhuang?

552
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,870
When I came back with you to the House of Zhuang,

553
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,600
I never thought

554
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,280
you would give up.

555
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,350
In my heart,

556
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,240
you are as strong as Xinyan.

557
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,230
You won't let innocent people fall into the whirlpool.

558
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,440
You won't give up easily

559
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,290
on finding the truth and the murderer behind everything.

560
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:30,990
Yan Xingcheng,

561
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,220
you won't give away the House of Zhuang.

562
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,680
You won't believe the rumours.

563
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,230
You won't give up

564
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,060
on finding out the truth of your parents' car accident,

565
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,270
right?

566
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,610
Shen Manning.

567
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,500
Xingcheng.

568
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,090
Let's go back to the House of Zhuang.

569
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,550
I'll accompany you.

570
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,520
Let's go back to LH Star.

571
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,520
I...

572
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,400
No matter what danger

573
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,310
or difficulties,

574
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,120
I will stand with you forever.

575
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,430
♫Falling in love with the most dangerous person♫

576
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,420
♫I can't let go♫

577
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,210
♫Oh, forget it♫

578
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,680
♫Meeting the most dangerous person♫

579
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,100
♫I can't turn him down♫

580
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,580
♫This love drama♫

581
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,090
♫He is the most dangerous♫

582
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,950
♫The concern left for me♫

583
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,740
♫Oh, forget it♫

584
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,170
Shen Manning.

585
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,200
♫Leave the most dangerous place♫

586
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,650
♫But I've already fallen♫

587
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,970
♫He might know too♫

588
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,750
I love you.

589
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:15,950
You...

590
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:16,830
You...

591
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:19,870
What did you say?

592
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,050
I love you.

593
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,690
I never thought

594
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,950
I'd meet a girl like you.

595
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,640
I never thought

596
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,140
I'd have such feelings.

597
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,680
I thought I wouldn't love anyone else.

598
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,050
But Shen Manning,

599
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,850
I love you.

600
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,720
Say it again.

601
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,410
I love you.

602
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,420
♫Tick-tock, the second hand goes♫

603
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,590
Say it again.

604
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,390
♫Every moment it turns♫

605
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,120
♫Right now♫

606

I love you so much.

607

♫How are you doing?♫

608
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,590
I can't hear enough.

609
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,600
Say it 100 times, 1,000 times.

610
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:42,430
♫I always think about you♫

611

00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:09,150
♫No longer like parallel lines♫

633
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,670
Today is a good day.

634
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,190
I have a gift for you.

635
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,090
What gift?

636
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,330
I don't

637
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:34,980
need this anymore.

638
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,270
But

639
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,680
if you wear my ring,

640
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,320
you'll be mine.

641
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,110
OK.

642
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,220
I see, Mr. Yan.

643
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,030
I'm sorry

644
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,240
for making you worry during this period of time.

645
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,640
I promise

646
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,770
I will start over.

647
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,330
I will return to LH Star and the House of Zhuang

648
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,480
to find my identity

649
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,990
and  the truth.

650
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,750
After I finish everything,

651
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,420
we'll leave here

652
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,510
and find a place you like

653
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:29,550
to live a peaceful

654
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,470
and simple life.

655
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,140
Okay.

656
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:35,960
As long as you like,

657
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:37,930
I'll go anywhere with you.

658
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,990
Why did you come all the way here?

659
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,010
What brings you here?

660
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,750
I have a special gift for you.

661
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:20,110
A gift?

662
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,000
This is the nursing home, right?

663
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,540
Why did you bring me here?

664
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,770
There is someone very important

665
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:39,050
that you need to meet in person.
