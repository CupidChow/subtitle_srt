What are you doing?

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,880
If I wanted the LH Star,

6
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,620
I wouldn't have to married you.

7
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,700
You have no right to know what I want.

8
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,520
Just be Zhuang Xinyan.

9

If it happens again,

10
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,930
I will never

12

I finally graduated.

13
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,510
I'm finally home.

14
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,060
But

15
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,290
I don't think Manman's back yet.

16
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,850
She hasn't replied a single message of mine.

17

What are you doing, Manman?

18
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,850
Fine.

19
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,030
Let's wait and see.

20
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,360
I'll teach you a lesson when you come back.

Did you miss your Sister Manman?

31

She...

32

has forgotten us.

33

Look at you!

34
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,370
You've been in college for four years.

35
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,970
You haven't improved at all.

36
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,290
Can you stop mentioning Manning now?

37
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,810
You'll make Uncle Shen sad again,

38
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,230
you know?

39
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:10,880

53

You'd better plan for your job

54
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,840
at present.

55
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,909
Don't always draw with a notebook all day.

56
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:42,470
Can you make a living as a cartoonist?

57
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,240
Why can't a cartoonist make a living?

58
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,400
Besides,

59
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,580
how do you know I can't find a job?

60
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,030
Yesterday,

61
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,560
I've got an offer from a company.

62
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,950
Meina, you've found a job?

63
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,650
Yes, Uncle Shen.

64
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,600
I attended an online interview before.

65
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,460
It's a big jewelry design studio.

66
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,640
The boss is amazing.

67
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,710
I heard he won many international gold awards  for design.

68
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,240
I thought if I could work there for a few years,

69
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,430
maybe I can become

70
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,670
a jewelry designer too.

71
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,430
You should

72
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,150
get through the internship first.

73
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:17,840

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,480
I wish Manning could be as obedient as you.

76
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,940
If she could come back early

77
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,420
and get a job successfully,

78
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,350
I wouldn't have to worry about her.

79
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,510
Don't worry.

80
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,230
When she comes back from her study trip,

81
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,290
she will accompany you immediately.

82
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,460
I hope so.

83
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:40,790
By the way,

84
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,320
Manman asked me to bring her graduation works

85
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
and show them you.

86
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:49,600
Look.

87
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,730
It's so well drawn.

88
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,790
How amazing she is.

89
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,100
Where are you going?

90
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,280
I shouldn't have asked,

91
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,110
right?

92
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,170
You just need to remember

93
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,230
the purpose of your return to the House of Zhuang.

94
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,960
I will do

95
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,740
what I should do.

96
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,890
Are you going out?

97
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,010

President's condition suddenly deteriorated.

101
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,000
Send him to the hospital now!

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,130
Director Chen.

103
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,650
How is President?

104
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,570
Have you seen the pathological examination report

105
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,490
of him?

106
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,790
President insisted on conservative treatment.

107
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,730
Now, he's diagnosed with severe renal failure.

108
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,130
So...

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,070
President

110
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,000
needs to stay in the hospital from now on?

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,700
Based on the current situation,

112
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
President must stay in the hospital

113
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,070
for a comprehensive system treatment.

114
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,470
His condition has been changing so quickly.

115
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,870
As your attending doctor,

116
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,000
I have a necessary suggestion for you.

117
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:46,960
Go ahead.

118
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,170
I hope all your family members should stay in the hospital

119
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,670
and leave your blood samples.

120
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,330
In this way,

121
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,400
we can carry out the kidney transplant matching

122
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,800
among relatives for him.

123
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,160
If there is a suitable match among relatives,

124
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,330
we can immediately

125
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,290
perform the kidney transplant

126
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,970
for President.

127
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
A transplant?

128
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,260
You mean...

129
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,930
anyone who is in the immediate family of

130
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,230
President Zhuang

131
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,820
needs to do the match?

132
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,070
Yes.

133
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,080
The match between immediate blood relatives

134
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,940
is much higher than that of stranger donors.

135
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,730
So I hope the whole family

136
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,070
comes to the hospital in advance

137
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,130
for blood samples.

138
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,020
OK.

139
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,960
Get ready for it.

How is it going?

143
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,790
It's been too long.

144
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,640
It's hard to find the car back then

145
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,100
only based on a car number.

146
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,490
But based on the comprehensive review after I came back this time,

147
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,510
Yuan Shuai and I found something else.

148
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,230
As for Miss Xinyan's car accident

149
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,300
a few months ago,

150
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,980
I found that the hijackers and the ones who crashed on them

151
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,270
may not be

152
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,760
the same group of people.

153
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,190
We found out

154
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,150
where this truck came from, went to,

155
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,810
and its last dismantled spot.

156
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,800
We have sufficient evidence to show

157
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,180
that the car owner and the man in black

158
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,590
who took Miss Manning away

159
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,990
were not the same peaple.

160
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,160
That means there was more than one person

161
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,690
who attacked them.

162
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,470
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

163
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,300
If it happens again,

164

Zhuang Xinyan, you weren't a coward when you were young.

you fought against me all the time.

177
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,000
You hit your head and bled,

178
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,810
but you didn't even blink.

179
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,350
How come

180
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,270
you can't even talk

181
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,110
without a man?

182
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,650
Are you Zhuang Xinyan?

183
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,130
Are you the real Zhuang Xinyan?

184
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,350
Are you...

185
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,590
Give me back my phone.

186
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,250
Didn't you hear me?

187
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,960
Give me back my phone!

188
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,580
Don't put on airs!

189
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,720
Your whole family is dead,

190
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,810
leaving you alone.

191
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,120
Do you think

192
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,640
you can take away the entire LH Star

193
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,630
just because you brought some unknown men?

194
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,460
Dream on!

195
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:36,810
Also,

196
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,450
I advise you to be clear.

197
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,960
It'll be fine if you have something to do with the House of Zhuang.

198
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,890
But if you don't,

199
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,380
I won't let you go,

200
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,670
including everyone

201
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,280
around you.

202
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:35,630
Come on.

203
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,280
Draw mine first.

204
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,380
I'll show you

205
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,540
who is willing to sacrifice everything for grandpa.

206
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,120
And who should be the real heir to LH Star?

207
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,270
Come here.

208
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,920
Roll up your sleeves, please.

209
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,580
Roll up your sleeves.

210
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,490
Wait.

211
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,160
I...

212
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,620
I have...

213
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,790
the trypanophobia.

214
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,750
Miss Zhuang.

215
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,710
It won't hurt.

216
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,030
How is the House of Zhuang now?

217
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,710
They should be fine.

218
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,630
A few cars went out just now.

219
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,150
Where is Shen Manning?

220
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,750
Show me her shared location.

221
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:11,920
Boss.

222
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,710
She went out with the Zhuang Family.

223
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,340
She called you a dozen times.

224
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,830
She just sent me a message.

225
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,150
President's condition worsened.

226
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,280
Everyone went to Heng Sheng Hospital.

227
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,850
President has the renal failure.

228
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,620
But if she goes to Heng Sheng Hospital...

229
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,340
Heng Sheng Hospital is famous for organ transplants.

230
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,420
What's more famous is its DNA analysis...

231
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,450
Fang Xiang, switch to our system.

232
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,630
Show me the image of the biggest VIP ward

233
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,960
of Heng Sheng Hospital.

234
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,480
Boss.

235
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,240
They are drawing blood samples for Miss Xinyan.

236
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,770
Fang Xiang.

237
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,800
Follow Shen Manning's position.

238
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,060
Yuan Shuai, follow me.

239
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:38,980
It's enough.

240
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,700
She's not in good health since she was young.

241
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,760
Don't draw so much.

242
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,060
After so many years,

243
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,170
it's still your Brother Lin who loves you the most.

244
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,120
♫Tick-tock, the second hand goes♫

245
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,130
♫Every moment it turns♫

♫I always think about you♫

249
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,010
Sorry.

250
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,850
Xinyan has the trypanophobia.

251
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,780
♫when I wake up from my dreams♫

252
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,170
Let me take her out for a rest.

00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,180
♫All stubbornness♫

254
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,620
♫Broke down in an instant♫

♫If I give up everything♫

256
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,250
Xingcheng.

257
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,110
Keep silent.

258
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,910
♫And take the risk♫

259
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,720
♫Will you come back to me♫

260
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,730
What should I do?

261
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,090
They just drew my blood.

262
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,390
-If my blood type... -Don't be afraid.

263
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:11,400
♫And go back to the beginning of the story?♫

264
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,320
-But my blood... -I'm here to handle it.

265
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,560
Excuse me.

266
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,310
Blood samples!

267
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,580
What happened here?

268
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,070
Roll up my sleeves for me.

269
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,490
Hurry up.

270
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,070
Roll up my sleeves for me.

271
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,190
What are you going to do?

272
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,060
Mix your blood with mine

273
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,670
so that this blood sample can't be tested.

274
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,670
Use your blood?

275
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:36,910
Otherwise,

276
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,850
you want them to test your DNA?

277
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,000
♫Falling in love with the most dangerous person♫

278
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,990

00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,310

289
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,220
What's going on?

290
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:31,300
Drink it.

291
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,890
Is the matter in hospital settled?

292
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,150
Are you suspecting me,

293
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,230
or the ability of  Yuan Shuai and Fang Xiang?

294
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,320
I'm not suspecting you.

295
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,560
I'm so scared.

296
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,980
I'm drawn blood today.

297
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,760
And what's next?

298
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,860
We will try to

299
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,700
intervene the testing results.

300
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,240
They won't get your DNA through comparisons.

301
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,450
I've told you

302
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,100
what kind of place

303
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,990
is LH Star and the House of Zhuang?

304
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,150
It won't be the first time

305
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,480
or the last time.

306
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,260
You mean...

307
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,510
there will be a next time?

308
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,200
Before you become the real owner of LH Star and the House of Zhuang,

309
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,460
they will test your background

310
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,070
again and again.

311
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,970
So you'd better adjust your emotions,

312
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,340
forget everything that happened before,

313
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,750
become Zhuang Xinyan

314
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,390
and the real owner of LH Star and the House of Zhuang.

315
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,040
What if I can't?

316
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,430
What if

317
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,020
I can't become Zhuang Xinyan?

318
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,500
What if I can't be

319
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,930
the owner of LH Star and the House of Zhuang?

320
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,800
What do you want to say?

321
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,690
I want to say...

322
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:52,460
I...

323
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,430
I want to say I can't make it.

324
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,190
I really can't!

325
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,080
Yes, Zhuang Xinyan and I

326
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,780
look exactly the same.

327
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,720
But I'm not Zhuang Xinyan.

328
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,090
I'm just an ordinary girl.

329
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,040
I'm just from an ordinary family.

330
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,390
My dad and I

331
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,370
have been living like this.

332
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,070
How could I be the owner of the House of Zhuang

333
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,840
and the LH Star Group?

334
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,200
Yan Xingcheng, I beg you.

335
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,020
Please let me go.

336
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,850
I really...

337
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,380
I'm really scared.

338
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,510
I really can't make it.

339
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,240
I beg you.

340
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,380
Do you know where we are?

341
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,310
Do you know we've come this far?

342
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,870
Now you want to give up?

343
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,160
Do you know what will happen if you leave?

344
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,270
I...

345
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,830
I don't know.

346
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,180
I really...

347
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,090
I really can't make it.

348
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,310
I can't continue.

349
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,570
I'm so scared.

350
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:03,750
I...

351
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,790
If I continue,

352
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,430
I won't be able to become Zhuang Xinyan,

353
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,190
I will also...

354
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,770
I will also hurt everyone.

355
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,380
I'll find a way to repay

356
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,350
what I owe you.

357
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,710
I will repay you definitely.

358
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,990
I'm sure I will!

359
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,670
I got Xinyan's corneas.

360
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,000
The corneas I owe her...

361
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,750
Just take them back.

362
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,870
Take them back?

363
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,590
Tell me how to take them back.

364
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,450
Can you bring her back to life?

365
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,400
Or you die for her now?

366
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,600
♫I remembered your smile again♫

367
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,900
♫Long time no see♫

368
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:30,750
♫I was longing for a hug in my dream♫

369
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,640
♫But the dream could not be true♫

370
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,820
♫What I said to myself♫

371
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,910
♫Have you heard it?♫

372
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:58,150
♫The past taught people to grow up♫

373
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,100
♫I would not listen♫

374
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:11,290
♫Thinking about your face If you're just hibernating♫

375
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,290
Take your passport.

376
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,780
Fly back to arts university tomorrow morning.

377
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,450
♫Give me one more moment♫

378
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,410
From the first second you leave here,

379
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,570
you're no longer Zhuang Xinyan.

380
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,050
♫Missed your face and wanted to pay you back♫

381
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,110
Everything about the House of Zhuang and LH Star

382
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,570
has nothing to do with you.

383
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,890
No matter what happens tomorrow in LH Star,

384
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:30,530
♫Why not forever?♫

385
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,000
don't come back.

386
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,090
Or I'll be the first one kill you.

387
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,460
Got it?

388
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,280
♫I hate my jokes before♫

389
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,170
Yes...

390
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,700
I got it...

391
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,670
♫How much time is delayed?♫

392
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:02,910
♫If you could come again♫

393
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,860
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you.

394
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,780
The blood samples were sent to the Testing Center.

395
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,120
The results will be out in two days.

396
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,320
It was in a mess in the corridor just now.

397
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,480
Are the blood samples still be used?

398
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,070
I'm sorry.

399
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,870
It's my fault.

400
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:31,740
No way.

401
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,060
I'll take Zhuang Xinyan here

402
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,860
and have her drawn blood again.

403
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,520
Mr. Zhuang.

404
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,380
What?

405
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,750
Even you are opposed to me?

406
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,470
Miss Xinyan has been living alone for so many years.

407
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,150
She's indeed not in good health.

408
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,820
She had been drawn so much blood.

409
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,230
I'm afraid it's inappropriate

410
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,230
to bring her back.

411
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,120
I really didn't notice her charm.

412
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,900
She just came back for less than a week.

413
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,860
Not only did she

414
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,150
fascinate the men around her,

415
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,550
but you're fascinated too, aren't you?

416
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,250
Mr. Zhuang.

417
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,430
I'm just being objective.

418
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,170
Objective?

419
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,900
Mufan is right.

420
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,370
He has been Miss Xinyan's playmate since childhood.

421
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,520
Of course he knows her health well.

422
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,950
She has been drawn so much blood here.

423
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,280
It's inappropriate

424
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,340
to take her back.

425
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,370
-Uncle Guangyi. -That's enough.

426
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,240
It's been a long day.

427
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,460
Everyone is tired.

428
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,840
Go back and rest.

429
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,910
Mom.

430
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,990
Can't you hear me?

431
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,250
Fine.

432
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,790
I'll let her go today.

433
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,070
I'll wait for the result from the testing center.

434
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,040
I'd like to see

435
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,470
what she can do indeed.

436
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,020
On the general meeting of shareholders of LH Star next week,

437
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,200
I'll let her know

438
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,140
who the real owner of LH Star and the House of Zhuang is.

439
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,120
Boss.

440
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,610
Change to Plan B

441
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,860
immediately.
