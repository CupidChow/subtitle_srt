00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,479
Fang Xiang.

5
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,830
Any new clues?

6
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,970
I'm still sorting out clues.

7
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:44,890
Yuan Shuai.

8
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,520
Some points of time match up.

9
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,410
You must check every clue,

10
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,250
name and place

11
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,250
carefully.

12
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,090
Don't miss any point.

13
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,570
Otherwise, the evidence can't be linked up

14
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,030
and they'll take advantage of the loophole.

15
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,700
But boss,

16
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
it's still weird.

17
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,090
Many clues can't be linked up.

18
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,220
17 years ago,

19
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,710
many documents were lost.

20
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,030
Even if Yuan Shuai

21
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,820
got back the old documents last time,

22
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,080
it's still not enough.

23
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,440
The previous documents and the existing ones

24
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,370
can't be merged.

25
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,440
Of course the case 17 years ago

26
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,970
can't be merged

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,400
with the recent case.

28
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,150
Right.

29
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,320
But maybe there is

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,350
a hidden clue.

31
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,079
As long as we find the lead,

32
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,300
maybe

33
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,610
we can find the murderer of the car accident

34
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,450
17 years ago.

35
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,590
Besides,

36
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,910
did anything happen to

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,079
that transportation company 17 years ago?

38
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,329
I heard

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,000
it's because the data we found this time

40
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,720
doesn't relate to the previous information?

41
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm good at numbers.

42
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,930
Let me help you.

43
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,310
Manning.

44
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
17 years ago,

45
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,630
it was my dad's transportation company

46
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,510
that settled his accident

47
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,700
and signed a trilateral mediation agreement

48
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,740
on his behalf.

49
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,630
at the police station.

50
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,920
But obviously someone

51
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,650
was behind this matter.

52
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,590
My dad didn't receive any commissions.

53
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,780
But since the money was transferred

54
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,710
to my mom's overseas bank account,

55
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,060
if we follow this clue,

56
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,210
we will definitely find the remitter.

57
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,810
Then we can catch the person behind the scenes.

58
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,670
You're right,

59
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,060
but it's been too long.

60
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,579
We can only find the bank

61
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,579
but not the remitter

62
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,579
or the principle.

63
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,070
It's okay.

64
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,340
Even if it's a needle in a haystack,

65
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,460
as long as we want to find it,

66
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,560
we can find it.

67
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,650
Don't you think

68
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,130
it's too quiet at home?

69
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,070
Isn't this the best state?

70
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,040
There's no more noise

71
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,710
or nagging that shouldn't be heard.

72
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,180
But

73
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,000
is this still a home?

74
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,090
What do you want to say?

75
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,790
Cut to the chase.

76
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,220
Don't beat around the bush.

77
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,180
I just want to know,

78
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,630
in your heart,

79
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,600
what is home?

80
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,600
What is family?

81
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,610
What is clan?

82
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,800
What are ties of kinship?

83
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,080
What do you

84
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,670
want to hear from me?

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,700
Do you want me to lower my head?

86
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,700
Do you want me

87
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,010
to feel sympathy for those people outside?

88
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,020
Or do you want me

89
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,080
to kneel down and admit my mistake?

90
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,220
The President gave you a lot of time,

91
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,740
hoping you

92
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,560
can think it through.

93
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,430
Now it seems

94
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,540
he was wrong.

95
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,630
Don't use my dad to pressure me.

96
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,830
In House of Zhuang,

97
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,250
I am who I am.

98
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,240
I don't belong to anyone,

99
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,760
nor do I rely on anyone.

100
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,280
He's just

101
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,590
my biological father.

102
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,659
Besides, he's gone now.

103
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,810
I'm the only one

104
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,440
who's in House of Zhuang,

105
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,090
But you...

106
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,000
Lin,

107
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,030
you've been in our family for 20 years.

108
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,980
You've said and done

109
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,730
enough.

110
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,610
If you are smart,

111
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,410
choose your own path as soon as possible.

112
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Don't blame me for not reminding you

113
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,220
after you've been driven into a corner.

114
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,210
Why can't I find it?

115
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:42,520
It's okay.

116
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,710
If it's too much,

117
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,030
I'll ask Fang Xiang to enter it into the computer

118
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,130
and run the data.

119
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,050
Let me do it.

120
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,880
I can take a closer look.

121
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,320
Besides,

122
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,280
it's my duty.

123
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,190
I didn't have the chance

124
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,770
to apologise to you officially

125
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,890
as you were sick a few days ago.

126
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,120
Xingcheng.

127
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,290
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,120
My mom was badly ill back then.

129
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,160
My dad hurt you all.

130
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,710
After all these years,

131
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,590
at least

132
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,530
I owe you an apology.

133
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,590
Manning.

134
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,310
It has nothing to do with you.

135
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,620
How come it has nothing to do with me?

136
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,200
They are my parents.

137
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,620
But you were only six.

138
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,750
Although I know

139
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,420
your father was the truck driver back then

140
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,880
and I do feel a little uncomfortable,

141
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,240
these are not things

142
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,180
we can control.

143
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,210
So I can't blame you.

144
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,340
Xingcheng, do you know?

145
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,960
In the past,

146
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,560
I thought you were very cold

147
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,630
and ruthless,

148
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,580
but now I know

149
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,030
your heart

150
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,040
is very warm

151
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,140
and firm.

152
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,120
I don't know

153
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,910
how to repay you and Xinyan.

154
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,790
♪The love is the love♪

155
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,420
Maybe

156
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,970
this is destiny.

157
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
I'll get the door.

158
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,870
Let me make you some tea.

159
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,670
No need, Manning.

160
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,090
I'm here

161
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,770
to say something important.

162
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,560
Go ahead.

163
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,310
You'll never find out the truth

164
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,870
from the documents you're looking through now.

165
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,330
What do you mean?

166
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,500
Even if you find the mediation agreement

167
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,640
about that car accident

168
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,020
and Manning's mother's account,

169
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,610
it's impossible to know who the real murderer was.

170
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,380
Why?

171
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,390
Because...

172
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,010
Because I didn't crash into

173
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,610
your parents' car back then.

174
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,110
Dad.

175
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,210
What are you talking about?

176
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,190
I didn't drive my truck

177
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,550
to hit your parents.

178
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,240
Someone arranged another car accident

179
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,950
to knock your parents

180
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,180
off the road.

181
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,310
Once everything is done,

182
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,560
leave immediately.

183
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,550
We'll find the best doctor for your wife

184
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,910
and pay all the surgery fees for her.

185
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,060
Don't I need to call the insurance company?

186
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,580
But if I leave like this,

187
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,070
isn't this a hit-and-run?

188
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,040
There's no term for a hit-and-run.

189
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,200
Staying at the scene or calling the police after you leave

190
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,760
is the same as compensation.

191
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,230
What?

192
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,200
Don't you want to treat your wife?

193
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,880
No.

194
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,070
I've never done such a thing.

195
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,150
I can get off and help.

196
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,660
Although it was a car accident,

197
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,400
I...

198
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,380
I don't want anyone to be hurt.

199
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:09,900
Shut up.

200
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,870
Do what you should do.

201
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,550
Otherwise, if anything happens,

202
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,980
it will be all your fault.

203
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,070
Hello?

204
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,880
Hello?

205
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:49,900
Dad.

206
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,980
Dad.

207
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,860
Mom.

208
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,460
In the end, I decided not to do this kind of thing.

209
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,720
But at that moment,

210
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,990
someone arranged a second truck

211
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,730
to hit your parents.

212
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,010
Dad, is that true?

213
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,040
Yes.

214
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,300
I saw it.

215
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,620
The data equipment back then

216
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,980
was not as advanced as it is now.

217
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,210
There were no surveillance cameras

218
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,210
on the coast road.

219
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,420
They framed me

220
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,400
for this accident

221
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,560
and forced me and my transportation company

222
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,690
to admit this so-called car accident.

223
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
I wanted to tell the truth back then,

224
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,180
but they were ruthless.

225
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,230
I was afraid that they would hurt your mother

226
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,300
and you.

227
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,160
It's all my fault.

228
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,740
Your mother died that night too.

229
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,630
I didn't take their money

230
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,310
I came back in a hurry.

231
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,260
I've been keeping it

232
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,980
in my mind.

233
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,640
It's been torturing me.

234
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,190
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,120
I really...

236
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,450
Wait.

237
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,910
Dad just said

238
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,110
someone arranged

239
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,650
that car accident twice.

240
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,690
It also happened twice to me

241
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,010
when I was on the road in the mountains with Xinyan.

242
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,320
Twice?

243
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,240
What should we do?

244
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,310
They're catching up.

245
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,370
What should we do?

246
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,750
Hurry up. Make a call.

247
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,650
Passcode 1121.

248
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,920
Who should I call?

249
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,140
The first one in the contacts.

250
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,030
He called me

251
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,940
half a month ago.

252
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,760
That man

253
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,170
called me.

254
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,670
He asked me

255
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,280
to get a brooch

256
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,109
from Manning.

257
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,329
If your car accident

258
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,240
and my and Xinyan's car accident

259
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,440
both happened twice,

260
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,200
it means

261
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,540
the person who followed me

262
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,850
was not the same person who asked my dad

263
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,850
to get the brooch.

264
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,070
Then it means

265
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,580
the one who hurt Xinyan,

266
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,580
who kidnapped you,

267
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,210
and who caused my parent's car accident

268
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,990
were not the same group of people.

269
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,660
We've been trying

270
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,220
to link all clues together.

271
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,650
We thought all of them

272
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,060
was done by the same group of people,

273
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,460
but that's not the truth.

274
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,070
There's someone hiding behind them.

275
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,620
When someone created trouble and harm,

276
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,730
he would give a crushing blow

277
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,330
at the most critical moment.

278
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,390
My parents suffered that.

279
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,480
So did Xinyan.

280
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,690
Even you...

281
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,710
I'm fine.

282
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:31,790
But Xingcheng,

283
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,770
we must find him.

284
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,630
We must find this man hiding in the dark.

285
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,390
We need to find the person

286
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,840
who hurt everyone.

287
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,450
[Zhuang Caixuan]

288
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,680
[Zhuang Caixuan]

289
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,850
It's okay.

290
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,380
Everything will pass.

291
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,630
Everything will be fine.

292
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Give me some time.

293
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,850
Let me finish what I should do.

294
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,970
I will fulfill

295
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,540
whatever I promise you.

296
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,380
I trust you.

297
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,000
I'll wait for you

298
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,800
no matter how long it takes.

299
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,050
Do you want

300
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,140
a gift?

301
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,010
A gift?

302
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,570
Look.

303
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,620
It's the pink star from Andromeda.

304
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,810
It is said that when you see this star with someone you like,

305
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,770
you'll be together forever.

306
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,570
You remember that?

307
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,010
I remember

308
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,310
every word you said.

309
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,990
So did you see it?

310
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,350
I saw it.

311
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,260

Who gave you the courage?

00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,100
How dare you

328
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,650
to have a secret meeting here

329
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,260
without me, the new President of LH Star?

330
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,140
I...

331
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,190
Yan Xingcheng.

332
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,420
What do you want?

333
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,540
What do you think I want?

334
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,160
I don't care what you're up to.

335
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,200
You were kicked out by House of Zhuang and LH Star.

336
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,520
How dare you

337
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,830
to hold a shareholder meeting here?

338
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,030
What right do you have

339
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,340
to be the Chair in the meeting room on the top floor?

340
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,900
You stole LH Star

341
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,680
from me.

342
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,820
Today,

343
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,310
I'll let you

344
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,180
spit it out.

345
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,570
Stop bluffing.

346
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,240
See if you can take LH Star from me.

347
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,410
Who do you think you are?

348
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,070
With that stupid seal last time?

349
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,980
Come on.

350
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,330
No one will admit it.

351
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,090
Don't even think about

352
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,820
taking LH Star away from me.

353
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,330
After so many years,

354
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,540
why haven't you improved at all?

355
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,520
My…

356
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,700
Cousin.

357
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,580
Let me show you

358
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,420
how I get back

359
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,920
what belongs to me today.

360
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,310
I am now informing you

361
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,730
and all shareholders of LH Star.

362
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,560
We have acquired

363
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,550
the rest of the shares in the market

364
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,220
except my mom's 40% shares.

365
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,040
Plus

366
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,940
the joint partner agreement

367
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,540
we just signed,

368
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,060
our shares

369
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,860
are far more than the shares

370
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,170
owned by you and your mother.

371
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,990
You've acquired the rest of the shares?

372
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,970
Why didn't I know?

373
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,960
Stop lying.

374
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,570
It's impossible.

375
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,970
It's impossible.

376
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,110
The stock price of the company is high.

377
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,840
Where did you get so much money?

378
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,810
What do you think I've been doing

379
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,910
for all these years?

380
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,490
Fang Xiang.

381
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,030
What's more…

382
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,270
What a scene.

383
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,090
Mr. Zhuang.

384
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,450
Sorry.

385
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,560
I’m not interested in

386
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,750
your personal stuff within House of Zhuang,

387
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,120
but I'm very interested

388
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,440
in making money.

389
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,050
Mr. Tang.

390
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,840
I'll accept

391
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,030
this joint statement.

392
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:10,590
Mr. Yan.

393
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,750
Take care.

394
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,060
You...

395
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,020
You...

396
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:22,950
Yan Xingcheng.

397
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,770
Mr. Zhuang, do you have anything to say

398
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,340
before you resign?

399
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,390
Yan Xingcheng.

400
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,920
Don't get cocky.

401
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,970
It's no big deal to get funds.

402
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,900
It's no big deal to take the shares of the Group.

403
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,650
LH Star.

404
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,720
I don't want it.

405
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,870
It's all yours.

406
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,030
But you will never come back

407
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,820
to House of Zhuang.

408
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,660
No one can leave today.

409
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:05,630
Yang.

410
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,410
Yan Xingcheng.

411
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,260
You want to lock me up here?

412
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,380
I want you to pay back what you owe

413
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,510
little by little.

414
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:20,520
Yang.

415
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,320
Got it.

416
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,080
How did you plot to hurt Zhuang Xinyan

417
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,310
but kidnap Shen Manning by mistake?

418
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:36,640
How did you scheme, stalk and set fire?

419
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,490
No, no, Mr. Yan.

420
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,860
There must be a misunderstanding.

421
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,540
Mr. Zhuang.

422
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,380
Talk to him.

423
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,400
Explain it.

424
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,880
You still deny it?

425
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,510
Will you only admit it

426
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,980
until we show you the evidence?

427
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,350
Yang.

428
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,660
I didn't expect you to be such a person.

429
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,720
How dare you to do this behind my back?

430
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:05,750
Yan Xingcheng.

431
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,610
Zhuang Jiakai.

432
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,100
You betrayed me.

433
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,440
You betrayed me,

434
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,800
it won't do good to you.

435
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Shut up!

436
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,380
Move!

437
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,190
Cousin.

438
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,190
You must trust me.

439
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,290
We are family.

440
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,090
You have to trust me.

441
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,170
This has nothing

442
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,950
to do with me.

443
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,150
I trust you.

444
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,100
But who is this person?

445
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,620
Yan Xingcheng.

446
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,110
Don’t think you can take these

447
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,030
as evidence.

448
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,480
Let me tell you.

449
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,710
I'm not afraid of you.

450
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,650
Come with me.

451
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:04,490
Mom.

452
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,090
Yan Xingcheng organised a shareholder meeting

453
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,290
without permission.

454
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:09,640
Yes.

455
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:10,830
It's him.

456
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:11,880
It's them.

457
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,750
They colluded with others

458
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,320
and took all the shares

459
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,020
in the market.

460
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,310
Now LH Star

461
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,890
has been controlled by others.

462
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:21,690
Not only that,

463
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,820
they also made up false evidence

464
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,900
and tried to put Yang…

465
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,380
No,

466
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,760
they tried

467
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,150
to put me in jail.

468
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,480
Let him take it.

469
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,040
Mom.

470
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,050
I don't care about

471
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,520
LH Star.

472
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,900
They can take

473
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,540
whatever they want.

474
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,240
All I care about

475
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,540
is House of Zhuang.

476
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,290
Mom.

477
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,270
Mom!

478
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,340
You can't do this.

479
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:47,770
Mom.

480
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,880
I only care about

481
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,720
everyone who steps into the door House of Zhuang.

482
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,160
And you

483
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,800
have no right to stand here.

484
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,900
Get out of my family

485
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,080
with your identity and ambition.

486
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:14,680
Identity.

487
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,140
Qualification.

488
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,510
Do you still want to show

489
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,030
that fake recording of my parent?

490
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,400
Meixuan.

491
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,950
I didn't take good care of the kids.

492
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,590
Yi is naughty and immature.

494
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,000
You not only spoil him,

495
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,210
but also treat his two friends as your own kids.

496
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,720
I'm sorry

497
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,700
for letting the kids get hurt.

498
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,530
I'm sorry, Xinyan.

499
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,820
From now on,

500
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,200
I will take good care of them

501
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,440
and everyone in the family.

502
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,050
You're really something.

503
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,610
You even found the original recording.

504
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,630
So what?

505
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,630
They are dead.

506
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,340
They are dead.

507
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,060
They died in the car accident overseas

508
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,240
in that storm 17 years ago.

509
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,990
They died in the dark

510
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,000
and deep sea

511
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,970
17 years ago.

512
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:11,989
Xingcheng.
