You can't do this.

145

Go away.

147
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,870
You have the thalassophobia, right?

148
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,490
The doctor just said

149
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,200
you had a panic attack.

150
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,790
Your breathing and heartbeat almost stopped.

151
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,670
If you have a phobia about water,

152
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,400
why did you jump into the water?

153
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,420
Does it have anything to do with you?

154
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,240
Of course.

155
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,250
If you don't tell me,

156
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,520
I'll ask my brother to block this hospital.

158

159

In order to save her,

160
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,030
you can even give up your own life?

161
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,410

Don't move.

168
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,840
The doctor said your body temperature is low

169
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,220
and you were choked by sea water.

170
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,950
You need a good rest to recover.

00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,360
Meina had it fixed for you.

176
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:49,900
Okay.

177
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,390
Thank you.

178
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:55,820
But

179
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,160
who saved me?

180
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,550
When I fell,

181
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,280
I heard someone calling my name.

182
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,230
Is it...

183
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,510
Many people saved you.

184
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,100
Firefighters, people from maritime affairs,

185
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,630
paramedics and policemen.

186
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,970
They saved you together.

187
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,390
The police came to investigate on the accident just now.

188
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,110
They said

189
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,120
the driver of the truck carried you

190
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,450
didn't do it on purpose.

191
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,890
The car crashed on you was also an incident.

192
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,910
As for the person who lured you into the trunk,

193
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,070
we'll keep investigating on him.

194
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,470
It was an accident.

195
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,280
But I...

196
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,030
Next time when something like this happens,

197
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,410
don't go after him.

198
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,070
Call the police immediately.

199
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,830
Have a good rest.

200
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,060
I'll tell the doctor that you're awake,

201
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,320
and ask them to see you.

202
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,130
Director Lin,

203
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,520
do you have anything else to say?

204
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:54,900
No.

You...

Where are you?

237
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,250
Are you busy?

238
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,880
Are you in the House of Zhuang

239
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,410
or

240
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,490
at work?

241
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,260
Why asking?

242
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,920
No.

243
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,220
Wait please.

244
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,350
It's...

245
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,160
It's because

246
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,280
you called me

247
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,990
and said you would come yesterday.

248
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,430
I'm busy.

249
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,850
Are you busy with...

250
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:14,820
You...

251
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,690
Are you busy

252
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,640
working?

253
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,960
Or are you busy with

254
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,540
the marriage

255
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,650
between LH Star and Luminous?

256
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,980
You can think whatever you want.

257
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,300
Really?

258
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,730
It seems that

259
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:56,870
I...

260
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,940
I'm really disturbing you.

261
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,090
But

262
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,940
the stars tonight

263
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,470
are really beautiful.

00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,120
I haven't...

265
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,550
I haven't seen

266
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,700
such a clear starry sky for a long time.

267
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,530
The Phospherus.

268

♫I remembered your smile again♫

269

♫Long time no see♫

272

273
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,650
is pink?

274

♫I was longing for a hug in my dream♫

275
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,790
I heard that couples see it together

276
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,330
will be together forever.

277
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,080
♫But the dream could not be true♫

278

♫I would not listen♫

284
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,800

♫Thinking about your face. If you're just hibernating♫

♫Give me one more moment♫

OK.

Sir.

302
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,500
Your friend's phone

303

is soaked.

304
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,550
I need to change its mainboard and screen.

305
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,080
It will cost at least 3,000.

306
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,720
Three thousand?

307
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,600
So expensive?

308
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:05,820
It's soaked.

309
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,680
I have to repair and fix them all.

310
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,280
Let me see.

311
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,910
Sir.

312
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,820
This is not right.

313
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,480
This isn't my friend's phone.

314
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,730
My friend's phone isn't that old.

315
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,630
You brought it here.

316
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,600
This is your friend's phone.

317
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,600
That's my friend's phone, right?

318
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,470
What's wrong with you?

319
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,470
Give me the phone.

320
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:33,730
If you can't afford it,

321
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,730
then don't repair it, okay?

322
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,360
OK, I don't want to have it repaired.

323
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,510
Give me back my phone.

324
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,880
-Don't repair it if you can't afford the fee. -Give it to me.

325
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,390
Give me my phone. I'm not repairing it.

326
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,590
Give me back my phone.

327
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,850
What are you doing?

328
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,250
Come with me.

329
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,330
Don't go.

330
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,610
Don't go.

331

What are you doing?

332
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,000
Yuan Shuai,

333
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,580
you were so cool just now.

334
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,640
That punch just now

335
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,900
must let the owner remember it forever.

336
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,440
What about me?

337
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,120
Yuan Shuai,

338
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,160
stay with me from now on.

339
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,870
In this way,

340
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,330
no one dares to bully me.

341
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,510
I went there first, OK?

342
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,570
Yuan Shuai,

343
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,520
talk to me.

344
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,900
Don't ignore me.

345
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:50,840
Just talk to me.

346
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,910
Don't ignore me.

347
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,040
-Rao Meina. -Rao Meina.

348
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,250
What do you want to ask?

349
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,370
You ask first.

350
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,160
Don't follow me anymore.

351
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,050
Yuan Shuai.

352
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,030
Including you.

353
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,470
What does it have to do with me?

354
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,560
Do you need me to make it clear?

355
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:19,830
I have

356
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,910
no interest in you.

357
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,550
Yuan Shuai.

358
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,070
Don't say that.

359
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:25,750
I...

360
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,110
That's all.

361
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,830
Don't follow me anymore.

362
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,770
Don't be sad.

363
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,070
It's not hard to get him.

364
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,790
I'll help you chase him.

365
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,360
You are willing to help me?

366
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,370
He and I have been friends for more than ten years.

367
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,400
I'm pretty clear

368
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,470
about

369
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,880
what he likes and dislikes.

370
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,370
Really?

371
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,670
Yes.

372
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,260
Thank you.

373
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,270
You came all the way

374
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,890
for my engagement earrings.

375
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,130
Are you sure

376
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,620
you want to get engaged to him?

377
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,750
What do you mean?

378
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,540
Didn't you receive

379
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,620
the press release?

380
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,870
Tonight,

381
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,230
welcome to my engagement ceremony.

382
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,350
Are you going to give up your life

383
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:12,950
so easily?

384
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,510
You knew

385
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,740
he didn't like you at all.

386
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,760
Lin Mufan,

387
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,760
do you know what you're saying?

388
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,520
I'm getting engaged tonight.

389
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,230
You told me that my fiancé

390
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,930
didn't like me at all.

391
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,270
Did I say it wrong?

392
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,760
You saw it yourself.

393
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,730
How did he treat Manning?

394
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,810
I couldn't see it.

395
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,030
He would rather sacrifice himself

396
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,090
than lose Manning.

397
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,870
Yan Xingcheng

398
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,770
kept everything hidden in his mind.

399
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,940
But no matter what he does,

400
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,430
he never lies.

401
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,200
He doesn't like you.

402
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,140
He loves Manning.

403
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,060
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

404
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,320
Tang Lin,

405
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,190
you deserve a better life.

406
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,700
You deserve a better man,

407
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,150
a warmer and more serious life,

408
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,130
instead of getting involved in other people's love,

409
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,330
and become a hindrance to others' love.

410
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,510
Tang Lin,

411
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,250
you must think it through.

412
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,180
Manning,

413
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,350
take a rest.

414
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,020
There's no rush.

415
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,570
It's okay, Auntie.

416
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,650
It'll be done soon.

417
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,240
You're so thoughtful.

418
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,030
It would be great is my girl

419
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,580
were half as good as you.

420
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,430
I wouldn't have to worry.

421
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,490
Who is speaking ill of me?

422
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,430
Are you here to steal food again?

423
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,090
I don't earn as much as you eat.

424
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,330
Stealing your food?

425
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:09,490
You...

426
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,970
If I did't eat enough food,

427
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,320
I wouldn't become taller than you.

428
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,040
You brat.

429
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,680
You're so nice.

430
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:20,520
Thank you.

431
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,620
By the way,

432
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,030
I have to work overtime tonight.

433
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,750
Don't wait for me.

434
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,880
I won't come back for dinner.

435
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,470
I've put your phone and laundries

436
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,310
home.

437
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,880
Remember to put them away.

438
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,550
Okay.

439
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,870
I'm leaving.

440
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,390
What's wrong?

441
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,590
Anything else to say?

442
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,980
Nothing.

443
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,160
Stay home tonight.

444
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,420
Don't go out.

445
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,870
Don't wander around.

446
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,990
I'm really leaving.

447
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,570
Dad, you're back.

448
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,830
I have nothing to do in the company today.

449
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,790
I've finished my work,

450
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,990
so I came back ealier.

451
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,870
I'll cook now.

452
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:24,920
No need.

453
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,870
Let's do it together

454
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,580
after auntie Huixin is back.

455
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,860
Sure.

456
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,220
I'll pack my clothes.

457
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,290
The new CEO of LH Star Group

458
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,420
will hold a small engagement ceremony

459
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,510
with the daughter of Luminous Group tonight.

460
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,770
The ceremony will be held non-publicly.

461
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,300
Only dozens of close friends and relatives will be invited.

462
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,170
There're two engagement parties in six months.

463
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,230
Our House of Zhuang

464
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,330
is really lively.

465
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,640
You're being rude.

466
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,220
Watch your mouth.

467
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,650
Grandpa,

468
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,030
you misunderstood me.

469
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,150
I obviously have good intentions.

470
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:20,640
Look.

471
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,470
I've prepared

472
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,700
the best suit

473
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,090
to cheer up my dear cousin.

474
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,540
The color is so beautiful.

475
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,420
Unfortunately, last time...

476
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,170
Get out.

477
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,100
OK.

478
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,110
He would rather sacrifice himself than lose Manning.

479
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,240
He doesn't like you.

480
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,960
He loves Manning.

481
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,070
You deserve a better man,

482
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,739
a warmer and more serious life,

483
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,190
instead of getting involved in other people's love

484
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,389
and become a hindrance to others' love.

485
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:20,800
There's always someone in this world

486
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:23,750
who is more important than your own life.

487
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:48,830
Boss.

488
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,860
It's the time.

489
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,520
Boss.

490
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:01,840
Let's go.

491
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,430
Shen Manning.

492
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,590
Listen to me carefully.

493
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,630
Don't ask for help.

494
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,450
and waste your energy.

495
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,050
Share your position with me.

496
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,020
Save your phone's power.

497
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,220
Don't make any sound.

498
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,060
I'll come and save you.

499
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,860
Do you hear me?

500
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,110
Hello, Manning.

501
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,110
Hello, Lin Mufan.

502
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,500
I have something to ask you.

503
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,960
You must tell me the truth.

504
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,610
What do you want to ask?

505
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,730
As long as I know,

506
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,430
I'll tell you everything.

507
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,690
Who saved me on the bridge

508
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,630
after the accident that day?

509
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,140
Was it you?

510
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,050
Manning.

511
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,430
Please answer me!

512
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,380
Was it you?

513
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:08,890
Manning.

514
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,250
I've told you last time.

515
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,530
Everyone saved you together.

516
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,370
People from the Maritime Bureau, Fire Centre, police station

517
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,470
and the Emergency Center.

518
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,670
It was Yan Xingcheng.

519
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,490
Right?

520
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,770
Manning.

521
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,720
Listen to me...

522
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,200
♫Every time I look out of the window♫

523
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,550
♫I wish to see you walking by♫

524
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:59,230
♫The night breeze is cool♫

525
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:03,660
♫I'm all alone♫

526
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,120
♫I wish you could call my name♫

527
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:14,840
♫Call as if I can see♫

528
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,200
♫Calling me. How I wish it was you calling me♫

529
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:26,540
♫Shout out to set me free♫

530
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:32,910
♫You love me♫

531
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,380
♫We love each other♫

532
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:48,050
♫I don't want to live in a world without you♫

533
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,270
♫Who can show me the way♫

534
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,700
♫Even if there are countless hardships♫

535
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,230
♫The direction of the heart♫

536
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:11,670
♫Your direction♫

537
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,600
♫Called out to me♫

538
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,160
♫Called out to me♫

539
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,300
♫I look forward to it♫

540
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,100
You get engaged to me

541
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,800
for the interest of your family and the company.

542
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,000
Don't you think it's a great sacrifice?

543
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,820
-If I had another choice... -You have.

544
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,480
I know what kind of person you are.

545
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,680
With your ability,

546
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,510
you must have other choices.

547
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,340
Are you really going to marry me?

548
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,860
This is your last chance to show your trump card.

549
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,560
If no one objects

550
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,800
their love...

551
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:44,770
I object!
