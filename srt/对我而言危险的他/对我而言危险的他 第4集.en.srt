[My Lethal Man]

00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,110
[Episode 4]

4
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,520
Which ward are you from?

5
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:22,829
Boss.

6
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,510
It's okay.

7
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,230
As planned.

8
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,040
When you

9
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,940
meet another you in the world,

10
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,650
what you're going to face next

11
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,290
is either the climax of fate

12
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,700
or the sign of death.

13
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,710
They were there for me.

14
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,579
I should be the one they wanted to catch.

15
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,329
But you and I look too alike.

16
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,090
They mistook you for me.

17
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,140
But don't worry.

18
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,620
I'll send you back to school.

19
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,380
Stay here and don't go anywhere.

20
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,640
I'll take care of this.

21
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,850
I won't get you involved again.

22
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,050
OK?

23
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,339
You must go back to the House of Zhuang

24
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,350
and find Yan Xingcheng.

25
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,440
Boss.

26
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,760
Testing Center called.

27
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,290
They said matching blood samples we sent before can't be used.

28
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:35,760
What?

29
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,630
I don't know if it's because of the fall

30
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,340
or the contamination during the test.

31
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,020
The blood samples we sent

32
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,990
are meaningless.

33
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,860
They advised us to pick samples again

34
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,110
or give up.

35
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:48,930
I knew

36
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,540
it's not that simple.

37
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:51,860
No.

38
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,810
I need to go to the Testing Center

39
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,010
to keep an eye on them.

40
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,590
There's only one sample.

41
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,540
I don't care which ways they use,

42
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,680
they must detect it.

43
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:01,540
Let's go.

44
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,710
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

45
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,570
What happened?

46
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,040
Yan Xingcheng never switched off his phone.

47
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,910
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

48
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,390
Fang Xiang also switched his phone.

49
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,430
We will try to intervene

50
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,560
the testing result.

51
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,830
I don't believe

52
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,260
this girl is the real Zhuang Xinyan.

53
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,930
Didn't you check before?

54
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,370
she had a serious car accident.

55
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,180
I did check.

56
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,040
That car was in a serious car accident.

57
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,760
Strangely,

58
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,650
the broken car and the people in the car

59
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,010
disappeared in the end.

60
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,230
Boss,

61
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,610
I think besides us,

62
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,340
there is another team tracking her whereabouts.

63
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,550
Of course.

64
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,950
Once Zhuang Xinyan came back,

65
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,530
for the whole House of Zhuang and LH Star,

66
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,460
everything has been broken by her.

67
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,670
How could there be no one watching her?

68
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,490
Maybe

69
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,090
there are many people

70
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,159
hoping that she won't come back

71
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,030
and disappear.

72
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,790
Let's go.

73
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,710
Let's go to the Testing Center.

74
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,740
I don't believe

75
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,720
we can't catch her loopholes

76
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,370
before general shareholders' meeting.

77
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,760
How many secrets are there?

78
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,380
How is it going?

79
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,500
People in the hospital just now…

80
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,510
Why did you come back?

81
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,290
Do you know

82
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,130
how dangerous it was in Heng Sheng Hospital?

83
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,990
What about you?

84
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,800
You knew it was dangerous,

85
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,790
why did you come?

86
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,590
To destroy the House of Zhuang.

87
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,020
Nobody can get back the shares after you leave.

88
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,020
No one can be

89
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,450
the real owner of LH Star.

90
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,940
Since I can't replace Xinya to fulfill her wish,

91
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,250
I will destroy all of these

92
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,080
for her.

93
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,590
Yan Xingcheng.

94
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,750
What about you?

95
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,540
Have you forgotten what I told you?

96
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,240
You shouldn't come back.

97
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,430
Yan Xingcheng.

98
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,050
Who are you?

99
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,180
I saw it.

100
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,480
You don't covet the House of Zhuang

101
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,940
and you don't want the huge assets of LH Star.

102
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,480
You don't do it for money or people.

103
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,310
Then what do you want?

104
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,110
Why did you get me involved in this whirlpool?

105
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,310
What's your purpose?

106
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,720
Do you want to know who I am?

107
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,730
You got me involved in this.

108
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
You should tell me

109
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,550
who my peers is.

110
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,760
I'm the person who loves Zhuang Xinyan most

111
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,270
in this world.

112
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,750
I can give up everything,

113
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,580
and destroy everything for her.

114
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,050
I want to help her get what she deserves.

115
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,880
If I can't,

116
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,610
I'll destroy the House of Zhuang and LH Star.

117
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,030
No matter what it takes,

118
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,430
I will do it for Xinyan.

119
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,470
Yan Xingcheng.

120
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,530
But these have nothing to do with you.

121
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,570
You can take your passport and ticket

122
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,230
and fly back to your Overseas Arts University.

123
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,230
You can leave now.

124
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,020
Wait.

125
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,000
Wait, Yan Xingcheng.

126
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,140
I'm not leaving.

127
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,800
Since you've made up your mind, don't look back.

128
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,810
I want to stay and protect you.

129
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,010
I know it's useless to say anything now.

130
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,600
♫Tick-tock, the second hand goes♫

131
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,540
I can't become the real Zhuang Xinyan.

♫Every moment it turns♫

133
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,200

♫How are you doing?♫

138
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,750
Just like in the hospital

139
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,870
the House of Zhuang would still fear me

140
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,600
because of my identity.

141
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,610

♫All stubbornness♫

145
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,140
You can't destroy the House of  Zhuang and LH Star.

146
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,930

to guard them.

151
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,740
I came back with you

152
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,390
♫To take the risk♫

153

156

Fang Xiang controls

157
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,710
the system of the VIP ward.

158
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,360
No one will enter

159
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,600
President's ward.

160
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,380
We let the most professional doctor

161
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,420
give President a comprehensive treatment.

162
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,820
When the results are out,

163
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,070
we'll send President back to Heng Sheng Hospital.

164
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,880
How did you think of sending President...

165
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,810
sending grandpa to another hospital?

166
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,780
I knew something was wrong

167
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,240
on my first day back.

168
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,650
President Zhuang's case says he has kidney failure.

169
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,610
Unless he was at the terminal stage,

170
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,690
he wouldn't have been so unconscious.

171
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,020
But at the terminal stage of kidney disease,

172
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,490
the patient would depend on the hemodialysis machine.

173
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,130
However, the hemodialysis machine at the bedside of President Zhuang

174
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,190
was rarely opened.

175
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,990
Since then,

176
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,350
I have seriously suspected that

177
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,880
someone deliberately delayed the treatment of the President.

178
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,830
So we transferred him to a hospital we know

179
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,750
and treat him with our people.

180
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,680
They delayed the treatment of President?

181
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,270
What's their purpose?

182
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,030
President was seriously unconscious.

183
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,430
Ocean Star had no leader.

184
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,630
The House of Zhuang was in chaos.

185
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,940
Someone will take this opportunity

186
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,370
to get what they want.

187
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,940
The control of the House of Zhuang,

188
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,240
and top positions in the Group

189
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,100
or

190
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,000
unallowed indulgence and freedom.

191
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,550
But

192
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,420
they are all grandpa's closest friends or family.

193
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,480
In the upper world,

194
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,500
there is no word like "closet".

195
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,790
Or

196
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,960
in a world like this,

197
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,420
there is no such thing as love.

198
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,970
Whether it's family ties, friendship or

199
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:51,670
love,

200
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,690
everyone is like a crocodile in a deep pool.

201
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,840
They can do anything

202
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,230
for huge benefits.

203
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,080
If you don't

204
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,470
turn yourself into a heartless crocodile,

205
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,570
you'll be torn apart by the group.

206
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,650
This is the real reason

207
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,980
why I want you to be the real Zhuang Xinyan.

208
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,660
I'll help you.

209
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,510
You just need to calm down

210
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,940
and maintain your identity as Ms. Zhuang Xinyan.

211
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,920
As for the rest,

212
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,760
Fang Xiang, Yuan Shuai and I

213
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,860
will handle it for you.

214
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,940
I promise

215
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,240
one year later,

216
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,300
I'll send you

217
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,020
back safely.

218
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,510
I am the person who loves Zhuang Xinyan the most

219
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,890
in this world.

220
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,910
I can give up everything

221
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,710
and destroy everything for her.

222
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,550
No matter what it takes,

223
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,530
I will do it for Xinyan.

224
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,400
So he really

225
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,660
loves her.

226
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,480
I promise

227
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,690
one year later,

228
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,760
I'll send you back

229
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,730
safely.

230
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,100
Send me back to my world safely?

231
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,930
Can I really go back safely?

232
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,339
I finally got an author ID

233
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,890
on the comic channel.

234
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,160
I can't even think of my online character.

235
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,369
Hello, Mum.

236
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,990
Where did you go

237
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,599
when you weren't helping out at the store?

238
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,230
Don't tell me

239
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,230
you're doing comic creation again.

240
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,839
I'm on my way.

241
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,910
I'm on my way to the Central Hospital.

242
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,390
Uncle Shen asked me

243
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,140
to get some rheumatism medicine for him.

244
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,060
Don't lie to me.

245
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,560
I knew you were at the cafe.

246
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,980
Are you following me?

247
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,900
Aunt,

248
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,850
prepare my favorite food for me tonight.

249
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,560
Remember to decant the wine

250
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,450
that I brought the day before yesterday in advance.

251
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,620
You're thinking about drinking so early in the morning.

252
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,820
Do you want to be sick?

253
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,190
I'm different from you.

254
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,420
Since I had heart surgery when I was eight years old,

255
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,970
every day I live now

256
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,400
is an earned one.

257
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,940
So for me,

258
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,290
if I have wine, I'll get drunk today.

259
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
I don't care if it will be true or not.

260
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,450
Fine.

261
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,710
As long as my sister is happy,

262
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,390
you can do anything you want.

263
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,760
Anyway,

264
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,420
I do have a friend like this by my side.

265
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,900
You can meet him, Sister.

266
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,500
Who?

267
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,440
Must I go there personally?

268
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,360
I admire him very much.

269
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,690
I also asked someone to investigate him thoroughly.

270
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,410
He's a good person.

271
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,470
He's working in jewelry industry, too.

272
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,310
If you can marry him...

273
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,610
-Then... -Brother.

274
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,110
Are you asking me to go on a blind date

275
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,190
or to use a beauty trick?

276
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,200
When it comes to business,

277
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,850
I can use anyone as leverage

278
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,390
except my sister.

279
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,570
I asked you to meet him

280
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,230
because I think he really deserves you.

281
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,430
Besides,

282
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,170
he is indeed related to a deal of our company.

283
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,450
His family has no leader now.

284
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,900
Whether the company can survive or not is still a question.

285
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,740
Let alone

286
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,460
caring about his small studio.

287
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,090
Let me guess.

288
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,740
It must be someone from LH Star.

289
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,140
People of the House of Zhuang.

290
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,820
But he has nothing to do with the House of Zhuang.

291
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,250
Zhuang Jiakai, the third generation of the House of Zhuang.

292
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,430
is now competing with Ms. Zhuang Xinyan who came back just now.

293
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,230
And the Group is holding a shareholders' meeting.

294
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,790

is indeed beneficial to us.

Go get this person to our side.

00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,110
or are you forcing me

344
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,860
to give the whole LH Star to

345
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,440
that little girl who hasn't grown up?

346
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,190
Shut up!

347
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,070
Mom.

348
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:02,980
Sit down.

349
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,790
Since the matching result is out,

350
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,630
don't say anything you shouldn't.

351
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,470
Mom.

352
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,700
Lin,

353
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,360
what's going on in the hospital?

354
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,840
If the President has any problem,

355
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,440
who can afford it?

356
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:26,720
Yang.

357
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,430
The shareholders' meeting is coming.

358
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,910
I have to guard my grandpa myself.

359
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,240
Drive now.

360
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,840
Go to the hospital now.

361
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,160
It's too simple.

362
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,340
Next time,

363
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,970
I'll ask boss to make me a more interesting one.

364
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,060
Yuan Shuai.

365
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,170
-Hello. Are you here to visit... -Scram!

366
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:51,930
Everyone.

367
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,160
The doctor specifically instructed

368
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,350
President Zhuang is seriously ill.

369
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,960
No one is allowed to enter.

370
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,120
Cut the crap.

371
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,030
Move aside.

372
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,360
Don't be mad, Mr. Zhuang.

373
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,630
The doctor specifically instructed

374
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,390
no one is allowed to enter.

375
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,310
What are you talking about?

376
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,280
My biological grandpa is lying inside.

377
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,570
This is my mother.

378
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,870
The person inside is her biological father.

379
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,590
Butler Lin

380
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,830
is also the personal assistant of my grandpa

381
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,070
for over 30 years.

382
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,460
Aren't we allowed to enter?

383
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,380
Who are you?

384
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,120
How dare you stand in my way?

385
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,610
I'm nothing indeed.

386
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,340
I'm definitely not as good as

387
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,780
those who want to occupy

388
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,850
the entire LH Star Group

389
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,590
while the President is seriously ill.

390
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,540
What did you say?

391
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,840
Say it again!

392
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,380
Anyway,

393
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,560
no one is allowed to enter.

394
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,480
Get out of the way!

395
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:59,480
You can't enter!

396
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,550
Don't forget

397
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,930
the President is still lying inside.

398
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:11,860
Okay.

399
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:12,940
Yang.

400
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,280
Call them.

401
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,760
Get me a team of security from the company.

402
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,780
I'd like to see

403
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,550
who dares to make a scene in front of my grandpa's ward.

404
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,150
Copy that.

405
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:21,990
Move!

406
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:24,770
Ms. Zhuang.

407
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,390
I said move!

408
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,280
I'll give you one minute.

409
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,010
[Boss]

410
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,750
Leave immediately.

411
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,440
Or we'll call the police.

412
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,570
Do you want to have tea at the police station

413
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,230
or go back to the place before?

414
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,710
Think it through.

415
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:44,580
Get lost!

416
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,070
Jiakai.

417
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,590
Mom.

418
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,580
Go wake your grandpa up.

419
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,910
Now the House of Zhuang and LH Star are in turmoil.

420
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,370
We need your grandpa to host the big picture.

421
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,660
Isn't it on this floor?

422
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,230
Did I see it wrongly?

423
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,250
I think I saw Manning just now.

424
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,340
Don't move.

425
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,290
What are you doing?

426
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:45,760
The doctor said

427
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,750
Grandpa needs rest.

428
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,600
No one can disturb him.

429
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,420
Stop putting on airs.

430
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,410
We are familiar with

431
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,250
all the attending doctors here.

432
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,570
As to when will grandpa rest

433
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,700
and need treatment,

434
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,320
you have no right to give orders.

435
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,780
Go away!

436
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,070
Don't touch me!

437
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,440
I'm Ms. Zhuang Xinyan,

438
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,700
Zhuang Meixuan's biological daughter.

439
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,190
Before you touch me,

440
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,100
think of that

441
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,350
whether you have the right to touch me.

442
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Before the general shareholders' meeting of LH Star,

443
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,470
grandpa needs to rest without any disturbance.

444
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,070
If you don't want anything

445
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,530
to go wrong on the meeting,

446
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,750
leave as soon as possible.

447
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,120
Because of the shareholders' meeting next week,

448
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,850
we are worried about grandpa.

449
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,440
Who knows what you will do to grandpa?

450
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,480
After all,

451
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,640
only Grandpa has the right to decide the next heir.

452
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,550
Only someone who wants to do something to Grandpa

453
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,490
would have this kind of speculation, right?

454
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:57,890
You...

455
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,550
Are you okay?

456
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:40,910
I'm fine.

457
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,890
Don't touch my mom.

458
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,510
If you don't want it to be too embarrassing,

459
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,400
don't fight.

460
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,270
Who are you to talk to me like that?

461
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,840
If it weren't for her,

462
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:05,330
I would never talk to people of the House of Zhuang.

463
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,420
Do you think you can become the half owner of the House of Zhuang,

464
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,330
depending on this girl?

465
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,620
In this place,

466
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,350
it's not your turn to make the decision.

467
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,050
Jiakai.

468
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:17,870
Mom.

469
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,490
Make a phone call.

470
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,310
Tell them to block the hospital.

471
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,910
They can steal your grandpa.

472
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,980
There must be a lot of traitors.

473
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:25,790
Yang.

474
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:26,990
Got it.

475
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,150
You

476
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,880
kidnapped a patient

477
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,980
and attempted murder.

478
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,220
What a big crime!

479
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,530
But we're never the ones who want to do this.

480
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,150
It's those who can kill their family

481
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,280
for a huge profit.

482
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,610
What did you say?

483
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,010
I know you understand

484
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,410
what I said.

485
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,040
Lin!

486
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,670
What are you waiting for?

487
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,600
Call the police.

488
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,330
Wait.

489
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,650
President?

490
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,390
Are you okay?

491
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,230
Let me do it.

492
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,240
Grandpa.

493
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,440
What?

494
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,340
Don't you recognize me

495
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,830
or don't you want to admit that I'm your father?

496
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:35,660
Dad.

497
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,270
Do you know I'm your dad?

498
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,790
Where did they take you?

499
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,620
How are you feeling?

500
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,670
Are you hurt?

501
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,580
Do you need a doctor?

502
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,370
No.

503
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,630
Although I'm old,

504
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,160
I'm strong and resilient.

505
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,000
I didn't die in the first half of my life.

506
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,340
In the rest of my life,

507
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,450
no one would kill me.

508
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,630
In the past,

509
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,520
I always thought that I still have many years to live.

510
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,050
But this time,

511
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,140
I feel

512
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,390
I don't have much time left.

513
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,730
So today,

514
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,940
I want to say

515
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
what I should say.

516
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,510
For the business of the House of Zhuang,

517
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,060
you'll split it

518
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,890
according to the agreement you made with your sister Meixuan.

519
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,290
Although I created LH Star,

520
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,570
over the past decade,

521
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,080
Meixuan and her husband made it grow and develop.

522
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,880
I should have given them all to Meixuan.

523
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,190
What a pity.

524
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,850
But luckily,

525
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,700
Xinyan is back.

526
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,850
Xinyan,

527
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,490
the shares your mother left behind

528
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,780
should be inherited by you.

529
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,170
After I transfer the shares to you,

530
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,590
you will be the biggest shareholder

531
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,020
of LH Star Group.

532
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,750
So,

533
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,690
the shareholders' meeting next week...

534
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:06,930
Xinyan.

535
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,350
Grandpa.

536
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,760
I will give

537
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,820
the House of Zhuang

538
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,670
and LH Star

539
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,270
to you.

540
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,270
[LH Star]

541
00:34:58,810 --> 00:34:59,490
Mr. Zhuang.

542
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,950
Don't be angry.

543
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,840
Grandpa entrusted the whole LH Star

544
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,960
to that little girl.

545
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,620
Did you tell me not to be angry?

546
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Things may not be as bad as you think.

547
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,530
What do you mean?

548
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,400
Although the President said it himself,

549
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,610
she has left the House of Zhuang for so many years.

550
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,410
Even if she is the new president,

551
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:19,850
how can she

552
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,920
guard the whole LH Star Group?

553
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,040
The problem that LH Star Group is facing now

554
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,530
is not just inheriting it.

555
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,140
Besides us,

556
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,770
many people are interested in LH Star.

557
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,340
Since she dares to be the president,

558
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,080
she must have the courage

559
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,210
to afford this position.

560
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,890
You mean...

561
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,910
I will give

562
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,400
the House of Zhuang

563
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,260
and LH Star

564
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
to you.

565
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,020
Am I really going to be the heir

566
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,880
of the House of Zhuang and LH Star?

567
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,450
If I make a mistake,

568
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,240
or...

569
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,720
What I'm thinking about?

570
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:50,630
Who is it?

571
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,750
It's so late.

572
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,260
What brings you here?

573
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,220
What?

574
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,710
Are you coming in?

575
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,040
It's a bit late.

576
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,220
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

577
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,310
Let's live together.
