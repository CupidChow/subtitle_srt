chase the fraud money back.

12
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,870
I can offer ten percent of the amount

13
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,930
as compensation to you and your team.

14

No need.

I'll get your money back.

16
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,070

Aren't you an investment consultant?

29

My money hasn't entered your investment account yet.

30

You don't even want the commission?

31
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,500
I have never been interested in dirty money,

32

42
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,310
Send Xinyan's information to him

43

44

LH Star would need to have a new president immediately.

Nothing.

81

Are you still copying professor's Geminate Rose?

82
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,620
I heard that once this homework is done,

83
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,020
you can get full marks in advance,

84
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,410
so that you can graduate and go home, right?

85
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:45,810
Yes.

86
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,340
No way. You want to graduate early?

87
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,260
Nana,

88
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,500

89
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,600
I just want to graduate early and go home,

90
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,530
so I can spend time with my dad.

91
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:01,820
Alright.

92
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,880
I forgive you

93
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,210
for your filial piety.

94
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,390
By the way,

95
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,910
have you heard the legend

96
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,040
behind Geminate Rose from professor?

97
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,520
What legend?

98
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,680
Legend has it that the rose

99
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,290
have been depending and growing together.

100
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,170
They got each other's backs for lifetime

101
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,800
until the flowers bloom.

102
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,210
Under the sunshine,

103
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,270
they can turn around

104
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,830
and look at each other.

105
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,960
But after one glance,

106
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,170
these two roses either die at the same time

107
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,170
or one is damaged,

108
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,450
and the other blooms alone.

109
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,220
Imagine this scene.

110
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,340
When you

111
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,390
meet

112
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,780
your doppelganger,

113
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,520
If what's infront you is

114
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,500
not the climax of fate,

115
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,720
then it is the omen of death.

116
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,290
Stop reading these weird comics.

117
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,920
What doppelganger and twin flower?

118

What the other me in the world?

119
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,710
This isn't what I saw in comic books.

120
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,550
It's true.

121
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,840
I'm leaving.

Wait for me!

126
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,120
Xinyan,

for your safety,

128
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,190
I would assign someone to guard you to the Art University.

129
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,870
Although this is the 13th school you transferred to,

130
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,020
I promise you that

131
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,580
once the House of Zhuang and LH Star settle down,

132
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,430
I would take you home as soon as possible.

133
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,620
Grandpa, I will protect myself

134
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,880
and wait for you to take me home.

135

Hi, girl,

136
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,170
let's be friends.

137
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,400
I am half Chinese.

138
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,600
Do you think

139
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,990
I came here to make friends?

140
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,170
Tell me.

141
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,840
Who are you?

142
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,180
How is that possible?

143
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,950
It has been 17 years.

144
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,120
You're still alive.

145
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,470
Meet me

146
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,330
at the front gate

147
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,200
of the Art University.

148
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,030
Who is there?

149
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,410
Hey, what's the matter?

150
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,690
Someone from China is looking for you downstairs.

151
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,900
China?

152
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,390
Hello,

153
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,640
are you looking for me?

154
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,490
Yes.

155
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,400
President Zhuang and my father asked me to pick you up.

156
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,680
Let the principal know and

157
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,550
come back to the House of Zhuang with me.

158
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,150
Wait.

159
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,130
Who were you talking about?

160
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,180
Do we know each other?

161
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,350
Don't you remember me?

162
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,580
I'm Lin Mufan.

163
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,050
When we were young,

164
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,490
you often called me Lin.

165
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,990
Your grandfather, President Zhuang Cheng'an

166
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,370
and my father Lin Guangyi

167
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,570
sent me to pick you up.

168
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,390
L-Lin?

169
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,300
Xinyan.

170
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,040
Have you forgotten me

171
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,770
after leaving the House of Zhuang for over ten years?

172
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,630
When you were little, Yi thought you were too young.

173
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,420
I was the one who played with you.

174
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,140
I'm sorry.

175
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,470

My surname is Shen. My name is Shen Manning.

181

I'm a senior student from the Department of Design.

00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,890
We do look the same,

347
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,020
but I'm not her.

348
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,940
Her name is Zhuang Xinyan.

349
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,140
I-I'm Shen Manning.

350
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,780
Shen Manning is dead.

351
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,490
Your name is Zhuang Xinyan.

352
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,790
How is that possible?

353
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,010
I'm fine now.

354
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,910
I am alive here.

355
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,540
Why do you say so?

356
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,890
[Zhuang Xinyan]

357
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,720
I...I'm not Zhuang Xinyan.

358
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,980
I'm Shen Manning, not Zhuang Xinyan.

359
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,570
Stop chasing me.

360
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,640
Stay back!

361
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,050
-Okay.-If you come any closer, I'll jump!

362
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,930
Calm down, don't rush for anything.

363
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,180
It's dangerous there.

364
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,870
I'm not the Zhuang Xinyan

365
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,750
you are looking for.

366
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,810
I'm really not her.

367
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,680
I did nothing.

368
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,990
I know nothing.

369
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,520
I am begging you.

370
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,020
Stop following me.

371
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,030
Don't come over!

372
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,060
Don't come over!

373
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,750
If you come any closer,

374
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,420
I...I will really jump.

375
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,290
Don't touch your eyes!

376
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,720
You can stand here

377
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,270
because someone died for you.

378
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,470
You can see the world

379
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,830
because you took her eyes.

380
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,010
What?

381
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,290
Two people in one car.

382
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,800
Since you are still alive,

383
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,930
who was the one who died?

384
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,470
Your encounter with her

385
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,910
is your destiny.

386
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,450
Since someone has left in the accident,

387
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,380
then the person who survived

388
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,230
doesn't belong to yourself anymore.

389
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,580
You must live on behalf of

390
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,050
the person who left.

391
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,890
You are Zhuang Xinyan.

392
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,290
You can only be

393
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,610
Zhuang Xinyan.

394
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,900
♫I remembered your smile again♫

395
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,900
You must live on behalf of

396
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,650
the person who left.

397
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,000
♫Long time no see♫

398
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,850
♫I was longing for a hug in my dream♫

399
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,760
♫But the dream could not be true♫

400
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,870
♫What I said to myself♫

401
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,000
♫Have you heard it?♫

402
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:35,110
♫The past taught people to grow up♫

403
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,180
♫I would not listen♫

404
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,030
Can you

405
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,380
go back to the House of Zhuang for me.

406
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:48,760
♫Thinking about your face If you're just hibernating♫

407
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,450
You must go back to the House of Zhuang

408
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,190
and get

409
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,650
LH Star back for me.

410
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,560
♫Give me one more moment♫

411
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,910
Find Yan Xingcheng.

412
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:02,120
♫Missed your face and wanted to pay you back♫

413
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,450
You must

414
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,400
live on.

415
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:07,910
♫Why not forever?♫

416
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,550
Yan Xingcheng,

417
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:25,909
right?

418
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,500
You want me to go back to the House of Zhuang

419
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,980
on behalf of Zhuang Xinyan?

420
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,370
How long do I have to be there?

421
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,860
One year. Is that enough?

422
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:48,630
Xinyan saved my life.

423
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,050
My eyes

424
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,390
are also from her.

425
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,900
Twin roses.

426
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,040
If only one rose can live,

427
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,080
I'm willing to go with you

428
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,300
on behalf of her.

429
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,550
♫Falling in love with the most dangerous person♫

430
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,400
♫I can't let go♫

431
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,540
♫Oh, forget it♫

432
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,780
♫Meeting the most dangerous person♫

433
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,700
♫I can't turn him down♫

434
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,670
♫This love drama♫

435
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,170
♫He is the most dangerous♫

436
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,990
♫The concern left for me♫

437
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:31,030
♫Oh, forget it♫

438
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,350
♫Leave the most dangerous place♫

439
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,470
♫But I've already fallen♫
