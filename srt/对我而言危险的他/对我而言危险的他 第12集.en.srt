4
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:27,390
I guess you really don't like it.

5
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,910
How about...

6
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,720
I can eat.

7
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,860
Sorry, Grandpa.

8
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,130
I...

9
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,910
I ate too fast.

10
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,800
And I ate too much.

11
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,790
I want to go back to my room and take a rest.

12
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,930
Do you need a family doctor?

13
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,060
No.

14
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,400
I just need a rest, Grandpa.

15
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,920
OK.

16
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,280
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,370
Xinyan got wet yesterday.

18
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,630
She might catch a cold.

19
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,870
I'll take care of her.

Manning.

21
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,060

22
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,260
What's wrong?

23
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,690
I...

24
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,420
I am allergic to mangoes.

Shen Manning.

26
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,140

Can you hear me?

34
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,560
Manning.

35
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,970
Shen Manning.

36
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,040
Drink this.

37
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,340
Open your mouth.

38
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:25,870
Drink it.

39
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,750
Take a big sip.

40
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,900
Shen Manning, spit it out!

41
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,470
Spit it out. Hurry up.

I'll get something for you.

58
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,590
Okay.

59
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,910
I'm not leaving.

60
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,670
I'll stay with you.

61
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,000
You don't want me to investigate?

62
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,460
How dare you block my data!

63
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,480
I will give you a taste of death.

64
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
It's not that hot.

65
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,650
Has the acute rubella gone away?

66
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,910
Do you want some water?

67
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,220
You had a high fever last night.

68
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,810
I just want to thank you.

69
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,050
I was allergic to mangoes when I was a kid.

70
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,410
When it was serious,

71
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,600
I would have breathing muscle paralysis and cardiac arrest.

72
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,300
So,

73
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,650
I want to

74
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,310

♫Leave the most dangerous place♫

109

♫But I've already fallen♫

111
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,350
♫He might know too♫

112
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,410
Although you didn't tell me

113
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,040
why you brought me back,

114
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,250
I know

115
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,790
you've been waiting.

116
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,650
You've been waiting for the good timing.

117
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,970
By then,

118
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,950
you will tell me everything,

119
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,490
right?

120
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,100
So before that,

121
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,640
I will try to act as Zhuang Xinyan.

122
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,710
I won't expose my identity.

123
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,970
No matter what difficulties I will face,

124
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,310
I won't give up.

125
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,690
Did Tang Lin

126
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,350
find out who I am?

127
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,700
You knew it?

128
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,080
A series of things happened recently.

129
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,970
Tang Lin kept pushing harder and harder.

130
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,520
I don't think

131
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,330
she wanted to test my bottom line.

132
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,960
She just wanted to find the evidence

133
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,490
that I'm not Zhuang Xinyan.

134
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,530
Xingcheng.

135
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,910
If Tang Lin finds the evidence

136
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,440
that I'm not Zhuang Xinyan,

137
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,840
you can just push me out.

138
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,190
What are you talking about?

139
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,850
If the evidence that I'm not Zhuang Xinyan

140
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,800
is exposed,

141
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,790
I'll bear all the consequences.

142
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,070
Manning.

143
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,200
Do you know what you are talking about?

144
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,210
I don't know what will happen

145
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,380
after I pretended to be Zhuang Xinyan.

146
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,430
I don't know

147
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,980
if it is exposed，

148
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,500
what punishment I'll have to face.

149
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,840
But I know

150
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,340
if Zhuang Xinyan hadn't been there that night,

151
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,540
I would have died.

152
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,240
Shen Manning.

153
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,900
My life, my eyes,

154
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,340
everything

155
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,620
is no longer just mine.

156
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,710
If we were exposed,

157
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,250
you should at least hide well,

158
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,250
so that all our efforts

159
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,570
will not be wasted,

160
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,260
right?

161
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,730
Trust me.

162
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,060
I can handle it.

163
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,290
The flowers won't bloom again.

164
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,770
The season is wrong.

165
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,440
Even if the season is right,

166
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,350
the flowers can not be planted alive.

167
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,160
Why?

168
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,270
Because its heart died.

169
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,770
People who should have bloomed here

170
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,180
left

171
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,820
one after another.

172
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,520
Even if the one left behind supports it strenuously.

173
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,500
Water.

174
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,150
Sunshine.

175
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,950
Fertilizer.

176
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,310
They still...

177
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,109
They can't bloom.

178
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,940
The flowers won't bloom

179
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:12,720
in a house where the sun does not shine in,

180
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,619
in this dark corner.

181
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,950
So,

182
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,359
should we open the windows?

183
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,690
Can the sun shine in?

184
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,980
It would be nice to have the windows open

185
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,460
to let the sunlight

186
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,610
and the wind come in.

187
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,770
Let those who should stay stay.

188
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,130
For those who shouldn't stay,

189
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,490
let her go.

190
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,830
I will stay here

191
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,370
until the flowers bloom.

192
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,700
Thursday afternoon.

193
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,940
Maybe it will be a good day.

194
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,730
Let's go to the beach

195
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,040
to fly kites

196
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,060
and have a picnic.

197
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,490
I'll tell you

198
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,350
all my secrets.

199
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,810
Give it back!

200
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,040
When does my sister

201
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,070
need to drink to drown her sorrows?

202
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,820
I don't drink to drown my sorrows.

203
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,160
I'm angry.

204
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,590
Who pissed you off?

205
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,120
I'll deal with him.

206
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,180
That guy of the House of Zhuang.

207
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,770
Yan Xingcheng.

208
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,240
This man is not that simple.

209
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,380
Why must you choose him?

210
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,790
He's handsome

211
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,160
and capable.

212
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,870
I like him.

213
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,310
Men in the world is countless.

214
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,060
As long as you don't choose the people of the House of Zhuang,

215
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,960
I will find

216
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,770
anyone you like for you.

217
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,480
I just want Yan Xingcheng.

218
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,280
Get him here.

219
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,200
Enough.

220
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,270
You've had enough.

221
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,940
Don't think about it.

222
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,470
He's the grandson-in-law of the House of Zhuang.

223
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,930
Although I'm not convinced of the House of Zhuang in business,

224
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,410
but I'm not used to

225
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,090
undermining the foundation for other's housework.

226
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,050
What if he is not

227
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,540
the grandson-in-law of the House Of Zhuang?

228
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,220
What if the House of Zhuang

229
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,320
has no granddaughter?

230
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,670
Anyway,

231
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,720
I just want Yan Xingcheng.

232
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,680
No matter what it takes,

233
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,310
I must get him.

234
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:48,980
Brother.

235
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,450
Just wait and see.

236
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,550
When the truth comes out,

237
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,050
I can take LH Star

238
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,550
back to you with ease.

239
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:07,820
Linlin,

240
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,720
remember that you are my sister.

241
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,200
Remember the rules I set for you since you were a kid.

242
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,680
You should be clear about what to do and what not to do.

243
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,390
You should have a bottom line.

244
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,750
I know.

245
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,250
You don't have to lecture me.

246
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,520
[Yan Xingcheng]

247
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,510
Can we meet?

248
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,340
Of course.

249
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,810
Hello, Fang Xiang.

250
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,980
Where are you?

251
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,380
Go back now.

252
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,850
Our plan is going to be ahead of schedule.

253
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,270
Director Lin.

254
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,070
You're awake.

255
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,190
How did you sleep last night?

256
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,020
Open the door.

257
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,210
I'm going back now.

258
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,140
Don't worry.

259
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,290
Our boss said

260
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,150
I didn't

261
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,030
treat you well.

262
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,310
He asked me to buy the food early in the morning.

263
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,980
Let's

264
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,120
have a good meal.

265
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,470
Thank you.

266
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,600
But I really have something important to do.

267
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,400
Open the door.

268
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,590
Director Lin,

269
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,570
don't be so disrespectful.

270
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,320
If you leave,

271
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,850
Boss will say I didn't treat you well.

272
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,040
How about this?

273
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,910
Let's have a drink.

274
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,350
Have a drink?

275
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,600
This door has an electronic lock.

276
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,720
You can't get out anyway.

277
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,630
Just a couple of drinks.

278
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,360
Half an hour.

279
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,190
It won't delay your business.

280

[Death Record]

281
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,060
The weather is so nice.

282
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,640
Mom, Uncle Shen, hurry up.

283
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,260
Director Lin.

284
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,420
I bought these for you specially.

285
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,810
I brought this wine

286
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,210
from Qingdao.

287
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,900
This wine has a rich taste and a long lasting aftertaste.

288
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,590
You can drink as much as you want.

289
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,880
Thank you for your kindness.

290
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,480
But I really don't have time.

291
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,900
We agreed to have a drink.

292
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,520
Don't you drink a single glass of wine?

293
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,210
OK?

294
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,610
Director Lin, you're a good drinker.

295
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,340
Have another drink after this.

296
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,360
Fang Xiang,

297
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,700
I really have something important to do.

298
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,980
If you don't let me go now,

299
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
it'll be too late.

300
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,450
What important thing?

301
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,010
Except life and death,

302
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,190
it's nothing.

303
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,310
I'm talking about something as important as life and death.

304
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,690

305

I'm liked by the daughter of Luminous Group.

307
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,750
Should I say it's an honor

308
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,610
or misfortune?

309
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,450
You were engaged to the granddaughter of LH Star Group.

310
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,070
Should I say it's an honor

311

or misfortune?

312
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,120
I think the answer to this question

313
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,830
lies in that the young lady sitting in front of you

314
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,950
is true

315
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,980
or

316

fake?

If you don't let me go,

319
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,100
who knows what she will do?

320
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,750
It'll be too late,

00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,310
if something happens.

322
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,680

323
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,050
We also know

324
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,450
what Tang Lin knows.

325
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,290
Our boss

326
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,170
will take care of it.

327
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,130
So your boss

328
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,420
went to see her, right?

329
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,090
How did you know?

330
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,090
I also know

331
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,680
Tang Lin

332
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,780
won't see your boss

333
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
and Xinyan alone.

334
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:20,570
No.

335
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,920
It should be Manning.

336
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,470
Shen Manning will be there too.

337
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,310
I got everything right, right?

338
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,430
I know Tang Lin too well.

339
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,300
Once she gets the evidence,

340
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,400
she will take the initiative.

341
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,130
And she'll do whatever it takes.

342
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,470
What she wants now

343
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,860
is not only Yan Xingcheng, your boss.

344
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,660
What she wants

345
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,290
is to make Zhuang Xinyan be utterly discredited.

346
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,420
Then she wants to perish with you guys.

347
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,240
Miss Tang's problem

348
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,300
has come to an end.

349
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,740
Do I need to answer?

350
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,490
Yan Xingcheng.

351
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,070
What's wrong with you?

352
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,580
Do you think everything

353
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,410
is under your control?

354
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,290
No matter what I say or do,

355
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,120
you're not surprised

356
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,920
and scared, right?

357
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,610
Of course I will be scared of something.

358
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,270
Did you block my phone signal?

359
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,000
If you don't believe me,

360
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,430
go and check

361
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,610
if Tang Lin contacted me.

362
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,750
What are you afraid of?

363
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,230
How dare you hurt Zhuang Xinyan?

364
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,910
So Zhuang Xinyan is your pain.

365
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,380
That one over there

366
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,170
isn't your pain, right?

367
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,510
Yan Xingcheng.

368
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:11,980
Who are you?

369
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,450
Why are you here?

370
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,130
What do you want?

371
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,860
What is your purpose?

372
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,550
Are you qualified to know?

373
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:21,670
Mr. Yan,

374
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,560
have you considered the consequences of infuriating me?

375
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,490
What do you want?

376
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,910
Do it.

377
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:42,750
Hello.

378
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,590
What?

379
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,470
An accident?

380
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,250
What accident?

381
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,440
My daughter is in Italy.

382
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,520
Hello?

383
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,160
Hello?

384
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,370
Uncle Shen.

385
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,260
What accident?

386
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,660
What happened to Manman?

387
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,440
Emergency center called

388
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,430
Manning just came back.

389
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,760
She fell at the airport.

390
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,230
Her life is in danger.

391
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,840
Is it true?

392
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,670
Let's take a look.

393
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,100
Mom.

394
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,850
Don't worry.

395
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:09,930
Uncle Shen,

396
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,310
do you have Manman's foreign number?

397

Call her.

Taxi.

Something is going to happen.

Yan Xingcheng,

403
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,370
don't you want to say anything?

404
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:34,930
To you?

405
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,200
No need.

406
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,230
Hello, Dad.

407
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,010
What are they doing?

408
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,660
Are they going to take Dad with them?

409
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,380
No.

410
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,850
Isn't that Man...

411
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:47,520
Manman?

412
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,780
Dad.
