So many people

34
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,360
can't even protect Xinyan.

35
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,970
You always say that you can protect the Group

36
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,230
and save LH Star.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,760
In the end,

38
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,790
there were bond default.

39
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,190
The financial list lost.

40
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,540
The designer was bribed.

41
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,740
The Group was framed by Luminous Group.

42
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,870
Now,

43
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,100
even my granddaughter

44
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,160
got involved in it.

45
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,040
Listen,

46
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,950
LH Star Group can fall.

47
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,440
But

48
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,360
if anything happens to Xinyan,

49
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,980
none of you

50
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,980
can escape.

51
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,900
Grandpa.

52
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,200
Xinyan.

53
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,510
Xinyan.

54
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,410
How are you?

55
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,720
Are you still feeling unwell?

56
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,930
I'm fine.

57
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,750
I just feel

58
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,170
a little dizzy.

59
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,590
The doctor came yesterday.

60
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,850
He said you inhaled too much dense smoke.

61
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,870
Your throat and respiratory tract were burned.

62
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,560
That's why you were in a coma.

63
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,680
Are you feeling better now?

64
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,310
Do you need a doctor?

65
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,540
Lin.

66
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:52,890
Grandpa.

67
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,150
I'm really fine.

68
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,829
Really?

69
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,710
Don't make me worry.

70
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,250
I heard that something happened to you yesterday.

71
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,850
I didn't sleep all night.

72
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,660
Grandpa.

73
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,610
I'm sorry

74
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,010
for making you worry.

75
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,870
Xinyan,

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,329
you are everything to the House of Zhuang.

77
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,410
You're here.

78
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,590
The House of Zhuang is here.

79
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,390
If anything happens to you,

80
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,030
the House of Zhuang will collapse.

81
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,560
Grand...

82
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,630
Grandpa.

83
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,230
I made you all worry about me.

84
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,360
Don't worry.

85
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,520
I'm really fine.

86
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,440
You should get some rest too.

87
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,350
You're awake.

88
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,230
I'm relieved.

89
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:09,720
You

90
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,700
get engaged with Xinyan.

91
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,500
Grandpa.

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,350
LH Star

93
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,300
has no leader now.

94
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,620
Even if she became the CEO

95
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,159
on behalf of me,

96
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,130
there are always people

97
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,090
being not convinced.

98
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,440
I want you to get engaged

99
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,550
and hold a grand engagement ceremony immediately.

100
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,960
Let those people

101
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,130
who eye covetously LH Star

102
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,590
open their eyes to see that

103
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,800
you are

104
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,330
the new owners of LH Star.

105
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,440
I've got the exhibit back

106
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,420
and design it again.

107
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,410
I asked Yuan Shuai

108
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,250
to take it to the jewelry show.

109
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,650
LH Star won't fall into

110
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,940
a business trap.

111
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,850
There was no fire in the company yesterday.

112
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,030
Someone put a cake tobacco with something in it

113
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,340
in the ventilator.

114
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,170
The wind is heading to your office.

115
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,340
I've reassigned new security guards.

116
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,880
I've also sent the CCTV to Fang Xiang.

117
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,190
I promise

118
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,670
this won't happen again.

119
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,390
I trust you.

120
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,800
Do you still feel dizzy?

121
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,000
Do you need I call...

122
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,510
I'll call the doctor for you.

123
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,010
Let's get engaged.

124
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,270
Let's get engaged.

125
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:52,470
Just like

126
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,210
Grandpa said,

127
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,990
let's hold a grand engagement ceremony.

128
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,330
Let the people outside

129
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,630
and inside the Group

130
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,050
can see us.

131
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,320
Do you know what you're talking about?

132
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,390
I know.

133
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:20,790
I know.

134
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,370
I'm not the real Zhuang Xinyan.

135
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,920
But after I came back here,

136
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,860
I have no one to rely on.

137
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,360
Last night,

138
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,910
when I fell on the ground,

139
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,540
you were the only one...

140
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,060
I only have you.

141
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,750
So can you come to me

142
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,440
and be with me?

143
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,160
Do you know what's the meaning of

144
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,560
getting engaged with me?

145
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,430
If you fall in,

146
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,500
you'll never get out.

147
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,980
Do you know who I am?

148
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,160
Do you know why I came back?

149
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,310
If everything is not ready,

150
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,380
are you sure you want to get engaged with me?

♫It opes in my heart♫

177
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,130

♫It shines on my heart♫

What's that look on your face?

198
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,790
Happy expression.

199
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,540
What do you think?

200
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,800
Would you like a drink?

201
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,780
Why are you drinking so early in the morning?

202
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,890
What is it?

203
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,430
Brother.

204
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,750
He beat you.

205
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,890
They really changed the design.

206
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,830
What do you think?

207
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,830
Isn't he awesome?

208
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,660
It took less than 48 hours

209
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,320
from recalling the design to reworking it.

210
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,110
Besides,

211
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,960
the sender of the designer, Lin Mufan

212
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,590
is Yan Xingcheng.

213
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,620
Why are you so happy when your brother lost?

214
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,760
Are you doing this for Lin Mufan

215
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,040
or Yan Xingcheng?

216
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,710
For both of them.

217
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,180
Can't I?

218
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,460
I spoiled you so much.

219
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,560
Brother,

220
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,830
don't be angry.

221
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,910
I know

222
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,380
you've been planning for the mergers and acquisitions of LH Star

223
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,330
for a long time.

224
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,920
But think about it.

225
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,470
If it was merged so easily,

226
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,750
it's meaningless

227
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,170
to us.

228
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,970
There are two outstanding men in LH Star.

229
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,630
Don't you think

230
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,980
winning them

231
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,750
and conquering them

232
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,290
is more interesting?

233
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,620
Business war

234
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,050
is unlike your fashion studio's brands.

235
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,920
Once you miss the chance, it won't come back.

236
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,270
This is the best time to beat LH Star.

237
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,880
However, I didn't expect

238
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,880
this little girl is nothing,

239
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,120
but each of the two men around her

240
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,600
-are better than the other. -Mr. Tang.

241
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,710
What?

242
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,080
Mr. Lin.

243
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,660
I'm the new CEO of the Group.

244
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,290
I invited you here

245
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,060
to help me deal with the crisis of the exhibit.

246
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,620
I don't want you to take

247
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,410
any other emotions there.

248
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,510
She looks exactly

249
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,600
like me.

250
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,590
My name is Shen Manning.

251
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,640
I'm a senior design student in the Department of Art.

252
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,070
Shen Manning?

253
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,120
I'm not.

254
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,910
You got the wrong person.

255
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,800
If I do,

256
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,120
who are you?

257
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,430
I'm Zhuang Xinyan.

258
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,970
Xinyan

259
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,170
specialized in finance and business management abroad.

260
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,740
If she is really Xinyan...

261
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,930
Only art students

262
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,900
can draw this line.

263
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,780
So cool.

264
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,160
It will definitely be popular.

265
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,830
They look good together.

266
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,630
I'm poisoned.

267
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,819
I'm dying.

268
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,960
I will depend on you

269
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,300
in the rest of my life.

270
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,690
If you say so,

271
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,240
you'd better die now.

272
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,370
Why do you

273
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,750
have no sympathy at all?

274
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,510
You should at least comfort me.

275
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,330
Comfort you?

276
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,330
You stole someone elser's burger,

277
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,980
do you want comfort now?

278
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,720
Should I buy a new one

279
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,720
and let you enjoy it?

280
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,940
I think it's good.

281
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,400
You wish.

282
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,230
No, no, no.

283
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,360
I'll draw it for you.

284
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,870
Why do you become a lady

285
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,150
when Yuan Shuai comes?

286
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,120
Yuan Shuai,

287
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,310
have a seat.

288
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,720
I bought you a cake.

289
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,650
He won't come.

290
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,590
Have you ever seen a husky that protects its food?

291
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,830
I haven't seen a husky that has a sweet tooth.

292
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,600
It's okay.

293
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,400
Just eat.

294
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,670
Just think we don't exist. Right?

295
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,780
Yes, you eat.

296
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,920
Enjoy.

297
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,680
Enjoy.

298
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,330
A cool man's favorite is sweetmeat,

299
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,350
just like my best friend.

300
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,470
My best friend

301
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,870
liked this cake the most.

302
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,360
But after her study trip,

303
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,150
she never replied to my messages.

304
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,220
She still didn't reply my messages.

305
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,740
Who?

306
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Your best friend?

307
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,030
Yes.

308
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,590
My best friend.

309
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,190
We grew up together.

310
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,880
We went to Arts University to study together.

311
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,540
We agreed to go home together.

312
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,980
Did you also graduate from Arts University?

313
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:34,970
Wait.

314
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,470
What do you mean?

315
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,190
Do you know anyone else

316
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,790
who graduated from Overseas Arts University?

317
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,430
Just a friend.

318
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,990
A friend?

319
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,130
Is she a girl?

320
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,980
Let me tell you.

321
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,630
It'd better not be my bestie.

322
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,590
We used to be good friends.

323
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,580
It's like that we were inseparable.

324
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,410
But now?

325
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,870
Shen Manning,

326
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,650
I'll see if you'll come back.

327
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,110
Your friend's surname is Shen...

328
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,950
Shen Manning.

329
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,130
25 years old.

330
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,860
My childhood friend.

331
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,390
We went to Arts University to study together.

332
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,800
She majored in design.

333
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,290
And I...

334
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,580
I majored in anime art.

335
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,380
What's wrong?

336
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,700
Do you know my friend?

337
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,300
It's impossible.

338
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,450
She is your friend.

339
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:34,710
Right.

340
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,030
I got a message.

341
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:39,870
Oh no.

342
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,020
Something happened in the company.

343
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,680
Yuan Shuai,

344
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,620
we have to go.

345
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,710
See you.

346
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,490
What's the rush?

347
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,640
Yuan Shuai,

348
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,130
Yuan Shuai, you haven't finished your cake.

349
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,260
You can't take this plate, can you?

350
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,710
What a coincidence!

351
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,740
Shen Manning is her best friend.

352
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:10,910
Do you know?

353
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:11,630
No.

354
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,660
Since you did not know, why did you answer yes?

355
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,380
But once,

356
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,960
when she saw Boss and Ms. Zhuang Xinyan together,

357
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,020
she called Shen...

358
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,740
Shen...

359
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,280
Who is it?

360
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,510
I thought she was unauthorized personnel,

361
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,640
so I pulled her away.

362
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:30,750
Oh.

363
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,050
What should we do?

364
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,930
If she meets Ms. Zhuang Xinyan again in the office...

365
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,330
-I'll report to Boss. -Wait.

366
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,790
Don't tell Boss

367
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,150
everything in the first place.

368
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:44,990
If he knows,

369
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,770
she'll definitely be fired.

370
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,130
It must be hard for her

371
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
to work in LH Star.

372
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,900
Can you bear to let her resign

373
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,030
because of one word?

374
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,840
Then what should we do?

375
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,190
How about this?

376
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,840
Let's suppress the news

377
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,430
and keep an eye on her.

378
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,490
Don't let her meet Ms. Zhuang Xinyan.

379
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,180
Boss and Ms. Zhuang Xinyan are here.

380
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,050
[LH Star, Luminous. The battle of two major jewelry brands]

381
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,650
In the leading companies in the jewelry industry,

382
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,070
there could be something as serious as arson.

383
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,270
It's definitely the big news tomorrow.

384
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,240
Maybe it's related to Mr. Tang of Luminous.

385
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,570
Didn't Mr. Zhuang and Mr. Tang

386
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,310
have a serious conflict?

387
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:42,710
Today,

388
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,040
they are the grasshoppers who will go through the autumn.

389
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,300
Let's see how long they can keep jumping.

390
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,150
We gather you here today

391
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,330
for two things.

392
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,830
When the President was seriously ill,

393
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,800
the Group

394
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,260
was in chaos.

395
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,780
The company also suffered serious

396
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,620
bonds crisis.

397
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,900
The crisis was just solved.

398
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,450
The opponent group attacked our new product

399
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,380
using copyright design

400
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,670
as the starting point.

401
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,710
We have been questioned by media

402
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,170
and made many shareholders

403
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,830
lose confidence in our group.

404
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,480
Now,

405
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,370
the crisis has been solved.

406
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,480
But the internal adjustment of the group

407
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,310
is extremely urgent.

408
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,710
So first,

409
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,820
LH Star Group

410
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,000
will reconsolidate from top to bottom.

411
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,550
Mr. Chen,

412
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,710
I want to transfer you from logistics to the Operating Department

413
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,240
as the Operating Director.

414
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,910
Me?

415
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,350
You used to work under the President Zhuang

416
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,440
in operation.

417
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,370
Now,

418
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,210
are you still willing to work?

419
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,310
I can.

420
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,600
Don't worry.

421
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,520
I'll take care of

422
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,890
Operating Center.

423
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:37,700
Okay.

424
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:39,890
Mr. Lin.

425
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,090
Ms. Zhuang.

426
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,820
I want you to be the director of the Design Center.

427
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,880
Is there a problem?

428
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,460
But Mr. Qian...

429
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,060
Answer me.

430
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:49,950
Can you

431
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,270
or not?

432
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:04,740
I can.

433
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:05,970
OK.

434
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,260
Lin Mufan is the director of the Design Center.

435
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,060
From now on, all the art of

436
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,960
new designs

437
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,620
should be reported to him.

438
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:14,750
Zhuang Xinyan.

439
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,370
What do you want to do?

440
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,860
The Design Director has been

441
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,750
with our company for 20 years.

442
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,350
Do you want to ignore him now?

443
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,850
Ms. Zhuang.

444
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,130
I've never seen

445
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,220
so much fuss.

446
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,610
Mr. Zhuang.

447
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,480
You used to be the acting CEO of the company,

448
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,420
and the Vice President of the company.

449
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,070
But now,

450
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,150
I'm afraid

451
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,510
you will have another position.

452
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,610
Zhuang Xinyan.

453
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,510
How dare you do this to me?

454
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,510
Mr. Zhuang will be transferred from the position of Vice President,

455
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,140
and be the director of the Logistics Department.

456
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,020
Zhuang Xinyan.

457
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,560
How dare you transfer me to the logistics?

458
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,290
The logistics work

459
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,180
also needs some ability.

460
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,370
Mr. Zhao,

461
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,970
your transfer

462
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,200
will be far away.

463
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,330
Mr. Zhao.

464
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,660
Turn yourself in.

465
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,190
Ms. Zhuang, are you going to deal with me?

466
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,940
You know

467
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,140
what you've done.

468
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,580
Zhuang Xinyan,

469
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,310
don't think you can do whatever you want

470
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,990
just because you're the granddaughter of the President.

471
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,680
Listen.

472
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,040
You're too young

473
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,240
to drive me away.

474
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,730
You used the President's illness

475
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,070
to manipulate the Finance Department,

476
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,890
bribe the financial manager

477
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,550
and the design director

478
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,570
to produce plagiarism works,

479
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,250
do high throwing

480
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,900
and bargain hunting,

481
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,060
open a private account,

482
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,000
and prepare for immigration.

483
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,760
Do you want me to continue?

484
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,200
These are enough for you to be jailed for 30 years.

485
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,880
I didn't.

486
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,580
You are slandering me!

487
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,970
It's a frame-up!

488
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:48,910
Zhuang Xinyan.

489
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,060
If you dare,

490
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,540
show me the evidence.

491
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,650
I didn't.

492
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,930
I didn't!

493
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,080
Let go of me!

494
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,520
Let go of me!

495
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,350
Are you celebrating  Chinese New Year?

496
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,210
It's so lively.

497
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:07,900
Young lady,

498
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,600
are you good?

499
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,860
You can respond quickly and effectively according to the current situation.

500
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,120
I underestimated you.

501
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,940
Thanks to you.

502
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:18,740
Good.

503
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,850
You win this round.

504
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,750
But there will be another round.

505
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,700
Looking forward to it.

506
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,790
I'm always honest.

507
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,480
I admit what I did.

508
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,130
I spent a lot of money

509
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,290
bribing the design director of LH Star

510
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,740
and asking them to design

511
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,750
the same work as that of Luminous.

512
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,300
I just wanted to create a public opinion storm.

513
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,080
I just wanted to

514
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,060
blacklist them from the industry.

515
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,120
I just wanted to make their import and export

516
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,420
harder.

517
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,610
This was an unfair business act.

518
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,920
I did it.

519
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,700
I admit it and will correct it.

520
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,100
I accept the punishment.

521
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,720
But

522
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:10,140
don't slander Luminous

523
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,250
for killing or harming people.

524
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,010
Business is business.

525
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,870
Competition is competition.

526
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,590
Even if I lose everything,

527
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,870
I won't harm anyone.

528
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,880
Ms. Zhuang.

529
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,380
Luminous will still be

530
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,010
your business competitor.

531
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,490
But don't worry.

532
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,280
About your safety,

533
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,070
I won't hurt a hair on your head.

534
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,750
Got it, Mr. Tang.

535
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,170
The witness and evidence you want are here.

536
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,170
What else do you want to say?

537
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,330
Ms. Zhuang.

538
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,870
I was wrong.

539
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,700
I shouldn't have...

540
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,430
Take him out!

541
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:09,940
Let me go.

542
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,980
Ms. Zhuang.

543
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:11,670
Ms. Zhuang.

544
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,830
Please let me go.

545
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,270
I was wrong.

546
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,720
Next, I'm going to announce

547
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
the second thing.

548
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,350
With the consent of the President,

549
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,030
Mr. Yan and I will hold an engagement Ceremony

550
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,100
in a week.

551
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,420
♫Falling in love with the most dangerous person♫

552
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,410
♫I can't let go♫

553
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,200
♫Oh, forget it♫

554
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,240
After the engagement,

555
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,670
♫Meeting the most dangerous person♫

556
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,570
Mr. Yan will be the closest person to me.

557
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:10,090
♫I can't turn him down♫

558
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,500
At the same time,

559
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,600
we will also be

560
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,570
♫This love drama♫

561
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,080
♫He is the most dangerous♫

562
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,880
the new owners

563
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,940
♫The concern left for me♫

564
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,730
♫Oh, forget it♫

565
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,920
of LH Star.

566
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,190
♫Leave the most dangerous place♫

567
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,640
♫But I've already fallen♫

568
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,330
How about this one?

569
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,620
Not bad.

570
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,940
You're the best at making me happy.

571
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,430
In this family,

572
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,690
besides you and Mufan,

573
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,410
who else can I trust?

574
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,490
Ms. Zhuang Xinyan and Mr. Yan.

575
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,910
Yes.

576
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,800
I have my granddaughter

577
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,310
and my grandson-in-law.

578
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,700
By the way,

579
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,940
is Mufan going to the engagement ceremony today?

580
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,310
He has work to do.

581
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,210
Maybe...

582
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,090
Ms. Caixuan is here.

583
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,530
What are you doing?

584
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,350
I have a charity meeting,

585
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,460
so I can't attend Xinyan's engagement ceremony.

586
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,320
Dad, please give this gift to her.

587
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,420
Don't let Xinyan think I've neglected her.

588
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,860
Why are you so generous?

589
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:30,630
We're a family.

590
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,010
Why did you say that?

591
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,310
Jiakai is immature.

592
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,430
Maybe everything in the House of Zhuang

593
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,870
will belong to Xinyan.

594
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,790
Dad.

595
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,120
It's too late.

596
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,160
I have to go.

597
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,270
Please give this gift to Xinyan for me.

598
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,430
Also,

599
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,950
the tie suits you better.

600
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,240
I didn't expect I can encounter

601
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,720
an engagement of the CEO.

602
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,940
With Ms. Zhuang and Mr. Yan,

603
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,000
LH Star can't

604
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,040
be bullied again.

605
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,930
Mr. Yan is so handsome.

606
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,110
Can you stop being so obsessed?

607
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,420
Everyone is here for

608
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,100
the CEO's engagement ceremony.

609
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,960
So many people.

610
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,370
The director asked me to send the materials to producer.

611
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,020
I don't think the producer is here.

612
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,090
I want to see the beautiful bride too.

613
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,070
Ms. Zhuang, you're so beautiful.

614
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:12,810
Mr. Yan will like you very much

615
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,850
when he sees you.

616
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:15,929
Really?

617
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,080
Of course.

618
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,730
Especially your eyes,

619
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,239
they are the clearest eyes that I have seen.

620
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,420
Eyes?

621
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,590
Your lip shape is pretty too.

622
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,469
Later,

623
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:31,090
I will use a lipstick for you.

624
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,989
When you kiss Mr. Yan,

625
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,590
it won't run.

626
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,570
Kiss?

627
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,409
Yes.

628
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,400
After you exchange your engagement rings,

629
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,330
won't you kiss?

630
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,390
Hello, producer.

631
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,220
I have the document.

632
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,510
I'll send it to you right away.

633
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,310
Sorry.

634
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,600
Sorry.

635
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,630
Did I hear it wrong?

636
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,970
It sounds like Meina.

637
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,440
Okay.

638
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,000
I'll be there in five minutes.

639
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,720
Sorry.

640
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,510
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

641
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,360
Sorry.

642
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,470
Sorry.

643
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:20,570

Luckily I ran fast.

677
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,630
Finally, I can see

678
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,430
the sweet moment of the CEO and the Vice President.

679
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,710
Man... Manning!
