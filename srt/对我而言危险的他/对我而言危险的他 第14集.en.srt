00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,259
It has been two hours and she still

6
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,120
hasn't finished taking a shower?

7
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,150
So what?

8
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:41,979
What is wrong with two hours?

9
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,440
I can take a shower all day.

10
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,610
You're overreacting.

11
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,509
Are you hiding something from us?

12
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,780
No.

13
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,870
Maybe she is about to finish soon.

14
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,490
I don't believe it.

15
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,150
Step aside.

16
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,880
What are you doing?

17
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,710
You jerk!

18
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,150
Do you want to go in and peek at her shower?

19
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,080
Go away!

20
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,940
You jerk!

21
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,850
You can't go in.

22
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,270
You can't!

23
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,789
What are you doing?

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,289

Are you trying to peek at her shower?

27
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,620
You can't go in.

28

Go away!

Why are you all wet?

39
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,120
Did you see him?

40
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,400
Did you talk to him?

Wake up, Manman.

52
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,610
I seem to have had

53
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,440
a long and panicky dream.

54
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,560
In the dream,

55
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,190
I experienced a completely different life

56
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,650
of another person.

57
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,550
Now that I wake up from my dream,

58
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,730
and I'm back in my world.

59
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,800
Don't move. Relax.

60
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,690
It doesn't seem real.

61
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,420
You naughty kid.

62
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:50,930
But...

63
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,230
this is the life I should have.

64
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,100
You little greedy cat. Go away.

65
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,580

69
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,440
It has been a long time

70
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,130
since we've had a family dinner together.

71
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,210
Come on.

72
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:35,840
Come on.

73
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,620
Cheers.

74
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,640
Come on, Manman.

75
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,870
-Uncle. -Manning.

76
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,230
Say sorry to Auntie Huixin

77
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,580
and Meina.

Manning.

80
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,420
I know you must had your reasons

81
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,680
and difficulties to do those things.

82
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,430
You've grown up.

83
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,080
I don't want to

84
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,870
ask and blame you too much.

85
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,570
Now that you're back,

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
you have to apologize

87
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,200
for what you did.

88
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,090

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,440
Nana.

90
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,350
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,420
I know what I did

92
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,160
hurt you.

93
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,920
No matter what the reason was,

94
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,810
I was wrong.

95
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,630
I want to apologize to you seriously.

96
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,780
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,780
Kid,

98
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,770
you must have suffered a lot

99
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,830
being in someone else's home.

100
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,790
Shen,

101
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,390
why are you doing this?

102
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,370
Manman.

103
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,310
Since you said so,

104
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,220
I forgive you.

105
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,290
Manning.

106
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,920
Because of such an attitude of yours,

107
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,040
this matter is over in our family.

108
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,910
-Come on. -Together.

109
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,190
Together. Come on.

110
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,130
-Nana. -Mom.

111
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,030
Mom.

112
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,630
Uncle.

113
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,620
A toast to you.

114
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,250
Cheers!

115
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,000
-Come on. -Okay.

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,460
Come on.

117
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,150
-I wanted to eat this. -Let's eat.

118
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,750
Let's eat.

119
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,790
Now you are standing here.

120
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,530
I feel like a dream.

121
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,480
You wouldn't leave suddenly again, would you?

122
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,320
You wouldn't tell me one day

123
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,570
that you don't know me at all, would you?

124
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,090
Fine.

125
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,330
I'll stop talking about it, okay?

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,130
You must have suffered a lot this time.

127
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,870
Since you suddenly disappeared

128
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,600
from arts university, I got it.

129
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,750
Now I remember you asked me

130
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,220
what would happen if twin flowers meet that day,

131
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,760
I can't help but be scared.

132
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,430
Nana.

133
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:19,880
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,760
We've been best friends for 20 years.

135
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,560
Why do you always say sorry to me?

136
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,270
But, Manman,

137
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,429
how was that part of your life going?

138
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,289
Did you really experience the omen of death

139
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,309
or the climax of fate?

140
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,220
What about you and that man?

141
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,710
Yan...Yan Xingcheng?

142
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,330
Before the House of Zhuang issued such a big change notice,

143
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,940
they should have had a meeting with us shareholders

144
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,760
to inform us.

145
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,960
The stock price went down this morning.

146
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,130
If it goes on like this,

147
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,810
we'll lose everything.

148
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,450
We don't care

149
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,870
what people in the House of Zhuang do.

150
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,860
But they should live up to

151
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,250
our investment.

152
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,150
If the new one can't hold onto his seat,

153
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,870
why don't we...

154
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,840
Who complained just now?

155
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,530
Say it again.

156
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,560
I know what you're thinking.

157
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,560
About the matters of House of Zhuang,

158
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,430
it is not necessary to explain too much to you.

159
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,560
As long as the House of Zhuang still has LH Star,

160
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,040
you don't have to worry about your shares.

161
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,840
I'll guarantee you with everything the House of Zhuang and I have.

162
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,020
You will only

163
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,350
get more,

164
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,990
not less.

165
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,120
It is easy for you to say, CEO.

166
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,760
But the company's top management suddenly changed.

167
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,320
The stock price has been plummeting.

168
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,520
I don't know how the company can save it.

169
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,360
What else can you do to regain the shareholders' confidence?

170
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,170
Not to mention development of new series and products,

171
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,210
even new production lines

172
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,670
need funds and cash flows.

173
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,420
The resource lines and product lines all collapsed.

174
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,740
When the company's detailed financial results for the first half of the year were released,

175
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,180
the stock price would plummet even more.

176
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,620
That's right.

177
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,020
Everything needs money.

178
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,650
Since the change of succession of top management

179
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,740
caused trouble,

180
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,410
the top management should figure out a way

181
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,870
to announce positive news

182
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,070
to stabilize the shareholders.

183
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,310
What positive news?

184
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,760
Tell me.

185
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,440
Marriage between LH Star and Luminous Group.

186
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,840
According to the information we got privately,

187
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,700
our competitor, Luminous Group,

188
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,460
has always wanted to collaborate with us.

189
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,740
Miss Tang Lin of Luminous Group

190
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,760
seems to have connections with the House of Zhuang.

191
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,310
As two famous luxury jewelry companies,

192
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,290
if you can collaborate,

193
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,220
it will be a great benefit for the jewelry market

194
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,620
as well as the stock price

195
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,010
of both companies.

196
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,470
We won't worry about losing our shareholders' confidence

197
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,260
and save our company's stock price.

198
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,170
Marriage?

199
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,400
Mr. Sheng,

200
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,630
who do you want to arrange to marry Miss Tang Lin of Luminous Group?

201
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,420
Whoever has the power of LH Star

202
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,440
should go.

203
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,270
Mr. Sheng.

204
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,420
-Please mind your words. -Fang Xiang.

205
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,490
I agree.

206
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:30,780
Boss.

207
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,730
I told you

208
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,220
I will be responsible

209
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,330
for the House of Zhuang and LH Star.

210
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,470
You want me

211
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,320
to work in your studio?

212
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,860
You won't be an official employee for the time being.

213
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,240
But I need an assistant to complete

214
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,700
some extra designs for me.

215
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,630
When your were in the company...

216
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,720
You graduated from arts university.

217
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,120
I've seen your drawings.

218
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,010
I still have confidence

219
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,680
in your handling of the lines

220
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,440
and helping me wind up the work.

221
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,120
So,

222
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,010
will you join us?

223
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,100
I thought

224
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,880
you wouldn't want to see me again.

225
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,110
Besides,

226
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,620
I don't want to have anything to do with LH Star anymore.

227
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,400
It has nothing to do with LH Star.

228
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,800
Those are all designs of my private studio.

229
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,050
That matter is in the past.

230
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,950
Don't you want to start over?

231
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,190
Start over?

232
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,500
Go back to your own life.

233
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,130
This time,

234
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,560
you're just Shen Manning.

235
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,850
Boss,

236
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,430
how can you agree so easily?

237
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,090
Don't forget why we came back.

238
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:13,860
But...

239
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,450
I'll hold LH Star in my hands

240
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,320
and finish what I should do.

241
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,380
But you still have Shen Manning.

242
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,000
Linlin.

243
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,030
Give it back.

244
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,940
You're drunk.

245
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,820
Stop drinking.

246
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,210
You won't give it back?

247
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,260
I have more.

248
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,550
Linlin.

249
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,850
Can you leave me alone?

250
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,840
It is wrong for me to go out.

251
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,690
It is not right for me to come back.

252
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,820
I shouldn't have drunk.

253
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,950
I did nothing right.

254
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,190
I did nothing good.

255
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,090
Then why don't you just pretend I had a heart attack

256
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,010
and died on the operating table?

257
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:56,980
Linlin!

258
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,050
Linlin!

259
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,800
You've been in poor health since you were young.

260
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,490
I've always cared about you.

261
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,609
But things are different now.

262
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,430
You are the leader of Luminous Group and Celine.

263
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,140
You should be clear

264
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,000
about what you should do

265
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,460
and what you shouldn't do.

266
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,819
I don't allow you to see that man.

267
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,480
It is for your own good.

268
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,200
But I really like him.

269
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,060
I know.

270
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,810
I know he's evil.

271
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,810
Whether his background is unknown,

272
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,860
whether I can't defeat him,

273
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,380
but I was totally dazzled by him.

274
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,470
Linlin,

275
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,370
what is so good about that man?

276
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,020
Why does it have to be him?

277
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,220
Brother.

278
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,040
Does love need a reason?

279
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,480
Just think of it as...

280
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,740
I owe him in my previous life.

281
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,430
I'll pay him back in this life.

282
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,790
Lin Guangyi called me today.

283
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,360
He said many shareholders in LH Star

284
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,240
complained about the frequent changes

285
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,640
of their top management.

286
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:29,040
In order to stabilize stock prices and shareholders,

287
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,930
LH Star decided to form an alliance with us

288
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,420
and let you

289
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,010
get married.

290
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,250
You and Yan Xingcheng...

291
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,190
Really?

292
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,550
Yes.

293
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:00,620
Brother.

294
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,150
I'm going to the studio now.

295
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,760
I'll book a gown

296
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,480
and a set of jewelry.

297
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,270
Was Designer Li still there?

298
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,680
Forget it.

299
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,120
I'll go find Lin Mufan.

300
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,350
Linlin.

301
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,010
Linlin.

302
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,170
Think it over.

303
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,880
Let me help you.

304
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,700
Don't get me wrong.

305
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,330
I didn't mean anything else.

306
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,770
It is inconvenient to use just one hand for you,

307
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,900
so I came to help you.

308
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,760
Such a long wound.

309
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,950
Why don't you go to the hospital?

310
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,610
I won't die.

311
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,540
Don't talk like your unlucky boss.

312
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,970
You won't die from the wound.

313
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,570
But what if it gets infected?

314
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,060
Yan Xingcheng is made of steel.

315
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,050
Does he have to let everyone be like him?

316
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,850
It has nothing to do with Boss.

317
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,840
It is because I was careless.

318
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,410
What are you doing?

319
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,680
Dry the disinfectant for you.

320
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,690
What else can I do?

321
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,030
Give me your hand.

322
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,370
I'm not done yet.

323
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,320
♫I've never felt lonely♫

324
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,470
♫Because of your company♫

325

339
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,760
It's done.

340
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,680
Yuan Shuai.

341
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,830
Are you leaving like this?

342
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,290
You don't want your stuff?

343
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:00,640
No.

344
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,490
What is wrong?

345
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,560
Do you have something to tell me?

346
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,190
