[Episode 18]

4
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:26,850
In other words,

5
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,060
they went to arts university

6
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,060
to see Miss Xinyan

7
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,660
because they knew about the personal seal.

8
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,140
Not only did they know this,

9
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,670
they also knew that the seal

10
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,830
is with Xinyan.

11
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,440
No wonder they tried to kidnap Miss Xinyan.

12
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,880
In the end,

13
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,140
they kidnapped Shen Manning by mistake.

14
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,380
In this way,

15
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
we can explain

16
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,630
why Miss Xinyan

17
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,970
had such a big trouble

18
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,220
and why Miss Manning was involved.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,440
If they really kidnapped Zhuang Xinyan,

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,340
then LH Star would...

21
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,140
It was Manning

22
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,280
who saved LH Star and the House of Zhuang.

23
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,190
Now all fingers

24
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,840
are pointing at Miss Manning.

25
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,990
Does that mean

26
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,430
the personal seal

27
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,820
is with Miss Manning?

28
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,449
The last person Xinyan saw

29
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,230
when she had the accident was Manning.

30
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,190
But I'm not sure if that personal seal

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,420
is in Manning's hands.

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,140
Boss,

33
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,050
go ask her.

34
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,780
I don't want her to know.

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,740
In the past six months,

36
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,250
she has been in this vortex for too long.

37
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,950
I finally sent her out safely.

38
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,350
I don't want her to go back to danger.

39
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,280
But Boss,

40
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,160
the seal...

41
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,690
I'll be with her these days.

42
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,090
I'll find a chance to ask her

43
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,500
what happened during her last meeting with Xinyan.

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,020
But I don't want her to know what we're going through

45
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,270
or let any danger

46
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,530
fall into her again.

50
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,290
and clues about the truck 17 years ago.

51
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:14,580
OK.

53
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,390
follow Yang.

54
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,690
Yang is Zhuang Jiakai's right-hand man.

55
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,860
If we keep an eye on him,

56
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,020
Zhuang Jiakai won't cause any trouble.

57
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,820
When I find my mother's personal seal,

58
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,600
there might be other solutions.

59
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,800
Come back then.

60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,730

Are you awake?

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,130
I was thinking

65
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,900
if still no one answered the 20th call,

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,089
the next second,

67
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,640
I will appear by your bed.

68
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,250
You really called me more than 20 times?

69

I'm sorry.

71
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,930
I drank too much last night.

72
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,850
You called me so many times.

watched me drinking

81

don't drink so much,

Not that day.

131
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,170
It was in my dream.

you

136
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,960
walked ahead.

137
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,420
Then I followed your steps

138
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,450
and stepped behind your footsteps.

139
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,600
You turned around and held my hand.

140
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,990
You said

141
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,210
we would be together forever.

142

143
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,090
when you get back what you want,

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,200
let's get out of here.

145
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,360
Where do you want to go?

146
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,910
Anywhere.

147
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,430
Where there are mountains, rivers

148
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,360
and stars.

149
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,080
Anyway,

150
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,370
as long as I can leave these troubles

151
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,520
and won't get involved

152
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,870
in these things...

153
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,280
Maybe I've been too busy

154
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
and didn't spend much time with you?

155
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,310
No.

156
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,300
I just hope you won't be too tired.

157
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,870
I hope when you are with me,

158
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,650
you can be happy and relaxed,

159
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,820
without thinking too much.

160
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,730
As long as you're by my side,

161
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,180
it is enough.

for disturbing you.

167
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:24,670
Sorry.

168
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,100
Let's go.

169
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,670
You're so naughty.

170
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:27,890
Chen.

171
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,800
What?

172
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,540
Don't you recognize me?

173
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,140
No.

174
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,710
I'm a little surprised.

175
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,040
Why?

176
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,100
Because of me?

177
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,060
No.

178
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,080
Nobody can drink

179
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,200
my wine so easily.

180
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,930
What do you want

181
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,010
this time?

182
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,180
You.

183
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,570
You want my design.

184
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:40,910
Tell me.

185
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,040
How much do you plan to pay this time?

186
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,750
You've made progress.

187
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,260
I thought saying this

188
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,940
would scare you away.

189
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,360
I'm from the House of Zhuang.

190
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,610
This small thing

191
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,770
is not enough to scare me.

192
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,520
It is no wonder that you are the man from the House of Zhuang.

193
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,780
You're also charming.

194
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,130
I heard

195
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,680
you intend to set up a personal studio.

196
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,460
Although my Celine is not luxurious enough,

197
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,140
it is also a well-known studio

198
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,040
in the fashion industry.

199
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,190
Now,

200
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,100
as the CEO,

201
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,080
I will sign a three-year contract with you to fully cooperate.

202
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,960
I wonder if you

203
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,880
would like to take the offer?

204
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,270
A full cooperation?

205
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,220
You mean...

206
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,490
Mine

207
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,830
is yours.

208
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,510
Tang Lin,

209
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,270
I know you appreciate my designs.

210
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,350
But you don't have to

211
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,200
hand over your business which you have managed for years

212
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,430
to me.

213
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,360
I've never been indirect to

214
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,050
the person I trust.

215
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,240
Mufan,

216
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,930
you're talented.

217
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,140
I'm willing to give you

218
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,190
all of my sources

219
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,260
to help you become an international designer.

220
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:21,870
If

221
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,850
you still willing to believe me...

222
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,339
Don't talk.

223
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,700
Otherwise,

224
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,310
I can't help it.

225
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,560
What are you looking at?

226
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,960
You've never seen a couple being intimate?

227
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,210
I'm not interested in you.

228
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,510
Have fun.

229
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,530
I was scared.

230
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,790
I was scared.

231
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,880
Yuan Shuai,

232
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,500
are you just leaving like this?

233
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:48,960
Or what?

234
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,230
I helped you.

235
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,430
At least

236
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,950
you should thank me.

237
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,100
I need your help？

238
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,390
I'll say it one last time.

239
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:06,660
Don't.

240
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,580
follow me.

241
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,300
I haven't eaten this mousse cake for a long time.

242
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,160
I heard that they have improved the recipe.

243
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,030
Let me try it.

244
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,390
It tastes even better.

245
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,440
Try it.

246
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,450
Hurry.

247
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,020
You have it on your mouth.

248
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,770
Meina.

249
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,370
Hey, Meina.

250
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,320
Manman.

251
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,140
What is wrong?

252
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,390
Take your time.

253
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:39,920
Don't...

254
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,620
Don't cry.

255
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,540
Meina is crying.

256
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,390
It is okay.

257
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,120
I'll make a call.

258
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,890
Stay here and

259
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,950
don't go anywhere.

260
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,710
Manman, are you there?

261
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,010
Yes, I am.

262
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,560
Go ahead.

263
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,740
I'm listening.

264
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,370
I'm really listening.

265
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,280
Don't cry.

266
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,770
Okay, Boss.

267
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,220
I'll visit her later.

268
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,640
Don't say anything too harsh.

269
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,260
Boss.

270
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,620
Why are you...

271
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,250
Don't hang up.

272
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,740
Boss.

273
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,120
I just finished screening the big data of entry and exit.

274
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,090
I have a major discovery to tell you.

275
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:26,620
Go ahead.

276
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,780
Before Miss Xinyan's accident,

277
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,730
the right-hand man of Zhuang Jiakai, Yang,

278
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,930
had a record of entry.

279
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,700
The city he went to

280
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,920
is far away from Miss Xinyan's arts university,

281
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,270
but once he entered the country,

282
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,270
the distance wouldn't be a problem.

283
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:39,810
Also,

284
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,440
Tang Lin sent someone to Dr. Tai

285
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,600
to take away Miss Xinyan's medical record.

286
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,240
Although Miss Tang returned the medical record,

287
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,930
at the same time, Yang also had an entry record.

288
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,150
So our guess is correct.

289
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,020
Yes.

290
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,800
The ones who went to arts university for Miss Xinyan

291
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,660
should be Zhuang Jiakai and Yang.

292
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,440
So they knew

293
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,630
the personal seal that

294
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,130
can influence the whole LH Star Group

295
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,330
was with Miss Xinyan.

296
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,740
So they planned to go to arts university to

297
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,640
take Miss Xinyan and the seal away.

298
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,100
But Manning's appearance

299
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,450
ruined everything.

300
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,000
Now all fingers

301
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,890
are pointing at Miss Manning.

302
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,790
This means

303
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,140
that personal seal

304
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,160
must be with Miss Manning.

305
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,660
Fang Xiang,

306
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,010
go to Rao Meina first.

307
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,190
Then tell Yuan Shuai,

308
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,910
besides Yang,

309
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,490
to keep an eye on Zhuang Jiakai as well.

310
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,110
This matter can not be so simple.

311
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,580
Okay.

312
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,350
Excuse me.

313
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,570
Where is the girl sitting here just now?

314
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,030
She was taken away by a man.

Just now, Uncle Guangyi came to me.

348
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,100
He said

349
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,310
grandpa wanted to see me.

350
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,770
So I went to see him.

351
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,280
Grandpa.

352
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,890
You didn't raise your head

353
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,980
or talk.

354
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,300
Do you really not want to see me anymore?

355
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,230
No.

356
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,310
President Zhuang.

357
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,090
It is not that I don't want to see you.

358
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:48,440
I just...

359
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,000
I don't know how to meet you.

360
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,680
Yes.

361
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,490
You and Xingcheng

362
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,570
tricked me

363
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,780
and Lin Guangyi so badly.

364
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,190
When I saw you,

365
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,370
I thought you were my granddaughter.

366
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,000
Then?

367
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,430
I'm sorry.

368
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,490
President Zhuang.

369
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,770
I was wrong.

370
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,550
I...

371
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,930
I shouldn't have pretended to be Xinyan and lied to you.

372
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,640
But...

373
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,190
Xingcheng and I did this

374
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,530
for a reason.

375
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,320
I...

376
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,540
I'm not looking for an excuse.

377
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,690
We did

378
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,510
do this.

379
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,880
We were wrong.

380
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,130
No, it was not our fault.

381
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,470
It was all my fault.

382
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,620
If you are mad,

383
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,780
just be mad at me.

384
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,330
If you want to punish us,

385
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,730
just punish me.

386
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,250
After such a big accident,

387
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,570
he just wants to stay out of it

388
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,500
and shift all blame to you?

389
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,040
No. President Zhuang.

390
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,530
Xingcheng didn't mean to shift the blame.

391
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,450
He is...

392
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,870
Well, he and I...

393
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:51,470
He...

394
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:53,590
I...

395
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:55,780
I...

396
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,380
You two are together, right?

397
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,120
I knew it long ago,

398
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,250
since he brought you home,

399
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,160
stayed by your side every day,

400
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,220
and didn't allow anyone to touch you.

401
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,040
If he didn't have this intention,

402
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,370
I would

403
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,350
have lived in vain for over 60 years.

404
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,760
Since you called me grandpa,

405
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,710
you can't take it back.

406
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,960
Whether it was because you used to think of yourself as Xinyan

407
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,530
or now you're with Xingcheng, the brat,

408
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,290
from now on,

409
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,180
I am your grandpa.

410
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,570
Do you agree?

411
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,410
You...

412
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,510
Are you not angry with me anymore?

413
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,580
You forgave us?

414
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,720
Silly girl.

415
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,730
Since you came back,

416
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,450
I've seen through

417
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,850
your little thoughts.

418
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,730
Although you're not Xinyan,

419
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,210
when I look at you,

420
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,420
I feel like

421
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,510
she is really back.

422
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,560
I've lived for so long.

423
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,210
I don't care about anything.

424
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,330
Xingcheng

425
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,670
has suffered a lot outside.

426
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,790
As long as he can come back,

427
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,680
the House of Zhuang will be saved.

428
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,850
It would be hard for you

429
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,450
to go forward with him.

430
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,820
It is not hard.

431
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,090
I like Xingcheng.

432
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,860
No matter what difficulties I face,

433
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,510
I will try my best

434
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,740
to keep him company.

435
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,060
Good girl.

436
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,020
Do you really think so?

437
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,890
Then stay with Xingcheng.

438
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,060
The door of the House of Zhuang

439
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,260
will always be open for you.

440
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,480
Grandpa.

441
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,260
[Yan Xingcheng]

442
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,890
That brat again?

443
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,800
I sent him a message.

444
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,140
He probably didn't see it,

445
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,990
so he kept calling me.

446
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,040
We were on a date today.

447
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,540
He is waiting for me.

448
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,070
No.

449
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,560
Tell him

450
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,300
you're having tea with grandpa.

451
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,190
Ask him to wait.

452
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,600
Maybe...

453
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,510
Alright.

454
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,210
Go ahead.

455
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,770
Don't make Xingcheng anxious.

456
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,080
When you two are together,

457
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,890
be good.

458
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,110
I'll wait for you two at the House of Zhuang.

459
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,980
I'm leaving.

460
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,740
Grandpa.

461
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,040
Go.

462
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,200
Grandpa.

463
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,280
Take care of yourself.

464
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,490
We'll visit you when we're free.

465
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:00,940
Go ahead.

466
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,930
But Xingcheng,

467
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,370
this time I saw him,

468
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,360
I think he didn't look well.

469
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,770
If you're free,

470
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,740
ask the doctor to treat him more.

471
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,270
Got it.

472
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,620
Well,

473
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,950
tell me what happened to you.

474
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,730
What happened to me?

475
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,110
You skipped work today

476
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,860
and even took me on a one-day date.

477
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,700
Did you really miss me?

478
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,080
Manning.

479
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,470
Mr. Yan,

480
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,930
I know you well.

481
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,200
I just went out for a while.

482
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,620
Why are you so nervous?

483
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,650
What happened?

484
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,790
Is it about the House of Zhuang

485
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,440
or LH Star?

486
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,710
No.

487
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,900
Is it about me?

488
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,090
Don't think too much.

489
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,500
I just want to spend a day

490
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
to accompany you.

491
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,730
Here we are.

492
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,070
Go back and rest.

493
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,210
Call me if anything happens.

494
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,410
Don't go out at night.

495
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,060
By the way,

496
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,230
my dad saw you sending me home last time.

497
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,590
After that,

498
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,250
he kept urging me to take you home for dinner.

499
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,770
We're already together.

500
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,560
I hope our relationship

501
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,910
can be blessed by my dad.

502
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:58,990
So,

503
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,000
come to my house for dinner this weekend, okay?

504
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,350
I'll prepare for it.

505
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,720
I'm leaving.

506
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,100
Manning.

507
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,040
I want to ask you something.

508
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:36,990
Back then...

509
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,300
That man...

510
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,940
He was the thief who came to my house last time.

511
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,400
He is holding my backpack.

512
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,970
Wait for me here.

513
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,770
Yan Xingcheng.

514
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:34,940
What's wrong?

515
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,800
What happened?

516
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,680
I'm going to go after Xingcheng.

517
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,600
Can you help me?

518
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,100
Get in.

519
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,720
Xingcheng.
