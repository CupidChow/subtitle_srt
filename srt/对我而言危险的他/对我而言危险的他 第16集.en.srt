Not only did I dare to marriage by capture,

125
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,170
Then I'll try again.

130
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,540
So you won't give up on me, right?

131
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,430
You will leave with me, right?

132
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,240
Of course...

133
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,590
Yes.

134

135
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:45,860
By the way,

136
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,880
I was

137
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,720
bit by someone.

138
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,540
It still hurts.

139
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,020
It has been a long time

140
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,620
for you to suffer.

141
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,120
No.

142
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,850
I came here voluntarily.

143
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,380
Have you forgotten?

144
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,640
I remember.

145
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,340
I remember every moment

146
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,750
with you.

147
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,890
But whether you are doing it for Xinyan

148
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,390
or for me,

149
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,310
I shouldn't have dragged you into

150
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,770
the House of Zhuang.

151
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,210
The House of Zhuang

152
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,610
and LH Star

153
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,850
are too dangerous.

154
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,660
Xingcheng.

155
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,630
I should have told you

156
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,420
my real identity.

157
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,620
But the situation of the House of Zhuang

158
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,140
is much more complicated than I thought.

159
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,260
When I was abroad,

160
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,960
I had a chance to call

161
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,410
the House of Zhuang and come back earlier.

162
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,020
But I don't know if I would have survived to this day

163
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,870
if I had called them.

164
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,640
Why?

165
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,140
Do you think the car accidents of you and Xinyan

166
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,390
were accidents?

167
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,090
Someone doesn't want her to come back alive

168
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,840
and they don't want me to come back alive.

169
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,110
The accident of you and Xinyan,

170
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,720
and the accident of my parents 17 years ago

171
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,060
were done by someone.

172
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,590
This...

173
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,400
I've been looking for the one

174
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,970
who killed my parents

175
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,240
and the one who kidnapped you

176
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:37,930
as Xinyan.

177
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,600
If we don't find him,

178
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,280
everything in the House of Zhuang will not end.

179
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,750
If I don't find him,

180
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,830
I will never get the truth

181
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,760
about my parents

182
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,410
and Xinyan.

183
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,980
XingCheng.

184
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,610
No matter what happens,

185
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,370
I will always be with you.

186
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,490
I support all your decisions.

187
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,230
I will do my best

188
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:19,960
to help you.

189
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,170
Manning.

190
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,680
I support you.

191
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,650
You must find the real murderer.

192
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:29,810
Find him.

193
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,570
Help me

194
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,300
and Xinyan fulfill the wish.

195
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,250
But you have to promise me one thing.

196
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,250
I'll promise you anything.

197
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,800
From now on,

198
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,860
no matter what happens to you,

199
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,150
don't hide it in your heart.

200
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,360
Don't always think about bearing it alone.

201
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,360
You have to tell me.

202
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,560
Let me bear it with you.

203
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,550
Got it?

204
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,890
Do you hear me?

205
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:17,820
I...

206
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,310
You just said

207
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,100
you would listen to me in everything.

208
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,230
So,

209
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,230
let's start with this.

210
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,710
Yan Xingcheng.

211
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,060
Do you love me?

212
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,910
Do you love me?

213
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
I want to listen to you.

214
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:49,770
Manning.

215
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,150
Yan Xingcheng.

216
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,800
Do you love me?

217
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,400
What do you think?

218
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,670
Why are you riding on me?

219
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,360
I have to stand high

220
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,270
to see far.

221
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,760
Then why did you light the fireworks?

222
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,870
Because it's romantic.

223
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,960
Why do you have so many questions?

224
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,240
Great.

225
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,070
They are finally together.

226
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,080
Does the pig I carry

227
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,320
also want a hug?

228
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,030
What did you say?

229
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,820
Who are you calling a pig?

230
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,570
I am.

231
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,830
If I'm not a pig,

232
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,950
I wouldn't have played around with you.

233
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,260
If I'm not a pig,

234
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,500
would I like you?

235
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,870
Louder.

236
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,500
I can't hear you.

237
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,170
I didn't say anything.

238
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,400
I said I couldn't hold on any longer.

239
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,560
Hang in there.

240
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,540
I haven't seen enough.

241
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,650
Don't move.

242
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,580
Hang in there.

243
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,870
Can you do it?

244
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,340
Meina!

245
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,170
Are you okay?

246
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,830
You made me fall down

247
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,950
in such a short time.

248
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,520
I'm strong, OK?

249
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,020
Look.

250
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,160
I have biceps.

251
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,060
So big.

252
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,640
So stupid.

253
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,070
You can watch it here.

254
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,320
Meina.

255
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,360
What are you doing?

256
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,220
Don't follow me.

257
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,860
Wait for me.

258
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,720
-Meina! -Don't follow me.

259
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,310
Handsome.

260
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,650
Get in.

261
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,500
Helmet.

262
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,500
Get off.

263
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,030
Me?

264
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,540
Fang Xiang.

265
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,619
Yuan Shuai.

266
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,750
Fang Xiang.

267
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,690
Go!

268
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,940
If you become the personal training partner of Yuan Shuai,

269
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,560
you'll win his love.

270
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,870
Are you sure?

271
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,460
Of course.

272
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,830
There are only three things

273
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,820
in Yuan Shuai's mind.

274
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,910
Eating, sleeping and training.

275
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,250
If you can be his training partner,

276
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,430
he'll definitely like you.

277
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,380
Three.

278
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,130
Two.

279
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,830
One.

280
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,440
Go.

281
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,820
I dare not.

282
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,920
One more time.

283
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,350
Three.

284
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,410
Two.

285
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,120
One.

286
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,010
Go.

287
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,760
Yuan Shuai.

288
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:57,840
Yes!

289
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,340
We can finally...

290
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,180
Done.

291
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,270
So it was me.

292
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,250
You're smiling so happily.

293
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,390
What happened?

294
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,620
Nothing good happened.

295
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,490
But there are two interesting people.

296
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,890
Yuan Shuai or Fang Xiang?

297
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,200
Tell me honestly.

298
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,290
Which one do you like?

299
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:07,950
Me?

300
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,700
Neither.

301
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,700
Do you think I believe you?

302
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,330
You... Believe it or not.

303
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,380
Anyway,

304
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,070
I don't think about love.

305
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,260
I just want to finish my comics.

306
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,240
So stingy.

307
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:07,880
Brother.

308
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,170
Go back to your room and sleep.

309
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,100
I'm not going.

310
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,300
Enough!

311
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,610
You've done enough these days.

312
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,850
You've done what you should.

313
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,790
What else do you want?

314
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,020
Even you yelled at me?

315
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,480
It's fine if others laugh at me.

316
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,380
But we're siblings.

317
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,440
Why are you mocking me too?

318
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,750
I'm not.

319
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,780
Tang Lin,

320
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,420
I've treasured you since you were young.

321
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,210
I sent you abroad

322
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,270
not to see

323
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,370
what you are now.

324
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,530
You like Yan Xingcheng.

325
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,220
You wanted to get engaged to him.

326
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,440
I listened to you.

327
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,830
But now he's with someone else,

328
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,190
and you still miss him.

329
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,390
Who do you think you are?

330
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,570
Did I teach you that?

331
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,530
How could I teach a sister like you?

332
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,630
So do you think I'm a disgrace to you too?

333
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,050
Right?

334
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,250
I like him.

335
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,060
I got engaged to him.

336
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,650
I was dumped by him.

337
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,930
These embarrassed you,

338
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,700
right?

339
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,520
I don't deserve to be your sister.

340
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,720
I'll leave.

341
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,740
I'll leave, okay?

342
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:37,660
Tang Lin.

343
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:38,620
Tang Lin!

344
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,010
Tang Lin, stop!

345
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,330
I was dumped.

346
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,790
It is my fault.

347
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,540
I got engaged to Yan Xingcheng.

348
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,740
It is my fault too.

349
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,850
Bringing shame on Luminous

350
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,720
is also my fault.

351
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,340
Just laugh at me.

352
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,300
That's who I am.

353
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,620
I was...

354
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,590
I was a mistake.

355
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:25,750
Tang Lin.

356
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:26,680
Are you okay?

357
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,780
None of your business.

358
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,120
You came to laugh at me

359
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
like they did,

360
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,470
right?

361
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,770
You see me getting dumped.

362
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,750
You see

363
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,970
my groom was snatched away at the engagement party.

364
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,380
Don't you think it's funny?

365
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:24,920
Tang Lin.

366
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,320
Don't do this.

367
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,330
You want me to stop?

368
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,170
What do you want me to do?

369
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,960
You want me to announce to the world that

370
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,380
I'm fine?

371
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,660
Although my groom was snatched away,

372
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,270
I was very happy.

373
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,320
Right?

374
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:56,800
Go away.

375
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,470
I'm very happy now.

376
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,280
I'm very happy.

377
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,600
I'm the happiest person in the world.

378
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,910
Okay?

379
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,530
Tang Lin.

380
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,870
No one is mocking you.

381
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,760
You underestimated yourself.

382
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,260
Lin Mufan.

383
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,370
Let me ask you.

384
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,700
I like him.

385
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,130
Am I wrong?

386
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,000
Is it wrong for me to like someone?

387
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,860
I know.

388
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,290
I know he is

389
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,370
a strong and intangible man.

390
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,040
I know I'm not qualified

391
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,150
to stand beside him.

392
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,230
But I don't care.

393
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,930
I don't care what others think of me.

394
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,700
I don't care how my brother opposes me.

395
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,030
I don't even care

396
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,520
whether he likes me or not.

397
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,550
I just like him.

398
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,140
I like him.

399
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,960
What did I do wrong?

400
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,470
Tell me.

401
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,130
What did I do wrong?

402
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,790
Tell me.

403
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,710
I like him.

404
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,820
I like him.

405
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:57,440
I like him. I like him.

406
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,090
It's hot.

407
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,780
You'll feel better after drinking it.

408
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,380
Thank you.

409
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,880
Actually, I haven't been to the beach at night

410
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,450
for many years.

411
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,830
I should thank you today.

412
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,380
Tang Lin.

413
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,950
Others have gone far.

414
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,470
Are you sure

415
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,080
you want to stay where you are?

416
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,660
What do you want to say?

417
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,240
I always think

418
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,150
you now are

419
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,830
not Tang Lin.

420
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,950
When I first met you,

421
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,020
you were vigorous, effective

422
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,970
and proud.

423
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,950
The CEO of Celine Fashion Studio, Tang Lin.

424
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,780
I'll take care of your jewelry design

425
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,490
for the next year.

426
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,620
When you told me

427
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,090
you would buy my whole year of design,

428
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,010
I really wanted to say yes.

429
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:51,970
Really?

430
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,510
Because my salary in LH Star

431
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,260
is far from the salary you gave.

432
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,050
If I hadn't promised my dad

433
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,340
to stay in LH Star,

434
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,690
I would definitely go with you.

435
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:12,560
Boss,

436
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,430
is it late to change my mind?

437
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,450
It's too late.

438
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:25,950
I won't accept it.

439
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,020
You look better when you smile.

440
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,800
You kept saying

441
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,860
you knew Yan Xingcheng well.

442
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,060
But I think

443
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,820
I know what kind of person you are.

444
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,970
You like Yan Xingcheng.

445
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,680
You can try your best to pursue him.

446
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,850
But at the same time, you have a bottom line

447
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,430
and conscience.

448
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,950
Even if you have Manning's trump card,

449
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,220
you don't want to make it public.

450
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,220
You're just forcing them

451
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,220
to bow to you.

452
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,080
However,

453
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,450
love never follows the heart.

454
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,300
There are many things in life

455
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,450
that are not as good as they should be.

456
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,560
Loving someone without a happy ending

457
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,090
is just one of them.

458
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,680
Love

459
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,820
is always random.

460
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,350
Can love

461
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,240
only be random?

462
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:44,670
Mom,

463
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,620
the House of Zhuang is in a mess now.

464
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,890
Can you stop going to

465
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:48,880
the damn public welfare meeting?

466
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,650
Jiakai.

467
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,170
Watch your mouth.

468
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,790
I have controlled myself.

469
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,350
The House of Zhuang is like this.

470
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,840
Can you really ignore it?

471
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,670
Or, in your heart,

472
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,810
is the House of Zhuang unimportant?

473
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,890
Is LH Star unimportant?

474
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,270
Am I unimportant?

475
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,910
Even if the group

476
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,640
was managed by Auntie Zhuang Meixuan's family,

477
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,970
we do not have the credit but the hard work.

478
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,090
Then why?

479
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,150
Why can only the children of Auntie Zhuang Meixuan

480
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:15,940
inherit the family?

481
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,470
Why did grandpa insist on

482
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,180
giving the House of Zhuang to them?

483
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,580
Forget about the fake Zhuang Xinyan case.

484
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,920
Now Yan Yi is back.

485
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,180
Should we leave everything to them?

486
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:23,880
JiaKai.

487
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,690
Just because I don't have a father?

488
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,040
Just because

489
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,640
I don't know who my father is?

490
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,390
Sure.

491
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,420
From now on,

492
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,910
you don't have me as your son.

493
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,180
I don't have you as my mother.

494
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,090
Boss,

495
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,020
should I get rid of him?

496
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,480
Do you think

497
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,310
it is easy to deal with him?

498
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,909
But it's too arrogant

499
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,670
for him to do these to the Group.

500
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,070
I shouldn't make him feel comfortable.

501
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:53,699
[LH Star]

502
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,170
Manning.

503
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,640
Why are you here?

504
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,840
I came to pick you up from work.

505
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,550
But I don't want your colleagues to see it.

506
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,200
I really can't play with you anymore.

507
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,010
You hit me too hard.

508
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:07,610
Are you okay?

509
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,400
I didn't mean it.

510
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,590
It's okay.

511
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,450
I know when you slept...

512
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,870
But Mr. Yan,

513
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,500
do you want to elope with me?

514
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:25,470
Elope?

515
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,150
Let's go.

516
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,290
Come on.

517
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,340
Do you have a driving license?

518
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,410
What?

519
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,240
Are you scared?

520
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,640
I'm afraid if you don't drive well,

521
