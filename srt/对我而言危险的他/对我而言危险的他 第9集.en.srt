LH Star has released a great news.

00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,180
The new CEO Zhuang Xinyan who just came back from abroad

announced to be engaged to her fiance, Mr. Yan Xingcheng.

Shen.

14
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,640
It's me.

15
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,030
I brought you some fresh steamed vegetables buns.

What are you doing?

19
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,180
What should we do?

20
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,540
That person is...

21
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,610
She is my...

22

Don't look over there.

It's okay.

I'm here.

25
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,440
Sorry.

26

I'm in a hurry.

What should I do?

-She is my best friend since childhood.-Calm down.

30
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,360
You need to know where you are.

31
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,810
You should also know

32
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,410
what you are talking about.

33
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,079
It is not our first day back.

34
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,280
It is also not the first time we've encountered such trouble.

35
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,810
Fang Xiang and Yuan Shuai went to deal with it.

36
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,350
Trust me.

37
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,130
Go get changed.

38
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,870
I'll wait for you outside.

Go.

Put me down!

Yuan Shuai,

43
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,740
Put me down.

00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,900
Why won't you let me attend the wedding?

47
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,350
I saw them just now.

48

What are you doing?

52
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,510
You saw it wrong.

53
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,909
The ones standing on the stage

54
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:59,570
are the CEO of LH Star and the new vice president.

55
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,390
Their engagement

56
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,090
has nothing to do with you.

57

What do you mean?

58
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,870
No.

59
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:19,950
No.

60
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,120
You just don't want me to attend the wedding, right?

61
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,780
Fang Xiang,

62
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,340
do you know something?

63
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,260
Tell me.

64

Yuan Shuai.

65
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,360
You would not tell me, right?

66
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,390
Fine.

67
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,150
I'll go see her.

68
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,680
I'll ask her by myself.

I don't want to see you anymore.

Yuan Shuai.

72
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,470
At least she won't say anything.

73
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,250
What an enviable engagement ceremony.

74

Should I feel honored?

82

Knowing yourself and the enemy

84
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,159
I thought after the copyright incident,

85
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,820
LH Star and Luminous Group will have a new situation.

86

What kind of situation do you want?

87
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,120
Collaboration.

88
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:44,970
Or

89
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,150
something more intimate.

90
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,540
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,920
I'm not interested in any intimate relationship.

You seem to tell me that there is

93
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,810
a special meaning behind this engagement ceremony.

94
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,130

Just Okay?

Well, I...

114

Should we at least figure something out?

115
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,180
Should we check

116
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,510
why she was there today?

117
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,410

And then?

121
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,680
Tell her everything

122
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,100
and try to explain to her?

123
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,970
You are in a difficult position,

124
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,590
any rash action

125
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,640
would cause a

turmoil for House of Zhuang and the Group.

127

I've reminded you again and again,

128
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,910
don't try anything you can't do.

to deal with her.

is to be Ms. Zhuang Xinyan.

145
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,520
that person is not her best friend?

146
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,600
She won't ask around in the company, will she?

147

Will she get fired?

Why do you care so much?

What do you mean?

151
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,580
She's just a little girl,

Why are you so heartless?

154

I have never cared about anyone.

nor reply to my WeChat.

178
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,120
Are you

179
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,340
that person today,

180
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,530
Manman?

181
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,160
Impossible.

182
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,680
There should not be two people in the world who resemble each other this much.

183
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,880
You must be mistaken.

184
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,520
Hello,

185
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,030
please add more.

186
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,360
Why are you here?

187
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,430
What is it?

188
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,150
You don't welcome me?

189
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,010
On such a wonderful night,

190
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,370
isn't it a waste

191
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,290
to drink here alone?

192
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,490
Wonderful?

193
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,530
Don't get me wrong.

194
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,020
I rejected you before,

195
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,240
so it is impossible for me to continue with you.

196
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,590
I just thought that on

197
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,330
such an interesting night

198
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,270
with ups and downs,

199
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,270
it is such a waste.

200
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,090
What do you want to say, Miss Tang?

201
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,850
Just say it.

202
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,500
I like you being so straightforward.

203
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,540
I want Yan Xingcheng.

204
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,770
Do you know what you are talking about?

205
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,030
Yan Xingcheng just...

206
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,070
Vice President Yan and our CEO

207
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,330
just had the engagement ceremony today.

208
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,260
So what?

209
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,230
I'm not rich enough,

210
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,090
not educated enough,

211
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,110
or not good-looking enough?

212
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,240
I don't deserve him?

213
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,960
Love is not only compared with conditions.

214
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,190
You surely know

215
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,360
about love.

216
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,140
Then tell me

217
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,900
what men and women do without conditions?

218
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,930
They can't always be deeply in love, can they?

219
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,420
You and I perceive things

220
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,000
much differently in life.

221
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,440
Sorry.

222
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,450
I can't chat with you anymore.

223
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,250
Let me ask you.

224
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Yan Xingcheng

225
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,630
can't fall in love at first sight

226
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,110
with a lady from a noble family like me.

227
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,670
How do you believe that

228
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,110
he can fall in love with

229
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,740
the fake lady?

230
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,290
What are you talking about?

231
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,720
President Zhuang sent you abroad

232
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,150
to pick Zhuang Xinyan up,

233
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,230
but you stayed there for two weeks

234
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,500
and returned empty-handed.

235
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,590
Now, the noble Ms. Zhuang Xinyan

236
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,480
of House of Zhuang

237
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,670
brought Yan Xingcheng to the house.

238
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,130
Do you really believe

239
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,980
Zhuang Xinyan is the real Zhuang Xinyan?

240
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,430
Yan Xingcheng is the real Yan Xingcheng?

241
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,490
Help me to investigate on

242
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,920
the newly engaged CEO

243
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,730
and everyone around her.

244
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,730
Ms. Zhuang and Mr. Yan,

245
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,790
Miss Tang came to the company early in the morning.

246
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,510
She said she has a very important business collaboration

247
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,440
to meet and talk with you in person.

248
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,170
I tried to stop her,

249
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,140
but...

250
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,650
Okay.

251
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,060
Go back to work.

252
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,110
Miss Tang.

253
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,790
Collaboration?

254
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,530
Luminous Group and LH Star?

255
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,290
It's my Celine Fashion Studio.

256
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,310
I want to buy all the new products

257
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,330
of LH Star's Secondary Design Studio for a whole year.

258
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,050
Ms. Zhuang,

259
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,130
name your price.

260
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,030
Do you know how much it costs

261
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,090
to buy a studio's

262
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,990
designs of whole year?

263
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,440
Of course.

264
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,690
Just give me the price.

265
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,270
I'll pay ten times.

266
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,670
Ten times?

267
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,680
Are you kidding, Ms. Tang?

268
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,700
As long as Vice President Yan asks,

269
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,050
I would give whatever amount you asked.

270
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,530
What is it?

271
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,110
Mr. Lin,

272
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,770
these are the documents you asked me to send to the Production Department yesterday.

273
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,230
I have checked with the responsible people.

274
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,230
Okay.

275
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,670
Wait.

276
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,450
Did you go to the office of CEO to prepare the case?

277
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:32,770
Sorry.

278
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,650
I forgot.

279
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,240
It's okay.

280
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,640
I'll contact Qiao.

281
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,310
No, no, no.

282
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,410
It's my fault. I'll send it.

283
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,020
Twin Roses?

284
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,760
You know this painting too?

285
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,260
When I studied

286
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,120
at arts university,

287
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,180
this is a very famous teacher's work.

288
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,280
My best friend even copied this work

289
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,330
as her graduation project.

290
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,690
Arts university?

291
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,790
Your best friend?

292
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,500
So,

293
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,500
you also want to copy Twin Roses?

294
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,890
You know this painting?

295
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,150
When I studied abroad,

296
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,890
I knew this painting

297
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,620
was a work of a famous professor when he was young.

298
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,300
[I'm in the office of CEO. Bring Rao Meina from your department to watch the show.]

299
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,490
Ms. Zhuang,

300
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,750
sign it.

301
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:41,820
Miss Tang,

302
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,870
this collaboration agreement you proposed

303
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,200
is against the business trade principle.

304
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,290
We need time to think carefully about

305
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,140
this collaboration agreement which worths multiple times more than a premium

306
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,600
before making a decision.

307
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,770
It is impossible for a real businessman

308
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,390
to reject such a collaboration proposal

309
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,790
at a premium of this much.

310
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,470
Ms. Zhuang,

311
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,590
are you not interested in business?

312
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,160
Then I want to ask you,

313
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,230
how will you explain to the shareholders on the financial report?

314
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,670
It has nothing to do with the financial report.

315
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,310
What does it have to do with then?

316
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,460
It's about the fact.

317
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,150
Well said.

318
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,300
Whether it's business or life,

319
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,470
I like to deal things with sincere people

320
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,040
like Ms. Zhuang.

321
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,250
I have known the Director of  Secondary Design Studio,

322
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,600
Lin Mufan,

323
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,990
for a really long time.

324
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,140
I really like his designs.

325
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,580
And

326
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,600
I'm very interested

327
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,720
to cooperate with him.

328
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,080
So no matter you agree or not,

329
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,570
I hope you can call him here and

330
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,330
three of us will meet directly.

331
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,390
Three of us?

332
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,960
Shen Manning.

333
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,060
Manman.

334
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,030
Is that you, Manman?

335
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,090
Didn't you say you went abroad to study?

336
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,070
Why are you here?

337
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,990
And why are you dressed like this?

338
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,270
That day...

339
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,370
that day in the auditorium,

340
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,370
it was you, right?

341
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,070
You got the wrong person.

342
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,510
We grew up together.

343
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,420
I know what you look like,

344
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,580
how you speak,

345
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,110
and I even know your voice.

346
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,270
How could I be wrong?

347
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:24,910
Manman,

348
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,890
look at me.

This is your biggest boss,

the only CEO of LH Star.

Who is she?

00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,610
Her surname is Zhuang.

357
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,260
Zhuang Xinyan.

358

No.

My name is Zhuang Xinyan.

360
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,270
You got the wrong person.

It's me.

Mr. Lin,

364
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,250
if she's an employee of your studio,

365
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,650
please keep an eye on her.

366
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,430
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhuang.

367
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,230
It's my fault.

368
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,910
I'll take her away immediately.

369
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,550
Impossible.

370
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,390
It's me, Manman.

People of LH Star

376
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,190
all surely have stories.

377
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,780
But I'm not interested in

378
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,640
your stories.

Mr. Lin.

381
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,520
You don't have any objection

382
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,660
against my proposal at a premium of ten times,

383
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,100
do you?

384
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,590
Ms. Zhuang, sign it.

385
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:27,960
What is it?

386
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,560
Do you even want to close the door and discuss with Vice President Yan

387
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,400
for half a month

388
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,760
for this kind of collaboration proposal?

389
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,100
As CEO of LH Star,

390
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,200
this is so weak of you.

391
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,270

Since we've agreed to collaborate,

394
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,200
Ms. Zhuang,

395
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,610
take me to your storage warehouse.

396
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,400
I heard

397
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,530
only the CEO

398
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,210
can open the jewelry storage warehouse.

399
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:51,650
Boss.

400
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,140
It's a bit troublesome.

401
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,660
The jewelry storage warehouse is encrypted by multiple layers.

402
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,190
Although I can solve the problem,

403
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,180
but I have to cut in through the program bug.

404
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,090
it's like

405
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,190
blow up our own central control system.

406
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,120
Not only will it take a lot of time,

407
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,290
but there will also be big trouble.

408

[Storage Warehouse]

409
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,240
Ms. Zhuang,

410
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,110
you have three chances in 90 seconds

411
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,470
to enter the correct password

412
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,670
and identification,

413
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,040
so that you can open the encrypted door.

414
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:43,980
90 seconds?

415
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:44,790
Yes.

416
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,040
If it exceeds,

417
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,910
the encrypted door will automatically lock.

418
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,040
Without reporting to the police,

419
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,240
you can never open it.

420
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,170
What's wrong, Ms. Zhuang?

421
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,120
Aren't you going to open the door

422
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,230
and show us

423
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,720
the powerful production storage of LH Star?

424
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,150
Please enter the high level encrypted password.

425
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,100
You are only allowed to enter three times wrong.
