Linlin.

Don't talk to me.

65
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,900
Let me calm down.

66
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,070
What's wrong?

67
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,260
Brother.

68
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,590
I bumped into Shen Manning just now.

69
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,420
Shen Manning?

70
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,409
I've solved the problem

71
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,550
between us.

72
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,680
I won't do anything to her.

73
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,570
But just now,

74
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,370
I took her to chase Yan Xingcheng’s car.

75
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,110
It seemed he was chasing

76
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,000
a weird person.

77
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,260
He followed that guy to the junkyard.

78
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,430
Yan Xingcheng almost died.

79
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:12,760
Really?

80
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,770
Brother.

81
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,890
Is there still internal fight within the House of Zhuang?

82
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,960
Why did that person show up

83
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,010
in front of Shen Manning's house?

84
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,270
Why did Yan Xingcheng

85
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,310
chase his car?

86
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,200
Brother.

87
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,460
If something goes wrong with LH Star,

88
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,540
will the collaboration

89
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,680
between them and Luminous Group be affected?

90
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,550
You don't have to

91
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,500
worry about anything.

92
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,820
I will figure it out.

93
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,300
But I recently...

94
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,190
Listen to me.

95
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,610
Don't get involved in the thing between the House of Zhuang and LH Star Group anymore.

96
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,850
I'll take care of it.

97
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,030
How is it?

98
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,520
Does your wound still hurt?

99
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,180
Did any water get in?

100
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,770
I'm fine.

101
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,020
You have no idea

102
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,130
how scared I was

103
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,170
when that thing fell off.

104
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,970
I hated myself

105
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,510
for not running faster

106
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,120
and catching up.

107
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,030
Don't be silly.

The person who suddenly appeared today.

139
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,630
And…

140
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,450
I didn't want to tell you.

141
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:17,980
Xingcheng.

142
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,550
I don't want you to get involved

143
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,350
in the fight between the House of Zhuang and LH Star.

144
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,100
I want to do my best to protect you

so that you can live and love

146
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,790
like a normal girl.

147
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,750
Xingcheng.

148
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:52,640
Okay.

149
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,220
Let me tell you.

150
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,480
So this brooch is what they are looking for.

151
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,270
They think I have it with me?

152
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,720
Don't worry.

153
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,970
I will protect you.

154
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,050
I'm not afraid.

155
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,240
It's just that...

156
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,010
Do I have this brooch?

157
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,430
Xingcheng.

158
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,850
I remember now.

159
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,790
When I had an accident abroad,

160
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,050
at that time,

161
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,630
Xinyan put something in my pocket.

162
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,460
But when I woke up

163
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,430
in the hospital,

164
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,170
the arrival of you, Fang Xiang and Yuan Shuai

165
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,470
messed with my original plan.

166
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,860
Then I went back to your house with you,

167
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,710
so I forgot about it.

168
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,340
But I found it

169
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,100
in one of our arguments.

170
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,110
It's a rose-like brooch.

171
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,460
The brooch is a birthday gift to mom and auntie

172
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,560
from grandpa.

173
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,110
It stands for

174
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,580
the twin sisters of the House of Zhuang.

175
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,680
In my memory,

176
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,160
my mother used to wear it.

177
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,050
Then that's it.

178
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,480
No wonder when Xinyan left,

179
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,470
she asked me to do the thing for her.

180
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,610
So she wanted me to give you this brooch

181
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,330
so that you can get back your LH Star on behalf of her.

182
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,640
Xingcheng.

183
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,310
This brooch is still in my house.

184
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,410
This morning,

185
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,720
I accidentally knocked it over.

186
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,270
It fell under my bed.

187
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:49,890
Are you sure?

188
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,320
I'll put it away when I get back.

189
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,510
Come over and get it yourself

190
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,270
tomorrow morning.

191
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:56,730
Okay.

192
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,010
Alright, stop crying.

193
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,470
You've been crying for so long.

194
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,760
If you keep crying,

195
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,960
how would others think of me?

196
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,180
I just feel bad.

197
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,090
Can't I even cry?

198
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,020
I want to cry.

199
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,280
Fine.

200
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,080
Cry.

201
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,560
Cry as long as you want.

202
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm all ears.

203
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,170
I'll take it if you want to let steam off,

204
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,400
but he who tied the bell to the tiger must take it off.

205
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,120
I’ll go to Yuan Shuai.

206
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,580
No.

207
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,230
No.

208
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,410
No, I beg you.

209
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,520
Do you want to hear the story of Yuan Shuai?

210
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,820
Hey Bruce Lee, don't you have any euros?

211
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,540
Where's your wallet?

212
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,070
Come on.

213
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,550
Where is it?

214
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,400
Thank you.

215
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,130
Are you also Chinese?

216
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,440
Thank you.

217
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,030
Thank you.

218
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,380
What are you doing?

219
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,330
I thought you came to help me.

220
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,790
You're just like them.

221
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,160
Bastard!

222
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,310
Don't touch the Chinese!

223
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,760
None of your business.

224
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,390
What do you think?

225
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,050
So

226
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,830
you are the heroine of this story?

227
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,510
Heroine?

228
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,030
Later...

229
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:36,480
Say uncle.

230
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,390
No.

231
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,840
Look at that man. What are you doing?

232
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,630
Why are you sitting on the street?

233
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,110
Look at this cute mini cake.

234
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,590
It's amazing.

235
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,400
You broke his heart.

236
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,810
He is standing up.

237
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,150
Guys. Hey, come on. Over here. Guys.

238
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,000
Bruce Lee here pushed me.

239
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,540
He's gonna teach me a lesson, huh?

240
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,230
He wants to show us his kung fu.

241
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,300
Come on. Do you want to get beaten up?

242
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,360
You can't move?

243
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,810
Look me. Show us some kung fu.

244
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,280
Come on.

245
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,410
So,

246
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,860
you voluntarily worked for Yan Xingcheng

247
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,540
but Yuan Shuai was captured?

248
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,000
Not really.

249
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,300
Do you know the wolf king and wolf head?

250
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,300
Yes.

251
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,020
The wolf king is the king of wolves,

252
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,620
while the other is a General who fights in a battle.

253
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:49,950
Correct.

254
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,040
As for love,

255
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,550
once the wolf king falls in love,

256
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,590
he will love only one person in his life.

257
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,060
For a wolf head who fights in a battle,

258
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,110
he only knows how to fight.

259
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,210
So,

260
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,390
he's not into a relationship at all.

261
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,990
For the first draft of this cycle

262
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,760
and the production plan for the next cycle,

263
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,880
there are many raw materials in the studio,

264
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,720
but there's still la ack of pure materials.

265
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,280
I'm afraid you need to stock up on some of them.

266
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,840
No problem.

267
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,070
As long as it’s your design,

268
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,680
no matter how high-quality material it is,

269
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,730
I dare to do it.

270
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,950
Thank you, boss.

271
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,950
Apart from work,

272
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,590
let's talk about something else.

273
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,280
Is there anything wrong

274
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,440
with the LH Star?

275
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,330
Did anything happen to

276
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,410
Yan Xingcheng?

277
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,380
Tang Lin.

278
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,990
This has nothing to do with me.

279
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,510
It's not me.

280
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,410
It's just

281
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,120
I met Shen Manning…

282
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,940
Don't you think it's weird?

283
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,460
Do you think the House of Zhuang

284
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,560
are hiding some secrets?

285
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,200
Boss.

286
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,180
According to the investigation,

287
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,190
we can trace the car.

288
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,740
Although Yuan Shuai

289
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,500
lost the car,

290
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,630
but we've figured out the source of it.

291
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,850
This car was rented.

292
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,500
The rental company

293
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,030
has been established for 20 years.

294
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,390
As I expected,

295
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,600
their license used to rent the car

296
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,100
were all fake.

297
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,570
They threw the car near the canal in the suburbs.

298
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,830
In other words,

299
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,380
they had planned to run away without the car

300
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,390
after getting the thing away from Shen Manning's home,

301
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,340
but

302
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,170
you saw them

303
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,330
and followed them.

304
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:12,900
Wait.

305
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,840
You said

306
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,330
this company has been established for 20 years?

307
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,270
This company

308
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,430
is famous in the transportation industry.

309
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,090
It has a wide range of business.

310
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:24,920
Many years ago,

311
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,910
the owner went abroad with the construction team

312
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,590
and provided transportation service there.

313
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,400
How long has it been there?

314
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,010
When did he go abroad for construction?

315
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,200
Have you searched the information?

316
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,880
No, I haven't.

317
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,210
Let me check it in the system.

318
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,770
I asked you to look into

319
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,600
the capital flows related to the House of Zhuang

320
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,220
before my parent's accident.

321
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,470
Did you find anything?

322
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,140
I've checked.

323
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,570
When the accident happened,

324
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,670
there was no large fund flows in the House of Zhuang's account

325
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,080
from China to abroad.

326
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,470
There's no record of border crossing for the employees of the company.

327
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,420
But after I expanded

328
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,120
the range of the data earch,

329
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,010
I found a strange clue

330
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,350
that looked ordinary.

331
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,440
The capital flow

332
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,680
is not too big.

333
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,110
The payers and receivers

334
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,170
are all ordinary people.

335
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,880
They have nothing to do

336
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
with the Zhuangs or LH Star.

337
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,830
They have even

338
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,210
never been to LH Star.

339
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,270
The receiver,

340
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,510
Jiang Min,

341
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,570
is a middle-aged woman.

342
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,110
After this middle-aged woman

343
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,930
established this account abroad,

344
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,300
this was the only cash flow.

345
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,280
No other cash flow.

346
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,850
What's weirder is,

347
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,230
in the past 17 years,

348
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,290
no one

349
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,820
has ever touched this money.

350
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,870
It has been sitting there for 17 years.

351
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,550
I found it strange too.

352
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,220
So,

353
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,240
I investigated

354
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,650
this middle-aged woman.

355
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,980
She passed away

356
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,300
17 years ago.

357
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,020
The money

358
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,270
has no owner now.

359
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,710
When she died 17 years ago,

360
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,350
her family didn't even claim the money.

361
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,860
The money without an owner for 17 years.

362
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,420
Does this have anything to do

363
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,310
with our investigation?

364
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,510
I looked into this account.

365
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,410
A middle-aged man logged into this account,

366
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,160
but he didn't take a penny.

367
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,560
Since then,

368
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,480
no one has touched this account for 17 years.

369
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,190
What are you doing?

370
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:47,930
Dad.

371
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,690
Nothing, I'm looking for something.

372
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,950
I remember I was here this morning.

373
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,710
I left it here.

374
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,620
Why can't I find it?

375
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,700
You're a girl.

376
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,950
Why are you so careless?

377
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,840
What are you looking for?

378
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,730
Let me help you.

379
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,710
It's okay, dad.

380
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,460
I'm just looking for a brooch.

381
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,640
A rose-style brooch.

382
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,040
A brooch?

383
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,140
Dad.

384
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,270
I'm fine.

385
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,560
Go back and rest.

386
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,480
I'll keep looking.

387
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,310
It must be here.

388
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,550
I will find it.

389
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,480
Where is it?

390
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,350
Manning.

391
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,540
Is this it?

392
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,320
Yes.

393
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,240
Dad, that's it.

394
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,710
-Thank goodness you helped me put it away. -Manning.

395
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,870
Keep an eye on your thing.

396
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,150
No one will always

397
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,330
clean up for you.

398
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:52,990
Hello, Xingcheng.

399
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,180
You haven't slept?

400
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:55,960
Not yet.

401
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,460
What are you doing so late at night?

402
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,120
Nothing.

403
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,280
I just want to tell you

404
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,770
I have your brooch.

405
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,540
It's safe now. Don't worry.

406
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:06,760
Really?

407
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,710
I'll take care of it

408
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,880
tonight.

409
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,230
I'll lock the door

410
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,140
and all the windows later.

411
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,340
My dad is at home today.

412
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,700
We'll ensure its safety.

413
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:16,620
Okay.

414
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,450
Yuan Shuai has also sent someone

415
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,480
to your neighbourhood.

416
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,350
Rest assured.

417
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,350
What about you?

418
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,540
I...

419
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,150
Why are you still up at this hour?

420
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,730
Don't forget.

421
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,070
You promised me to come to my home tomorrow.

422
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,590
I hope my dad can see

423
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,750
a cool and handsome you.

424
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,430
Don't make yourself too tired.

425
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,350
I'll be there on time.

426
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,370
Xingcheng.

427
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,380
I hope tomorrow

428
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,720
my dad will like you

429
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,000
as soon as he meets you.

430
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,620
I hope he will support us

431
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,430
to be together.

432
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,090
Then we can be together forever.

433
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,120
Okay?

434
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,190
Leave everything to me.

435
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:04,600
Everything will go well.

436
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,150
I’ll wait for you.

437
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,610
Mr. Yan, you are here.

438
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,390
Why are you in such a hurry?

439
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,390
I was waiting for you.

440
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:14,620
Waiting for me?

441
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,480
Were you afraid I wouldn't come?

442
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,160
I was afraid that some people would suddenly become coward

443
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,960
and run away.

444
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:24,730
But

445
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,510
Mr. Yan

446
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,650
you can’t run away

447
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,350
without me.

448
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,170
Is the man you chose

449
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,350
so useless?

450
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,070
Let's go.

451
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:39,740
Wait.

452
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,550
I've brought a gift.

453
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,530
Mr. Yan, you know manners.

454
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,630
But you have to wait.

455
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,400
Follow me.

456
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,420
What are you doing?

457
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,350
I broke your tie last time.

458
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,060
So this time,

459
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:13,820
I bought you a new one.

460
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,390
I picked it for you.

461
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,820
I think the color and the style suit you well.

462
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,610
The clerk also said…

463
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,880
What did she say?

464
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,400
She said

465
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,240
if a girlfriend

466
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,270
ties a tie for her boyfriend,

467
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,720
he will be loyal to her

468
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,800
forever.

469
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,420
Why do you always believe in such thing?

470
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,630
Andromeda.

471
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:46,720
Tie.

472
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,260
Because I love you.

473
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,130
I remember it should be tied this way.

474
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,500
I learned it from the video.

475
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,760
Why doesn't it work?

476
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:33,840
Let me teach you.

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,000
Don't work so hard.

505
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,180
In order to treat me,

506
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,960
you get up early and work late.

507
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,500
It's just transportation.

508
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,560
It's not a big deal.

509
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,060
Besides, the overseas salary is high.

510
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,120
I can work more when I'm still young

511
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,770
and earn back all the medical expenses for you.

512
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,850
We can go home together then

513
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,590
and raise our daughter well.

514
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,360
Take out the brooch.

515
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,460
Otherwise, what happened 17 years ago...

516
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:45,880
Who is it?

517
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,200
Dad.

518
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,380
We're here.

519
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,270
This is

520
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,990
Yan Xingcheng

521
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,110
I talked about to you before.

522
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,780
The president of Lan Hai

523
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,670
who took Maning to his house

524
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,790
and let her pretend to be another girl.

525
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:19,670
Dad.

526
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,810
Why are you bringing this up again?

527
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,640
Manning.

528
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,580
He kept you at his house for so long.

529
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,270
Now he came here today.

530
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,880
As a father, can't I ask about it?

531
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,470
Uncle,

532
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,760
I'm sorry

533
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,380
for that.

534
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,270
I made Manning take the risk

535
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,220
for me and my family,

536
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,500
but I promise

537
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,950
this will never happen again.

538
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,820
I hope you can keep your promise.

539
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,040
Uncle.

540
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,010
I have another name.

541
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,080
Yan Yi.

542
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,090
Dad.

543
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,310
What's wrong?

544
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,490
Manning.

545
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,020
Go make some tea.

546
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,360
I want to talk to him alone.

547
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,760
Aren't you going to ask about more?

548
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,180
My age,

549
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,380
identity,

550
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,340
family background.

551
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,450
I'm 27 years old.

552
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,040
I'm the eldest son of the eldest daughter of Lan Hai Group.

553
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,160
My father is Yan Li.

554
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,160
My mother is Zhuang Meixuan.

555
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,350
I have a sister,

556
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,270
Zhuang Xinyan.

557
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,750
There are so many people

558
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,060
in your family.

559
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:02,950
Yes.

560
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:06,770
They all

561
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,290
passed away.

562
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,940
17 years ago,

563
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,780
they had a car accident.

564
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,300
My father died on the spot.

565
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,400
My mother fell into the sea

566
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,630
and her whereabouts are still unknown.

567
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,810
When my sister met Manning,

568
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,770
she also died

569
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,590
because of an accident.

570
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,389
I'm sorry about your loss.

571
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,300
Uncle, I want to ask you a question.

572
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,560
Are there only you and Maning at home?

573
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:52,730
All these years,

574
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,370
what have you been doing for a living?

575
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,200
My... My job…

576
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,510
What are you talking about?

577
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,090
About your birth.

578
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,830
About my birth?

579
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,050
My dad should be the one who asks you.

580
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,130
Why did you ask my dad?

581
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,710
Because I want to know more about you.

582
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,270
What for?

583
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,680
My life

584
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,760
is very simple.

585
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,340
My dad worked hard

586
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,660
to raise me up.

587
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,360
My mother passed away when I was very young.

588
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,880
All these years,

589
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,410
my dad has been earning money

590
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,540
by working in the transportation industry.

591
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,810
Truck transportation?

592
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,060
When I was young,

593
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,710
my mother was seriously ill.

594
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,640
At that time,

595
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,940
my dad went abroad

596
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,150
to earn her medical expenses.

597
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:53,720
Xingcheng.

598
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,140
What's wrong?

599
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,420
Manning.

600
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,520
I'm a little hungry.

601
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,340
Get me some food.

602
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:03,950
I haven't had lunch.

603
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,530
In a minute.

604
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,100
I did stay abroad for a while,

605
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,540
but that was just a part-time job at a foreign construction site.

606
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,650
May I ask

607
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,490
when did Manning's mother

608
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,140
pass away?

609
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,340
She...

610
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,520
17 years ago?

611
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,010
17 years ago,

612
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,240
Manning's mother

613
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,190
died of illness.

614
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,080
Her surname is Jiang.

615
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,850
Her name is Jiang Min.

616
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,090
Dad.

617
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,600
Are you serious?

618
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,740
The surname of the truck driver

619
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,010
who caused Yan Yi's parent's car accident

620
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:04,930
is Shen?
