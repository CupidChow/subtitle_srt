[Episode 2]

4
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,970
Zhuang Xinyan,

5
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,710
the granddaughter of Zhuang Cheng'an,

6
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,990
founder of a famous domestic luxury jewelry brand.

7
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,490
Her mother is Zhuang Cheng'an's

8
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,800
beloved eldest daughter,

9
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,730
Zhuang Meixuan.

10
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,370
Zhuang Xinyan grew up in the Zhuangs' Mansion.

11
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,509
She was taken care of by her grandfather and her family.

12
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,500
She could have grown up carefree

13
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,510
as Miss Zhuang.

14
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,430
Unexpectedly,

15
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,070
during the winter when she was seven,

16
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,270
the House of Zhuang had a huge accident.

17
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,370
When her parents were patrolling the branch office overseas,

18
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,930
suddenly there was a rainstorm,

19
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,890
they had a car accident.

20
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,120
Her father died on the spot.

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,290
Her mother went missing.

22
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,150
The hit-and-run driver escaped.

23
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,160
In order to help her through the setbacks,

24
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
he made up his mind

25
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,940
to send her abroad alone.

26
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,110
Although Zhuang Xinyan

27
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,220
has been abroad for all these years,

28
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,010
she didn't forget to return to the House of Zhuang.

29
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,210
Not only that,

30
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,050
she will also take back LH Star

31
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,640
her mother left for her.

32
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,220
So she concealed her identity

33
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,180
and grew up hard.

34
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,710
One month ago,

35
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,920
LH Star encountered the most severe debt crisis

36
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,730
since its establishment.

37
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,330
Its overseas debt that was supposed to be repaid in two months

38
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,250
needed to be repaid immediately due to a sudden change

39
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,710
in local national policy.

40
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,840
All of LH Star's assets were mortgaged on raw materials.

41
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,170
They had no assets to pay off the debts.

42
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,740
So the overseas bank froze

43
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,050
huge assets of LH Star.

44
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,120
Zhuang Cheng'an fell down

45
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
when he heard this

46
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,260
and fell into a coma.

47
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,740
Now the House of Zhuang and LH Star

48
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,270
are at the most critical moment.

49
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,440
Miss Zhuang must return to the House of Zhuang immediately.

50
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,570
Not only does she need to stabilize the House of Zhuang and LH Star,

51
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,040
but also get back the 40% of shares

52
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,970
left by her mother, Zhuang Meiyuan

53
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,840
and become the real heir of LH Star.

54
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,280
This is...

55
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,260
This is Zhuang Xinyan's personal information.

56
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,900
Her family,

57
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,870
her childhood friends,

58
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,020
the people she was close to and the people she hated,

59
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,640
every country she had lived abroad

60
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,650
since she was 7 years old,

61
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,320
and every friend

62
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,950
she had met in every school.

63
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,300
You have to remember them all.

64
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,680
Of course, there are also her living habits,

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,019
her favorite food,

66
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,519
food that she never touched,

67
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,579
her favorite music

68
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,220
and the type of business and languages she specialized in.

69
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,810
You have to remember all of them clearly.

70
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,010
How is that possible?

71
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:28,990
How...

72
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,870
How could I remember so many things

73
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,700
in such a short time?

74
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,440
You can't ask me to become exactly like her

75
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,600
in a short time.

76
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,180
I can't.

77
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,300
You have to do this.

78
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,790
In such extremely dangerous and profit-seeking places as

79
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,520
the House of Zhuang and LH Star,

80
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,650
countless eyes will be watching you.

81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,850
If you show any flaws,

82
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,430
you'll be identified by someone with ulterior motives.

83
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,690
What's waiting for you and me

84
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,320
is not survival,

85
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,070
but only death.

86
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,450
Do you understand?

87
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,330
Yes.

88
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,860
Then what's your purpose?

89
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,800
Do what you should do.

90
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,780
Don't ask anything you shouldn't know.

91
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,360
It's mine...

92
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,790
Are you going to

93
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,010
show to others with this

94
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,730
that your surname is not Zhuang?

95
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,540
No.

96
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,380
I-I just...

97
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,760
I'll say it again.

98
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,360
From now on,

99
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,280
you are Zhuang Xinyan.

100
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,810
Zhuang Xinyan

101
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,330
is you.

102
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,030
Due to the debt crisis a few days ago,

103
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,390
the renowned luxury jewelry group, LH Star

104
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,240
has announced a major personnel change today.

105
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,190
The board of directors of LH Star

106
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,460
will sign the new certificate of appointment today.

107
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,730
Zhuang Jiakai, the son of Zhuang Caixuan,

108
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,070
the second daugther of the House of Zhuang,

109
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,350
is likely to be the heir of LH Star

110
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,810
and become the third-generation president.

111
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,610
Boss, this...

112
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:23,860
Turn around.

113
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,780
Let's go to LH Star.

114
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:50,920
What?

115
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,030
Why don't you sign it?

116
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,620
Do you have a problem with me being the new president?

117
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,310
It's a big deal

118
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,760
for the group to assign a new president.

119
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,770
At least let me meet the president.

120
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,960
My grandpa is sick.

121
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,860
Instead of helping him,

122
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,910
you're here to cause troubles, aren't you?

123
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,630
Listen,

124
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,600
no one can

125
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,960
take over LH Star besides me now.

126
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,410
Understand?

127
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,100
We still have Ms. Zhuang Meixuan.

128
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,530
What?

129
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,690
Say it again.

130
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,130
Let me tell you.

131
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,460
Now in the House of Zhuang,

132
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,720
only my mother and I are surnamed Zhuang.

133
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,929
What Ms. Zhuang Meixuan?

134
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,190
She's nowhere to find.

135
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,130
Also,

136
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,419
those who agree to sign this

137
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,080
certificate of appointment,

138
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
I'll let you stay.

139
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,910
Those who won't sign it

140
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,610
have to leave LH Star

141
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,680
immediately.

142
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,920
You can't sign it.

143
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,660
Everyone,

144
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,300
the certificate of appointment of the new president of LH Star

145
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,890
cannot be signed.

146
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Who are you?

147
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,690
Do you know where this is?

148
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,720
Mr. Zhuang Jiakai.

149
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,310
First,

150
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,820
you are not the only third generation of the House of Zhuang.

151
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,730
When President Zhuang was seriously ill,

152
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,180
you're not the only heir.

153
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,240
Secondly,

154
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,760
according to the internal share settlement of LH Star,

155
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,290
you are not

156
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,010
the largest shareholder of LH Star.

157
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,310
So,

158
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,800
you have no right to force all shareholders

159
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
to appoint you as the president.

160
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,450
Stop talking nonsense.

161
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,090
You know clearly

162
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,350
whether I'm talking nonsense.

163
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,900
Who are you?

164
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,300
How dare you make a scene at LH Star?

165
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,900
Security!

166
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,480
Drag him out!

167
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,060
Hurry up!

168
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,990
What are you doing?

169
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,200
Who sent you here?

170
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,950
How dare you ruin my resignation as president?

171
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,840
Let me tell you.

172
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,040
Now, besides me,

173
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,830
no one is qualified to take over the whole LH Star.

174
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,570
She is.

175
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,790
Who is this?

176
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,790
Do you know her?

177
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,080
Isn't this...

178
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,650
Zhuang...

179
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,500
She's the only daughter of Zhuang Meixuan,

180
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,630
the eldest daughter

181
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,450
of President Zhuang,

182
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,000
Zhuang Xinyan.

183
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,460
She's really the only daughter

184
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,740
of Ms. Zhuang Meixuan.

185
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,890
I heard that more than ten years ago,

186
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,540
she was sent abroad by President Zhuang.

187
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,110
Yes.

188
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,910
She was hidden for many years.

189
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,020
Many people have never seen her.

190
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,600
LH Star used to be

191
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,570
founded and managed by her mother.

192
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,540
If Miss Zhuang really returns,

193
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,650
she's indeed the most qualified one.

194
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,390
Shut up!

195
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,570
I don't believe it.

196
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,290
Zhuang Xinyan was sent abroad 17 years ago.

197
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,170
She has been out of touch.

198
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,390
It is impossible for her to come back.

199
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,500
Impossible.

200
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,770
How did you know

201
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,940
she's been out of touch?

202
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,730
How can you be sure

203
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,690
she won't come back?

204
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,620
Whether you believe it or not, it doesn't matter.

205
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,040
As long as she stands here,

206
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,030
you have no right

207
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,330
or qualification

208
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,800
to take away the whole Ocean Star.

209
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,680
Miss Zhuang.

210
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,980
I'm Zhuang Xinyan.

211
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,670
I don't agree with

212
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,920
this certificate of appointment.

213
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,500
Drive.

214
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,940
Go back to the House of Zhuang.

215
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,540
We received news that

216
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,580
the car was severely crushed.

217
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,920
I thought she was dead.

218
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,100
You thought...

219
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,020
You didn't see her alive or dead,

220
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,360
how could you be sure?

221
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,640
She's right in front of you.

222
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,400
Where did you find those losers?

223
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,430
Boss, I was wrong.

224
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,880
I'll go to the House of Zhuang

225
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,070
to settle this matter.

226
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,670
Come back.

227
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,890
Where do you think this is?

228
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,310
Do you think you can do whatever you want

229
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,460
like you did abroad?

230
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:25,810
But boss...

231
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,040
Since she dares to come back alive,

232
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,020
let's make her suffer

233
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,500
in the House of Zhuang.

234
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,700
Come down.

235
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:00,750
Missie.

236
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:02,870
Welcome back.

237
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,460
Thank you, Lin...

238
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,370
Thank you, Uncle Guangyi.

239
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,300
Although we haven't seen each other for a long time,

240
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,040
Missie,

241
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,000
you don't need to be so polite.

242
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:27,960
Who is this?

243
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,990
He...he is...

244
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,580
I'm her fiance.

245
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,130
I met Xinyan when she was studying in Spain.

246
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,380
We arrived in Italy three months later.

247
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,800
We've been dating for almost a year.

248
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,470
She told me something happened at home,

249
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,670
so I came back with her.

250
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,130
We've greeted the seniors

251
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,100
and handled some family matters.

252
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,670
Congratulations, Missie.

253
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,530
The president is waiting for you.

254
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,240
Please.

255
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,200
Please.

256
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:37,750
Xingcheng.

257
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,440
Yan Xingcheng.

258
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,020
Ms. Caixuan.

259
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,260
Zhuang Xinyan?

260
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,850
Auntie.

261
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,870
Long time no see.

262
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,740
You've really grown up.

263
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,320
Long time no see.

264
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,540
How are you recently, Auntie?

265
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,600
Who is this?

266
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,510
He is my...

267
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,540
My surname is Yan.

268
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,480
Yan Xingcheng.

269
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,320
I'm Xinyan's fiance.

270
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,110
Your surname is Yan too?

271
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,210
It is a good surname.

272
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,140
Missie.

273
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,740
The president is still waiting.

274
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,900
Okay.

275
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,430
Let's go in now.

276
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,490
President.

277
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:45,950
President.

278
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,860
President.

279
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,230
Miss Xinyan is back.

280
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,010
I'm back.

281
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,880
Grandpa.

282
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,160
What have I been doing?

283
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,400
Why did I agree to come back?

284
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,290
Why would I become Zhuang Xinyan?

285
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,810
How could I substitute her

286
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,820
to stabilize the House of Zhuang

287
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,680
and become the heir of Ocean Star?

288
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,100
I can't do it.

289
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,050
So many shoes.

290
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,380
♫I'll hug you like this♫

291
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,960

307
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,830
I was just curious.

308
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,200
So I looked around.

309
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,450
♫I'll cooperate with your willfulness♫

310

♫It's okay. I have masculine charms that you can rely on♫

315
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,680
When you are Zhuang Xinyan,

316
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,490
♫Who can tell the magic of love♫

317
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,710
these are all yours.

318
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,190
I won't be Zhuang Xinyan forever.

319
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,710
These won't be mine either.

320
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,850
I got the wrong person?

321
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,110
President Zhuang gave me

322
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,440
accurate information.

323
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,350
If she is not Zhuang Xinyan,

324
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,910
then where is

325
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,270
the real Xinyan?

326
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,220
Why did I spend two weeks looking for her there

327
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,730
but got no news?

328
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,590
Two million

329
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:05,950
to buy out this.

330
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,360
You are...?

331
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,970
The CEO of Celine Fashion Studio,

332
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:17,960
Tang Lin.

333
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,090
It was you who called me seven times this afternoon

334
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,870
and insisted on buying out this pair of

335
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:34,970
jewels.

336
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,500
My studio is the best styling studio

337
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,260
in the fashion industry.

338
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,470
Your jewelry designs coincide with

339
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,470
the concept and style of our studio.

340
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,320
I will not only buy out this design,

341
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,000
but also all your jewel designs

342
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,220
for the following year.

343
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,660
How much salary are you going to pay me

344
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,700
for buying out all my designs for the whole year?

345
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,430
10 million.

346
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,660
Are you satisfied?

347
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,190
I'm afraid

348
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,140
you'll only be able to buy this at this price.

349
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,180
Mr. Lin.

350
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,680
I'm sincere to discuss

351
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,540
the annual cooperation with you.

352
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,550
Missie is back.

353
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,030
Mr. Lin.

354
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,570
I'm talking to you.

355
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,410
Sorry.

356
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,890
Something urgent came up. See you again.

357
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:43,800
Mr. Lin, you...

358
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,630
This is where she used to live.

359
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,580
This is her life.

360
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,690
Can I really become her?

361
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,760
Can I really help her get everything back?

362
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,610
What is that?

363
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,730
She really came back?

364
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,700
Why didn't she tell me?

365
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,300
She didn't even call me.

366
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,590
Shen… Shen Manning.

367
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:23,940
Shen Manning.

368
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,480
Are you Shen Manning?

369
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,170
W-what Shen Manning?

370
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,000
A senior student of the Department of Art

371
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:37,410
majored in Designing in Overseas Comprehensive Fine Arts University.

372
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,130
No, you got the wrong person.

373
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:40,300
Impossible.

374
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,020
We met before.

375
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,250
Under the teaching building of Overseas Comprehensive Fine Arts University...

376
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,310
That afternoon...

377
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,730
It wasn't me. You really got the wrong person.

378
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,330
No way.

379
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,670
If I'm wrong,

380
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,110
if you're not Shen Manning,

381
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:00,980
then who are you?

382
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,290
Who are you?

383
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,520
I...

384
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,460
I...

385
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,040
I am...

386
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,220
I'm Zhuang Xinyan.

387
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,040
Xinyan?

388
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,440
Yes.

389
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,600
I'm Zhuang Xinyan.

390
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,480
My grandfather is seriously ill.

391
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,400
Uncle Guangyi called me.

392
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,390
I came back last night.

393
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,460
Didn't Uncle Guangyi tell you?

394
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,380
I'm Lin Mufan.

395
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,820
When we were young,

396
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,230
you often called me Lin.

397
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,040
Lin.

398
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,870
You used to

399
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,790
fold paper planes

400
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,170
and fly kites with me.

401
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,190
I've been abroad for only ten years or so

402
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,670
and you already forgot me?

403
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,560
Lin,

404
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,640
I really have to go.

405
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,930
I have something to do.

406
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:08,980
Wait.

407
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,820
One month ago,

408
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,370
my father and President Zhuang

409
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,470
sent me to pick up Xinyan overseas.

410
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,390
Because of some special reasons,

411
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,850
I didn't get to see Xinyan.

412
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,190
But before I left,

413
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,410
I called Xinyan countless times.

414
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,760
If you're really Zhuang Xinyan,

415
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,320
you should have

416
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,790
my number in your phone.

417
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,040
[Zhuang Xinyan]

418
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,100
[Lin Mufan]

419
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,600
She abandoned

420
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,990
this number long ago.

421
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,640
Who are you?

422
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:02,700
Her

423
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:06,940
fiance.

424
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,300
His surname is Yan?

425
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,120
Xinyan's fiance?

426
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,210
Did I tell you

427
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,990
once you enter the House of Zhuang,

428
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,830
you have to throw yourself away.

429
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,880
If you don't become the real Zhuang Xinyan,

430
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,540
those who keep an eye on you will see through you.

431
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,150
Do you want to die?

432
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,830
Or you don't even want to know how you will die?

433
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,430
No.

434
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,320
He suddenly called my name.

435
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:00,810
I...

436
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,890
No one in the House of Zhuang will give you a chance to make mistakes.

437
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,840
Your carelessness

438
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,400
needs to be made up with endless carefulness.

439
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,950
If you don't want to collect your own body in a few days,

440
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,280
you'd better remember my words.

441
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,080
Once you enter here,

442
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,960
you can only be Zhuang Xinyan.

443
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,010
You must only be Zhuang Xinyan.

444
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,270
Answer me.

445
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,840
Yes.

446
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:39,990
Yan Xingcheng.

447
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,660
Who are you then?

448
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,340
Are you really Zhuang Xinyan's fiance?

449
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,460
You brought me back

450
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,830
and forced me to become Zhuang Xinyan.

451
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,030
What is your purpose?

452
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,010
What did you say?

453
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,870
You're just like everyone else, aren't you?

454
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,670
You gave me Zhuang Xinyan's eyes

455
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,690
and forced me to become her.

456
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,810
It is not because you love her very much.

457
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,610
You just want to get everything in the House of Zhuang.

458
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,590
After I become the real Zhuang Xinyan

459
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,320
and the only heir to Ocean Star,

460
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,380
once I marry you,

461
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,110
everything of the House of Zhuang and Ocean Star

462
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:17,909
will be yours.

463
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,940
What are you doing?
