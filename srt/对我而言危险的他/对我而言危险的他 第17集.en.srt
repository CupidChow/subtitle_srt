00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,440
Ten days later,

175
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,410
who has the largest share

176
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,160
of LH Star Group

177
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,080
would become the real owner of LH Star.

178
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,830
My dear cousin.

179
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,140
At that time,

180
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,670
don't cry in public.

181
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,190
Get out.

182
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
I want to talk to you alone.

183
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,170
You are scared?

184
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,090
I am?

185
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,670
Yang, take them out.

186
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,540
Mr. Zhuang, be careful.

187
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,360
Don't worry.

188
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,300
I'd like to see

189
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,410
what would my cousin say to me.

190
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,520
Let's go.

191
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,520
They have left.

192
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,250
What are you trying to say?

193
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,220
Let go of me!

194
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,010
If you touch my people again,

195
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,420
I'll let you know

196
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,900
what life is worse than death.

197
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,280
Yan Xingcheng.

198
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,340
If you dare,

199
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,620
hurt me like you did when I was a kid.

200
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,740
Are you blind?

201
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,590
Why did you step on my flowers?

202
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,650
Pay for my flowers!

203
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,830
This is my mother's greenhouse.

204
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,360
The flowers are ours too.

205
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,830
Kill me if you dare.

206
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,510
If you dare to talk nonsense in LH Star again,

207
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,430
next time,

208
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,950
it would be your eyes.

209

[Shen Manning]

210
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,500
Hello, Xingcheng.

211
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,670
I asked you out for dinner, but

212
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,310
I might not be able to come.

213
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,280
The case I took before,

214
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,570
the client seems to have some suggestions

215
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,500
and amendments.

216
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,030
So,

217
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,210
Mr. Lin asked me

218
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,630
to meet the client.

219
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,660
So I may not be able to go tonight.

220
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,470
Hello, Xingcheng.

221
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,290
Are you listening?

222
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,170
Okay.

223
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,320
Well,

224
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,310
I'll try to finish it earlier tonight

225
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,450
and come to you after that, okay?

226
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,340
What's going on?

227
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,400
What's that sound?

228
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,440
Nothing.

229
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,610
I see.

230
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,200
I'll contact you

231
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,230
after I finish it.

232
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,940
Okay.

233
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,980
See you tonight.

234
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,700
Yan Yi, no one taught you that

235
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,020
you should not have any weakness

236
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,670
before getting what you want?

237
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,109
Don't touch her.

238
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,920
I'm not interested in

239
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,599
a woman like her.

240
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
But I will give you a peice of advice.

241
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,230
Don't dream of getting a woman,

242
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,690
and taking the LH Star away at the same time.

243
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,609
In this world,

244
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,290
there are many people who throw good money after bad.

245
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,420
You can't escape from it either.

246
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,730
There are ten days left.

247
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,090
I want to see

248
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,400
how you can prove yourself

249
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,820
that you are the largest shareholder of LH Star.

250
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,980
And how you going to

251
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,900
sit in this position?

252
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,810
Cousin, I'm waiting for you.

253
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,020
No way.

254
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,590
The story has just started.

255
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,540
Why does the female lead have to make a choice?

256
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,230
Left, right, right, left.

257
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,180
I've been waiting for the two of you for so long.

258
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,110
Are you off work?

259
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,010
Do you want to join us tonight?

260
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,340

Yuan Shuai.

262
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Yuan Shuai, I have something to say.

263
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,090
Can you have dinner with me tonight?

264
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,400
I really want to talk to you.

265

00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,490
Mom, I'm back.

267
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,990
I've been through a lot,

268
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,740
and got many innocent people involved,

269
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,790
But...

270
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,300
I'm back.

271
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,070
I'm sorry.

272
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,620
I couldn't protect Xinyan.

273
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,400
I swear that

274
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,030
no matter what difficulties

275
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,320
or danger I encounter,

276
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,870
I will find the people

277
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,740
who hurt Xinyan

278
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,400
and you.

279
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,760
I will protect LH Star

280
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,400
and the House of Zhuang.

281
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,210
Mom and Dad have been away for 17 years.

282
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,610
Why would anyone search their old office?

283
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,550
Is there

284
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,650
anything else here?

285
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,960
Ten days later,

286
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,320
who has the largest share

287
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,830
of LH Star group

288
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,940
would be the real owner of LH Star.

289
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,350
There's something

290
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,850
I have to tell you.

291
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,350
Since your mother

292
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,420
took over LH Star from me,

293
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,950
nearly 40% of the shares

294
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,480
went under your mother's name.

295
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,160
This share

296
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,940
can confirm

297
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,650
the ownership of LH Star.

298
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,920
But your mother is missing now.

299
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,660
Before

300
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,190
announcing the death by overseas police,

301
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,160
there is a personal seal of hers

302
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,230
can be used to move this stock right.

303
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,220
Before she went abroad, she told me

304
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,790
she left this seal to Xinyan.

305
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,770
So their real purpose

306
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,350
is the largest share of LH Star,

307
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,750
my mother's personal seal.

308

Hello, boss.

00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,390
I'm tracking Miss Xinyan's data.

312
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,470
No need to track the time of the accident.

313
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,400
Go and check

314
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,980
the details on exit and entry of arts university

315
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,210
within 10 days before and after Xinyan's accident.

00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,290

321
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,390
Do as I said.

OK.

324
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,220
Check Shen Manning's phone.

325
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,280
Send me her location. Now. Right now.

The lines here must be changed.

329

But running contracts with LH Star Group is too troublesome.

330

Mr. Lin, I heard

331
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,780
you're going to run studio yourself.

Good.

333
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,920
Is there any way to circle around the company

335

could you please explain in details

regarding the revision you were talking about?

341

Okay.

these places and colors

344
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,160

347
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,050
and a whole set of products.

348
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:09,690
Here.

349
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,270
Let me see.

350
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,350
OK, this part.

351
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,420
I think still need to revise for a little bit.

352
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:17,950
Alright.

353
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,390
OK.

354
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,900
Can you take a look if it is ok?

355
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,560
The lines here are a bit stiff.

356
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,630
You can change it here.

357
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,030
OK. And this part, right?

358
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,350
Yes.

359
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,380
Manning.

360
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,830
Take a look. This place needs to be modified.

361
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,790
Okay, I got it.

362
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,600
Take a look.

363
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,780
Is it okay?

364
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,790
OK.

365
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:50,940
Manning.

366
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,790
Look at this place.

367
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,320
I hope the lines are softer.

368
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,000
OK?

369
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,140
Okay.

370
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,180

Cheers.

378
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,340
Don't drink too much.

379
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,830
Slowly. Wipe it off.

380
