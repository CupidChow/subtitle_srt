I-I didn't.

45

Useless brats!

177
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,930
What nonsense are you making up?

178
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,870
You fell into the sea

179
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,960
and was saved,

180
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,830
and you were sent to an orphanage overseas?

181
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,880
Liar!

182
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,070
Do you know

183
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,810
how many people

184
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,980
were sent to rescue you from grandpa and my mom?

185
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,570
And how many nautical miles around did

186
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,530
the local police went to search?

187
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,870
There's no one there.

188
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,830
How dare you tell me

189
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,940
you are Yan Yi.

190
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,090
Will you say that

191
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,800
Auntie Zhuang Meixuan would be back in a few days?

192
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,000
How dare you say my mom is dead?

193
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,420
If I didn't grow up there,

194
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,810
I wouldn't be here now.

195
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,790
If you were Yi,

196
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,000
what about Xinyan?

197
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,270
Right.

198
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,830
If you were Yan Yi,

199
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,830
what about Zhuang Xinyan?

200
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,030
What about the real granddaughter of the House of Zhuang?

201
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,810
Grandpa,

202
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,470
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,150
Xinyan,

204
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,690
she left.

205
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,560
Half a year ago,

206
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,710
I found her at arts university overseas.

207
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,040
I wanted to come back with her.

208
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,110
But...

209
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:55,750
tell me.

210
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,500
she had an accident.

211
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,150
Who are you?

212
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,230
I'm Yan Yi.

213
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,620
She was anxious to save others.

214
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,310
In the end,

215
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,350
she had a serious car accident.

216
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,420
How is that possible?

217
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,390
It's been 17 years.

218
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,230
-I failed to protect her.-You're still alive.

219
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,080
When I got there,

220
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,340
she was already dead.

221
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,460
I have to save someone first.

222
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,470
Wait for me,

223
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:31,840
brother.

224
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,550
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,740
You were seriously ill.

226
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,710
I couldn't tell you the truth.

227
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,560
LH Star was a mess too.

228
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,480
I couldn't have showed my real identity

229
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,630
at that time.

230
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,520
So,

231
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,930
you just found someone randomly

232
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,990
to pretend to be Zhuang Xinyan.

233
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,240
She's not someone randomly.

234
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,840
Do you know

235
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,760
what responsibility she has to take

236
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,190
to pretend to be the granddaughter of the House of Zhuang and the heir of LH Star Group?

237
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,080
Everything and

238
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,070
and all the plans

239
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,580
were done by me.

240
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,210
It has nothing to do with her.

241
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,810
I forced her

242
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,290
to go home with me.

243
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
I'll take the punishment

244
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,350
if the Group and the family need to blame.

245
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:01,840
Yan Yi.

246
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,470
You're making it sound so grand.

247
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,790
You want to take all the responsibilities

248
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,020
and try to save her?

249
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,970
Since she dared to break into the house,

250
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,550
she must pay the price.

251
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,240
I told you.

252
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,790
She has nothing to do with all the responsibilities

253
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,960
and punishment.

254
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,200
Come at me.

255
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:22,750
You...

256
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,290
Enough.

257
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:25,870
President.

258
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,120
Stop talking.

259
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,200
Hasn't the House of Zhuang

260
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,100
broken up?

261
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,600
Two of you have to

262
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,240
fight against each other at home,

263
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,540
at least after I die.

264
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,160
-Grandpa.-Grandpa.

265
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,000
Alright.

266
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,570
This matter is over.

267
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,390
From now on,

268
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,420
in the House of Zhuang,

269
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,700
in LH Star,

270
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,260
no one should mention about Xin-

271
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,400
Xinyan again.

272
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,190
Grandpa.

273
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,810
We can't let them go.

274
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,829
-This is...-I told you.

275
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,520
Don't mention it again.

276
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,280
Alright.

277
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,190
You...

278
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,599
all leave.

279
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,290
Leave me alone

280
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,400
for a while.

281
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,550
Xinyan is

282
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,870
gone.

283
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,020
So...

284
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,670
when he was looking for me,

285
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,730
he has already

286
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,890
told the media?

287
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,820
It is not as simple as you think.

288
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,270
He posted a change notice

289
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,820
to LH Star and all the media.

290
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,030
A man

291
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,840
who dares to detonate himself as a bomb.

292
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,630
How dare you play tricks in front of him?

293
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,580
If I don't show up,

294
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,880
you wouldn't even know how he killed you.

295
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,510
Brother.

296
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,940
He shouldn't be yours.

297
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,780
From now on,

298
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,180
you should stop thinking about him

299
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,650
and stay at home.

300
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,510
Don't go anywhere.

301
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,750
Brother.

302
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,830
Brother!

303
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,290
Xingcheng.

304
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,040
Xingcheng.

305
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,670
Why are you here?

306
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,210
What happened?

307
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,360
Why am I here?

308
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:18,810
Right,

309
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,360
it was a car accident.

310
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,040
You hurt your forehead.

311
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,700
Don't move.

312
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,910
I'm fine.

313
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,800
Where are they?

314
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,840
Are they okay?

315
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,840
Yan Xingcheng,

316
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,300
also...

317
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
No one got hurt.

318
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,500
Your father is in the lounge.

319
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,600
Your friend, Meina

320
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,190
is outside.

321
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,410
Meina,

322
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,950
she...

323
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,750
It is all over.

324
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,320
Manning.

325
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:19,290
You...

326
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,870
You called me?

327
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:21,600
Yes.

328
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,220
I knew it was you.

329
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,480
Shen Manning.

330
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,180
Yan Xingcheng and I...

331
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,080
We...

332
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,460
He and the House of Zhuang

333
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,990
and LH Star Group

334
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,500
have announced everything.

335
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,590
He is the eldest son of the eldest daughter of the House of Zhuang, Zhuang Mei Xuan.

336
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,850
His real name is Yan Yi.

337
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,570
17 years ago,

338
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,770
there was a serious car accident

339
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,740
when he went on the inspection tour to all the branch offices with his parents.

340
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,010
He grew up abroad.

341
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,470
He is the real eldest grandson

342
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,030
of the House of Zhuang.

343
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,790
What are you talking about?

344
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,500
I don't understand.

345
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,070
I knew the secret between you and him,

346
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,460
and his identity.

347
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,430
But I really didn't expect

348
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,910
he would

349
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,640
expose himself when

350
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,070

00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,290
Where are Fang Xiang and Yuan Shuai?

524
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,420
I asked them to guard you.

525
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,540
Let's go. I'll send you back.

526
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:11,920
I...

527
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,140
I want to

528
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,080
talk to you alone.

529
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,850
What do you want to say?

530
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,710
I'm listening.

531
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,710
Your identity...

532
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,970
and your relationship with the House of Zhuang.

533
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,730
You are...

534
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,500
So,

535
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,040
these are the secrets

536
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,900
you've been trying to tell me?

537
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:51,340
Yes.

538
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,860
I didn't know you were such an amazing person.

539
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,860
So you are the only true heir

540
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,640
of the House of Zhuang.

541
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,770
Actually,

542
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,750
you don't even

543
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,440
need me,

544
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:27,800
right?

545
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,180
Actually,

546
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,850
you can get back everything

547
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,340
on your own,

548
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,630
♫I remembered your smile again♫

549
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:47,940

550
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,730
♫Long time no see♫

551
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:01,580
♫I was longing for a hug in my dream♫

552
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,980
So it is done between us.

553
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,490
♫But the dream could not be true♫

554
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:13,600
♫What I said to myself♫

555
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,540
At that time

556
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,790
You said it would take a year.

557
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,730
♫Have you heard it?♫

558
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,790
It is not even a year yet.

559
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:28,830
♫The past taught people to grow up♫

560

561

Thank you for keeping your promise and

562
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:33,910
♫I would not listen♫

♫Thinking about your face If you're just hibernating♫

566

I can

567
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,350
get out of this world now.

568
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:47,280
♫Give me one more moment♫

569

Shen Manning.

571
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,040
I know we're not from the same world.

♫Missed your face and wanted to pay you back♫

♫Why not forever?♫

575

Yan Xingcheng.

577
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:02,910
No.

578
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,310
Mr. Yan,

579
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,490
the game is over.

580
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,750
We're even now.

581

You're right.
