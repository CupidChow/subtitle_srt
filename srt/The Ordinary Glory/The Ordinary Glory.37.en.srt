1
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,360
Mr. Liu.

2
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,840
This is our team's
investment manager, Lin Yuming.

3
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,120
He'll be taking over my work from now on.

4
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,560
This is Mr. Liu,
the founder of our project.

5
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,480
Hello, Mr. Liu.

6
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,680
Hello, Mr. Lin.

7
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,840
Yiqiu, are you withdrawing?

8
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,120
Yes.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Mr. Lin is more experienced than me.

10
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,480
He'll surely manage this project well.

11
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,160
Don't worry.

12
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,880
I trust King's reputation.

13
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,320
But Yiqiu, why are you suddenly leaving?

14
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,960
It's because

15
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,160
there's a problem
with my personal work schedule.

16
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,360
I hope you can understand.

17
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,760
I see.

18
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,960
I can't force you.

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,800
However,

20
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,800
if you get a chance
to work on a project again,

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,640
you're always welcome to join us.

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,600
Thank you.

23
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,720
I'll leave you to it.

24
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,440
Okay.

25
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,280
Mr. Liu, please have a seat.

26
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll tell you my thoughts
on this project first.

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,040
Okay, go ahead.

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,160
Mr. Wu, the handover
of the project is done.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,640
Mr. Lin is talking to the founder.

30
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,160
Hello?

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,880
Mr. Li.

32
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,560
Okay, I'll be right there.

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,080
"Rihuan BioTech Limited Company."

34
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,240
That name sounds familiar.

35
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,200
In the local genetic testing industry,

36
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,760
this company has been
the fastest-growing one in recent years.

37
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,080
Their IPO?

38
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,080
After waiting for over a year,

39
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,680
it's going to happen soon.

40
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Do you want to do it?

41
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,160
Do you want Team Four to do it?

42
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,800
Mr. Li, this is a top-rated company.

43
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,680
Once it gets listed successfully,
its value will multiply several times.

44
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,520
Team Four doesn't get good deals.

45
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,840
What's the catch?

46
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,160
I remember now.

47
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,560
Mr. Qu personally invested
in this project a few years ago, right?

48
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,840
That's right.

49
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,840
And it was Mr. Qu

50
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,800
who specifically asked you
to take on this project.

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,640
Kezhi, based on my experience,

52
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,800
out of all the projects in the company,

53
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,440
the only one that can become a unicorn
in three to five years

54
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,240
is this one.

55
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,800
Please tell him then.

56
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,600
Our team is incapable
of accommodating such a huge project.

57
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,240
Kezhi.

58
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,160
There's still time.

59
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Think about it.

60
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,280
If you succeed,

61
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,360
I'll benefit from it too.

62
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,920
What do you think?

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,960
These five dishes suit your taste, right?

64
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,600
Shengchao.

65
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,720
I'm really broke this month.

66
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,600
What are you talking about?

67
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,480
I'm right here. Why would I let you pay?

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,880
You won't?

69
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,600
Don't think about that.

70
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,320
Eat up.

71
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,200
Sir, your drink.

72
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,160
Thank you.

73
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,240
Hao Shuai.

74
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,920
Go in my stead this afternoon.

75
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,640
Where to?

76
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,680
Where else?

77
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,160
Do you mean

78
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,680
Morfan's factory?

79
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,600
Yes.

80
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,560
I can't communicate with those hicks.

81
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,160
You're good at dealing with them.

82
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,720
I'll let you do your thing.

83
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,840
But aren't you in charge of this case?

84
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,080
Also, Mr. Su specifically wants you to go.

85
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,760
What's this?

86
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,320
You're using Mr. Su again.

87
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,400
Things have already come this far.

88
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,440
Does it matter
who's in charge of the project?

89
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,560
It doesn't matter who goes.

90
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,960
But…

91
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,360
But what should I tell them?

92
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,320
Just use your wits.

93
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,440
Get our stand across,

94
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
but remember one thing.

95
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,280
Tell them not to cause trouble here again.

96
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,760
Why should they listen to me?

97
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
I haven't recovered yet.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay.

99
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,480
Don't take it to heart.

100
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,600
They're unreasonable.

101
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,680
If it doesn't work out, call the police.

102
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,840
Do you know how to do that?

103
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,760
110.

104
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,040
If you take care of this for me,

105
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,520
when things quiet down,

106
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,800
I'll let you handle a project.

107
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,920
What are you thinking about?
Aren't five dishes enough for you?

108
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,320
I'll go then.

109
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,560
You should've said this earlier.

110
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,560
All right, eat up.

111
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,800
After that, get back to work.

112
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,040
Waiter, check, please.

113
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,640
MORFAN APPAREL

114
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,640
Hello, is anyone here?

115
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,080
Hello, is anyone here?

116
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,840
I'm here.

117
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,800
What do you want?

118
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,480
I'm looking for someone.

119
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,680
Young man.

120
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,360
Are you telling the truth?

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,920
At this point,

122
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,960
I have no reason to lie to you.

123
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,520
Also, according to the law,

124
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,120
my company is just like you.

125
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,480
We're all victims of this fraud.

126
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,960
If you don't believe me,

127
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,600
you can consult any lawyer or the police.

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,920
Then…

129
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,560
what should we do now?

130
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,800
Our company will follow
the procedures to liquidate the project.

131
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,840
After the liquidation,

132
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,920
you might get some compensation.

133
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,560
But I don't want to lie to you.

134
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,080
It won't be much.

135
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,720
But the police have made a case.

136
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,280
Your boss took the money.

137
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,400
As long as we catch him--

138
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,920
He's already gone!

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,080
How can we catch him?

140
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,320
- That's right.
- That's right.

141
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,360
Go on.

142
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,400
If there's no other way,

143
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,440
why did you come here?

144
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,240
Actually,

145
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,800
I want to tell you something.

146
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,160
From now on,

147
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,120
don't come to our company.

148
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,080
Sir, I'm sorry.

149
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,400
Young man, let me ask you something.

150
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,600
Tell me the truth.

151
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,160
Go ahead.

152
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,320
He ran away.

153
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,160
Can we still find him?

154
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,600
Let's leave it to fate.

155
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,360
Let me tell you.

156
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,480
Luckily, you were the one who came.

157
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,080
But if it's that Yin guy,

158
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,560
I won't be able to stop them

159
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,200
from fighting.

160
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,880
Actually, Mr. Yin didn't know either.

161
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,760
He didn't know?

162
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,080
He must be blind.

163
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,480
That Zhou bastard
got away right under his nose.

164
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,440
Why do you say that?

165
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,080
These past few years, they were so close

166
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,840
that they might as well
wear the same pants.

167
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,840
Do you mean they see each other often?

168
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,440
They see each other a few times a month.

169
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,920
How could he get away
right under his nose?

170
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,240
<i>Mr. Su, I'm really sorry.</i>

171
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,480
I really didn't expect it
to turn out this way.

172
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,480
What do you mean?

173
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,280
Isn't that your project?

174
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,200
Yes, but I haven't seen their founder
for half a year.

175
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,000
I didn't expect it to be this serious.

176
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,920
Young man.

177
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,160
Go back.

178
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Tell your boss too.

179
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,280
We won't find him for now.

180
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,440
But this doesn't mean it's over.

181
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,760
Why did they return it?

182
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
What did they say?

183
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,520
The Risk Control Center said
the same thing two years ago.

184
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,880
They said the offshore wind energy project
doesn't have strong operability.

185
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,400
Don't you know
the Risk Control Center is full of crap?

186
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,080
Yes, I know.

187
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,000
But it's not up to me.

188
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,080
Go back first. I'll think of something.

189
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,640
Why are you still here?

190
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,640
Mr. Ma.

191
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,240
I think since this project
has been rejected,

192
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,520
our top priority is finding
another project to replace it.

193
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
The deadline for submission
of new projects is in two days.

194
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,240
Our Energy Team must submit
a project this time.

195
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,960
What other projects do you have?

196
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,240
None?

197
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,360
Well, yes.

198
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,280
There is one.

199
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,520
Just say it.

200
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,560
Qiancheng Solar.
Risk Control has already approved it.

201
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,280
It's Lan Qianyi's project.

202
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,640
Boss.

203
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,080
I…

204
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,440
I think no matter whose project it is,

205
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,400
as long as it brings good profits,

206
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,520
it benefits all of us.

207
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,000
Why don't we

208
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,560
use Qianyi's project as the replacement?

209
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,600
Can't you consider my dilemma?

210
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,520
You've been away for a month.

211
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,040
I have to send Xiaoxiao to school
and take care of her meals all by myself.

212
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,440
Don't I have work to do?

213
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,400
Do you know how much
backlog of work I have this month?

214
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,000
Hold on.

215
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,280
Hello, I'm Yu Wenli from King Capital.

216
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,760
Yes, we take
the baby warmer project very seriously.

217
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,320
- A cup of coffee.
- Our Finance Team

218
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,040
is doing their best to finish the report.

219
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,240
Okay.

220
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,080
I'll contact you
with further developments.

221
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,560
Okay, thank you.

222
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,000
Bye.

223
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,120
I'm begging you.

224
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,520
Finish your work and go home.

225
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,960
I know your work is important, but…

226
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,160
What do you mean?

227
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,760
You think I'm being unreasonable,
don't you?

228
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,880
You say that every time.

229
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,840
Thank you.

230
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,400
Forget it. I don't want to argue.

231
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,840
Okay.

232
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,320
Pretend I never said anything, okay?

233
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
How is it? Are you okay?

234
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,120
I'm fine. I'm used to it.

235
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,120
What are you busy with?

236
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,240
An urgent project.

237
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,120
It's not easy to advance this project.

238
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,520
We've revised the report thrice
just to pass Risk Control's review.

239
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,440
I have a parent-teacher meeting
and a family party with Xiaoxiao.

240
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,400
I thought I could juggle
my family and career.

241
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,960
Now I know how it feels
to get stuck in the middle.

242
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,640
What about you?

243
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,680
How have you been?

244
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,680
There's a big project.

245
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,440
But I don't want to do it.

246
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,760
Hello?

247
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,480
Is everyone present?

248
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,880
Okay, I'll be right up.

249
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,400
I'm off to a meeting.

250
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,840
Next time, I'll hear you talk
about the big project you don't want.

251
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,200
Sure.

252
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,560
Are you okay?

253
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm fine.

254
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,920
I'll get going.

255
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,080
Are you really okay?

256
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,640
Yes, I'm okay. Don't worry.

257
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,520
Mr. Ma.

258
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,360
Qianyi.

259
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,200
Make the font bigger
or we won't be able to read it.

260
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,160
Everyone, work hard.

261
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
- Mr. Ma.
- Mr. Ma.

262
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,040
What does Mr. Ma want?

263
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,720
He has been here
four times this afternoon.

264
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,120
I never expected that

265
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,080
this would be

266
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,280
how Mr. Ma asked for a favor.

267
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,520
Mr. Zhao, what's going on?

268
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,320
Do you remember your project
that Mr. Ma shot down?

269
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,760
Qiancheng Solar?

270
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,080
Take it out.

271
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,760
- And then?
- And then,

272
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,400
wait and see a miracle.

273
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Hello, Mr. Liu.

274
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,080
Just call me Yuming.

275
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,200
Yuming.

276
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,880
Sorry to bother you.

277
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,040
I've sent you
the revised investment proposal.

278
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,359
You've read it.

279
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,839
What do you think?

280
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,400
That's great.

281
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,960
Okay.

282
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,440
Yes.

283
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,960
Yes, I…

284
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,800
I'll get ready right away.

285
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,760
Let's get this approved
by the investment committee in one go.

286
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,600
Okay.

287
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
It's no trouble.

288
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,160
Okay, wait for my news.

289
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,680
That's all.

290
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,000
Bye.

291
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,120
What a good project.

292
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,040
It's smooth sailing.

293
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,920
But this time, it's all thanks to Sun…

294
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,160
Mr. Ding, I…

295
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,600
Do you think I got too excited?

296
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,200
What do you think?

297
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,200
<i>Who am I throwing a tantrum at?</i>

298
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,680
<i>It was my own decision.</i>

299
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,000
<i>Why can't I accept it?</i>

300
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,080
Sicong.

301
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,120
What are you looking at?

302
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,640
Nothing.

303
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,120
Don't be so sneaky.

304
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,920
Mr. Xu.

305
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,160
When is our boss going to say it?

306
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,760
I want to go home.

307
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,040
Who doesn't want to go home?

308
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,920
Do you dare leave before him?

309
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,000
Look, Mr. Ma is so hopeless.

310
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,600
Is it so hard for him

311
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,320
to ask for a favor?

312
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,840
Why are you smiling?

313
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,000
Where is she?

314
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,240
She was just here.

315
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,360
Boqian, where did she go?

316
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,000
I didn't look up.

317
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,320
Did none of you see where she went?

318
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,440
Xu Taiping,
what kind of team leader are you?

319
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,360
Did she go missing?

320
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,640
Did she skip work?

321
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,080
I'm asking you, Xu Taiping.

322
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,280
- Mr. Ma.
- Where is she?

323
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,280
I'm here.

324
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,520
I'm sorry, Mr. Ma.

325
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,320
I went out for a while
and didn't have time to inform Mr. Xu.

326
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,600
Lan Qianyi, where did you go
at this late hour?

327
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,600
I went to the reference room

328
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,920
and took out the documents
on the Qiancheng Solar project.

329
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,880
Mr. Ma, please.

330
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,840
Can you give me

331
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,040
another chance on this project?

332
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,520
Can you?

333
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,520
Let me take a look.

334
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,240
- I'll think about it.
- Thank you, Mr. Ma.

335
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,720
Xu Taiping.

336
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,680
What time is it?

337
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,280
- It's 10:30 p.m.
- It's so late. Aren't you going home?

338
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,080
What kind of team leader are you?

339
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,720
Go home now, understand?

340
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,240
After work today,

341
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,480
treat your team members
to improve their well-being.

342
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,280
Who's paying…

343
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,360
Thank you, Mr. Ma!

344
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,200
It's Mr. Ma's treat.

345
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,800
Qianyi.

346
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,880
You're amazing.

347
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,240
I'm impressed.

348
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,720
You manage to make Mr. Ma say that.

349
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,520
You've matured so fast.

350
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,000
It's nothing.

351
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,040
Since Mr. Ma couldn't say it,
I just said it for him.

352
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
Stop chatting.

353
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,080
It's Mr. Ma's treat.
Let's celebrate Qianyi's victory.

354
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,360
<i>Ms. Yu, you're awake.</i>

355
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,000
Are you all right?

356
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
I'm fine.

357
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,920
The deadline to submit
to Risk Control is almost up.

358
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,440
You'd better go back

359
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,880
and complete the report
on the baby warmer project.

360
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,320
We need to seize the moment.

361
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,040
This state-of-the-art baby warmer machine

362
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,320
is important for the protection
of premature babies.

363
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,360
If we can produce it,

364
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,560
it can help many families.

365
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,360
You've never been a parent,

366
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,720
so you don't know
how important this product is.

367
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,240
But Ms. Yu…

368
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,800
If I hadn't fallen ill,

369
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,360
I'd definitely do

370
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,400
the final draft.

371
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,080
But there's no other way now.

372
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,200
I can only rely on you two.

373
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
Yes, Ms. Yu.

374
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,000
Don't worry. Leave it to us.

375
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,960
That's right, Ms. Yu. Rest well.

376
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,960
Regarding this matter,

377
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,920
we'll take care of it.

378
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,080
Thank you.

379
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,080
- Mr. Wu.
- Mr. Wu is here.

380
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,080
Kezhi.

381
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,640
How are you? Are you feeling better?

382
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,840
Much better.

383
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,520
Mr. Wu, I'll let you two talk.

384
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,440
We're busy.

385
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,480
- Okay.
- We'll get going.

386
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,720
- Bye, Ms. Yu.
- Bye, Ms. Yu.

387
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,680
Bye.

388
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,120
Thank you.

389
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,840
Don't worry.

390
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
The doctor said it was nothing serious.

391
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,480
It's just neurasthenia and exhaustion.

392
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,840
You just need a few days of rest.

393
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,440
And

394
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,240
don't worry about Xiaoxiao.

395
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,880
I've contacted your husband.

396
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,800
He'll ask his family
to take care of Xiaoxiao.

397
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,000
He's on his way back too.

398
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,000
Thank you for today.

399
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,600
Don't mention it. It's what I should do.

400
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,600
We should always help each other.

401
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,960
If…

402
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,440
If I quit,

403
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,240
would things get better?

404
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,520
What are you saying?

405
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,920
I originally thought

406
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,880
that I could do everything well on my own.

407
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,760
In fact,

408
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,960
whether it's my superiors,
my subordinates,

409
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,360
my husband, or my child,

410
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,600
everyone thinks that I'm not doing enough.

411
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,120
Look at you.

412
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,840
That's not true.

413
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,760
When you fell ill,
they came to see you right away.

414
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,760
You're mistaken.

415
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,200
They came to see me
because they wanted me to stop my project.

416
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,640
I've caused them trouble.

417
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,200
Maybe I should be
like what my husband said.

418
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
I should go home early

419
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,520
and just be a housewife.

420
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,760
Look at you.

421
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,720
You always think too much.

422
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,320
No matter what, get well first.

423
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,360
Kezhi.

424
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,280
Thank you for comforting me.

425
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
She still thinks
about this stupid project.

426
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,400
We'll need to work overtime as well.

427
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,040
The project isn't that profitable.

428
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,160
Why is she working so hard
for social responsibility?

429
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,280
Is she running a charity?

430
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,560
How did we end up with such a boss?

431
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,240
Isn't her husband capable?

432
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,840
I think she should just be a housewife…

433
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,320
Mr. Wu.

434
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,320
You two are still here.

435
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,160
We…

436
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,600
Mr. Wu, we'd like you
to talk to Ms. Yu about something.

437
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,640
It's about the baby warmer project.

438
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,040
It's a lot of work
and it doesn't make much money.

439
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,800
Do we really need to do it?

440
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,080
Yes, Mr. Wu.

441
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,120
Look.

442
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,720
You and Ms. Yu are batchmates.

443
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,360
Also, you two are the closest.

444
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,400
So I'll have to trouble you
to talk to Ms. Yu about this.

445
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,240
Mr. Wu.

446
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,440
- Mr. Wu.
- Mr. Wu.

447
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,800
Is it done?

448
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,440
Are you sure they won't come?

449
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,200
Good job.

450
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,920
Mr. Yin.

451
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,160
I want to ask you something.

452
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,520
Ask away.

453
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,760
Well,

454
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,480
are you close

455
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,600
with Morfan's boss?

456
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,200
Why are you asking that?

457
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,400
I…

458
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,400
Do you think I want this?

459
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,000
He ran away
and I wouldn't get punished, right?

460
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,400
What else do you want me to do, Hao Shuai?

461
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
I'm just asking.

462
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,600
Just asking?

463
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,240
Get out of my sight.

464
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,360
Look at this project.
We stayed up all night again.

465
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,120
Yes, it wasn't easy.

466
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
We finally made it.

467
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Good morning.

468
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,880
- Mr. Jiang.
- Mr. Jiang.

469
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,320
What are you doing?

470
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,680
This is the report on the baby warmer
Ms. Yu wants to invest in.

471
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,200
We finished it overnight

472
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,480
and we're about to submit it.

473
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,160
Thank you. Can I take a look?

474
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,680
Don't worry.

475
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,600
After I read it,

476
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,360
I'll send it to Risk Control.

477
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,960
What crap is this?

478
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,320
This can't be what Ms. Yu wants.

479
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,840
If they are eager to kill the project,

480
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,680
why don't they just tell Ms. Yu?

481
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,800
What's the point
of doing this behind her back?

482
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,840
Mr. Wu.

483
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,680
Thank you for informing us.

484
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,840
If we submit the report like this,

485
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,600
Ms. Yu will be disappointed.

486
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,720
Don't mention it.

487
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,920
I didn't think
they would do something like this.

488
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,680
But Mr. Jiang,

489
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,680
tomorrow is the submission deadline.

490
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,080
But the report is like this.

491
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,360
What should we do?

492
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,960
We can't make it.

493
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,440
Ms. Yu is in the hospital.

494
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,400
I have a business trip later.

495
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,360
We'll just have to submit it

496
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,040
to Risk Control next time.

497
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,720
But the project won't wait for us.

498
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Mr. Wu, you…

499
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,240
Wait for my call.

500
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,240
Mr. Sun.

501
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,120
Let's get to work.

502
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,400
Mr. Yin.

503
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,960
I'll get going then.

504
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,280
Sure, go ahead.

505
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,280
Thank you.

506
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,000
Let's go.

507
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
This way.

508
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,880
Don't just stand there. Let's get to work.

509
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,680
I've translated the foreign document
brought by Ms. Yu.

510
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,640
Mr. Wu, please check.

511
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,200
It's good.

512
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,240
Add one more slide to introduce
the exported baby warmer machine.

513
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,960
This is a key point.

514
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,000
Mr. Sun.

515
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,280
Are you sure about that?

516
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,880
I'm an expert at taking minutes now.

517
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,680
Qianyi.

518
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,040
It's in English.

519
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,240
And one with a weird accent.

520
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,680
You should listen to it too.

521
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,560
At least you'll know
the gender of the speaker.

522
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,880
The project report
of exported baby warmers

523
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,680
targets the market demand
for the proposed product…

524
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,800
Mr. Wu, we've confirmed that

525
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,480
the problematic baby warmer machines
were just knockoffs.

526
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,960
If we get stronger endorsements,

527
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,120
it'll help us in seizing
the local market share.

528
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,080
Ms. Yu has contacted UNICEF
to see if they would accept

529
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,960
our donation of baby warmer machines.

530
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,920
I contacted them before I came here.

531
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,200
They accepted our offer

532
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,360
and allowed us
to send it overseas as well.

533
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,720
Go and confirm the details with them.

534
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,680
Also, check with the supplier
if they have enough stock.

535
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,680
…technology, fund planning,
financial impact, and social impact.

536
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,760
- Hi.
- By the way, Mr. Wu,

537
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,600
- I just had an idea.
- Investment risk…

538
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,000
If we can have
a long-term collaboration with UNICEF,

539
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,640
Jianyi Baby Warmer

540
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,920
will not only have a domestic market share

541
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
but can also be promoted
in other countries and regions.

542
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,600
How about this?

543
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,880
Use data from overseas
and make a new forecast,

544
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,080
targeting the underdeveloped areas
in Southeast Asia.

545
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,080
Some of the data will have some changes.

546
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,920
I think the absolute values
from overseas data are meaningless to us.

547
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,760
Besides, not many people
understand the concept.

548
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,000
If we change it to percentage,
will it be more impactful?

549
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,160
Sicong.

550
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,440
I think there's a problem with the data.

551
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,680
I'm revising it.
I'll send it to you later.

552
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,680
I think I'll delete this part for now.

553
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
Revise the slides then.

554
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,520
Okay.

555
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,560
Mr. Wu.

556
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Let's eat.

557
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,080
Let me tidy up.

558
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,440
It's already 2 a.m.

559
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,639
Can we finish it?

560
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,360
With a final push, I think yes.

561
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,159
I didn't expect

562
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,159
Mr. Wu to help Ms. Yu to this extent.

563
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,199
I heard they joined the company
at the same time.

564
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,880
So

565
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,880
they're closer than ordinary colleagues.

566
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,719
I think you're right.

567
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,520
The bond between batchmates
is as strong as gold.

568
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,199
By the way, I want to ask you something.

569
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,679
- Give me your opinion.
- Okay.

570
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
It's about

571
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,680
the owner of Morfan Apparel who ran away.

572
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,720
I just feel

573
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,800
that there's something
between him and Yin Shengchao.

574
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,880
- Hao Shuai.
- Tell me--

575
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,840
I'll say this one last time.

576
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
It's for your own good.

577
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,400
This matter is beyond your responsibility.

578
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,000
Stay out of it.

579
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,800
- But…
- Have you forgotten

580
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,120
how Yin Shengchao
played you like a fiddle?

581
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Don't fight with him

582
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,960
unless you don't plan to stay.

583
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,480
Hao Shuai, Sicong is right.

584
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,240
You can't beat Mr. Yin.

585
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,440
Where are they?

586
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,880
They went out for some fresh air.

587
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,640
How much longer?

588
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,640
I still have one last day.

589
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,560
I mean…

590
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,200
Well, I'll get it done

591
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,120
by tomorrow morning.

592
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,400
Mr. Wu.

593
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,400
Thank you.

594
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,920
For what?

595
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,760
Thank you for giving me
the last chance to work overtime at King.

596
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,920
It allowed me
to spend more time with everyone

597
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,760
and create more memories.

598
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,480
That's all…

599
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,080
I can do for you.

600
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,960
Don't say that.

601
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,720
Although you won't admit it,

602
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,680
I know

603
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,160
you've fought a lot for me.

604
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,560
To be honest,

605
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,000
I thought I was a loser

606
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,080
for a very long time.

607
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,600
But this year in Team Four,

608
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,120
I'm quite proud of myself.

609
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,000
Look.

610
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,400
I have my own desk.

611
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,200
I also learned a lot about investing.

612
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,400
I even completed a project with you guys
that everyone thought was impossible.

613
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,680
That's enough.

614
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,120
It's time to leave.

615
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,760
As an investor,

616
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,960
I think this is a project
with high returns.

617
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,160
If you're a good project,

618
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,040
I'm the best investor then.

619
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,720
Yes.

620
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,880
A discerning investor.

621
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,120
Very discerning, okay?

622
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,880
Did you write this?

623
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,720
The kids are the main players.

624
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,360
I'm just a wingman.

625
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,360
We still have a few hours
before submission to Risk Control.

626
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,760
Take a look quickly.

627
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,960
I can still make adjustments.

628
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,840
What is it? Is there a problem?

629
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,160
Kezhi.

630
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,120
Thank you.

631
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,680
Don't mention it.

632
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,880
I don't know how to repay you.

633
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,960
I trained my subordinates,

634
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,680
but I don't know what they're thinking.

635
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,360
I gave them my heart,

636
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,400
but they smacked it away.

637
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,400
How did I end up like this?

638
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,440
I wanted to give up,

639
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,920
but

640
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,080
looking at these pages,

641
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,120
I felt a bit unwilling.

642
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,880
By the way,

643
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,400
let me show you something fun.

644
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,960
What is it?

645
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,200
These kids.

646
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,240
Do they look familiar?

647
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,920
When we first joined the company,

648
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,120
we were like this too.

649
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,880
All we did was work and work overtime.

650
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,280
No matter what project it was,
we had to work until the end.

651
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,000
I didn't expect that

652
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,280
after hustling for so many years,

653
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,080
I'm starting to doubt

654
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,160
if it's worth it.

655
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,240
Mr. Qu.

656
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,720
Kezhi.

657
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,560
You guys go and get ready.

658
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,520
Okay.

659
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,560
I heard that Wenli is sick.

660
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,240
She's just overworked.
It's nothing serious.

661
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,640
She should take care of herself.

662
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,080
You don't look well either.

663
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Don't overwork yourself.

664
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,360
Okay.

665
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,480
Mr. Qu.

666
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,560
Sun Yiqiu is about to leave.

667
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,040
If it's possible,

668
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,320
I don't want him to leave
the company just like that.

669
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,200
Training a new hire costs a lot of money.

670
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,720
Mr. Qu.

671
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,840
Can you please do something?

672
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,000
I'm the one who makes the rules,

673
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,320
so I can't simply break my own rules.

674
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,840
But

675
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,680
the personnel arrangements for each team

676
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,640
are adjusted to accommodate
the different sizes of projects.

677
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,640
If Team Four has a project
that's big enough,

678
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,920
then…

679
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,760
Of course, it's too late
to talk about this.

680
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,120
Thank you for your hard work.

681
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,760
Keep it up.

682
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,000
