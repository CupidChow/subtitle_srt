1
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,680
<i>Kezhi, it's unnecessary to lie to you.</i>

2
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,520
<i>We're good friends.</i>

3
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,040
<i>Let me tell you this in private.</i>

4
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,840
<i>Rihuan BioTech is going public.</i>

5
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,240
<i>As a competitor,</i>

6
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,560
<i>no doubt it's a lie if we're not jealous.</i>

7
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,640
<i>But to be honest,</i>

8
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,880
<i>how much do we know about them</i>

9
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,080
<i>to stop them with an anonymous letter?</i>

10
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,000
<i>If we make things up,</i>

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,640
<i>we'll get caught right away.</i>

12
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,880
Yes, you have a point.

13
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,760
<i>If this anonymous letter</i>

14
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,480
<i>is as detailed as you mentioned,</i>

15
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,400
<i>it's most likely</i>

16
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,320
<i>that there's a problem within the company.</i>

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,920
<i>It's impossible for outsiders
to know so much.</i>

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,040
I understand.

19
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,280
<i>Let me tell you.</i>

20
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,039
<i>If it were anyone else,</i>

21
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,840
<i>I wouldn't have said so much.</i>

22
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,600
<i>But since it's you who asked,</i>

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,000
<i>I have to tell you everything.</i>

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,760
Mr. Lin.

25
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,680
What's going on?

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,320
It's nothing. Let's get off work.

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Get off work.

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,400
Are you leaving?

29
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,160
- What's wrong?
- Your signature.

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,920
Kezhi.

31
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,480
Well…

32
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,480
Just say it.

33
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,880
Are you and Libo

34
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,840
in some kind of trouble?

35
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,760
No.

36
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,600
Everyone says Team Four has a big project.

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,920
Look at the two of you.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,520
Do you think I can't tell?

39
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,680
It's not as complicated as you think.

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,120
The two of us can handle it.

41
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Just focus on your project with Mr. Sun.

42
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,520
Others may not know you well, but I do.

43
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,280
The more trouble you're in,

44
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,400
the more you keep it to yourself.

45
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,960
What do you take us for?

46
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,600
If you're in trouble,

47
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,600
just say the word.

48
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,120
We'll be there anytime.

49
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,960
There's no need.

50
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,440
Mr. Lin.

51
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,920
I'm done revising the proposal.

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,520
Should we deliver it to Risk Control?

53
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,520
We need to go out.

54
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Carry on with your work.

55
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,240
This proposal…

56
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,720
Okay, sure.

57
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,600
When will Rihuan send over the data?

58
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,000
They're still working on it.

59
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,040
But it's already late.

60
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,800
I've contacted Rihuan BioTech's founder.

61
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,240
Let's investigate it on the ground

62
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
and try our luck.

63
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,400
Well…

64
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,640
Fatty and Yiqiu

65
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,880
don't seem to be happy

66
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,440
that they can't join us.

67
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,320
For Mr. Qu's project,

68
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,840
Team Four is both the cannonballs

69
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,840
and cannon fodder.

70
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,920
If we succeed, everyone will be happy.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,800
If anything goes wrong,

72
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,680
we can still get away from it.

73
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,760
It's right not to involve them.

74
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,800
If you want to protect them,

75
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,440
we have to resolve this matter quickly.

76
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,480
I understand.

77
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
Are you still angry?

78
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,080
If Mr. Wu doesn't want us

79
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,920
to participate in that project,

80
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,360
then just leave it.

81
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,000
Anyway, our online education project

82
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,120
isn't finished yet.

83
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,680
Why am I mad?

84
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,080
I just don't think there's a need

85
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,400
for him to be so secretive.

86
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,920
We're a family.

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,200
What difficulties can't he tell us?

88
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Difficulties?

89
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,320
I know him too well.

90
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,920
He's the leader of Team Four.

91
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,160
He must want to take
responsibility for everything.

92
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,200
But…

93
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,000
Forget it.

94
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,640
Why am I telling you this?

95
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,800
Didn't I ask you to send this project
to Risk Control?

96
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
Go on.

97
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,960
Remember to make a copy.

98
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,560
Okay.

99
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,080
What are you doing?

100
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,480
Shengchao.

101
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,160
This is the data
I got from Morfan Apparel.

102
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,280
I want to see if there's anything useful.

103
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,880
Don't you have anything better to do?

104
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,440
The police have already made a case.

105
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,039
Why are you worried?

106
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,760
Submit it to the database.

107
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Don't be an eyesore.

108
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,280
VALUE: 43,000 YUAN

109
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,800
You're here too.

110
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,360
What's wrong? What's on your mind?

111
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,760
There must be something. Tell me.

112
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,120
Mr. Wu took on a new project,

113
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
but he won't let Mr. Lin
and me participate at all.

114
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,560
We weren't even allowed to ask.

115
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,960
I wonder why.

116
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,680
Usually,

117
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,480
if you're excluded from a project,
there are only two possibilities.

118
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,560
Either your boss doesn't trust you,

119
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
so they're keeping
important information from you,

120
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,960
or the project is too important

121
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,840
for you to be responsible for.

122
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,200
So they excluded you from the risk…

123
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,320
When did he get this project
you're talking about?

124
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,280
I think it was the day
I renewed my contract.

125
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,920
Then these two things

126
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,600
can't be related, right?

127
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
Related?

128
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm not from your team,
so I'm just guessing.

129
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,360
It's a bit strange that
your contract was suddenly renewed.

130
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,240
Someone who can hand over
an IPO project to Team Four

131
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,720
and manage to renew your contract.

132
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,960
There's only one particular person

133
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,760
in the whole company.

134
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,120
Boqian, do you bring cigarettes?

135
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,880
Yes.

136
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Let's smoke one.

137
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,160
Let's go.

138
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,600
Let's go.

139
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,880
Wait, I'll go too.

140
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Wait for me.

141
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,760
How is it?

142
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,040
Have you come up with anything?

143
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,040
No.

144
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
What about you?

145
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,760
Don't you know me?

146
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,800
How would I know what girls like?

147
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,720
It's not that.

148
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,400
Ever since Qianyi joined our team,

149
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,760
she has helped us a lot.

150
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,520
Now that she finally has her own project,

151
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,760
we have to do something
to help her celebrate.

152
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,520
Why don't we buy her a cake?

153
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,880
It's not her birthday. Why buy a cake?

154
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,680
Then what should we buy?

155
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,840
The three of us are men,
we can't buy her flowers.

156
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
What flowers?

157
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,280
Yes, what flowers?

158
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,160
Sir.

159
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,960
Is this the one you like?

160
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,960
You have good taste.

161
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,160
This is the trendiest one this year.

162
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,520
It must be for your girlfriend.

163
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,560
No.

164
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
It's not.

165
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,320
- Then, sir…
- It's…

166
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
For a colleague.

167
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,280
Yes, a colleague.

168
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,400
- Sir…
- Actually, it's just

169
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,960
a normal relationship.

170
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,360
People in the company give gifts.

171
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,840
They give…

172
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,800
What do you want to know?

173
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,480
Actually, I just want to know

174
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,320
what shoe size you need.

175
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,920
SHANGHAI RIHUAN BIOTECH
LIMITED COMPANY

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,920
Mr. Wu.

177
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,280
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Mr. Zhao.

178
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,960
I'm so happy to see you.

179
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,800
It seems that Mr. Qu

180
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,080
really took good care of us.

181
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,480
Both of you are
King Capital's capable investors.

182
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,880
I'm so happy that you're here.

183
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,240
We're just doing our job.

184
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,200
Mr. Zhao.

185
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,200
- About that anonymous letter…
- Anonymous letter?

186
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,120
What's all this about?

187
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,000
We've put in so much effort
and waited for so many years.

188
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,960
Now, we're about to see
the company going public.

189
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,440
If you ask me,
it's definitely just a made-up story.

190
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,920
It's extortion and blackmail.

191
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,200
But both of you need to know this.

192
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,960
If this incident affects the company's IPO

193
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,080
in a few days,

194
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,800
I won't be able to answer the board.

195
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,520
We understand.

196
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,640
I'm here today
to find out more about the situation.

197
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,520
I spoke to you on the phone earlier.

198
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,960
I'd like to talk to
the department managers of your company.

199
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,200
- If it's okay--
- It's okay.

200
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,240
It's very okay.

201
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,440
This is something
the company needs to deal with the most.

202
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,280
We'll fully cooperate
on what you want us to do.

203
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,920
Everyone in the company
is at your disposal today.

204
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,440
- Okay.
- Let's get started then.

205
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,440
What's this?

206
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,920
A company called Rihuan BioTech
sent these data over.

207
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,160
Is this it?

208
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,160
I think so.

209
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,160
What are you thinking?

210
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,360
Might be the same as you.

211
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,280
Don't think too much.

212
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,200
If we're going to do it, let's finish it.

213
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,080
I thought doing field research

214
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,600
would reduce the workload.

215
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,080
But look at us now.

216
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
The more we organize, the more there is.

217
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,520
Kezhi.

218
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,000
Do you have any leads?

219
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,640
Not at all.

220
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,480
The person who wrote the letter

221
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,080
isn't among the people
we've investigated today.

222
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,680
Today, we've questioned
all the heads of the major departments

223
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,800
in Rihuan BioTech.

224
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,840
If we have to question those
who are not in charge,

225
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,640
we're really running out of time.

226
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,920
That's not the problem.

227
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,040
I think…

228
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,280
the person who wrote the anonymous letter

229
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,160
isn't in Rihuan BioTech.

230
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,600
Not in Rihuan BioTech?

231
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,040
Didn't you say
you've ruled out competitors?

232
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,240
Why are you going back to that?

233
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,320
Call it a hunch.

234
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,000
I must have missed something.

235
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,200
If it isn't the competitor

236
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,920
and it doesn't seem like an insider,

237
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,400
who wrote this anonymous letter then?

238
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,040
I thought we could find some clues
before they did.

239
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,480
Looks like with just the two of us…

240
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,000
You're still too inexperienced.

241
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,079
Let's pack up.

242
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
If he finds out, it's over for us.

243
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,280
So what if he finds out?

244
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,839
I have a clear conscience anyway.

245
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,359
He can't fire me, can he?

246
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,760
What are you looking at?

247
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,000
What did you just say?

248
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,120
I said, "What are you looking at?"

249
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,440
Before that.

250
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,520
Mr. Wu can't fire me, can he?

251
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,520
What's this?

252
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,040
I don't know.

253
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,520
I think it's for you.

254
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,520
If there's nothing else,

255
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,680
you can leave first.

256
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,120
Okay.

257
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
We'll get going then.

258
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,680
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

259
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,840
They're behaving well, aren't they?

260
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,880
We have no time for them now.

261
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,040
Rihuan BioTech sent over the materials.

262
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,960
Libo.

263
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,040
Where are they?

264
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,000
They left a note.

265
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,200
They said they're doing
due diligence or something.

266
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,240
That's good.

267
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,800
We don't have to avoid them anymore.

268
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,960
I thought about it last night.

269
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,480
Aside from our competitors
and people inside the company,

270
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,200
there's a blind spot we haven't checked.

271
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,680
Where is it?

272
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,480
Contact Rihuan BioTech for me.

273
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,480
Get me the list

274
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,160
of their former employees from last year.

275
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
That's right.

276
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,600
They know the details of the project,

277
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,200
but they're not in Rihuan BioTech.

278
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,360
This could be the people
who recently left the company.

279
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,720
I'll call them now.

280
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,040
Hello?

281
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,480
I'm Ding Libo from King Capital.

282
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,720
Hello.

283
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,960
Here's the thing.

284
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,720
I need to see the list of people
who left in the past year.

285
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,120
What?

286
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,640
Okay.

287
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,040
Okay, that's all.

288
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,720
- That's all. Bye.
- What's wrong?

289
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,640
They said the list of people who quit

290
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,760
was taken by the people
from our company last night.

291
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,200
I've read the report you sent me.

292
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,600
There are a few minor issues.

293
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,080
I made some comments.

294
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,680
Check your email when you have time.

295
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Yes.

296
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,000
Let's communicate as soon as possible
to speed up the project.

297
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,320
Okay, that's all.

298
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,360
Bye.

299
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,680
Qianyi.

300
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,320
- You scared me.
- Good morning.

301
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,840
Good morning.

302
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,640
What's wrong? Are you looking for me?

303
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,720
It's nothing.

304
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,240
I just came to say hi.

305
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,240
What's wrong?
Did I step on something dirty?

306
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,120
No.

307
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm busy over there.

308
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,920
I'll get going.

309
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,040
Where did you two go?

310
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,280
We went to…

311
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,160
We went to Rihuan BioTech.

312
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,480
Who told you to do that?

313
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,240
Look, you're being hasty again.

314
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,880
- Mr. Wu…
- Shut up.

315
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,120
Are you the ringleader?

316
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,640
Yes.

317
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,480
Good job.

318
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,520
You won't even listen to me.

319
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,920
Here is the list of people
who quit last year.

320
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
We found it.

321
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,920
From the list of people
who were submitted,

322
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,920
it's almost certain the person most likely

323
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,840
to be involved in this

324
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,240
is a technical director
who was fired by them six months ago.

325
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,880
Given his rank
and his knowledge of technical details,

326
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,800
he's also the most likely writer
of the anonymous letter.

327
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,800
Get to the point.

328
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,680
We asked him out.

329
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,720
Mr. Lin.

330
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,880
This is…

331
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,240
Dr. Li, right?

332
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,160
Nice to meet you.

333
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,280
Hello.

334
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,880
You must be Mr. Lin
the investor who contacted me yesterday.

335
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,800
Please have a seat.

336
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,400
I've heard a lot about you.

337
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,680
Nice to meet you.

338
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,760
I didn't expect my project
to have investors

339
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,200
in just a few days.

340
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,080
By the way,

341
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,280
this is an explanation of the project.

342
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,160
This is my personal resume.

343
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,360
This cell sample collector
is my latest project.

344
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,160
It's patented in China and the US.

345
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,920
It has a great future in the field
of molecular diagnostics.

346
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,880
Excuse me, Dr. Li.

347
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,920
You used to be

348
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,840
the technical director
at Rihuan Biotech, right?

349
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,320
Yes.

350
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,600
From what we know,

351
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,240
Rihuan BioTech is the leading company
in the industry.

352
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,000
You're already the technical director
of Rihuan BioTech.

353
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,640
Why did you suddenly decide to leave
and start your own business?

354
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,000
Let's just say it's my personal opinion.

355
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,800
Based on your resume,

356
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,360
your major area of research

357
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,920
has always been gene testing.

358
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,440
And when you were at Rihuan BioTech,

359
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,080
you were mainly
in charge of these products.

360
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,040
Why did you start your own business

361
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,480
and decide to specialize
in collecting specimens?

362
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,880
Don't you think

363
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,520
it's a waste of your talent?

364
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,760
It depends on the person.

365
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,720
Is that important?

366
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,280
As an investor,

367
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,280
we want to be clear about
the founder's attitude

368
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,320
towards the project.

369
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,720
Actually,

370
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
I was sabotaged by Rihuan BioTech.

371
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,640
What are you doing? Keep going.

372
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,880
I'm sorry, Mr. Wu.

373
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,040
What I've just shared,

374
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,480
I'm giving it to you for the sake

375
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
of our years of friendship as colleagues.

376
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,760
It's free.

377
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,360
After all,

378
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,480
this project
has nothing to do with us anyway.

379
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,600
Right, Mr. Sun?

380
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,560
What do you mean?

381
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,600
Let both of us be part of it

382
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,640
and the truth will be revealed soon.

383
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,920
Keep playing.

384
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,040
<i>When I resigned,</i>

385
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,800
Rihuan BioTech promised
to terminate my non-compete agreement.

386
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,160
I didn't know they were just all talk.

387
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,520
When I joined my new company,

388
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,880
they brought me the contract

389
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,880
and threatened me.

390
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,040
They said I can't develop
similar products for others.

391
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,320
They forced me to lose my job.

392
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,440
Genetic testing technology
is my forte, right?

393
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,760
If they do that,

394
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,800
I won't be able to do that
for the next five years.

395
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,240
I can't go to any company on the market.

396
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,360
What should I do then?

397
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,680
I can only go to a niche market

398
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,960
and start my own business.

399
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,880
If that's the case,

400
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,360
Rihuan BioTech sure isn't ethical.

401
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,800
They are worse than that.

402
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,920
They're a bunch of people who'd turn
their backs on righteousness for profit.

403
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,320
That's why you wrote an anonymous letter

404
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,160
when they were about to go public,

405
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,320
saying there was a problem
with their new product.

406
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,960
That they lied to consumers.

407
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,760
Hoping that the CSRC
would deny them from going public?

408
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,360
Who are you people?

409
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,720
Let me reintroduce myself.

410
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,960
Lin Yuming from King Capital.

411
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,760
King Capital?

412
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,080
You're in cahoots with Rihuan BioTech.

413
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,360
- Dr. Li.
- You're mistaken.

414
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,760
Let's talk about this.

415
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,200
Have a seat. Let's talk.

416
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,920
You had a fallout
with your previous company.

417
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,240
And because of them, you lost your job.

418
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,080
I understand
your discontent with Rihuan BioTech.

419
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,680
But don't you think

420
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,680
writing an anonymous letter

421
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,320
is a bit childish?

422
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,320
Or what?

423
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,480
What are you going to do?

424
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,200
Retract the anonymous letter.

425
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,560
In ten days,

426
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,520
when Rihuan BioTech passed the evaluation,

427
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,880
I guarantee they'll withdraw
your non-compete agreement.

428
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,560
What if I don't agree?

429
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,800
Rihuan BioTech can sue you

430
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,520
for slandering at any time.

431
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,920
You don't want a lawsuit, do you?

432
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,920
If they think I'm guilty of slander,

433
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,160
go ahead and sue me.

434
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,480
We can argue this in court.

435
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,440
We don't know who will win yet.

436
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,760
No.

437
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,120
Dr. Li, since we're here,

438
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,440
we can negotiate any terms you want.

439
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,920
Do you think you have the right
to negotiate with me?

440
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,560
You're a bunch of liars!

441
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,800
Why is he so impatient?

442
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,840
<i>End of the story,</i>

443
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,040
you have ruined the conversation.

444
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,000
That's not true.

445
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,600
At least we found this person, right?

446
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,520
Well, yes.

447
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,680
I shouldn't have looked
at the documents and meddled.

448
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,520
It's our fault.

449
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,280
But it's such an important clue,

450
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,680
it should be enough to make up for that.

451
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,160
Kezhi.

452
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,760
You can't disown our effort.

453
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,240
We really want
to work on this project with you.

454
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,200
Here we go,
Mr. Wu has already silently agreed.

455
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,520
Okay, this…

456
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,120
That's enough. Stop fighting it.

457
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,720
Let's do a trust high-five.

458
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,720
That's enough.

459
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,960
All right?

460
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,240
I know.

461
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
You're afraid
that this is going to be risky.

462
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,200
You don't want to drag us down.

463
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,840
But look.

464
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,440
Mr. Sun and I are here.

465
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,080
Isn't this settled just like that?

466
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,720
I thought we'd have to work together
as Team Four.

467
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,320
- Keep going.
- Fine.

468
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,960
Mr. Sun.

469
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,520
Do you really understand
what this choice means?

470
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,000
I do.

471
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,400
But to me,

472
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,960
being able to work with you
is the most important thing.

473
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,800
Looks like I can't get rid of both of you.

474
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,040
I'm so heavy.

475
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,640
How can you get rid of me, right?

476
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Mr. Su.

477
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,520
How's the liquidation process
of Morfan Apparel going?

478
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,840
It's going well as usual. Why?

479
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,320
Well.

480
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,040
Can you speed it up a bit?

481
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,560
If we keep delaying it,

482
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,080
it won't be fair to Morfan's workers.

483
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,640
Regarding this matter,

484
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,640
Shengchao is handling it.

485
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,520
You don't have to worry about it.

486
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,360
I know.

487
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,640
Good morning.

488
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,640
- Mr. Su.
- Shengchao, you're here.

489
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,760
What are you talking about?

490
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,720
Nothing.

491
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,240
Nothing.

492
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,720
What's wrong?

493
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,360
Mr. Su.

494
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,720
Well, I need your opinion.

495
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,640
Between these two, which is better?

496
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,520
Maserati of course.

497
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,560
- Getting a new car?
- No.

498
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,600
Did you win the lottery?

499
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,000
No, I got lucky
with two of the shares I bought.

500
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,720
You know cars. Please advise.

501
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,560
What do you think?

502
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,920
It's a nice car.

503
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Close the door.

504
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,040
Close the door.

505
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,920
No.

506
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,160
What's wrong with you?
You're so mysterious.

507
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,680
Are you going to tell?

508
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,680
If not, I'm leaving.

509
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,920
Wait.

510
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
You…

511
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,560
Is your superpower really accurate?

512
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,200
What superpower?

513
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,480
It's…

514
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,640
You mean looking at clothes?

515
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,800
Of course.

516
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,160
I'm Shanghai's Ralph Lauren.

517
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,600
What's wrong with you?

518
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,600
Do me a favor.

519
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,240
No way.

520
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,800
I didn't know you had such bad intentions.

521
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,040
I'll tell you about this.

522
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,200
Don't let it slip.

523
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,360
It's such big news.

524
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,880
Of course I have to tell Yiqiu.

525
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,080
I'm just kidding.

526
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,000
How can I tell him, right?

527
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,760
It's just a shoe size.

528
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,280
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

529
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,440
I'll know right away
when I see her next time.

530
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,040
But Sicong,

531
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,240
I'm not doing this for free.

532
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,920
What do you want?

533
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,360
I want to investigate Yin Shengchao.

534
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,800
You have to help me.

535
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,880
I already did.

536
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,000
When Dr. Li was at Rihuan BioTech,

537
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,440
he was working on
the latest genetic testing project.

538
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,880
But the project still didn't take shape
even after three years.

539
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,880
But the weirdest thing is,

540
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,840
he was fired three months ago,

541
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,680
and this product
is currently on the market.

542
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,080
And according to the report,

543
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,360
this new product
made Rihuan BioTech a huge profit.

544
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,600
It's now the main source
of the company's profits.

545
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,360
It's a project that hasn't made
a breakthrough in three years.

546
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,640
The person in charge
just left three months ago.

547
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,000
Yet it became a big success.

548
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,440
Isn't that bizarre?

549
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,800
Unless Dr. Li's successor is a genius.

550
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,240
That's not the case.

551
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,840
His successor is
the assistant he had for three years.

552
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,480
And he's the only one
in the entire R&D team.

553
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
That means…

554
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,240
Kezhi.

555
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,080
Why don't we just
return this project to the company?

556
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,200
Return it to the company?

557
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,640
We've already found out
who wrote this anonymous letter.

558
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,120
Once we solve the last problem, we'll win.

559
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,239
How can we return the project now?

560
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,199
But there's obviously a problem with it.

561
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,040
Which project of ours
doesn't have problems?

562
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,679
But this project has a huge risk factor.

563
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,639
Stop arguing.

564
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,600
Let me think about it.

565
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,679
You're all here.

566
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,159
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li.

567
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,120
Kezhi.

568
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,080
How's the investigation
on Rihuan BioTech going?

569
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,080
We're still working on it.

570
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,719
Okay.

571
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,239
Okay, I'll let you get back to work.

572
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,239
Kezhi, Mr. Qu wants me to tell you

573
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,480
to go see him.

574
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,120
Kezhi,

575
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,040
is there any progress
on the Rihuan BioTech's project?

576
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,040
It's too early to say
to say there's progress.

577
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,680
We still need time to investigate.

578
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,600
You've found the culprit
of the anonymous letter, haven't you?

579
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,160
Of course.

580
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,280
If you want to investigate further,

581
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,440
that's up to you.

582
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,960
But you have to get it done
before time runs out.

583
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,320
No matter what you do,

584
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,800
the company won't interfere.

585
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,400
Are you saying

586
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,880
do whatever it takes?

587
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,280
Kezhi.

588
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,040
I don't understand what you're saying.

589
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,280
It's just a normal business dispute.

590
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,280
What is it that you have to do
to be considered as

591
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,560
doing whatever it takes?

592
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,160
Besides, the company trusts you.

593
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,080
You should handle it.

594
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
You're free to do whatever you want.

595
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,360
I don't think
I need to answer for you, right?

596
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,680
Your decision

597
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,000
is the company's decision.

598
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,320
It's all up to you.

599
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,040
I'll still say the same thing.

600
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,360
I don't care about the process.

601
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,280
I just want the result.

602
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,880
Understood.

603
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
Get back to work.

604
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,600
I've been a bit busy lately.

605
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,120
I didn't have time to follow up with you.

606
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,480
You're in Kezhi's big project too, right?

607
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,480
Yes.

608
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,680
An IPO is a big deal.

609
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,200
The rewards are high and so are the risks.

610
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,080
If anything goes wrong,

611
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,880
aren't you afraid of
taking the blame with Kezhi?

612
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,520
I'm not afraid.

613
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,080
Actually, I was able to stay

614
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,520
because of everyone's help.

615
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,800
If I can't

616
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,760
shoulder it with them now,

617
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,640
then what's the point of me staying?

618
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,320
You didn't let Kezhi's effort down

619
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,480
when Kezhi asked for this project
from Mr. Qu

620
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,400
if you can think like this.

621
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,360
But on the other hand,

622
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,960
since he has already made this choice,

623
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,680
he has no other options but to succeed
in the Rihuan BioTech project.

624
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,240
We'll do our best.

625
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,120
I'm not worried about that.

626
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,200
It's just my imagination.

627
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,520
I'm thinking if Rihuan BioTech

628
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,200
really has a problem,

629
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,760
what would Kezhi do?

630
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,120
Don't think too much.

631
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,920
I was just saying.

632
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,440
There's nothing else. You can go.

633
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,200
Yiqiu.

634
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,320
I heard you used to play Go.

635
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,720
Yes.

636
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,360
I enjoy playing Go too.

637
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,960
Let's play sometime.

638
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,680
Sure.

639
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,400
Go ahead.

640
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,680
Hao Shuai.

641
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,720
Perfect timing.

642
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,520
Perfect timing?

643
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,360
What is it?

644
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,440
Nothing.

645
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,240
That thing I asked you to do.

646
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,320
How did it go?

647
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,120
Hao Shuai, listen to me.

648
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
This is an invasion of privacy.

649
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,840
It's too risky.

650
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,360
If the bosses find out…

651
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,680
I saw Qianyi just now.

652
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,680
Don't you want to know her shoe size?

653
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,960
Here, I'll tell you.

654
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,400
What about what I want?

655
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,760
Mr. Jiang.

656
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,200
What do you want?

657
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,480
I don't want anything.

658
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,920
I was just joking with him.

659
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,720
Really?

660
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,680
Yes.

661
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,640
It worked.

662
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,600
Look at your phone.

663
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,280
Did you skip the password?

664
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,200
That's great.

665
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,920
How long did it take?

666
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,200
It took five minutes.

667
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,520
Five minutes?

668
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,640
That's too long.

669
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,560
That's the fastest I can go.

670
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,760
I'll think of something.

671
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,480
Hao Shuai.

672
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,120
Have you made up your mind?

673
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,440
Are you really going to hack
Yin Shengchao's phone?

674
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,440
Be prepared.

675
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,640
I'll call you anytime.

676
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,760
Kezhi.

677
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,800
What does Mr. Qu mean?

678
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,560
Let's not talk about what he means.

679
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,280
What do you think?

680
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,080
There's something off
about Rihuan BioTech.

681
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,000
- I suggest we investigate it.
- I object.

682
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,800
Dr. Li doesn't have any solid evidence.

683
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,400
We should get him
out of the picture first.

684
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,640
Isn't that what he wants

685
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,480
if we start to investigate Rihuan BioTech?

686
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,600
That would lead us to the wrong direction.

687
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,520
Rihuan BioTech released a new product
three months after they fired Dr. Li

688
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,800
It even became a big hit.

689
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,920
It doesn't make sense.

690
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,760
Is that what we need
to be concerned about?

691
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,680
If we want Dr. Li
to withdraw the anonymous letter,

692
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,200
we need to give him a reason
that he can accept.

693
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,240
We just need to give
his name to Rihuan BioTech.

694
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,160
Whether it's compensation

695
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,440
or a cut of the sales,

696
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,600
Rihuan BioTech has many ways
to make him accept it.

697
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,400
If he wanted money,

698
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,640
he would have negotiated

699
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,040
when Mr. Sun and I got to him.

700
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,840
But what happened, Mr. Ding?

701
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,080
Can you explain that?

702
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,400
Mr. Sun, what do you think?

703
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,840
<i>I'm thinking if Rihuan BioTech</i>

704
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,240
<i>really has a problem,</i>

705
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,040
<i>what would Kezhi do?</i>

706
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,320
We're asking you a question.

707
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,160
I don't know.

708
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,960
You know what?

709
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,040
I think it's necessary
to get to the bottom of this.

710
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,200
You're the boss. It's your call.

711
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,480
So what do we do next?

712
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,200
I need to meet with Dr. Li.

713
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,240
