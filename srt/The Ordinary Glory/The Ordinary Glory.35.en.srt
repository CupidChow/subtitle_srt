1
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
Mr. Wu.

2
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,360
I'd like to take a leave.

3
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,360
I'm meeting with a founder
to discuss the project.

4
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,680
Mr. Wu.

5
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,160
Okay, go ahead.

6
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,960
He has his own work to do now.

7
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,480
Once the Risk Control Center
approves his project,

8
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,920
we'll have to get him to treat us.

9
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,080
Get back to work.

10
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,400
That's all for today.

11
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,480
Regarding the details of the product,

12
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,640
I'll be more prepared next time.

13
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,680
Let's talk again.

14
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,040
Okay.

15
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,800
I'm looking forward
to our next meeting too.

16
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,080
I didn't expect this, Yiqiu.

17
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,560
Apart from being good at playing Go,

18
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,160
you also have
a good aptitude as an investor.

19
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,200
Is that so?

20
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,840
Since I started my business,

21
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,560
I've met all kinds of investors.

22
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,360
Compared to them,

23
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,560
you're very young.

24
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,400
In terms of experience,
you definitely lack some.

25
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,720
But on you,

26
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,520
there are a lot of outstanding qualities.

27
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,160
I can feel that your passion
for the project is real.

28
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,200
I hope the day we officially
work together will come soon.

29
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,800
I'm sure it will.

30
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,160
Mom, I want that balloon.

31
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,200
Can we buy it tomorrow?

32
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,480
No, let's buy it today.

33
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,240
Why are you so disobedient?

34
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,480
I want it.

35
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,920
It's inconvenient for me to have them.

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,120
Can I give them to you?

37
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,360
Say thank you.

38
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,120
Thank you.

39
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,840
Be good from now on.

40
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,960
Sir.

41
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,120
This is for you.

42
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,320
Thank you.

43
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,320
Mr. Sun is quite busy.

44
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,680
Hello, this is Team Four.

45
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,880
Are you looking for Sun Yiqiu?

46
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,800
He's not here.

47
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,240
Who are you?

48
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,800
Risk Control.

49
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,040
Yiqiu's project is approved?

50
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,520
Okay.

51
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,080
I'll send him over to get it
when he gets back.

52
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Thank you.

53
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,200
Yiqiu's project has been approved.

54
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,960
What should we have for dinner?

55
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,200
Mr. Sun, I just got a call.

56
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,200
Mr. Sun!

57
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,960
What is it?

58
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,560
Fill up the gas tank for me.

59
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,280
Don't you know
I have a business trip tomorrow?

60
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,800
Go!

61
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,400
Kezhi.

62
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,520
What's going on?

63
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,920
Go to Risk Management

64
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,280
and get his report back.

65
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,200
Why should I?

66
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,880
What is the company doing?

67
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,760
Is this a joke?

68
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,280
Fatty, keep it down.

69
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,640
How can I?

70
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,080
Kezhi, do you have a plan?

71
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,840
What plan? Let's go together.

72
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,280
We'll find Risk Control and HR
and talk to them face-to-face.

73
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,720
Worst case, I'll go to Mr. Qu.

74
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,040
Let's go now.

75
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,160
Let's go.

76
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,600
Okay.

77
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,320
I'll go by myself.

78
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,800
Fatty!

79
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,840
Keep this safe.

80
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,440
Don't let Yiqiu know for now.

81
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,480
I'll think of something.

82
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,280
Kezhi.

83
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,600
What is it?

84
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,520
Sit down.

85
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,440
Mr. Li.

86
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,480
I want to make a deal with you.

87
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,240
A deal?

88
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,600
What deal?

89
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,000
If you help me keep Yiqiu,

90
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,840
Team Four will do anything.

91
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Kezhi.

92
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,240
Look at our department.

93
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,640
Whether it's the project

94
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,160
or the sales performance,

95
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,400
they're all acceptable.

96
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,600
I can't think of anything special

97
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,120
that requires you to help him.

98
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,400
Mr. Li, you might not know this.

99
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,720
In the past year,

100
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,000
I watched Yiqiu grow with my own eyes.

101
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,920
He has improved a lot.

102
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,200
He's earnest about his work.

103
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,560
He's a fast learner too.

104
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,920
This kid.

105
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,240
He didn't know how to do anything.

106
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,240
He's gritted his teeth
and made it this far.

107
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
It hasn't been easy.

108
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
Sun Yiqiu

109
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
shouldn't leave.

110
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,040
Kezhi.

111
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,440
Yiqiu.

112
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,320
He's very capable.

113
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,120
But let's be fair.

114
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,920
The rookies who stayed with Yiqiu

115
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
aren't bad either.

116
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,480
But compared to them,

117
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,240
Yiqiu's educational background
is pitifully low.

118
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,560
So HR gave him a one-year contract.

119
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,920
It's reasonable.

120
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,840
- Mr. Li--
- Kezhi.

121
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,960
From the bottom of my heart,

122
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,760
I really want to help him.

123
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,640
But you have to put yourself in my shoes.

124
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,880
You said Yiqiu is new.

125
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,800
I'm actually newer than him.

126
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,400
I've only been here for a few days.

127
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,840
My authority and persuasion

128
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,320
are nothing in the company.

129
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,680
Come to think of it,

130
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,440
you're the company's senior.

131
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,080
Tell me.

132
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,680
Since the opening of King Capital,

133
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,040
have there been
any high school graduates who stayed?

134
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
If there is,

135
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,880
even if it's just one,

136
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,920
I'll go and ask Mr. Qu to help now.

137
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,000
Or should I say,

138
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,680
if there's no one,

139
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,000
Kezhi,

140
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,560
you can't make it too hard for me.

141
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,640
Qianyi.

142
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,040
Thank you for reminding me yesterday.

143
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,200
I used my secret recipe
and half of the night

144
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,200
to wash my shirt clean.

145
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,000
Look, it's as good as new.

146
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,640
Are you okay?

147
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,200
Qianyi.

148
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,840
Ms. Pan.

149
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,960
Can you stop passing the buck to me?

150
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,360
What's the point?

151
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,040
No, that's HR's business.

152
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,840
Why can't the Risk Control Center
just pass over the project first?

153
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,800
I know about the company policy.

154
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,200
I know it's a company policy.

155
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,800
But it's unreasonable.

156
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,160
No projects, no contract renewal.

157
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
No contract, no project.
Tell me. What kind of stupid rule is that?

158
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,080
What's wrong with my attitude?

159
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,840
What does my attitude
have to do with this?

160
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,960
If I change my attitude, will you say yes?

161
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,480
Okay, I'll change it.

162
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,640
Ms. Pan, I'm begging you.

163
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Please, do me a favor.

164
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,520
Is this okay? Are you happy now?

165
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,760
Ms. Pan.

166
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,320
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

167
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,840
I was too agitated just now.

168
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Yes.

169
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,920
It's all my fault.

170
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,560
I sincerely apologize.

171
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
You know my temper.

172
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,080
Right?

173
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,400
How about this, Ms. Pan?

174
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,920
I'll make an appointment tonight.

175
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,760
I'll treat you to dinner.

176
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,320
I'll apologize to you.

177
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,520
Let's invite Ms. Gao from HR too

178
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,240
and talk about this nicely.

179
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,880
Okay, say no more.

180
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,520
What are you doing?

181
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,400
What are we having for dinner?

182
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,440
Hot pot again? I can't.

183
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,440
Hot pot upset my stomach
for the past two days.

184
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,760
I feel terrible.

185
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,800
- What's wrong with you?
- No, Shengchao.

186
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,080
It's fine. We have a new kid.

187
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,520
He doesn't know manners.
Let's keep talking. Just ignore him.

188
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,080
Sure.

189
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,520
Shengchao.

190
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,480
I have something to tell you.

191
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,120
Wait over there.

192
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,400
Okay, I'll listen to you.

193
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,760
What is it?

194
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,560
It's about Morfan Apparel
which Mr. Su asked about today.

195
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,200
I looked into it.

196
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,240
There's a problem with their report.

197
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,400
Several major distributors have terminated
their collaboration with them.

198
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,520
And the factory…

199
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,320
Go on.

200
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,640
Go on. I'm listening, Mr. Hao.

201
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,440
Shengchao.

202
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,600
I'm just being realistic.

203
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,920
I didn't mean anything by it.

204
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,880
Then shut up.

205
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,920
Do you know what's going on
in the business or do I?

206
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,720
You do.

207
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,000
Isn't that the end of it?

208
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,480
Just do your job.

209
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,800
Wait.

210
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,680
Remember two things.

211
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
You're finding trouble
in minding other's business.

212
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,360
Mind your own business
so that you're safe from trouble.

213
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,320
Also, don't interrupt me

214
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,520
when I'm on the phone.

215
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,920
MORFAN APPAREL'S BOSS

216
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,560
<i>Hello, the number you dialed is busy.</i>

217
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,000
What's this?

218
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,400
<i>The number you dialed is unavailable.</i>

219
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,800
<i>Hello, the number you dialed…</i>

220
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,200
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

221
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,360
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,800
I embarrassed myself just now.

223
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,160
I'm no better.

224
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,320
Just bear with it.

225
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,200
What did you say?

226
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,359
Look at you.

227
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,760
It's obvious.

228
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,200
It's Mr. Ma again, isn't it?

229
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,839
Bear with it.

230
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,839
No decision made on impulse

231
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,000
will turn out well.

232
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,920
I'm a great example.

233
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,000
I know you're not
in a good mood right now.

234
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,680
You must want to fight back,

235
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,480
be transferred,

236
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,960
or even resign.

237
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,040
But I have to advise you.

238
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,040
Don't do that yet.

239
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,600
Why?

240
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,800
I've known Ma Jianguo for a long time.

241
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,200
Although he's hot-tempered, petty,

242
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,840
and always putting on airs, he…

243
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,080
But…

244
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,360
I can't think of anything good about him.

245
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,520
But anyway,

246
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,800
he's now the executive vice president
of King Capital.

247
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,760
It proves that he's not a fool.

248
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,880
He's bullying and tormenting you.

249
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,880
From an investor's perspective,

250
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,680
he's weighing the pros and cons.

251
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,520
He thinks there's no need
to take any risks.

252
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,160
That's why he's doing this.

253
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,440
That's why

254
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,040
you need to learn to wait.

255
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,600
Learn to be patient.

256
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,440
When your wings grow a little bigger,

257
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,840
when you're useful to him,

258
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,200
when that time comes,

259
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,760
no matter how reluctant he is,

260
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,080
he won't make things difficult for you.

261
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,880
I understand.

262
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Thank you for telling me this.

263
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,960
I dare to advise you

264
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,600
because you still have to wait.

265
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,800
You still have time.

266
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,800
Unlike Sun Yiqiu.

267
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,520
Compared to him,

268
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,760
you're much luckier.

269
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,600
Yiqiu…

270
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,520
He…

271
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,560
He might have

272
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,160
to leave the company
because his contract is up.

273
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,680
Why?

274
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,840
Why?

275
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,080
I want to know why too.

276
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,960
All right, that's enough.

277
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,600
I'm going back. Will you be okay alone?

278
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,960
Let's pretend nothing happened today.

279
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,680
We didn't see each other.

280
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,600
Okay.

281
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,320
Where's Mr. Wu?

282
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,200
Mr. Wu?

283
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,040
He's not here.

284
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,000
His tank is full.

285
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,520
Why do I have to fill it up?

286
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,000
It's Mr. Wu.

287
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,520
Obsessive-compulsive.

288
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,360
Mr. Ding, Mr. Lin.

289
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,360
It's almost noon.

290
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,000
Do you want to have lunch?

291
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,320
I'm not hungry.

292
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,880
I already ate.

293
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,800
I'm going to the supermarket.
Do you want anything?

294
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,800
No.

295
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,200
No.

296
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,560
Mr. Ding.

297
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,560
Let's go inside.

298
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,800
That's enough.

299
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,360
We're not thieves.

300
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,880
I feel worse than a thief.

301
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,680
We're just afraid of running into Mr. Sun.

302
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,240
So be it.

303
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,880
How long do you think you can hide it?

304
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,760
I hope Mr. Wu
will come up with a solution soon.

305
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,800
I don't think

306
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,760
this is something Kezhi can handle.

307
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,680
Okay.

308
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
When Mr. Sun finds out, I'll tell him.

309
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,320
At worst, he can just leave.

310
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,560
With his determination,

311
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,440
which company can't he make it in?

312
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,080
You're taking this too lightly.

313
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,320
How is it simple?

314
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,360
If it's a problem that can be solved
by changing companies,

315
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,360
do you think Kezhi would be so anxious?

316
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,360
Just like what you just said,

317
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,000
Kezhi can do it.

318
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,560
You can do it. I can do it.

319
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,040
Even the kids in Yiqiu's batch can do it.

320
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,480
But only Yiqiu can't.

321
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,560
Why?

322
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,000
He has no educational background.

323
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,040
Isn't investing more important
than a diploma?

324
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
That's right.

325
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,760
Having knowledge is more important
than a diploma.

326
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,120
But think about it.

327
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,840
Regardless of how many HR departments
there are,

328
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,480
after seeing Yiqiu's resume,

329
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,320
will you give him a chance to interview?

330
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,760
Even if there is,

331
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,280
let's not talk about Yiqiu.

332
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,760
If it were you,
in an interview of three to five minutes,

333
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,680
how can you prove to others
that you really know how to invest?

334
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,080
There are three types of people
who have left the company over the years.

335
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,360
The first type.

336
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,240
People like Mr. Li.

337
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,360
Those with success and fame.
Projects are waiting for them.

338
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,880
If someone like him quits,
he'll either move up the ladder

339
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,600
or go into retirement.

340
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,960
The second type. Mr. Wang.

341
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,240
Although he encountered
some setbacks at work,

342
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,400
it didn't stop him from finding a way out.

343
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,480
He still has the connections
and resources he used to have.

344
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,440
Even if he moves to another company,
he can still continue his career.

345
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,800
The third type

346
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,760
is like Yiqiu.

347
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,640
He left without completing the project.

348
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,560
His resume is empty.

349
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,600
In the end,

350
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,720
it was all for nothing.

351
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,480
Even he can't explain clearly

352
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,080
how he gained work experience
during his year at King Capital.

353
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,080
Think about it.

354
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,560
If it were you,

355
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,320
you were the HR of a company.

356
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,960
Would you want someone like this?

357
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,120
<i>The number you dialed is unavailable.</i>

358
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,720
What's going on?

359
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,800
- Shengchao.
- Hold on. I'm busy.

360
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,360
- Someone's looking for you.
- Who is it?

361
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,360
- Morfan Apparel.
- Yin Shengchao.

362
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,840
- Yin Shengchao.
- Come out.

363
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,360
- Yin Shengchao.
- Come out.

364
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,360
- Yin Shengchao, come out.
- Yin Shengchao.

365
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
Are you Yin Shengchao?

366
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,600
The factory has long stopped working.

367
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,920
Half a year's worth of goods
are stored in the warehouse.

368
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,080
No one wants them.

369
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,600
We haven't seen a cent of our wages.

370
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,360
I sympathize and understand

371
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,120
your encounters and feelings.

372
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,560
I'll briefly explain the situation too.

373
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,800
The company, Morfan Apparel,

374
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,120
was indeed invested by King Capital.

375
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,120
That's true.

376
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,760
But we really didn't know

377
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,480
that Mr. Zhou ran away.

378
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,920
And we're just investors.

379
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,080
If they don't pay you,

380
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,120
it's out of our hands.

381
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,280
If it's just unpaid wages,

382
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,680
we wouldn't be like this.

383
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,480
Mr. Zhou

384
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,160
doesn't just owe us wages.

385
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,720
He owes us shares too.

386
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,120
- That's right.
- That's right.

387
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,480
Shares? What shares?

388
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,680
When the factory was built,

389
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,800
Mr. Zhou encouraged us
to become shareholders.

390
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,520
He said we'd get 10% interest a year.

391
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,560
We basically spent all our savings

392
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,120
on the factory's shares.

393
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,720
Do you know anything about this?

394
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,440
No, I don't.

395
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,480
When we first bought the shares,

396
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,480
he said it was
to avoid taxes or something.

397
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,360
He wanted all of our shares
to be in his name.

398
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,360
What was it again?

399
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,680
Nominee shareholder.

400
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,720
Yes.

401
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,920
There's a saying like that.
But that bastard is on the run.

402
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,240
What are we supposed to do now?

403
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,880
Do whatever you should.

404
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,280
We'll go to the police and courts
and sue whoever we want.

405
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
Don't tell me
you handed over all your savings

406
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,400
without a proper agreement.

407
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,120
Let me get this straight.

408
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,320
You're legally illiterate.

409
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,760
No one can deny it.

410
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
We're also the victims.

411
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,320
Yin Shengchao.

412
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,960
You don't have to be so sarcastic.

413
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,400
We're not here

414
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,840
to collect debts from your company today.

415
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,280
We're here for an explanation.

416
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,160
What explanation?

417
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,560
Okay, let me ask you.

418
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,120
In the contract between King Capital

419
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,000
and Morfan Apparel,

420
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,800
they entrusted the management to you.

421
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,840
Are you the person in charge?

422
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,440
So what if I am?

423
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,680
Okay.

424
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,000
It's not the first time
the company has been in trouble.

425
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,800
Even ordinary workers like us can see it.

426
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,200
But as the person in charge,
what have you done?

427
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,800
It has been months.

428
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,760
We've called, written,
and complained to you many times.

429
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,440
Have you replied to any of them?

430
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
What about this?

431
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,840
Why didn't you tell me?

432
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,240
Mr. Su.

433
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,280
I thought it was just
a few people causing trouble.

434
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,360
I didn't expect it to turn out--

435
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,680
Tell me.

436
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,920
Shouldn't you give us an explanation?

437
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,800
- Yes, give us an explanation.
- Yes.

438
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,720
Okay, don't shout.

439
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,000
We are in an office.

440
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,320
You want an explanation?

441
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,680
Fine.

442
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
Dear workers.

443
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,120
Due to my negligence at work,

444
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,280
I apologize.

445
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,960
Okay?

446
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
What was that?

447
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,440
You heard it.

448
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,480
What's wrong with that?

449
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,000
I was negligent at work

450
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,120
and that's the company's business
to handle.

451
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,040
What does it have to do with you?

452
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,440
Turn around and take a look.

453
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,720
We're a big company
that handles big projects every day.

454
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,160
Who would keep an eye
on a small factory like yours?

455
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,680
That's all I have to say.

456
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,800
Please don't hold us up, okay?

457
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,120
- Mr. Yin.
- Shut up. It's none of your business.

458
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,760
Are you leaving or not?

459
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,720
You're not leaving?

460
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,920
Go call security.

461
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,960
- You…
- What are you doing? This is…

462
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,720
Is this the attitude of King Capital?

463
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,880
Let's go.

464
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,720
Unreasonable.

465
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,400
Mr. Su,

466
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,080
legally speaking, we're victims too.

467
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,880
I want this matter settled

468
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,160
before Mr. Qu comes back from overseas.

469
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,200
Do you hear me?

470
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,280
Go.

471
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,320
Mr. Li.

472
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,680
Don't rush. Do you want some?

473
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,600
There's no need.

474
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,240
Are you busy?

475
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,560
I'm following up on a project.

476
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,320
I still have a few questions to prepare.

477
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,160
Okay, get back to work.

478
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,960
Yiqiu.

479
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,640
Lunch is the most nutritious meal
for the human body.

480
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,080
You can't just eat bread.

481
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,800
Got it.

482
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
Okay, get back to work.

483
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,920
What do you mean you don't know?

484
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,160
Mr. Wu, I'm not trying to brush you off.

485
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,920
Mr. Qu is on an overseas research trip

486
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
to review several projects together.

487
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,520
He hasn't specified when he'll be back.

488
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
He might be back on Saturday.

489
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,040
Or he might not be back
until the end of the month.

490
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,280
Mr. Qu could not tell me

491
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,800
when he'll back exactly.

492
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,240
Okay, I'll ask him directly.

493
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,480
Mr. Wu.

494
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,480
It's midnight at Mr. Qu's place.

495
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,000
I don't think that's a good idea.

496
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,720
How about this, Mr. Wu?

497
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,880
Tell me what you need from Mr. Qu.

498
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,320
I'll put it in the weekly report.

499
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,240
I'm sure he'll get back to you.

500
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,160
Okay?

501
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,760
<i>Are you free this weekend?</i>

502
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,160
LI SHIYAN: ARE YOU FREE THIS WEEKEND?

503
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,520
<i>I might have to work overtime.</i>

504
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,360
LI SHIYAN

505
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,960
<i>How's work these days?</i>

506
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,440
<i>It feels like it has been a long time.</i>

507
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,080
<i>Do you want to go out?</i>

509
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,040
<i>Sure.</i>

510
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,760
SUN YIQIU: SURE.

511

LI SHIYAN

512
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,520
Hello, this is Team Four.

513
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,160
Okay.

514
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,080
What's wrong?

515
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,880
Mr. Li is asking for me.

516
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,400
Yiqiu.

517
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,440
It's okay. Go ahead.

518
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,840
It's over.

519
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
It's just a matter of time.

520
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Come in.

521
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,720
Mr. Li.

522
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,480
Yiqiu, come in.

523
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,440
Have a seat.

524
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,960
Do you like oolong?

525
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,440
It's too much trouble.

526
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,680
Not at all.

527
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,200
Why did you want to see me?

528
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,840
Yiqiu.

529
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,920
It's nothing.

530
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,080
I don't think Mr. Wu should tell you.

531
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,480
I'm a busybody.

532
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,800
Just so you know.

533
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,800
The project you are in charge of

534
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,680
was rejected by Risk Control.

Sun Yiqiu.

537
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
I'll get going.

538
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,200
Hey…

539
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,040
<i>A project like yours</i>

540
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,760
<i>has no selling point or value.</i>

541
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,520
Do you know
what it's called in the company?

542
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,720
It's called a trash project.

543
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,120
<i>I used to say</i>

544
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,240
<i>false hope is the worst.</i>

545
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,080
But now,

546
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,840
you can have a little bit of hope.

547
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,800
<i>That was the first time</i>

548
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,720
<i>I bid farewell to the past as a loser.</i>

549
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,240
<i>After all these years,</i>

550
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,600
<i>I seem to have gotten used
to saying goodbye.</i>

551
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,800
<i>I keep leaving places
I've just gotten used to.</i>

552
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,960
<i>The only thing I can hold on to</i>

553
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,880
<i>is running.</i>

554
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,280
<i>It's the simplest
and most boring exercise.</i>

555
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,520
<i>Maybe it's because running
is the most ideal state</i>

556
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,960
<i>between effort and reward.</i>

557
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,000
<i>No matter how tired you are</i>

558
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,960
<i>or what obstacles you encounter,</i>

559
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,240
<i>as long as you don't stop,
you will move forward.</i>

560
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,040
<i>Unlike many things in life,</i>

561
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,840
<i>even if you've given it your all,</i>

562
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
<i>in exchange,</i>

563
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,120
<i>it might just be a blank slate.</i>

564
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,040
<i>This time,</i>

565
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,120
<i>do I have to say goodbye again?</i>

566
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,920
Mr. Lin.

567
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,800
<i>Mr. Sun, be prepared.</i>

568
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,440
For what?

569
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,480
I'm meeting that girl today.

570
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,680
She'll be here soon.

571
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,600
What does that have to do with me?

572
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,960
If everything goes well,

573
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,040
I'm sure you won't have anything
to do with it.

574
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,960
But what if it's the same as always?

575
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,360
Then stop talking nonsense
and take a walk with me.

576
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,280
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>
