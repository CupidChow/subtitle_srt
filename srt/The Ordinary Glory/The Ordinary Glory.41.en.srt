1
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,320
TO MR. WU

2
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

3
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,280
This huge burden

4
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,960
has finally been lifted off my chest.

5
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,640
What's wrong with that Dr. Li?

6
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,200
The board has been good to him.

7
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,800
We gave him time and money.

8
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,120
But he betrayed us

9
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,760
and even bit the hand that feeds him.

10
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,920
As the technical director,

11
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,240
he was responsible
for preventing defective products

12
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,480
from entering the market.

13
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,080
I don't see a problem with it.

14
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,160
After Rihuan BioTech goes public,

15
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,440
I hope you can rescind

16
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,920
his non-compete agreement.

17
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,920
Don't be too ruthless.

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,560
Is our product defective?

19
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,400
I don't think so.

20
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,800
It's not important.

21
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,640
Mr. Wu.

22
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,080
We'll follow

23
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
whatever you say now, okay?

24
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,600
Mr. Wu, are you in a hurry to leave?

25
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,960
I have an idea.

26
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,000
I have to thank you

27
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
for your massive help.

28
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,240
In the next two days,

29
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,200
I'll invite Mr. Qu

30
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,640
and let's have a celebration party.

31
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,880
- Okay?
- No need.

32
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,080
Tell me.

33
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,720
Rihuan BioTech is such a strange project.

34
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,600
Why did Kezhi stop investigating suddenly?

35
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't know.

36
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,280
Well,

37
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,840
Mr. Qu invited Mr. Sun out for dinner.

38
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,840
You know that, right?

39
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,079
But it was such a coincidence.

40
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,600
The day after they had dinner,

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,000
Kezhi told us to stop investigating.

42
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,640
Mr. Qu had such good timing.

43
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,080
The moment we suspected Rihuan BioTech,

44
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,040
he immediately went to see Mr. Sun.

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,120
Yes.

46
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,640
I informed Mr. Qu about it.

47
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,160
This project
is very important to Team Four.

48
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,400
It's just important to you.

49
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,680
Don't you know?

50
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,240
Kezhi has never turned a blind eye

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,240
to a project

52
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,800
that's obviously problematic.

53
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,800
Stop arguing.

54
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,080
I'm sorry, Kezhi.

55
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,640
I made the decision.

56
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,680
It has nothing to do with you guys.

57
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,720
What's going on?
Why are you standing here?

58
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,760
Shengchao, you're late, aren't you?

59
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,240
Shengchao, this is a nice car.

60
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,680
Even the seats are very comfortable.

61
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,200
I didn't ask you to get in. Get out.

62
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
I need to talk to you, Shengchao.

63
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,760
Let's talk in the office, okay?

64
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,880
No.

65
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,920
Mr. Su is upstairs.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,080
It's inconvenient to talk.

67
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,080
What is it?

68
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,440
This number.

69
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,880
Do you remember it?

70
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,720
I don't know.

71
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,160
- What is it?
- You don't know?

72
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,840
Allow me to jog your memory.

73
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,400
VOICE MEMOS

74
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,600
<i>Hello? Who is it?</i>

75
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,720
<i>Who is this?</i>

76
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,840
<i>Say something.</i>

77
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,000
- <i>You're crazy.</i>
- Mr. Zhou.

78
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,000
<i>Who are you?</i>

79
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,840
Who I am is not important.

80
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
Just know that I work for Yin Shengchao.

81
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,720
<i>Yin Shengchao?</i>

82
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
<i>I've been looking for him.</i>

83
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,240
<i>He's supposed to settle
my bankruptcy and close the case.</i>

84
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,880
<i>Why are the police still looking for me?</i>

85
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,880
<i>What are you doing?</i>

86
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,200
I see.

87
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,000
That depends

88
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,160
on your sincerity, Mr. Zhou.

89
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,880
<i>Sincerity, my foot.</i>

90
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,960
<i>How much did you take from me?</i>

91
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,520
<i>Do you think I'm a fool?</i>

92
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,640
<i>Let me tell you.</i>

93
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,960
<i>If someone finds me,</i>

94
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,400
<i>none of you can get away.</i>

95
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,520
I have a backup.

96
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,320
Hao Shuai!

97
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,560
You're trying to implicate me, aren't you?

98
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,840
Give it back to me.

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,320
I knew it.

100
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,840
Morfan was in such big trouble.

101
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,680
As their investment consultant,

102
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,600
you were not nervous at all.

103
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,200
You already knew
their boss was going to run away.

104
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,000
But you didn't tell the company.

105
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,400
You even asked him for money, didn't you?

106
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,640
Hao Shuai. Look.

107
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,200
Since you've found out about this,

108
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,800
do me another favor.

109
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Delete all your backups.

110
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,240
Keep this a secret.

111
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,960
And for all the money I got,

112
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,520
I'll give you half of it.

113
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,680
Okay?

114
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Do you like this?

115
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,400
Take the car and drive it as you like.

116
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,440
Return it whenever you feel like it, okay?

117
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Return it?

118
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,480
No. It's all yours. You can take it all.

119
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,600
The watch.
You like expensive watches, right?

120
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
It's all yours, okay?

121
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,480
- The belt.
- Stop.

122
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,480
I can let you go.

123
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,360
But I'm afraid they can't.

124
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,200
Hao Shuai.

125
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,000
You guys talk. I'm getting out.

126
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,920
Hao Shuai, what are you doing?

127
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,280
Do you know what you should do now?

128
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
First, you have to give
all the dirty money you got

129
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,600
to the workers in Morfan.

130
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,760
Think of it as interest.

131
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,640
Second, you have
to cooperate with the police

132
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,880
as soon as possible.

133
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,000
The sooner you catch the boss,

134
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,680
the lesser your crime will be.

135
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,440
Do you understand?

136
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,680
Shengchao!

137
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,000
Hao Shuai.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
By the way,

139
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,200
I need another small favor.

140
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,560
I hope you

141
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,800
won't show up at the office again.

142
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,560
Because when I see you,

143
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,560
I feel

144
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,120
disgusted.

145
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,800
Qianyi.

146
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Congratulations.

147
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,880
You finally get your own project.

148
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,240
You're too kind.

149
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,320
It must be expensive.

150
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,120
It's not.

151
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,440
Not expensive at all.

152
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Thank you.

153
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,640
Lan Qianyi.

154
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,760
After work today,

155
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,920
do you have time…

156
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,160
Hello, Mr. Xu.

157
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,200
Okay, I'll come back now.

158
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,800
I'm sorry. My team needs me.

159
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,920
I have to go back.

160
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,080
What were you saying?

161
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,280
Nothing.

162
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Thank you.

163
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,840
Mr. Ma.

164
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,880
You're here.

165
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,360
How's the Qiancheng Solar project going?

166
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,440
It's going well.

167
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,280
Well,

168
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,000
here.

169
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,760
I haven't given you the latest update yet.

170
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,680
Okay, come here.

171
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,720
Come here.

172
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,720
Listen.

173
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,920
For this project,

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
get all the documents ready

175
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,880
and hand them over to Zhao Boqian.

176
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,640
Mr. Ma,

177
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,160
did I do something wrong?

178
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,080
You didn't do anything wrong.

179
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Qianyi.

180
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,040
It's not because you weren't good.

181
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,720
It's because you're too outstanding.

182
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,120
Then why…

183
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,400
Here's the thing.

184
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,000
Our team has one spot to go to France

185
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,160
for a one-year course

186
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,360
and Mr. Ma decided to give it to you.

187
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,920
What?

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,520
Do you still want to work from abroad?

189
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,840
Work abroad?

190
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,880
- Me?
- Yes.

191
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,680
It's in France.

192
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,200
Do you not want it?

193
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,120
Yes, I do.

194
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,760
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

195
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,920
That's the answer I want.

196
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,920
Qianyi, I'm giving you this opportunity

197
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,720
because of your outstanding performance.

198
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,120
I have high hopes for you. Keep it up.

199
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,040
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

200
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,480
I'll get going.

201
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,440
Good luck.

202
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,560
Bring me that project document now.

203
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,560
Where's Mr. Sun? Did you send him out?

204
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
I didn't.

205
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,840
Why is it empty?

206
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,960
TO MR. WU

207
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,080
Congratulations.

208
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,520
Thank you.

209
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,760
In my hometown,

210
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,080
they say that giving someone shoes

211
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,600
means sending them off.

212
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,600
I didn't expect it to be so accurate.

213
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
How long will you be gone?

214
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,080
A year.

215
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,960
A year?

216
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,920
Maybe when you come back,

217
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,040
I'd already be a manager.

218
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,960
By then,

219
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,360
I'd be in your care, Manager Gao.

220
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,240
Hello?

221
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,640
Hello, Hao Shuai.

222
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,560
Sun Yiqiu…

223
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,400
He resigned.

224
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,320
Pick up.

225
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,760
Answer your phone.

226
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,600
Answer your phone.

227
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Pick up…

228
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,280
- Fatty.
- Don't touch me!

229
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,560
If you didn't inform Mr. Qu,

230
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,000
Mr. Sun wouldn't have left!

231
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,440
Fatty.

232
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,760
Even if we ignore Mr. Qu's order

233
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,160
and reject Rihuan BioTech,

234
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,440
do you think Sun would stay

235
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,800
because of that?

236
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
I know.

237
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,080
As long as Mr. Sun gets involved,

238
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,720
no matter what you do,

239
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,960
he will leave.

240
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
But…

241
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,080
But I just…

242
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,520
I don't want to see him

243
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,560
leave just like that.

244
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,600
It's okay.

245
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,000
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

246
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,400
<i>In the end,</i>

247
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,720
<i>I chose to leave without saying goodbye.</i>

248
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,560
<i>My decision to leave King Capital</i>

249
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,760
<i>was entirely my own willful decision.</i>

250
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,160
<i>I hope you can understand.</i>

251
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,880
<i>Over the years,</i>

252
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,600
<i>I've done all kinds of jobs.</i>

253
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,400
<i>But the days in Team Four</i>

254
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,400
<i>were the happiest for me.</i>

255
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,560
<i>From now on,</i>

256
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,480
<i>no matter what difficulties I face,</i>

257
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,760
<i>I'll stay hopeful,</i>

258
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,440
<i>and true to myself</i>

259
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,120
<i>until the end.</i>

260
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,040
<i>That's also the most precious thing</i>

261
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,360
<i>I've learned from you.</i>

262
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,720
<i>I haven't read many books,</i>

263
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,120
<i>but there's one line I remember clearly.</i>

264
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,920
"<i>The world is famous for leaving,</i>

265
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,640
<i>but we're not good at goodbyes."</i>

266
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,640
<i>I guess</i>

267
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,960
<i>I'm someone like that.</i>

268
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,080
<i>I always end up making every farewell</i>

269
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,080
<i>looks like I'm running away.</i>

270
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,040
<i>Lastly,</i>

271
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,960
<i>I don't know what else to say.</i>

272
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,920
<i>Thank you.</i>

273
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,680
<i>Thank you, Team Four.</i>

274
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,960
<i>From Integrated Team Four's analyst,</i>

275
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,359
<i>Sun Yiqiu.</i>

276
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,960
Mr. Wu.

277
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,600
Kezhi.

278
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,240
This is the investigation result

279
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,640
on Rihuan BioTech's
overseas affiliated companies.

280
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,520
There's indeed a data falsification issue.

281
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,440
I'm sorry

282
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,760
for giving it to you now.

283
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,880
Do you guys know

284
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,680
what doing this entails?

285
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,800
RESIGNATION LETTER, LIN YUMING

286
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,960
RESIGNATION LETTER, DING LIBO

287
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,280
Hello, sir.

288
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,560
Do you have a reservation, sir?

289
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,200
Sir!

290
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,720
To the great--

291
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,560
Mr. Wu, I was just talking about you.

292
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,120
Please have a seat.

293
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,400
Kezhi, are you looking for me?

294
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,920
Let's sit down and talk.

295
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,160
I'm sorry, everyone.

296
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,440
Could you give us five minutes?

297
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,760
Thank you.

298
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,440
Let's…

299
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,240
Rihuan BioTech

300
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,480
is suspected of profit inflation
using affiliated companies.

301
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,560
I request to terminate

302
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,720
the project's IPO filing.

303
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,360
Wu Kezhi.

304
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,720
Look at you.

305
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,440
Why are you still so impulsive?

306
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,200
We can still talk about this--

307
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,240
Sun Yiqiu resigned.

308
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,920
If the IPO falls through,

309
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,200
do you know how much damage

310
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,160
it will do to our company?

311
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,160
If the scandal breaks after the IPO,

312
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,680
which one do you think
will cause more damage?

313
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,480
If I don't see any action taken

314
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,080
by 10 a.m. tomorrow,

315
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,840
I will personally

316
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,160
report Rihuan BioTech to the CSRC.

317
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Wu Kezhi!

318
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,560
Listen carefully.

319
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,520
If you do that,

320
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,960
from now on,

321
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,760
your career
in the investment field is over!

322
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,720
I'll drag you with me then.

323
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,440
The people from Team Four

324
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,480
would rather die with honor.

325
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,160
Look.

326
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,200
What's going on?

327
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,120
You won.

328
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,400
I've asked Rihuan BioTech to drop the IPO.

329
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
But why

330
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,400
did you resign?

331
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,000
It's better

332
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,280
than you leaving.

333
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,240
After all,

334
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,680
I'm still a businessman.

335
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,880
I'm best at pursuing the option

336
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,320
that maximizes profit.

337
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,760
I used to think

338
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,880
that keeping Rihuan BioTech

339
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,960
would bring maximum benefits

340
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,160
to our company.

341
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,640
Now that I can't do that,

342
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,560
I should let the company

343
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,800
have someone like you.

344
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,240
Kezhi.

345
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,120
There are some things I can only say

346
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,320
after I resigned.

347
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,120
What you mean to King

348
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,320
is more important

349
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,600
than what King means to you

350
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,880
When I first joined the company,

351
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,440
you weren't like this.

352
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,000
You're right.

353
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,760
Sometimes when I look at you,

354
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,080
I'm reminded of our past.

355
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,560
I'm reminded of myself

356
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,080
when we worked hard side by side.

357
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,720
But you know how people are.

358
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,240
They always like to rise to the top.

359
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,440
And when you're up there,

360
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,200
sacrificing someone

361
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
would mean helping someone else.

362
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
And before I knew it,

363
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,440
I ended up like this.

364
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,720
My departure

365
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,000
is an opportunity for you.

366
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,040
When you get to the top,

367
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,000
I hope you'll do better than me.

368
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,240
But of course,

369
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,560
that's only if you're willing

370
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,720
to stay and keep working.

371
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,480
Kezhi.

372
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,560
Goodbye.

373
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,040
- Hi, Mr. Wu.
- Hi, Mr. Wu.

374
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,200
- Hello, Mr. Wu.
- Hi, Mr. Wu.

375
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Mr. Wu.

376
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
Hello, Mr. Wu.

377
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,480
- Hi, Mr. Wu.
- Hi, Mr. Wu.

378
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,760
Hello, Mr. Wu.

379
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,960
- Hi, Mr. Wu.
- Hi, Mr. Wu.

380
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,480

- Hello, Mr. Wu.

381
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Hello, Mr. Wu.

382
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,840
- Mr. Wu.
- Mr. Wu.

383
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Mr. Wu.

384
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
Hello, Mr. Wu.

385
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Mr. Wu.

386
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,360
Ms. Gao.

387
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,640
Mr. Wu.

388
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,200
From now on, this is your new office.

389
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,120
Where's Mr. Li?

390
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,160
He has taken over

391
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,200
Mr. Qu's position.

392
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,800
It was Mr. Li's idea

393
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,360
to leave this office to you.

394
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,080
If you don't like it,

395
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,200
I'll go to another floor

396
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,760
and find you a better seat.

397
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
This is good enough.

398
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
I won't bother you then.

399
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,240
By the way,

400
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,960
Mr. Li is waiting for you upstairs.

401
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,960
My goodness.
Out with the old, in with the new.

402
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,480
Kezhi, congratulations.

403
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,560
I'm sure you can tell

404
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,200
that everyone in the company

405
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,200
is looking at you differently.

406
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,680
They say you're the smartest person

407
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,720
in the company

408
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,720
because you could tell

409
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
that Chris and Mr. Li

410
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,600
wanted to get rid of Mr. Qu,

411
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,160
so you joined forces in advance.

412
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,520
That's nonsense.

413
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,840
Kezhi, do you have that kind of brain?

414
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,520
Don't look so gloomy.

415
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,760
Since the day I joined the company,

416
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
I've always wanted to sit on this chair.

417
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,120
But looking at it now,

418
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,680
this chair doesn't seem that comfortable.

419
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,680
As long as your conscience is clear,

420
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,040
no matter what people say,

421
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,520
don't take it to heart.

422
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,000
Do you agree?

423
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
Have some tea.

424
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,280
Kezhi.

425
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,240
Mr. Qu might have retired

426
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,240
to take responsibility for Rihuan BioTech,

427
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,720
but I know

428
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,600
the one who made it happen

429
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,080
was you.

430
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Kezhi.

431
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,440
Your hands were tied in the company

432
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,440
in the past few years.

433
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
In my opinion,

434
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,280
that was a huge waste of talent resources

435
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,840
for the company.

436
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,440
But it's fine now.

437
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,560
I've already proposed to Chris.

438
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,440
The company

439
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,320
plans to appoint you as the head

440
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,760
of the New Business Division.

441
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,480
It's just like the unicorn

442
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,520
I told you before.

443
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,320
Kezhi, you…

444
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,760
Mr. Li.

445
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,920
You had something to do
with Sun Yiqiu's resignation, right?

446
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,480
Kezhi.

447
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,680
Yi…

448
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
I quit.

449
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,320
You…

450
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,960
Quitting is my personal decision.

451
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,600
You don't have to follow me.

452
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,520
Just wait for your promotion and raise.

453
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,480
Don't always think about others.

454
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,080
Think more for yourself.

455
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,920
It's time for you

456
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,880
to be on your own.

457
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,360
Libo.

458
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,600
You didn't do anything wrong.

459
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,600
Don't blame yourself.

460
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,240
Team Four is counting on you two.

461
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,040
TWO MONTHS LATER

462
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
We have to get this project,
no matter what.

463
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,080
That's right.

464
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,040
I don't want to be scolded
by our boss again.

465
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,440
Don't be discouraged.

466
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,200
If we complete this project,

467
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,840
our team will be successful.

468
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,880
Okay.

469
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,120
MR. SUN YIQIU, HELLO!

00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,840
YOUR QUALIFICATIONS
DO NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS

471

FOR OUR VACANT POSITION.

472
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,360
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU
THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN SELECTED.

473
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,200
<i>But in the end,</i>

474
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,320
<i>the only thing that changed</i>

475
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,160
<i>was my mindset.</i>

476
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
<i>It was never the world.</i>

477
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,720
<i>Fortunately, my old friends</i>

478
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,640

<i>It's said that he's seen</i>

512
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,120

513

518
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,840

520

522

523

524
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,680

525
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,160
<i>about doing something

526
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,200
All right. That's all for now.

527
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,640
Okay.

528
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,080
Hello.

529
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,680
You sent over the report?

530
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,280
No way. I didn't receive it.

531
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,360
Let me check my email. Hold on.

532
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,200
Did they send it or not?

533
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,280
What are you doing?

534
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,360
You're Mr. Lyu, right?

535
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,320
Here's your order.

536
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,000
We don't have a Mr. Lyu here.

537
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,000
You must be mistaken.

538
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,880
Isn't this 301, Block C?

539
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,440
Dude, this is 301, Block A.

540
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,560
Please leave.

541
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
I'm sorry.

542
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,240
Hold on!

543
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,080
I'll call you back.

544
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,120
Hello.

545
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,880
Sir.

546
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,120
Are you hiring?

547
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,400
You punk.

548
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,080
What took you so long? I'm so busy.

549
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,200
Do you know that?

550
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
These are for you.

551
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,760
That's a lot.

552
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,480
Hang on.

553
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,320
You're your own boss now.

554
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,440
Why are you working
even harder than before?

555
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,600
You don't like it?

556
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,520
Fine.

557
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,800
Before you sign the contract,
you should leave.

558
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,320
No, I'll do it.

559
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,960
Read it all before you go home.

560
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,120
Kezhi, my work environment.

561
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,120
Do you think

562
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,800
it needs to be improved?

563
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,440
Why don't I sit there?

564
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
No, it's taken.

565
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
Taken?

566
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,560
Who is it?

567
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,680
You rascal.

568
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,080
Did you not answer my calls

569
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,680
so I'd come find you in person?

570
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,920
I'm really too ashamed

571
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,320
to see you again.

572
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,680
You left King Capital

573
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,200
because of me.

574
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,000
You're imagining things again.

575
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,600
It's my business if I want to leave.

576
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,880
It has nothing to do with you.

577
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,080
Yes.

578
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,200
Tell me.

579
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,360
How have you been lately?

580
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,720
I'm working part-time

581
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,480
while taking
an adult undergraduate degree.

582
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,200
I'm studying investment
and project management too.

583
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,240
That means you still want
to be an investment consultant.

584
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
I know.

585
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,000
With my education and experience,

586
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm still a bit far away

587
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,640
from becoming an investment consultant.

588
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,560
However,

589
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,720
I still want to hold on

590
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,360
to a little bit of hope.

591
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,400
Don't be sorry for that.

592
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,160
Isn't it good to have hope?

593
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,480
Didn't you always say

594
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,640
false hope

595
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,840
is the worst?

596
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,040
Did I say that?

597
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,600
I don't remember.

598
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,080
It's good to have hope.

599
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
Hope

600
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,200
gives you motivation to want to be better.

601
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,720
There's no such thing as false hope.

602
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,760
But I don't know

603
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,000
when that little hope of mine

604
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,400
will come true.

605
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,680
I have a low-paying

606
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,600
and stressful job

607
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,840
with a bad-tempered boss.

608
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,040
Would you consider it?

609
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,160
Are you inviting me

610
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,200
to your company?

611
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,800
But I have a question.

612
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,720
Go ahead.

613
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,920
As the founder,

614
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,480
what's your selling point?

615
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,000
Not bad.

616
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,200
I'm hardworking.

617
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,520
I just went to that company.

618
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,080
All workstations are empty.

619
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,040
In my opinion,

620
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,400
it's probably an investment scam.

621
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,560
Thank you.

622
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,880
I'll inform the client.

623
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,560
Fatty.

624
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,600
Fatty.

625
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,760
What are you looking for?

626
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,960
Why?

627
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,960
This isn't fair.

628
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,120
Why is he getting paid more than me?

629
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,080
Of course.

630
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,960
Mr. Sun is our founding employee.

631
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,840
As a first-day intern,

632
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
you can't compare to him.

633
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,360
I…

634
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,760
There's one more thing.

635
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,360
Since we've left King Capital,

636
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,360
I think

637
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,680
we should change

638
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,480
the way we address each other.

639
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,880
That's not funny.

640
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,280
Manager Sun.

641
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,960
I'm the new hire,

642
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,000
Lin Yuming.

643
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,400
From now on, you can call me…

644
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,800
Fatty.

645
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,680
Work hard,

646
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,200
Fatty.

647
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,080
"Fatty."

648
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,600
He's really calling me that. Why are you…

649
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,360
Why are you guys bullying me?

650
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,960
I want a promotion.

651
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,000
No, I want a raise.

652
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
Are you stupid?

653
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,640
Hello.

654
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,600
Yes.

655
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,560
Okay, no problem.

656
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,760
We'll leave now. Okay.

657
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,200
Let's talk later. Okay.

658
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,440
Let's go. We have a case.

659
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,520
Hurry up, Fatty.

660
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
THE END

661
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,360
