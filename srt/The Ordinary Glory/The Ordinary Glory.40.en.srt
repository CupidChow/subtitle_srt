1
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,040
You're the boss
of those two swindlers, right?

2
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,320
I'm really sorry, Dr. Li.

3
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,360
My subordinates were too reckless.

4
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,760
I apologize on their behalf.

5
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,240
Let's skip the formalities.

6
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,240
What are you up to now?

7
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,120
I have something here.

8
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,560
I'd like you to take a look at it.

9
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,000
Is it a check?

10
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,040
This isn't new.

11
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,840
No.

12
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,600
These are the meeting minutes

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,400
between Rihuan BioTech and this product.

14
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,960
During my investigation,

15
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,199
I found something suspicious.

16
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,639
Three weeks

17
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,000
before you were fired,

18
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,880
the executives of Rihuan BioTech
and the R&D team you were in charge of

19
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,240
had seven meetings.

20
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,280
But the only preserved meeting minutes

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,000
were from this last meeting,

22
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,120
which was the announcement
of your dismissal.

23
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,720
So I'm curious

24
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,400
why the last six meetings
weren't recorded.

25
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,640
Also,

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,760
in order to fire someone

27
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,920
who hasn't shown results for three years,

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,880
they had seven meetings.

29
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,840
Isn't that too much work?

30
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,520
What do you think?

31
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,000
I think in the last six meetings,

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,040
there was a big disagreement

33
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,760
between you and the executives.

34
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,600
So in the end, they had no choice

35
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,040
but to fire you.

36
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,640
What's your name?

37
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,320
I'm Wu Kezhi from King Capital.

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,760
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

39
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
I see.

40
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,960
I'm sorry to bother you.

41
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Thank you.

42
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,720
Are there any other numbers?

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't think that's necessary.

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,600
We've asked all the big hospitals

45
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,920
that work with Rihuan BioTech.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,440
None of them
has engaged its new testing equipment.

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,880
That's interesting.

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,560
After it was launched,

49
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,760
it became
the company's top-selling product,

50
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,240
but strangely,
there was no interest in the market.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,000
Where did they sell it?

52
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,640
Based on the reports they provided,

53
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,800
their main buyers

54
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,600
are also foreign medical institutions.

55
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,840
So there's no trace of it in China.
That's normal.

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,040
I hope that's the case.

57
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,079
What do you mean?

58
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,040
Forget it. Let's wait.

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,000
Mr. Ding has contacted

60
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,880
our company's
overseas investigation agency.

61
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,400
Let's wait for the results.

62
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Back then,

63
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,800
when Rihuan BioTech
handed over this project to me,

64
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,960
I told them

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
that based on this technology

66
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,320
and funding,

67
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,040
it was impossible

68
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,680
to come up with a new device

69
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,920
in such a short time.

70
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,040
Then they declared an IPO

71
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,600
and were eager to launch a new product

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,600
to make a profit.

73
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,280
The six meetings you just mentioned

74
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,760
were basically for me to nod and sign

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,760
to take this new product

76
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,240
to the market.

77
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,840
You turned it down.

78
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,880
Of course.

79
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,720
Genetic testing users

80
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,920
are mostly older people, children,

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,120
and pregnant women.

82
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,400
How can I agree to that?

83
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,920
I understand.

84
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,320
I can vouch for my integrity

85
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,400
that until today,

86
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,080
they have not overcome
the technical bottleneck of this product.

87
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,360
Dr. Li.

88
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,200
I completely understand

89
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,840
your frustration and anger.

90
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,240
But what we need now is evidence.

91
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,640
Otherwise, your anonymous letter

92
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,600
will only get you in trouble.

93
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,040
It won't get you anywhere.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Mr. Wu.

95
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,040
I can only be honest with you.

96
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,320
I don't have solid evidence.

97
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,920
So Mr. Wu,

98
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,280
I can only ask you for a favor.

99
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,080
You can even say I'm begging you.

100
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,880
Something must be wrong
with their product.

101
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,400
There's definitely something wrong.

102
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,720
If we let them go public,

103
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,640
it's harmful to others.

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,000
In other words,

105
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,280
this so-called new product
from Rihuan BioTech

106
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,200
has never appeared on the market.

107
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,880
We've been doing statistics all day.

108
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,120
Up until now,

109
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,400
there is zero institution in China

110
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,480
using the so-called latest generation
gene detection equipment

111
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,520
from Rihuan BioTech.

112
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,960
Mr. Sun, what do you think?

113
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,320
Mr. Lin and I suspect that the profits

114
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,680
reported in their financial statements
might be associated

115
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,600
with some fraudulent accounting practices
done by the management company.

116
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,560
Do you have proof?

117
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,560
Mr. Ding is investigating
overseas medical institutions

118
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,000
that have made significant
equipment purchases.

119
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,400
So we don't know the details yet.

120
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,200
I think this project

121
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,760
is getting weirder and weirder.

122
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,800
Why don't we

123
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,480
just give up?

124
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,920
Give up on what?

125
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,680
Mr. Ding.

126
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,080
How's your investigation going?

127
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,120
I've asked someone to look into it.

128
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,320
The final result

129
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,360
is not out yet.

130
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,240
How long will it take?

131
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,520
Two to three days.

132
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,240
But if you count the time difference,

133
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,360
it might take longer.

134
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,960
We don't have that much time.

135
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,920
In a few days,

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,240
the IPO will go through.

137
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,760
What else can we do?

138
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,920
Why don't you look into it?

139
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,600
Libo, hurry up.

140
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,000
I know.

141
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
Where are you going?

142
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,360
To get coffee.

143
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Mr. Lin.

144
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,840
If Rihuan BioTech

145
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,800
really falsified the data,

146
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,320
what should we do?

147
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,040
What else can we do?

148
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,600
With Mr. Wu's temper,

149
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,480
I'm sure
he will return the project right away.

150
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,240
Team Four is going
to offend someone again.

151
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,440
I'm used to it.

152
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,200
But it's an assignment from Mr. Qu.

153
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,120
Never mind Mr. Qu.

154
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,000
Even if it's from his dad, it won't work.

155
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,880
Why did you come down from up there?

156
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,720
I'm going for a smoke on the rooftop.

157
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,240
Are you off work?

158
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,280
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

159
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,440
If Mr. Wu really returns this project
to the company,

160
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,960
what will the company do?

161
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,960
How would I know?

162
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,240
That's not for us to worry about.

163
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,800
All we can do now

164
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,800
is to obey orders and follow commands.

165
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,480
Leave the rest to Mr. Wu.

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,360
All right, don't think too much.

167
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,400
I'm going back.

168
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,160
<i>Mr. Lin and I suspect that the profits</i>

169
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,720
<i>reported in their financial statements
might be associated</i>

170
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,600
<i>with some fraudulent accounting practices
done by the management company.</i>

171
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,000
<i>Mr. Wu, please.</i>

172
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,200
<i>You can even say I'm begging you.</i>

173
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,680
<i>Something must be wrong
with their product.</i>

174
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,720
<i>There's definitely something wrong.</i>

175
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,840
<i>If we let them go public,</i>

176
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,520
<i>it's harmful to others.</i>

177
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,120
<i>Besides, the company trusts you.</i>

178
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,720
<i>You should handle it.</i>

179
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,920
<i>You're free to do whatever you want.</i>

180
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,560
<i>Your decision</i>

181
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,080
<i>is the company's decision.</i>

182
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,240
<i>It's all up to you.</i>

183
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,880
<i>I'll still say the same thing.</i>

184
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,040
<i>I don't care about the process.</i>

185
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,240
<i>I just want the result.</i>

186
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,200
Hello?

187
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,400
What? Now?

188
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,360
Okay, I got it.

189
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,640
Libo.

190
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,880
I have to go now.

191
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,280
See you tomorrow.

192
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,600
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO PERMANENTLY DELETE THIS?

193
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,600
YES, NO

194
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,680
Hao Shuai.

195
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,360
Hao Shuai.

196
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,160
Think carefully.

197
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,280
If this gets out,

198
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,480
both of our lives will be ruined.

199
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,680
Sicong.

200
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,840
Trust me.

201
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,160
Yin Shengchao is up to something.

202
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,560
Even if he is fishy,

203
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,960
what does it have to do with you?

204
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,360
I know.

205
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,800
The impression I gave you
is that I hate him more.

206
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,840
I wanted him to get into big trouble
and be doomed.

207
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,880
But this time,

208
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,120
all of this has nothing to do with that.

209
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
The company went bankrupt.

210
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,960
The boss ran away.

211
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,160
To our company,

212
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,840
this is just a small project
that doesn't matter.

213
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,440
Yin Shengchao only has to write
a few reports

214
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,680
and have his bonuses deducted.

215
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,800
This will be the end of it.

216
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,640
Let's end it now, okay?

217
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,680
I can end it.

218
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,160
What about the workers at Morfan Apparel?

219
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,840
You didn't see them.

220
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,320
They worked hard
to support their families.

221
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,680
They spent all their savings

222
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,840
on that bastard who ran away.

223
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,600
If Yin Shengchao knew something,

224
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,040
maybe they could be saved.

225
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,000
Then tell me.

226
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,200
Can I still pretend
that I don't know anything?

227
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,480
I'm not trying to be a hero.

228
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,400
I just think that if I continue

229
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,880
to feign ignorance on this matter,

230
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,400
then I'm no different

231
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,760
from people like Yin Shengchao.

232
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,680
Sicong.

233
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,280
Do you understand what I mean?

234
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,480
You're a good friend.

235
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,840
The goddess is here.

236
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,280
I'll give you two some space.

237
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,440
I won't be the third wheel.

238
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,480
I have work to do.

239
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,240
Be careful.

240
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,760
What are you talking about in secret?

241
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,000
He left as soon as I got here.

242
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,120
It's nothing.

243
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,680
Why do you look so pale?

244
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,440
Did something happen?

245
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,080
Qianyi.

246
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,400
You must remember me.

247
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,720
If

248
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,920
tomorrow is my last day at work,

249
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,600
you must remember

250
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,760
I'm willing to do anything for my friend.

251
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,400
What are you talking about?

252
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,960
Nothing.

253
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
- Yiqiu, here.
- Thank you.

254
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,360
We should have done this earlier.

255
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,360
Right.

256
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
How is your mom's health?

257
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,240
She's fine.

258
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,560
Thank you for your concern.

259
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,000
To be honest,

260
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,240
when I hired you,

261
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,560
it was to repay a favor to your mom.

262
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,880
But your performance in Team Four

263
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,760
has given me too many surprises.

264
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,840
I'm flattered.

265
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,760
Don't be nervous.

266
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,600
Show the magnanimity you had
when we played poker.

267
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,360
Here, Yiqiu.

268
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,080
Please come in.

269
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,240
Kezhi, come on.

270
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,840
- Mr. Wu.
- Here.

271
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,760
Kezhi, today,

272
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,360
I'm treating Yiqiu to a meal.

273
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
You're his boss,
so you have to accompany him.

274
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,160
Have a seat.

275
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,240
Mr. Qu.

276
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,120
Why are you doing this?

277
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,280
There's no reason.

278
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Yiqiu is an excellent employee.

279
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,800
He's talented.

280
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,360
Moreover,

281
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,280
we share a bond.

282
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,640
Be it as a boss or a friend,

283
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,040
I should be the one treating.

284
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,240
Sun Yiqiu.

285
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,080
Don't you have work to do?

286
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,920
Right.

287
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,080
I'm sorry, Mr. Qu.

288
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,160
That's too bad.

289
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,040
No matter what,
never compromise your work.

290
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
All right.

291
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,520
I'll treat you next time.

292
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,080
Enjoy.

293
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Mr. Qu.

294
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,160
There's a problem
with Rihuan BioTech's products.

295
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,920
The fiscal report might be fake.

296
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,280
Why didn't you tell me?

297
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,160
If I told you

298
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,200
I didn't know about Rihuan BioTech,

299
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,800
would you believe me?

300
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
Kezhi.

301
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,960
I'll be honest with you.

302
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,079
King Capital is running out of funds.

303
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,960
The hot money in the market

304
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,520
is on the decline.

305
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,560
Worse, the competition
is getting more intense.

306
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,400
In order to help King Capital

307
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,119
raise more funds,

308
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,440
we have to show the investors

309
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,040
what we're capable of.

310
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,119
Whether Rihuan BioTech goes public or not

311
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,520
is proof of our capabilities.

312
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,880
I don't care what you do

313
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,080
or how you do it.

314
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,720
I just want the result.

315
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,480
Kezhi.

316
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,160
The oars of Rihuan BioTech

317
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,280
are in your hands.

318
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,320
Whether you can row successfully
to the finish line

319
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,280
directly determines King Capital's fate.

320
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,000
Do you understand?

321
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,400
If we let Rihuan really go public

322
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,040
with an unfinished product,

323
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,840
isn't it equivalent to taking
all the shareholders to gamble together?

324
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,000
That's enough. Stop talking.

325
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,160
If Rihuan BioTech fails,

326
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,640
King Capital will encounter a storm.

327
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,640
Who will be the first to be thrown
into the depths of the sea?

328
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,840
Is it me?

329
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,840
Is it you?

330
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,120
Neither.

331
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,440
We'll just stand in a safe place

332
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,440
and watch the children
who lost their footing

333
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,800
get swept under the waves.

334
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
As a leader,

335
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,080
the most shameful thing

336
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,680
isn't losing yourself.

337
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,360
It's watching your subordinates

338
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,880
pay the price

339
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,320
for your own wrong decisions.

340
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,520
I, Qu Zhonghui,

341
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,320
don't want that.

342
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,760
Why are you still here?
Didn't I tell you to go back?

343
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,280
Why is Mr. Qu looking for me?

344
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,880
It's none of your business.

345
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Go home.

346
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,120
Mr. Su is in a meeting. Just tell me.

347
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
Okay, I'll write it down now.

348
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,120
Yes, go ahead.

349
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,360
- 139…
- Hello, Consumer Goods Team.

350
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,160
- You're Mr. Liu, right?
- Go ahead.

351
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,280
Okay, I'll pass it on.

352
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,520
- Bye.
- Okay.

353
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,240
Okay, we'll be right down.

354
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,280
We'll be right down.

355
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,960
- What's wrong?
- We have a problem, Mr. Yin.

356
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,200
What is it?

357
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,160
The building management
said your car was hit.

358
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,040
What are you doing?

359
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,880
12 HOURS AGO

360
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,200
Will this work?

361
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,600
Why not?

362
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,800
Let me tell you.

363
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,040
I replaced it
exactly like Yin Shengchao's.

364
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,080
Let me tell you. Look.

365
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,640
Even the scratches on the screen

366
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,880
and the screen saver.

367
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,680
I chose the exact same one as him.

368
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,880
Are you stupid?

369
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,880
Won't everything be exposed
once he unlocks it?

370
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,200
Five minutes.

371
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,720
I guarantee that you won't be discovered
within five minutes.

372
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,680
Transfer the data.

373
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,440
Once it's unlocked, leave.

374
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,560
I'll find a chance

375
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,840
to switch the phones back.

376
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
What's wrong, baby?

377
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,680
Baby, where are you hurt?

378
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,440
Little Martha.

379
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,960
Where are you hurt?

380
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,800
Where?

381
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,080
- No, here.
- Move your hands.

382
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,240
Did you wash your hands?

383
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,920
I don't think the car was hit.

384
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,440
Who called just now? Property management?

385
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,600
I don't know.

386
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,720
Anyway, someone said

387
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,200
your car got hit.

388
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
I know.

389
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,720
It must be someone
jealous of your new car.

390
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,280
That's why they called
to tell you that your car got hit.

391
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,320
They're messing with us.

392
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,640
Who is it?

393
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,360
You're crazy!

394
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,360
Let's go.

395
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,240
<i>As a leader,</i>

396
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,880
<i>the most shameful thing</i>

397
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,360
isn't losing yourself.

398
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,080
It's watching your subordinates

399
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,600
pay the price

400
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,400
for your own wrong decisions.

401
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,920
I, Qu Zhonghui,

402
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,720
don't want that.

403
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,400
Good morning.

404
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,240
Why is Mr. Qu treating me to lunch?

405
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,080
Is it related to Rihuan BioTech?

406
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,680
Didn't I tell you?

407
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,520
Mr. Qu just wants to treat you to a meal.

408
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,640
Don't overthink it.

409
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,760
By the way,

410
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,560
the Risk Control Center
has approved the online education project.

411
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,720
You can start working on the rest.

412
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,160
What about Rihuan BioTech?

413
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,120
Finish the task I gave you first.

414
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,200
Okay.

415
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,560
What's going on?

416
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,320
Did Mr. Qu treat you to a meal?

417
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,880
The phone is ringing.

418
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Hello?

419
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
Yes.

420
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,760
Okay, I'll be right there.

421
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,240
Mr. Wu, Mr. Li is asking for me.

422
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,880
Yiqiu,

423
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,760
I know I'm not good at chess.

424
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,400
But you don't have to go easy on me.

425
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,840
I didn't.

426
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,320
People can lie.

427
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,160
But chess can't.

428
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,080
Winning a game

429
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,120
where the opponent
lets you win isn't meaningful.

430
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,200
You could have won 20 moves ago.

431
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
I didn't see it.

432
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,760
It's not that you didn't see it.

433
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,400
You were too greedy.

434
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,120
It's right here.

435
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,040
It looks

436
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,960
like it's alone, far from the battlefield.

437
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,800
But it's actually
a brilliant move for you.

438
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,800
With that,

439
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,680
it's indeed eye-opening.

440
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,000
But after that,

441
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,040
you'll lose your touch.

442
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
In order to protect this piece,

443
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,160
you've invested too much.

444
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,600
In the grand scheme of things,

445
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,600
it has become a burden.

446
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,160
If you're willing
to let go of this small piece

447
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,400
and put it away…

448
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,360
Look.

449
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,880
The game is back to life.

450
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,960
I'm just a lousy chess player.

451
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,320
Yet I'm giving
an expert like you a lesson.

452
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,240
I'm ashamed.

453
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,040
Do you want some tea?

454
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,120
- Shengchao
- What?

455
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,360
Your watch is worth
over 100,000 yuan, right?

456
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,160
You know your stuff.

457
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,440
You're the best, Shengchao.

458
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,200
Most people don't know this model.

459
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,800
Really? It's not bad.

460
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,440
All right.

461
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
Hello?

462
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,120
I don't need it.

463
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,840
Thank you. Don't call again.

464
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,840
Bye.

465
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,000
Liar.

466
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,080
There are too many liars now.

467
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,240
This isn't my phone.

468
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,760
Mr. Yin.

469
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,760
What are you two doing here?

470
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,760
This is yours.

471
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,120
During the meeting,

472
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,240
I took it by mistake.

473
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,960
They do look alike.

474
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,240
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

475
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,440
Let's go.

476
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,120
Gao Sicong.

477
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,280
Why are you so stupid?

478
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,320
It's so simple.

479
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,560
I can't believe you got caught.

480
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,720
Simple?

481
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,520
Why don't you do it yourself?

482
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,800
Let's not talk about that now.

483
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,080
Did you get it?

484
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,760
Mr. Jiang came
when I was about to crack it.

485
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
But…

486
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
But what?

487
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,400
On his phone,

488
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,200
I saw a missed call.

489
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,440
The number called him many times,

490
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,040
but he never picked up.

491
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,040
That's useless.

492
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,320
What if it's a courier?

493
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,600
That number was unique.

494
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,680
I think

495
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,440
it's from overseas.

496
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,720
What's the number?

497
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
I forgot.

498
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Can you do it or not?

499
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,720
- Do what?
- Let me think about it.

500
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,880
Tell me.

501
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,400
What are you doing?

502
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,280
If you don't tell me,

503
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,480
I'll go find Yin Shengchao now.

504
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,520
That's what happened.

505
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
That's all.

506
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,880
Are you that confident

507
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,200
about your own suspicions?

508
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
Even if the truth

509
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,320
is what you say it is,

510
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,680
do you think what you're doing now

511
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
can be forgiven?

512
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,080
This ends here.

513
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,520
Don't cause any more trouble, okay?

514
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,560
- But--
- I'm doing this for you.

515
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,960
You attempted to hack your colleague's
phone and steal the information.

516
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,080
It has nothing to do with your motive.

517
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,760
If this gets out,

518
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,760
Yin Shengchao will be finished.

519
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,200
And so will you.

520
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,640
I'll pretend

521
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,720
I don't know anything about today.

522
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,040
You may leave now.

523
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,480
- Mr. Jiang.
- Get back to work.

524
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,280
Mr. Jiang.

525
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,200
What is it?

526
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,800
The missed calls

527
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,040
on Mr. Yin's phone.

528
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
You saw it too, right?

529
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,520
They weren't ordinary domestic calls.

530
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,080
So

531
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,600
if Hao Shuai's guess is right,

532
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,480
maybe Yin Shengchao

533
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,800
is really connected
to the boss who ran away.

534
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,840
What if he's wrong?

535
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,920
If things get out of hand,

536
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,160
are you okay with being dismissed

537
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,240
along with him?

538
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,120
I…

539
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,040
I'm willing to believe him.

540
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,520
Hao Shuai

541
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,120
may seem like a troublemaker,

542
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,880
but he has been doing this for so long.

543
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,120
He must have his reasons.

544
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,440
So I was thinking

545
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,120
even though I didn't get him
any useful information this time,

546
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,960
a set of phone numbers

547
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,960
shouldn't be against the rules.

548
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,200
Show me the numbers you memorized.

549
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,160
Okay.

550
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

551
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,320
Close the door.

552
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,080
What's so mysterious?

553
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,760
Why did you want to meet here?

554
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,040
About Rihuan BioTech,

555
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,680
it's time to make a decision.

556
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,640
The results of the overseas investigation
aren't out yet.

557
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,080
It should be soon, right?

558
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,160
Notify Rihuan BioTech to lift the alarm.

559
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,120
Got it.

560
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,800
We're not investigating further?

561
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,160
Why?

562
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,960
Because of Yiqiu.

563
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,800
What does Rihuan BioTech
have to do with Mr. Sun?

564
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
Why don't you get it?

565
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,080
If Rihuan BioTech doesn't go public,

566
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,200
the company won't keep Yiqiu.

567
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,720
When Yiqiu unexpectedly
renewed the contract,

568
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
it was for the same reason.

569
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,920
This is a transaction between Team Four

570
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,160
and the company.

571
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,520
Kezhi.

572
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,880
But…

573
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,520
What if there's a problem
with Rihuan BioTech?

574
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,120
I have to choose
between this project and Mr. Sun.

575
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,640
What can I do?

576
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,160
Don't think about it. Let it be.

577
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,680
<i>In order to protect this piece,</i>

578
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,000
<i>you've invested too much.</i>

579
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,440
<i>In the grand scheme of things,</i>

580
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,159
<i>it has become a burden.</i>

581
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,480
What's wrong?

582
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,120
Nothing.

583
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,040
Nothing.

584
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,400
Let's go eat.

585
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,280
Why are you looking at me?

586
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,640
Mr. Sun's contract has been renewed

587
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,080
and we haven't celebrated yet.

588
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,800
Let's go. It's my treat.

589
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,280
- What about Rihuan BioTech?
- It's over.

590
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,640
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

591
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,760
Congratulations
on your contract renewal, Mr. Sun.

592
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,400
We've already toasted.

593
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,920
We've already toasted for that.

594
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,200
Really? We've already…

595
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,880
Can't we toast again?

596
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,560
- What's wrong?
- That's right.

597
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,800
Fatty.

598
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,720
Today is a happy day.

599
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,080
Drink as much as you want.

600
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,040
Drink up.

601
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,360
- Come on.
- Cheers.

602
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,040
- Hao Shuai.
- What?

603
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,280
- Come with me.
- No.

604
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,280
Come here.

605
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,320
What do you want?

606
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,720
Read this and you'll know.

607
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,240
An apology letter?

608
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,480
I don't accept your apology.

609
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,760
Take a look.

610
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
What is this?

611
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,000
Mr. Jiang also saw the missed call.

612
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,600
He's very sensitive to numbers.

613
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,080
So this number

614
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,280
can't be wrong.

615
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,480
Really?

616
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
That's great.

617
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,080
My job is done.

618
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,400
The rest is up to you.

619
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,880
Don't worry.

620
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,600
Leave the rest to me.

621
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,880
There's only one number.

622
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,080
Can we really find the person
you're talking about?

623
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,600
My intuition tells me

624
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,520
that the owner of this number

625
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,640
must be up to something.

626
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,600
Libo.

627
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,520
Libo!

628
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,320
Cheers.

629
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,640
No one wants to drink with you.

630
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,080
Clean it up and let's go.

631
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,560
Come with me.

632
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,120
No, this way.

633
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,040
Let's go.

634
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
Mr. Wu.

635
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,880
Mr. Wu.

636
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,440
Thank you.

637
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,840
For what?

638
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
I…

639
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,880
The fact that I can stay

640
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,320
has something to do
with the Rihuan BioTech case, right?

641
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,960
Don't flatter yourself.

642
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,240
Mr. Sun, I'm serious.

643
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,520
It's none of your business.

644
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,840
Do you still remember?

645
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,400
On the first day we met,

646
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,400
I told you in the car, I said…

647
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,560
The reason I'm like this is because

648
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,680
I didn't try hard enough.

649
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,440
Do you remember?

650
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,760
My selling point is that

651
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,680
I'm hardworking.

652
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,920
Actually, I lied.

653
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,080
It has nothing to do

654
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,160
with whether I try hard or not.

655
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,200
It's because I think my life

656
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,680
is hopeless.

657
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,120
But I don't think that way anymore.

658
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,480
Because I have a little bit of hope

659
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,720
in my life now.

660
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,040
So wherever I go,

661
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,160
<i>I'll bring</i>

662
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,600
that tiny bit of hope with me.

663
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,000
Really.

664
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,480
That tiny bit of hope.

665
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,720
It's enough.

666
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,440
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

667
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,640
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

668
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,120
Here's a toast

669
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,640
to you.

670
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,080
