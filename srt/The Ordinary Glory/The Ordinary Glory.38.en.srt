1
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,360
<i>Mr. Qu.</i>

2
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,360
Sun Yiqiu is about to leave.

3
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
If it's possible,

4
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
I don't want him to leave
the company just like that.

5
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,080
Training a new hire costs a lot of money.

6
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,600
Mr. Qu.

7
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,720
Can you please do something?

8
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,840
I'm the one who makes the rules,

9
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,200
so I can't simply break my own rules.

10
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
But

11
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,560
the personnel arrangements for each team

12
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,520
are adjusted to accommodate
the different sizes of projects.

13
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,480
If Team Four has a project
that's big enough,

14
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,400
then…

15
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,600
Of course, it's too late
to talk about this.

16
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you for your hard work.

17
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,640
Keep it up.

18
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,160
Good morning.

19
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,680
Good morning.

20
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,600
Good morning.

21
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,520
Good morning.

22
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,800
A message from Mr. Wu.

23
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,280
Don't tell me

24
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,800
he wants us to work overtime again.

25
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,920
Yiqiu, what is it?

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,120
No.

27
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,160
What was Mr. Wu trying
to take in this photo?

28
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,280
This won't do. I have to delete it.

29
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,640
Qianyi, you…

30
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,720
I already deleted it, okay?

31
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,240
- Sicong.
- Okay, I deleted it.

32
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,120
Qiuqiu, you're the only one left.

33
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,200
I don't want to do it.

34
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,600
What do you mean?

35
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,560
You can't keep such an embarrassing photo.

36
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,760
I'm leaving.

37
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,200
My contract is ending soon.

38
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,160
I'm keeping this photo as a memento.

39
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,760
I'll get going.

40
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,640
What did he say? Did you hear him?

41
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,280
No, say something, you two.

42
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,440
UNEQUALED PUBLISHED BY WILEY

43
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,320
You got discharged so soon.

44
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,600
I was so worried at the hospital.

45
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,480
Now, I'm finally relieved.

46
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,440
Thank you.

47
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,600
What's wrong?

48
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,480
Isn't the Rihuan project Mr. Qu's?

49
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,200
It seems like a good thing.

50
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,280
If nothing goes wrong, yes.

51
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,120
What do you think will go wrong?

52
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm not sure yet.

53
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,360
After completing this project,

54
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,720
King Capital would be on track to compete
in the medical technology field.

55
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,240
Mr. Qu's position
in the company will rise too.

56
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
But you can't blame him.

57
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
He has done so much for King Capital,

58
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,720
so he must've wanted
to get something for himself.

59
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,320
If you think it's a problem, just say no.

60
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Why are you hesitating?

61
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
The personnel arrangements for each team

62
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,600
are adjusted to accommodate
the different sizes of projects.

63
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,480
<i>If Team Four has a project
that's big enough,</i>

64
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,600
<i>then…</i>

65
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,440
It's nothing.

66
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,160
Let me know
if there's anything I can do to help.

67
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,400
It's your favorite green plum wine.

68
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,240
I learned how to make it.

69
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,520
Please, Mr. Wu.

70
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,000
What's the occasion?
You even let me drink.

71
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,120
If I don't let you drink,
how can I get you to tell the truth?

72
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,520
Are you still worried about that kid?

73
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,400
I've been thinking
about how to make him stay.

74
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,960
Now that I finally have a chance,

75
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,520
I don't know if I should help him.

76
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,840
What will happen if you help him?

77
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,760
We might get into trouble.

78
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,720
What if you don't help him?

79
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,720
Actually, you already know the answer.

80
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,920
I remember what you said before.

81
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,720
You said, "If I don't do
the things I'm supposed to do,

82
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,480
I'll regret it in the future.

83
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,040
I'm not afraid of trouble.

84
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,240
I'm already used to it."

85
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,840
I'm afraid that
whenever you think of today,

86
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,440
you'd have to drink alone.

87
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,960
<i>It's 8:10 a.m.</i>

88
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,000
<i>It has the best sunlight, the best air,</i>

89
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,280
<i>and the worst traffic of the day.</i>

90
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,440
<i>In this city,</i>

91
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,799
<i>countless people go out at this hour</i>

92
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,520
<i>to start their day at work.</i>

93
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,799
<i>At work,</i>

94
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,200
<i>they will meet friends, rivals,</i>

95
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,280
<i>the people they like and hate.</i>

96
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,040
<i>They'll meet trouble</i>

97
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,440
<i>and also encounter happy things.</i>

98
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,280
<i>To them,</i>

99
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,640
<i>it's just an ordinary day</i>

100
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,720
<i>in their long lives.</i>

101
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,200
<i>But to me,</i>

102
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,200
<i>it's the last day</i>

103
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,920
<i>of a memory I will treasure.</i>

104
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,840
<i>I shall end today's game like this.</i>

105
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,200
Yiqiu.

106
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,320
Are you really

107
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,760
going to leave…

108
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,560
Yes.

109
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,400
Aren't you going to talk to Mr. Wu again?

110
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
He did his best.

111
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,640
That's because he's alone.

112
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,240
I've discussed it with Sicong.

113
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,920
Sicong can plead with Ms. Yu.

114
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,040
She's on good terms with Team Four.

115
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,960
It's a long shot,

116
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,520
but I can ask Mr. Ma
what he thinks about this.

117
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,960
If more of us can talk to--

118
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,240
Qianyi.

119
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,440
Thank you.

120
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,560
But I really don't want
to cause you any trouble.

121
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,920
If you must leave,

122
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,920
no matter what HR says, remember this.

123
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,520
Firstly, don't write a resignation letter.

124
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,920
Secondly, insist to the company
that you intend to renew your contract.

125
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,800
If the company disagrees,
demand compensation.

126
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Otherwise,

127
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,440
be it a non-compete agreement
or non-disclosure agreement,

128
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,360
don't sign anything.

129
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Do you understand?

130
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,000
What are you laughing at?

131
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,760
Nothing.

132
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,120
Thank you.

133
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,640
I'll go upstairs first.

134
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,360
Otherwise, Mr. Wu will scold me.

135
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,280
Come in.

136
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,320
Kezhi.

137
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,160
What's the matter?

138
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,120
Mr. Qu.

139
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
Why do you insist that Team Four

140
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,560
take on the Rihuan BioTech project?

141
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,880
Let's sit down and talk.

142
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,440
Tell me first.

143
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,720
Why can't Team Four take on this project?

144
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,000
Because it's your project.

145
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,360
Many people in the company think
that this project is flourishing.

146
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,880
They say you can just pick the fruit
after waiting a few days.

147
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,560
Others would kill for that.

148
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,240
But you seem to be avoiding it.

149
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
You're very cautious.

150
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,440
Your intuition tells you
that there's something wrong.

151
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,520
But I'm handing this project over to you

152
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,720
because of your keen sense of smell.

153
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,200
Mr. Qu.

154
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,680
What's wrong with this project?

155
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,000
Rihuan BioTech

156
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,320
recently received an anonymous letter

157
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,760
asking them to withdraw their listing.

158
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,240
Otherwise, they'll report
the problem of their product to the CSRC.

159
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,080
During the IPO,

160
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,720
smearing campaigns from competitors

161
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,320
and blackmail from scheming individuals

162
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,840
are common occurrences.

163
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,760
If someone succeeds,

164
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,200
someone else will fail.

165
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,600
But

166
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,800
I've put years of effort
into Rihuan BioTech.

167
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,000
I have to make it go public.

168
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,520
So you want us to take care
of this anonymous letter.

169
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,560
Find out who wrote it

170
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,000
and put an end to it.

171
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,680
Kezhi.

172
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,560
As long as you agree,

173
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,080
if you want to keep one or two people,

174
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,840
it won't be a problem for the company.

175
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,520
Hi, this is Integrated Team Four.

176
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,320
I'll be right there. Okay.

177
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,200
Mr. Wu, I'm going to Human Resources.

178
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,280
Where are you going?

179
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,680
- Human Resources.
- Wait.

180
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,920
That's what I want to discuss.

181
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,560
- Move.
- No.

182
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,080
Yiqiu, listen.

183
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,400
When Qianyi and Sicong get here,

184
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
we'll discuss it together, okay?

185
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,800
Move.

186
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,000
There's no other way.

187
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,240
Thank you.

188
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,200
Are we just going to let him go?

189
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,840
Say something.

190
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,000
What can I say?

191
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,400
Think of something.
Let's look for someone and beg.

192
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,920
We can't just watch him leave.

193
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,160
He's about to leave.
We need to do something.

194
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,120
I'm begging you.

195
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,360
I'll call Mr. Qu. Talk to him, okay?

196
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,000
He won't leave.

197
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,000
What?

198
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,200
The company wants to renew your contract.

199
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,400
I'm asking for your personal opinion.

200
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,440
Sun Yiqiu,

201
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,000
are you willing
to continue working with King Capital?

202
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,160
You're so annoying.

203
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,640
How do you know he can stay?

204
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,280
Just eat.

205
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,200
What's going on?

206
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,120
Mr. Sun.

207
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,120
Mr. Sun.

208
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,360
Mr. Sun, congratulations.

209
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,920
He's back. He's back again.

210
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
Hurry.

211
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,240
Yiqiu, congratulations.

212
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,160
How did you know…

213
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,120
Mr. Wu, you're so sharp.

214
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,040
Well…

215
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,040
Why are we still eating here? Let's go.

216
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,720
What do you want to eat today?

217
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,360
It's my treat.

218
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,400
- No, it's on me. It should be on me.
- What…

219
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,920
What? What you said is…

220
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,200
very understanding.

221
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,280
Hurry up.

222
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,000
- What should…
- Mr. Wu, what do you want to eat?

223
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,240
I'm still busy. Maybe next time.

224
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,360
No matter how busy you are,
you still have to eat.

225
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,480
What's the rush?

226
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,960
Mr. Sun is staying.
We have plenty of time to eat together.

227
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,120
Also,

228
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,520
since Mr. Sun is staying,

229
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,800
you two should work on
the online education project

230
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,240
he was previously in charge of.

231
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,560
Okay.

232
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,160
Don't just think about eating.

233
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,560
I'm not. I…

234
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,840
QU ZHONGHUI: I'M COUNTING ON YOU!

235
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,240
Yiqiu said he has to work,
so he's not coming.

236
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,480
How could he stand us up
on such a celebratory moment?

237
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,440
He's not coming?

238
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,960
At a time like this,
he'd rather celebrate with Team Four.

239
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,040
Yiqiu is quite lucky.

240
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,400
It's probably the first time

241
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,400
our company renewed
a one-year employee contract.

242
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,200
Yiqiu is amazing.

243
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,240
He caught that crook, Lu Siqiu,

244
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,080
restarted Micro Theater,
and worked on your <i>Justice Online</i>.

245
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,720
Plenty of reasons to renew his contract.

246
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,040
That's right.

247
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,640
Yiqiu has done a lot in the past year.

248
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,520
More than you, at least.

249
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,400
Fine.

250
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,680
I'll pay, okay?

251
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,840
Hey. Where are you going?

252
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,000
Am I that prickly?

253
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,680
No, I didn't see you.

254
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,680
Are you eating here too?

255
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,040
I'll pay for his table too.

256
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,600
No need.

257
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,600
You did a good job with Morfan.

258
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,720
This is your reward.

259
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,880
Go on.

260
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,800
CREDIT LIMIT: 1,000,000 YUAN

261
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,360
Here you go.

262
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,480
Thank you, Shengchao.

263
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,480
Shengchao, Hao Shuai, come here.

264
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,200
Let me tell you.

265
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,360
Police have started
investigating Morfan's case.

266
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,040
Our company is one of the victims.

267
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,160
I've put in a good word
with the higher-ups.

268
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,800
That's why they won't hold
our team responsible for now.

269
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,040
You…

270
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,480
Learn from your mistakes.

271
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,120
I will reflect on myself.

272
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,600
One more thing.

273
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,080
The liquidation process
for this project has officially started.

274
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Find some time and make a trip to Morfan.

275
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,720
Collect all the information
related to our collaboration with them

276
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,760
and compile everything.

277
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,920
Do we still have to go?

278
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,280
What else?

279
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,840
Did you hear that, Hao Shuai?

280
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,480
Yes.

281
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,440
Don't worry.

282
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,600
How can I not worry?

283
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,920
Why are we still going?

284
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,120
It's never-ending.

285
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,560
Why are you spacing out?

286
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,000
Get back to work.

287
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,120
PRICE: 18,000 YUAN

288
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,880
Okay, that's all for today.

289
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,280
We'll discuss the rest together tomorrow.

290
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,000
Okay.

291
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,840
What are you laughing at?

292
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,400
Nothing.

293
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,920
I just think

294
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,640
it's pretty amazing
that I can still see you tomorrow.

295
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,160
We didn't get to have lunch,
so we can't miss dinner again.

296
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,640
We have to celebrate with Mr. Sun.

297
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,680
Mr. Wu.

298
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,400
What did you say?

299
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,640
What's wrong with you today?

300
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,800
I said we have to celebrate with Mr. Sun.

301
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,680
I told you not to rush.

302
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,760
Not tonight.

303
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,120
My wife told me to go home early.

304
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,160
I'm not asking you to pay.

305
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
Mr. Sun.

306
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,880
Since you're staying,

307
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,280
do your best.

308
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,320
Don't embarrass Team Four.

309
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,640
Okay.

310
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,080
Mr. Ding.

311
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,560
Come, Mr. Ding.

312
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,800
The three of us…

313
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,360
I'll pass.

314
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,560
I have work to do at home.

315
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,680
Okay.

316
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,600
Yiqiu.

317
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,720
Congratulations.

318
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
Thank you.

319
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
Okay, see you tomorrow.

320
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,040
Does Mr. Ding not like team dinners?

321
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,360
No, that's the way he is.

322
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,800
If only

323
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
he stayed with us back then.

324
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,600
Did something happen?

325
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,520
Mr. Ding used to work with me and Mr. Wu

326
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,240
on Integrated Team Two.

327
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,400
You know that, right?

328
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,000
Later on,

329
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,320
because of his good performance

330
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,960
and capability,

331
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,080
he got promoted,

332
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,520
transferred to another division,

333
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,400
and handled projects independently.

334
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,360
Libo is really capable.

335
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,800
He completed a big project on his own.

336
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,160
At first, everyone thought

337
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,560
it wouldn't take long
for him to create a unicorn.

338
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,840
So what happened?

339
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,040
He blew it.

340
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,200
It's all because

341
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,120
of that little oversight
that he didn't notice

342
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,080
and was taken advantage of
by a corporate competitor.

343
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,000
The whole project collapsed in an instant.

344
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,720
He worked hard for three years

345
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,760
on this project.

346
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,720
He even neglected his family.

347
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,520
He lost everything

348
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,640
in one night.

349
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,280
<i>I heard</i>

350
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,760
<i>Libo was really depressed at that time.</i>

351
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,040
<i>He almost broke down.</i>

352
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,600
<i>He became dysfunctional.</i>

353
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,160
<i>The company had no choice</i>

354
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,520
<i>but to put him
on entrusted management work.</i>

355
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,160
<i>So when he was able to come back
and work in Team Four with us,</i>

356
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,640
<i>I already thought it was a miracle.</i>

357
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,400
<i>He needs to slowly let go</i>

358
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,240
<i>of whatever is bothering him on his own.</i>

359
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,760
All right, that's enough.

360
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,200
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

361
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
But they're not going.

362
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,720
What a waste.

363
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,480
Do they not want me to stay?

364
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
No, don't talk nonsense.

365
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,640
Look, when Mr. Wu found out
your contract was about to expire,

366
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,440
he worried about you every day.

367
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,360
Let's do it another day.

368
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,360
Another day, okay?

369
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,400
Okay.

370
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,640
I'll get going too.

371
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,640
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

372
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,960
<i>The company wants to renew your contract.</i>

373
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,160
<i>I'm asking for your personal opinion.</i>

374
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,360
<i>Sun Yiqiu,</i>

375
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,080
<i>are you willing
to continue working with King Capital?</i>

376
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,720
Since you're staying,

377
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,840
do your best.

378
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,720
Don't embarrass Team Four.

379
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,280
<i>I never thought</i>

380
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,600
<i>I'd stay.</i>

381
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,520
<i>Until now,</i>

382
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,880
<i>I still don't know how I ended up staying.</i>

383
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,040
WU KEZHI

384
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,200
I WILL DO MY BEST! THANK YOU!

385
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,800
SUN YIQIU: I WILL DO MY BEST! THANK YOU!

386
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,640
How's it going, buddy?

387
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,960
<i>Kezhi, you're bothering me again.</i>

388
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,520
You're an audit expert.
Who else could I bother?

389
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,240
How did it go? Did you find anything?

390
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,120
<i>- It's about Rihuan BioTech, right?</i>
- Yes.

391
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,280
Rihuan BioTech.

392
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,480
<i>I've asked around.</i>

393
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,360
<i>There's nothing wrong with the company.</i>

394
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,640
Is there really no problem?

395
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,160
Are you sure?

396
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,120
<i>Kezhi.</i>

397
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,920
<i>Regarding this company,</i>

398
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,200
<i>at least from the information
you've provided so far,</i>

399
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,840
<i>it looks okay.</i>

400
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,840
<i>As for the actual situation,</i>

401
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,000
<i>you'll have to investigate it yourself
before you decide.</i>

402
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,360
Okay, I got it.

403
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,200
- I'll buy you a drink next time.
<i>- Of course. It has been a while.</i>

404
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,480
DING LIBO

405
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,080
When I first left Team Two,

406
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,360
I did work on
the Rihuan BioTech project for a while.

407
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,120
But you know what happened after that.

408
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,160
I was busy with other things,

409
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,480
so I handed this project back
to the company.

410
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,960
Why?

411
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
Is Mr. Qu asking you to manage it?

412
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,720
It's handed over to Team Four.

413
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,440
Anonymous letter.

414
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,920
Is this the problem
the company wants us to solve?

415
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,680
What do you need me to do?

416
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,000
Get the full picture of the project first.

417
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,720
Also,

418
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,640
I'd like

419
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,840
to keep this between us.

420
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,680
Why?

421
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,440
Okay.

422
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,160
I'll contact my friends
who still work at Rihuan

423
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,880
and see if I can find any clues.

424
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,720
Kezhi.

425
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,080
I know

426
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,640
you might have some concerns.

427
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,360
After all, it's Mr. Qu's project.

428
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,600
Actually,

429
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,520
I think this matter

430
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,920
might be a good opportunity for us.

431
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,600
Don't think too much.

432
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,680
Fifteen days, right?

433
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,960
As long as we resolve this within 15 days,

434
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,600
there won't be any problems.

435
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,360
Keep in touch.

436
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,760
Where are you going? It's so early.

437
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,520
Good morning, Mr. Wu.

438
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,440
Where are you going?

439
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
When you go to Morfan
to gather information,

440
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,200
avoid talking to the employees.

441
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,440
- It's better if you don't say anything.
- I understand.

442
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,760
Do you really understand?

443
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,200
I know you're a busybody,

444
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,520
but be smart this time.

445
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,760
Don't cause trouble for the company.

446
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,880
Don't worry, Shengchao.

447
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,080
Shit!

448
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,680
Are you crazy?

449
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,640
Would you drive so close
if I were driving a Maserati?

450
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,760
I'd make you go broke!

451
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,080
PRICE: 11,000 YUAN

452
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,320
He scared me.

453
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,480
Shengchao.

454
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,240
Is that a new belt?

455
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,120
I saw it in a magazine.

456
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,920
It's an international luxury brand.
It costs over 10,000 yuan, right?

457
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,920
- It's fake.
- Let me see.

458
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,680
Stop it. Let's go.

459
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,960
If it's fake, just show me.

460
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,120
- Young man, slow down. Let me help you.
- I'm fine.

461
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,960
Are these all the information
and documents your boss left behind?

462
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,920
Yes.

463
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,680
Everything we can find is here.

464
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,200
By the way, young man,

465
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,040
can these documents help you
find that Zhou guy?

466
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,320
Well…

467
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,040
It's the police's job to make arrests.

468
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,080
We…

469
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,000
Then…

470
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,800
Why are you looking for these documents?

471
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,920
Isn't the company going
through a liquidation process?

472
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
We need to understand
the company's operations.

473
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,080
In the end,

474
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,360
the money goes to your company.

475
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,040
I'm sorry.

476
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,800
Forget it.

477
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
It's no use talking to you.

478
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,880
If you're done packing,

479
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,040
you can leave on your own.

480
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,520
SHANGHAI MORFAN APPAREL

481
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,560
BASTARD

482
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,320
Mr. Yin.

483
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,200
Okay, I'll be right down.

484
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,840
SHANGHAI RIHUAN BIOTECH

485

GENE TECHNOLOGY
ADEPT AT IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY

486
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,960
Mr. Wu.

487
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,600
Well…

488
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
What's wrong?

489
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,480
Can you take a look
at this letter of intent for me?

490
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,440
Kezhi.

491
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,360
Kezhi.

492
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,120
What are you doing?

493
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,760
Are you secretly trying to make a fortune?

494
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,280
You have such a stroke of good luck.

495
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,000
If I don't go gossip in Risk Control,
you won't tell me, right?

496
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,040
Don't.

497
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,400
Fine, your Team Four is on a roll.

498
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,000
It's a double celebration.

499
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,160
What do you mean?

500
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,240
How is it a double celebration?

501
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,920
Are you still pretending?

502
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,560
Do I have to spell it out for you?

503
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,240
Team Four got a big project for nothing.

504
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,160
It's getting listed in a few days…

505
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,720
Maybe not.

506
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,280
Don't you want me to sign the document?

507
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,080
Aren't you in a hurry?
Where's the document?

508
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,280
Give it to me. Hurry.

509
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,360
What do you do all day at work?

510
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,440
What project is getting listed?

511
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,160
Mr. Wu.

512
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,040
DING LIBO

513
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,400
Hey.

514
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,320
Hold on.

515
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,520
Drink this.

516
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,680
I just made it.

517
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,360
Thank you.

518
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,240
Don't mention it.

519
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,200
Don't burn yourself.

520
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,960
Where are you going?

521
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,840
Do you need anything?

522
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,640
Sit here. Let's talk.

523
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,600
I…

524
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,480
Sit down and have a chat.

525
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,080
No, just tell me what you want to say.

526
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,840
Stop making weird faces.

527
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,360
You're scaring me.

528
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,360
It's nothing.

529
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,400
I just have a small question.

530
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,239
I want to ask you about it.

531
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,960
Go ahead.

532
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,719
You talked to Mr. Wu about a big project.

533
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,120
What's going on?

534
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,040
- I have a document to sign.
- Don't.

535
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,600
What are you doing?

536
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,360
No, didn't you say that

537
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,679
a project is getting listed in a few days

538
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,480
and something about a stroke of good luck?

539
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,400
Since you already said most of it,

540
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,679
why don't you tell me everything?

541
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,639
Let me ask you.

542
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,920
Did you ask Mr. Wu about this?

543
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,120
I did.

544
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,600
Did he tell you?

545
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,040
No.

546
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,000
Then do you think it's okay to ask me?

547
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,000
Not okay, right?

548
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,600
<i>Ever since Mr. Zhou mentioned
that mysterious big project,</i>

549
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,200
<i>Team Four's atmosphere
has been a bit strange.</i>

550
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,840
<i>Mr. Wu and Mr. Ding
seem to be busy with something</i>

551
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,680
<i>that they want to hide
from Mr. Lin and me.</i>

552
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,120
<i>Most of the day,
they are nowhere to be seen in the office.</i>

553
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,680
<i>But speaking of strange people,</i>

554
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,920
<i>Team Four members aren't the only ones.</i>

555
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,120
What?

556
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,280
- Calfskin.
- What calfskin?

557
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,640
Your belt.

558
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,600
What about it?

559
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,400
Judging from the wear and tear,
you've used it for two months.

560
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,040
The price should be
between 150 and 280 yuan, right?

561
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,520
Amazing. How did you know?

562
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,800
I knew I wouldn't be wrong.

563
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,680
So there must be something.

564
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,600
Something is fishy.

565
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,600
Hey.

566
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,080
Good morning.

567
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,480
Good morning.

568
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,880
You look well lately.

569
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,440
Really?

570
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,960
I heard that

571
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,160
you're in charge of your own project.

572
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,720
And

573
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,720
Mr. Ma asked you to do it.

574
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,320
Congratulations. When are you treating us?

575
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,240
Let's invite them too.

576
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,560
Why are you touching me?

577
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,720
This belt is from Italy.
Crocodile leather pin buckle.

578
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,000
It's 1,800 yuan, right?

579
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,120
Yes, but why are you studying belts?

580
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,680
I'm just testing my superpower.

581
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,480
My family has made clothes
since I was a kid.

582
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,520
So no matter what clothing item they are,

583
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,000
I just need to touch them

584
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,120
and I'll be 80% to 90% correct
about their brand, texture, and price.

585
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,280
What are you up to now?

586
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,400
I'm not up to anything.

587
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,080
I'm telling you.
Something's fishy about Yin Shengchao.

588
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,760
Dude, aren't you over that?

589
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,480
Let me finish.

590
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,680
Yin Shengchao bought a shirt two days ago.

591
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,360
It's 18,600 yuan.

592
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,320
Mr. Yin?

593
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,240
It's a knockoff, right?

594
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,960
That's impossible.

595
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,400
It's from Milan Fashion Week's
latest runway collection.

596
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,520
You can only get it overseas.
There are no knockoffs.

597
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,040
Also, I found out yesterday

598
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,760
that he changed his belt.

599
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,880
It's over 10,000 yuan.

600
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,840
I can vouch for it.
It's authentic and the best luxury item.

601
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,760
So?

602
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,240
So

603
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,240
Yin Shengchao doesn't have
any top-rated projects, right?

604
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,920
How did he suddenly become so rich?

605
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,280
Especially after the scandal
with Morfan Apparel.

606
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,440
Hao Shuai, you can't say anything
without concrete evidence.

607
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,800
It's fine if you vent it out to us.

608
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,320
But if it really gets out,

609
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,480
you'd be implying Yin Shengchao

610
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,320
is involved in the Morfan Apparel scandal.

611
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,560
Do you know what that means?

612
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,280
It means he's finished.

613
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,800
No, you'll be finished.

614
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,200
That's right, Hao Shuai.

615
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,120
No matter what, he's your boss.

616
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,760
If you don't get along with him,

617
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,720
it'll be hard for you
to survive in this company.

618
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,600
Sure.

619
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,120
If we don't get along with our boss,
we can't survive.

620
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,360
Qianyi, you fought with Mr. Ma.

621
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,160
Sicong, you were at odds with Mr. Jiang.

622
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,640
You guys don't have

623
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,000
the right to lecture me.

624
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,400
We didn't mean it that way.

625
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,760
I don't care.

626
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,920
Even if you don't investigate with me,

627
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,320
I'll get to the bottom of this.

628
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,920
Hao Shuai.

629
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,240
I hope

630
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,640
Hao Shuai doesn't cause any trouble.

631
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,760
Mr. Lin, Finance already
stamped this contract.

632
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,200
Leave it there.

633
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,320
And I've revised this part
of the online education project report.

634
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,080
Okay, I'll take a look when I'm free.

635
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,360
What did Mr. Zhou say
about the big project?

636
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,200
He didn't say anything.

637
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,480
Is Mr. Wu hiding it from us?

638
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,720
What? Stop imagining things.

639
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,120
If something happened,
could he hide it from me?

640
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,800
Get back to work.

641
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,600
Any news?

642
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
I've asked everyone I know,

643
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,760
including the employees at Rihuan.

644
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,400
None of them can tell me
where this anonymous letter came from.

645
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,640
There are two possibilities for the people

646
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,280
who can release this anonymous letter

647
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,800
right before Rihuan's IPO.

648
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,400
It's either an insider or an outsider.

649
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,360
Externally, it's a competitor
who doesn't want to see the IPO succeed.

650
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,880
Internally,

651
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,600
it's someone who bears resentment

652
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,520
because they won't get
as much as expected from Rihuan's IPO.

653
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,680
We still don't know
either party well enough.

654
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,040
Are you guys discussing work here?

655
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,720
Carry on.

656
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,000
Kezhi.

657
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,320
We don't have much time.

658
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,800
If Rihuan can't find anything,
we'll do it ourselves.

659
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,360
I'll contact them now

660
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,600
and ask them to send
the relevant information.

661
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,320
I'll take care of the internal part.

662
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,800
As for the external part…

663
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,280
I'll do it.

664
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,720
Let's split up.

665
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,840
What's wrong?

666
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,880
Nothing.

667
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,040
I just feel like it has been a while

668
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,920
since I've seen you so enthusiastic.

669
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,360
Discovering a problem,
solving it, and completing a project.

670
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,960
Aren't those the things we're best at?

671
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,960
Besides,

672
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,840
the company has looked down upon us

673
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,400
all these years.

674
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,440
Now that we have the chance to succeed,

675
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,960
don't you want to prove yourself to them?

676
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,880
Let's show them

677
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,880
who we really are.

678
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,760
