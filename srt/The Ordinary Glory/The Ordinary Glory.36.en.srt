1
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,800
I'm sorry I'm late.

2
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,840
You forgot, didn't you?

3
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,880
I knew it. If not, you wouldn't have
kept me waiting for so long

4
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,280
Yiqiu.

5
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,320
What's wrong?

6
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,920
Nothing.

7
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,200
Let's go get a doll.

8
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,160
Okay.

9
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,320
WEIWEI TOY REPUBLIC

10
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,360
Which one do you like? I'll get it for you

11
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,200
as a token of apology.

12
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Let me see.

13
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,080
Look at that one with big eyes.

14
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,960
Take it out and see what it is.

15
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,320
This wine is quite good.

16
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,760
It's peach-flavored.

17
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,760
Let's try it again.

18
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,920
Excuse me.

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,880
There's no need.

20
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,640
Why don't we go watch a movie?

21
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,280
I should get going.

22
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,680
No, don't you want to talk more?

23
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,320
I don't think we're a good match.

25
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,440
Again?

26
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,000
- Wait for me.
- It's okay.

27
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,280
There are so many of them.

28
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
It's okay. That's enough.

29
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,560
We agreed to grab that one.

30
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,200
I don't want it anymore.

31
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,160
It's not cute anyway. That's enough.

32
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Yiqiu.

33
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,600
What's wrong with you?

34
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,200
Nothing.

35
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,000
Excuse me.

36
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,240
Hello?

37
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,160
Just a moment.

38
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,000
It's Mr. Lin.

39
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,440
He wants me to see him.

40
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,960
Okay, I'll go with you.

41
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,720
Okay.

42
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,040
Just a moment. I'll be right there.

43
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,320
Let's go.

44
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,280
Please wait.

45
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
Is there anything else?

46
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,480
Well…

47
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,720
Since we won't be talking anymore,

48
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,880
tell me the truth.

49
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,120
What don't you like about me?

50
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,760
Say what's on your mind.

51
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,720
Is it because of astrological signs,
horoscope, or my hairstyle?

52
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,960
Or is it because
you just think I'm a bad guy?

53
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,200
I know you're not a bad guy.

54
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,240
Then…

55
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,600
Then why is it?

56
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,200
You…

57
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,680
You're too wonderful.

58
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,240
Maybe we didn't talk much,

59
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,920
but I can feel that you're a very kind,

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,200
affectionate, and caring person.

61
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Maybe you didn't notice

62
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,200
that during our conversation,

63
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,760
you only talked about
your colleagues half the time.

64
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Did I?

65
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,520
You have a boss.

66
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
He has a bad temper,

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
but he has a good heart.

68
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,960
He has two adorable children.

69
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,440
You have a subordinate.

70
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,600
He looks silly

71
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,080
but he works harder than anyone.

72
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,760
He encounters some difficulties recently.

73
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,600
See? Am I right?

74
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,440
Gosh.

75
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,000
Why did I talk about them?

76
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,480
How about this?

77
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,480
Let's go back and talk.
I'll start with self-introduction.

78
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,480
Hear me out.

79
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,520
The reason I'm sure you're a good person

80
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
is because I can tell

81
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,920
that you see them as your closest
and most important friends.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,080
Someone who's this sweet to his colleagues

83
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,680
will only be nicer to his family.

84
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,840
Isn't that good?

85
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,440
It's unlikely
that you're here on a blind date

86
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,880
to pick a bad guy.

87
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,920
Actually, your personality

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,640
reminds me of my dad.

89
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,080
He's just like you.

90
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,360
He's a very good person.

91
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,280
He's passionate
about other people's matters.

92
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,640
Doesn't that make you feel secure?

93
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,200
That's why he's always at a disadvantage.

94
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,360
If something good happens in the company,

95
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,760
he never gets his turn.

96
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,400
He has to do all the dirty work.

97
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,280
I really admire that kind of person.

98
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,520
But

99
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,640
someone like him can only be my friend.

100
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't want
to live with someone like him.

101
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,080
Then,

102
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,800
I'll change.

103
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,160
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,760
A good person.

105
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,240
What kind of reason is that?

106
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,920
Is it wrong to be a good person?

107
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,960
You've suffered too much, really.

108
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,840
How about this? Let me comfort you.

109
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,120
To put it bluntly,

110
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,760
their aesthetics
are on a different level from ours.

111
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,240
- So…
- This is for you.

112
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,560
It looks like you, right?

113
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,200
Isn't he handsome?

114
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,800
Let me tell you.

115
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,920
If I get a cute plush toy

116
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,080
every time
I tell a story about failed blind dates,

117
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,920
all of what you've got
will be mine tonight.

118
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,280
Believe it or not?

119
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,320
Are you sure? Hurry up and tell us.

120
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,440
Tell us something sad

121
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,600
to cheer both of us up.

122
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Let's be happy.

123
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,760
Let's be happy.

124
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,120
Didn't you see that? Let me tell you.

125
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Yiqiu, listen.

126
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,480
Learn from his experience.

127
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,560
He can't use any of my experience.

128
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,040
He doesn't have to do anything.

129
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,440
He just has to sit there.

130
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,040
She just has to look at him

131
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,440
and she'll fall for him.

132
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Tell me about it.

133
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,280
Excuse me, I need to take this.

134
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,520
He's so interesting.

135
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,920
Is he usually this talkative?

136
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,280
Usually?

137
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,320
I'm going out.

138
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,520
Okay.

139
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,640
I'll be right there.

140
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,520
Mr. Sun, I'm sorry.

141
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,080
I can't stay longer.

142
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,800
I left a document at the office.
I have to send it tomorrow morning.

143
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,560
That's good.

144
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,560
I don't want to be the third wheel.

145
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,000
Mr. Lin.

146
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,240
Thank you.

147
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,560
Why are you thanking me?

148
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,960
You said I'm here to cheer you up.

149
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,760
The fact is,
you're worried that I'll be upset.

150
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,080
Isn't that why you asked me out?

151
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,960
Don't flatter yourself.

152
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,040
I'm sorry for the trouble.

153
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,520
Mr. Sun.

154
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,800
Yiqiu.

155
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,320
It's your personal matter

156
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,640
and I actually can't help much.

157
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,000
But I want to tell you something.

158
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,240
In the workplace,

159
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,520
there's no such thing

160
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,320
as give and take.

161
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,480
If there was such a thing,

162
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,960
Mr. Wu wouldn't be who he is today,

163
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,360
I wouldn't be who I am today

164
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,760
and you

165
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,120
wouldn't be who you are today.

166
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,000
Got it.

167
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,280
That sounds depressing.

168
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,600
That's what I thought too.

169
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,360
But I don't think so anymore.

170
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,200
We did put in a lot of effort.

171
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,680
But must the rewards we receive

172
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,040
be promotion and salary increase?

173
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,000
Can't completing projects,

174
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,320
surpassing ourselves,

175
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,120
and persevering
in this chaotic environment

176
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,640
also be considered a form
of reward for our efforts?

177
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,520
All right.

178
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,080
I'll cut to the chase.

179
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,320
The girl is waiting for you.

180
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,880
If you really have to go,

181
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,680
I can't help it.

182
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,440
But Team Four

183
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,960
will always have a place for you.

184
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,920
We will always be us.

185
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
I'll get my bag.

186
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,800
I might have to go back.

187
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Go back?

188
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,000
Where are you going?

189
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,920
I'm leaving King Capital

190
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,880
and I'm going back to the life
I used to know.

191
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Maybe

192
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,080
that's the life that really belongs to me.

193
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,200
Actually, from the beginning today,

194
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,520
I could tell

195
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,400
that you must be in some kind of trouble.

196
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,720
Although I don't know

197
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,400
what you do,

198
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,880
but

199
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,600
I think

200
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,600
if you walk away dejected like this,

201
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,560
Mr. Lin will also be very sad

202
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,960
if he sees you.

203
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,160
I think

204
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,880
someone like you

205
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,640
should leave

206
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,520
with your head held high.

207
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,320
This is for you.

208
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,720
No matter what difficulties
you face in the future,

209
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,280
when you see it, you'll think of me.

210
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,520
Then you'll know

211
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,520
I'm always rooting for you from behind.

212
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,080
Thank you.

213

<i>Hand over his project as soon as possible.</i>

227

Fatty.

228
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,560
Where is he?

229
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,680
He texted me this morning.

230
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,080
He said he has something to do
and wants to take the day off.

231
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,640
Why didn't he tell me?

232
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,120
It makes no difference.

233
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,160
Let alone taking the day off,

234
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,600
even if he chooses not to come back
from tomorrow onwards,

235
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,360
what can any of us say?

236
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,720
Kezhi.

237
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,120

<i>I'm sorry. You--</i>

240
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,600
Mr. Su, don't worry. It's fine.

241
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,880
It's really fine.

242
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,280
Fine?

243
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,240
It's okay?

244
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,520
Every time I ask you,

245
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,640
you tell me it's fine.

246
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,960
Look.

247
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,200
They have come looking for us.

248
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,360
They're just a few part-timers.

249
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,640
Fine.

250
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,640
It's not our fault that the boss ran away.

251
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,280
They can't put the blame on us
no matter what.

252
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,560
Mr. Su, please take a look.

253
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,800
Look at this.

254
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,320
Our company didn't invest much
in Morfan Apparel.

255
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,240
Once the news dies down,

256
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,160
selling off the company's assets
can cover the losses.

257
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,800
I'll bear the blame
for inadequate supervision.

258
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,080
Don't worry.

259
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,560
I'll write

260
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,800
and submit a good report.

261
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,520
I promise.

262
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,120
You won't be implicated.

263
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,080
Okay.

264
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,320
Do what you have to do.

265
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,440
Don't cause any more trouble.

266
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,600
- All right.
- Go.

267
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,880
I have a task for you.

268
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,440
Look into Morfan Apparel's fixed assets.

269
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,400
Go to the Legal Department too.

270
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,640
Do it as soon as possible.

271
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,120
Do you hear me?

272
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,160
Hello, this is Consumer Goods Team.

273
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,240
Mr. Yin.

274
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,400
It's for you.

275
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,320
Who is it?

276
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,880
A worker from Morfan Apparel.

277
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,680
- Hang up.
- But…

278
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,280
But what? Don't you understand?

279
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,840
- Hello?
- Yin Shengchao!

280
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,960
Yin Shengchao is not in today.

281
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Please don't call again.

282
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,360
Bye.

283
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,320
Can't you be smarter next time?

284
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,160
THE RESULTS OF THE APPLICATION
FOR OVERSEAS FIELD TRIP

285
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,880
I made it.

286
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,160
Look, I made it.

287
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,320
Come and see.

288
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,480
I made it to the overseas field trip.

289
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,280
The company is sending people

290
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,600
to Europe for a field trip.

291
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,280
- For one month.
- Not bad.

292
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,760
- Mr. Jiang.
- You've worked so hard.

293
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,040
- Good for you.
- Congratulations.

294
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,200
It's Team Two's honor.

295
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,560
Mr. Zhou.

296
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,600
I got elected, Mr. Zhou.

297
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,600
That's right.

298
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,480
So be it.

299
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,280
It's just a field trip.

300
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,280
Why are you so excited?
Keep a low profile.

301
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,240
Remember our team's motto.
Keep a low profile.

302
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,360
Fatty, let's have dinner together.

303
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,800
I have a lot to do.

304
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,760
Fatty, I'll invite our classmates.

305
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,120
- You must be there tonight.
- Sure.

306
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,760
It's a deal. See you tonight.

307
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,040
Mr. Zhou.

308
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,240
You have to come too.

309
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,000
Have a good time with your classmates.
I won't disturb.

310
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,280
Drink more tonight.

311
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,920
- Okay, next time.
- Okay.

312
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,960
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

313
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,000
Mr. Wu.

314
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
What do you think?

315
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,680
Am I doing it right?

316
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,600
What can we, as leaders,
offer to our subordinates?

317
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,280
It's none other than a vacation,

318
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,760
an oversea field trip,

319
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,680
and a better resume, right?

320
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,600
Where did all of them go?

321
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,280
They're all out drinking
with other people.

322
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,760
He's so ignorant.

323
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,640
Fatty.

324
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,840
Are you okay?

325
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,640
Why wouldn't I be?

326
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,680
Are you kidding me?

327
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,360
In the future,

328
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,120
you'll have opportunities like this here.

329
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,320
Don't worry.

330
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,000
I won't go
even if they invite me in the future.

331
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,080
THE RESULTS OF THE APPLICATION
FOR OVERSEAS FIELD TRIP

332
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,840
Are you still mad?

333
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,320
I'll apologize to you, okay?

334
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,120
I'm not mad at you.

335
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,280
I'm mad at myself.

336
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,280
Why are you mad at yourself?

337
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,080
I'm mad at myself for being useless.

338
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,720
I can't even get benefits
for my subordinates.

339
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,240
All right.

340
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,760
Don't think too much.

341
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,720
I'll take care of Fatty for you, okay?

342
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,800
Even if I can take care of Fatty,

343
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,920
I can't do anything about Mr. Sun.

344
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,040
What are you doing? What is it?

345
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,080
- I'm looking for someone.
- Who are you looking for?

346
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,760
There's no one else in the car.
Check if there's anyone in the back.

347
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,720
What are you doing?

348
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,840
It's him.

349
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,120
It's him.

350
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,440
- Yin Shengchao.
- Yin Shengchao!

351
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,400
- Get down!
- Get down!

352
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,840
- Get down!
- Get down!

353
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,120
- Yin Shengchao!
- Get out of the way!

354
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,160
Don't film my car. Get out of the way.

355
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,520
If you don't take your hands off me,
I'll call the police!

356
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,880
Hao Shuai, come here!

357
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,760
Mr. Yin, what's wrong?

358
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,840
You can talk to him.

359
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,760
That's right.

360
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,360
Don't rush. You can talk to me.

361
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,760
- Talk to you about what?
- No.

362
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,080
Don't rush.

363
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,600
If you have anything to say, tell me.

364
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,720
Get out of the way.

365
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,920
Get out of the way!

366
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,920
- It's all your fault.
- Beat him up!

367
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,040
Mind your own business!

368
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,440
Let's go.

369
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,000
Hao Shuai, are you okay?

370
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,560
You're injured. You need
to disinfect the wound with alcohol.

371
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,240
I know, but can you be gentler?

372
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,240
- You're rough.
- I'm sorry.

373
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,200
I'll do it.

374
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,160
Be gentle.

375
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,160
That's not right.

376
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,000
You have to clean the dirty parts first.

377
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,240
Okay, I'll try again.

378
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,160
Don't.

379
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,480
He's good at it. Let him do it.

380
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,080
Thank you.

381
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,440
Like you said earlier,

382
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,640
those people

383
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,480
are all after Mr. Yin.

384
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,080
Yes.

385
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,280
But I became the scapegoat.

386
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,480
This is ridiculous.

387
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,640
No matter what,
they shouldn't have beaten you up.

388
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,720
It's not their fault.

389
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,120
I'm sure they're angry too.

390
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,960
Now that the company has gone down,

391
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,920
they are all victims.

392
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,440
- I feel bad for them.
- Hao Shuai.

393
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,560
You know your position, right?

394
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,920
Although Mr. Yin is unreasonable
and quite impolite,

395
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,240
but he's right about one thing.

396
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,200
In the end,

397
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,640
there's nothing they can do.

398
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,040
I know.

399
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,680
I know what you mean.

400
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,000
I just want to advise you.

401
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,520
Indeed, those workers are pitiful.

402
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,040
But this is between the company
and the business.

403
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,960
If you take the wrong side,

404
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,520
it won't do you any good.

405
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,880
But

406
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,440
if I stay silent too,

407
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,840
then I'm no different

408
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,360
from people like Yin Shengchao.

409
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,960
Is something on your mind?

410
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,840
I completely understand

411
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,160
that Hao Shuai sympathizes
with the workers at the factory.

412
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,120
But I hope he won't do anything stupid.

413
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,320
What?

414
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,480
Why are you looking at me?

415
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,440
Nothing.

416
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,200
I just didn't expect

417
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,720
that you actually care
about other people's affairs.

418
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,640
I…

419
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,240
- What do you mean?
- Don't worry, it's a good thing.

420
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,880
It's quite adorable

421
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,120
to see you let go of your cold side.

422
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,120
When was I cold?

423
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,920
What's wrong?

424
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,440
I thought it could hold out for a while.

425
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,240
Looks like it'll have to retire early.

426
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,440
How about

427
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,560
I…

428
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
I'll send you home.

429
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,280
It's okay.

430
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,000
Problem solved.

431
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,160
No. Are you sure you don't want me
to send you home?

432
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,320
Don't worry.

433
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,320
See you tomorrow.

434
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,400
Don't throw it around.

435
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,560
I don't want it.

436
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,480
How about this?

437
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,320
- Let's have one last drink.
- Here.

438
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,600
Let's wish Zhang a successful field trip.

439
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,000
- Okay?
- Here.

440
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,640
- Thank you, guys.
- Congratulations.

441
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,560
- Cheers.
- Here.

442
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,720
Fatty.

443
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,240
- Don't call him.
- Yuming.

444
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,600
He wasn't like this before.

445
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,400
He can't hold his liquor.

446
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,320
Come on.

447
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,360
Let's go home and get some rest.

448
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,720
Let's drink some more.

449
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,440
You know what this is called?

450
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,120
What is it called?

451
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,920
As the liquor enters, sorrows deepen…

452
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,400
You…

453
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,000
And sorrows deepen even more.

454
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,320
I can't help it.

455
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,360
It's his fault
for having such a useless leader.

456
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,880
He's awake. See?

457
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,360
Are you okay, Yuming?

458
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,360
What did you say?

459
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,120
It's all in the past.
We didn't say anything.

460
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,920
We didn't. Cheers.

461
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,360
This is the last drink.

462
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,960
I'm asking you what you just said.

463
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,840
Lin Yuming.

464
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,920
What? What do you mean?

465
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,120
I'm asking you what you just said.

466
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,440
I said you're a fool.

467
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
You follow Wu Kezhi around every day.

468
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,960
How can you be anything?

469
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,720
Why did you say that?

470
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,760
- Yuming.
- Don't take it out on me.

471
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,600
- Take it out on Wu Kezhi if you can.
- All right, that's enough.

472
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,600
What are you doing?

473
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,200
Look how drunk you are.

474
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,800
I…

475
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,120
What should we do now?

476
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,200
What else can we do?

477
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,000
Send him back first.

478
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,720
It's all Yin Shengchao's fault.

479
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,040
He bolted so quickly.

480
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,640
Do you know where he lives?

481
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,000
We really don't know.

482
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,880
Slow down.

483
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,920
Hurry up.

484
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
Put the bag down.

485
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,080
Okay, let him hug you.

486
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,360
Come on, give me a hand.

487
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,920
- That's enough.
- Come on, let's go.

488
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,800
Fix it.

489
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,680
Come on, move up.

490
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,400
Let's go.

491
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,280
All right, is that okay?

492
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,160
Thank you.

493
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,960
All right.

494
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,160
I have to go home too.

495
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,200
Otherwise, I'll get scolding from my wife.

496
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,960
Whoever wants to go, go.

497
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,760
I can't walk anymore.

498
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,600
My back hurts.

499
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,480
I have to sit down.

500
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,880
Yes, come on.

501
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,400
Boqian, what are you laughing at?

502
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,000
It suddenly hit me

503
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,640
that a long time ago,

504
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,640
we slept together

505
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,200
just like now,

506
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,920
where we squeezed into a space for a nap.

507
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,440
I remember.

508
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,640
There was a project report

509
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,440
that needed to be rushed out overnight.

510
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,160
Back then, we were just interns, right?

511
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,120
How long has it been?

512
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,920
About six years, right?

513
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,440
Time flies.

514
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,160
Come to think of it,

515
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,960
it was pretty good back then.

516
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,200
We've got nothing to think about.

517
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,640
We worked together.

518
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,160
We got scolded together.

519
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,960
Unlike now.

520
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,760
Now, all we think about

521
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,280
is how to get promoted,

522
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,400
how to make money

523
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,440
to buy a house, a car,
and to raise our kids.

524
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,800
Actually,

525
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,760
it's good to relax

526
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,159
once in a while.

527
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,679
Right?

528
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,120
You're right.

529
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,320
Please tell Mr. Qu

530
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,360
that I'll handle this properly.

531
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,320
Yes.

532
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,840
Don't worry. Okay.

533
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,400
Bye.

534
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,880
Yin Shengchao!

535
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,200
- Come here!
- Mr. Su.

536
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,680
Yin Shengchao.

537
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,040
Mr. Qu has found out about Morfan Apparel.

538
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,160
What?

539
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,680
Mr. Qu is very angry now.

540
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,360
If you don't handle this well,

541
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,600
the whole team will go down with you.

542
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,680
I know.

543
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,920
Stop.

544
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,840
Come back.

545
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,440
Is there anything else?

546
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,360
Come here.

547
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,080
Explain to Morfan's workers.

548
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,360
Tell them we can only take this to court.

549
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,800
Don't let them come to the office again.

550
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,240
Me?

551
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,920
Do you think I should go?

552
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,280
I got it.

553
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,920
Have some water.

554
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,840
Thank you.

555
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,160
It's not even your celebratory party.

556
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,920
Why did you drink so much?

557
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
Good morning, Kezhi.

558
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,760
Kezhi.

559
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,280
Come with me.

560
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,400
What is it?

561
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,960
What's this?

562
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,280
I've contacted Ms. Yu and HR.

563
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,480
Just sign here

564
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,200
and you will be transferred
to Technology Media Telecom next week.

565
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,560
What are you doing?

566
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,720
We both know

567
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,160
I'm not a good boss.

568
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,280
A tree can be transplanted
and so can a person.

569
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,240
Go.

570
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,680
Stop following me around like a fool.

571
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,880
Well…

572
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,160
I'm not kidding.

573
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,640
I don't want you anymore.

574
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,520
You can go.

575
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,440
You can't make a living with me.

576
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,080
Do you understand?

577
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,680
Are you stupid?

578
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,800
Stop it.

579
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,240
Kezhi.

580
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,120
They all think I'm stupid.

581
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,560
They think I'm useless

582
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,480
and I can't make a living.

583
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,480
I admit it.

584
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,880
Do you think I'm stupid too?

585
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,760
Do you think I don't know how many people
you've offended in the company?

586
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,920
Do you think I don't know

587
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,040
I'll never get a good project
if I follow you around?

588
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,520
Then why do you think

589
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm still in Team Four?

590
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,000
Why?

591
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,920
I think

592
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,080
you're the real deal, Wu Kezhi.

593
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,840
That's what I want.

594
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120
But you won't get a promotion
or a raise with me.

595
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,040
That's what will help me in the future.

596
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,280
I think these experiences

597
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,040
are much more important to me

598
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,480
than traveling abroad

599
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,960
or picking up a few good projects.

600
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,680
That's why I stayed in Team Four.

601
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,760
Do you think I'm stupid?

602
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,960
But let me tell you one thing.

603
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,600
If you change one day,

604
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
I'm sorry.

605
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,080
I'll leave first.

606
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,960
You can't stop me.

607
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,200
You're notorious

608
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,880
in the company.

609
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,360
If I want to leave,

610
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,560
who can stop me?

611
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,320
What is this?

612
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,600
When I first started working for you,

613
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,280
I used to write this kind
of application letter

614
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,640
every week.

615
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,720
I have a lot.

616
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,920
Mr. Ding said you went out,
so I thought you'd be here.

617
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,200
You're working again?

618
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,880
My contract hasn't ended yet.

619
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,480
Do you want me to leave that badly?

620
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,160
Yesterday, you…

621
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,240
I spent the whole day sorting it out.

622
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,600
Since I can't do this project,

623
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,880
I'll let Mr. Lin handle it.

624
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,360
That put me at ease.

625
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,240
Mr. Sun.

626
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,640
If I can't get back on my feet

627
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,120
and make you worry

628
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,320
just because I can't stay,

629
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,320
I'd be disappointed with myself.

630
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,360
Even if today is my last day,

631
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,000
I have to pull myself together.

632
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,120
I have to do my last job well.

633
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,320
I can't embarrass Team Four, right?

634
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,000
Well…

635
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,880
I'm getting back to work.

636
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,920
I'll leave you to it. Bye.

637
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,960
