1
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,240
It looks like

2
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
someone doesn't want <i>Justice Online</i>
to get funding on purpose.

3
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,520
Who would do such a thing?

4
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,920
There are only a few competitors
in the market for <i>Justice Online</i>.

5
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,200
It's easy to guess who it is.

6
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,720
It doesn't matter who it is.

7
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,680
What's important is

8
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,480
how we should face it.

9
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,560
Can we do PR too?

10
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,520
We can't.

11
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
Why?

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,040
It's simple.

13
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,360
After completing the demo
of <i>Justice Online</i>,

14
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,200
I'm afraid

15
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,120
Nongzhou's pockets are emptied out.

16
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,360
So what do we do?

17
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,040
As a new online <i>wuxia</i>-themed game,

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,000
<i>Justice Online</i> holds itself

19
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,080
to international Triple-A standards.

20
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,440
The latest demo released a few days ago

21
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,680
has a skyrocketing number
of downloads on all major websites.

22
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,640
Its online popularity
is continuing to rise.

23
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,800
- And--
- Sicong, hold on.

24
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,600
Go ahead, Mr. Qu.

25
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,320
The strengths and sentiments of the game

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,360
you just mentioned

27
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,120
are all written in your report.

28
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,680
To be honest,

29
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,720
I'm not interested

30
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,040
in this kind of trendy stuff.

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,040
But…

32
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,040
Although I don't know much
about online games,

33
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,280
I can still read a few articles, right?

34
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Now, the online reviews

35
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,800
of your game

36
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,360
don't seem that good.

37
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,320
That's right.

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,280
I saw several of them this morning.

39
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,280
You're right.

40
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,640
What Mr. Qu said is absolutely true.

41
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,680
The major websites are almost all covered

42
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,320
in negative reviews of <i>Justice Online</i>.

43
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,000
We even came up with a set of data.

44
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,680
In the past 24 hours,

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,680
on the three most active
online game portals in the country,

46
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,120
the number of negative reviews

47
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,120
is a total of 3,454 articles.

48
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,760
Among them, 708 articles
have overlapping content.

49
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,240
A total of 1,721 articles

50
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,440
have more than 90% overlapping content.

51
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,560
Young man, how did you get these numbers?

52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,320
I'm ashamed to say this.

53
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,240
Yiqiu, I,

54
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,480
and all the Thunder Fire Studio employees

55
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,399
spent the whole night

56
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,680
filtering them one by one.

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,440
All the negative reviews

58
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,240
you can see online,

59
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,400
we've read all of them verbatim
more than once.

60
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,640
It's a bit of a shame.

61
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,200
Since the final funds
were spent on the product,

62
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,960
in the face of competitors' PR tactics,

63
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,160
<i>Justice Online</i> is powerless to fight back.

64
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,280
Before today's meeting,

65
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,800
we were also very aware

66
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,200
that no matter what we do,

67
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,040
it'll be hard to change

68
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,000
the online public sentiment
in such a short time.

69
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,880
But the only thing we can do now

70
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,880
is to influence the investment committee.

71
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,960
Perhaps

72
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,440
we can only use the dumbest method.

73
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,840
But that's the only effective method

74
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,080
I can think of.

75
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,560
You're not going to refute it
one by one, are you?

76
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,400
Do you remember what your teacher said

77
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,400
when we were at the academy?

78
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,040
Instead of dwelling on the answer,

79
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,880
focus on the question.

80
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,680
These press releases
that are causing us trouble

81
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,920
can definitely be used as bullets.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,200
We tracked down the top 100 accounts

83
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,440
with the most active content.

84
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,760
We found out that they're part
of the three most powerful PR teams

85
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,200
in the online game industry.

86
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,000
As you can imagine,

87
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,440
how much money was used

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,400
to execute such a huge PR campaign?

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,240
The one to cause these competitors

90
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,840
that have been operating successfully
for many years

91
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,880
to spend a hefty sum

92
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,240
just to nip
a fictional competitor in the bud

93
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,080
is a no-name studio that just released

94
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,080
a small demo of <i>Justice Online</i>.

95
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,320
So can we put it this way?

96
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,800
Before <i>Justice Online</i>
gained public recognition,

97
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,360
its competitors already acknowledged it.

98
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,880
That's all I have to present

99
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,800
for the <i>Justice Online</i> project.

100
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,680
The young man has a point.

101
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,720
I think

102
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,000
it's doable.

103
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,240
<i>Justice Online</i> defies the trend

104
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,320
and it's actually a sign
of courage and confidence.

105
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,080
I approve too.

106
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,160
Approved.

107
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,880
Mr. Wu, I'd like to ask

108
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,080
the reason for your approval.

109
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,600
I trust our team's Yiqiu.

110
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,840
Mr. Wu.

111
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
The decision to invest--

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Buffett once said this.

113
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,720
Be fearful when others are greedy

114
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,280
and greedy when others are fearful.

115
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,480
I think your game…

116
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,480
can prove that.

117
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,840
I approve too.

118
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,320
It's approved.

119
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,680
Did it get approved?

120
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,120
Congratulations. The rest is up to you.

121
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,600
Laugh if you want to. Don't hold it in.

122
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,240
Congratulations on
your triumphant return, Mr. Sun.

123
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
A round of applause.

124
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,520
Yiqiu, well done.

125
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,000
You have to treat us.

126
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,440
Let's have a meeting.

127
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,560
Tell me.

128
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,120
What did you learn from this project?

129
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,680
I used to think
that my contract was about to expire,

130
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,760
so I kept my eyes on those hot projects.

131
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,040
Now that I think about it,

132
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,960
I won't get the chance
to do the so-called bestsellers.

133
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,560
Right?

134
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,720
Now I understand.

135
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,880
Investing has no shortcuts.

136
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,760
If you want good results,

137
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,680
you have to move forward with the founder.

138
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,520
Is my explanation okay?

139
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,840
It's not an interview.
There's nothing to be okay about.

140
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,520
However,

141
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,920
I agree with you.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,560
Then as we agreed before,

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,840
from now on,

144
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,960
you can keep looking
for your own projects.

145
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,120
Really?

146
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,400
But there's a condition.

147
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,600
You can only choose from our own projects.

148
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,400
Understood.

149
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,280
People in the company

150
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,800
always compare us
to the trash cans of projects.

151
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,480
Those unwanted projects

152
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,400
that are deemed problematic or hopeless

153
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,840
will be dumped on us.

154
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,200
But in reality,

155
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,280
we rely
on these so-called "trash projects"

156
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,920
to pass the company's
performance evaluation every time.

157
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,640
I think Team Four's projects

158
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,120
are more suitable
for your current situation.

159
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,640
That's right.

160
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,120
Compared to the bestsellers,

161
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,440
it's easier to communicate

162
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,920
with the company and founder
of unpopular projects.

163
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,120
As an investor,

164
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,800
as long as you can solve the problems

165
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,360
in the company's projects,

166
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
you'll have a better chance of succeeding.

167
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,680
Go for it, Mr. Sun. I have faith in you.

168
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,280
What do you mean?

169
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,120
Do you think he's going to do it alone?

170
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,400
Aren't you embarrassed?

171
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,640
He has limited time and lacks experience.

172
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,480
Of course he needs you
to take care of him.

173
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,600
No problem.

174
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,520
No, I'm busy with my own work.

175
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,200
- I…
- That's it then.

176
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,360
Time is of the essence.

177
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,960
Mr. Wu, I really--

178
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,760
Mr. Lin, thank you.

179
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,040
<i>After I find my way forward again,</i>

180
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,640
<i>I try one more time
to stay in the company.</i>

181
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,480
<i>But this time,</i>

182
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,280
<i>I'm not fighting alone anymore.</i>

183
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,680
INVESTMENT VALUE

184
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,080
CHOOSING A PROJECT

185
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,200
DETERMINING A PROJECT'S
INVESTMENT VALUE

186
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,720
LOOK AT ITS DEVELOPMENT TREND

187
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,360
What are you doing?

188
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,480
- We have a meeting.
- Have it over there. Let's go.

189
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,280
- No, why?
- Where are we going? Why?

190
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,560
Let's go. I'll take you there.

191
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,160
- Come on.
- Where are we going? Hang on.

192
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,360
Qianyi.

193
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,360
Come here.

194
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,920
What's wrong, Mr. Xu?

195
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,720
I remember you mentioned
a project worth doing to me before.

196
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,000
You also wrote a report
on the feasibility of it.

197
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,920
What was it called?

198
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,960
Do you mean Qiancheng Solar?

199
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,960
Yes.

200
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,640
The one that does solar energy.

201
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Can you find it?

202
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,960
Yes, I can. Why?

203
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,720
Find it and do it.

204
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,280
Are you asking me to do it?

205
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,520
Here's the thing, Qianyi.

206
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,280
I think

207
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,800
you can start working
on your own project now.

208
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,040
Plus, the China-Europe Logistics project
has been approved.

209
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,120
Since our boss is in a good mood

210
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,920
by a little bit,

211
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,920
submit the project as soon as possible.

212
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,680
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

213
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,720
Approved.

214
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,560
Libo, Fatty.

215
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,480
Thank you for your hard work.

216
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,200
If I don't work hard, who will?

217
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,320
Mr. Sun, you have to be a grateful person.

218
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,640
Don't get ahead of yourself.

219
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,720
This is just the preparation.

220
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,200
If you really want this project,
you have to go through the founder.

221
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,920
But for that part,

222
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,440
none of us can help you.

223
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,240
You can only rely on yourself.

224
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,480
Yiqiu.

225
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,920
I heard you started a project.

226
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,800
Mr. Wu finally agreed
to let me give it a try.

227
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,720
What about you?

228
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,440
I finally started working
on a project too.

229
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,240
I can finally catch up with you guys.

230
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,960
Congratulations.

231
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,680
Qianyi, congratulations.

232
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,920
Did you get bullied again?

233
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
Hao Shuai.

234
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,640
Shengchao, the coffee is almost ready.

235
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,760
Forget it.
The coffee beans here aren't good.

236
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,880
Let's go downstairs.

237
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,480
You're paying later.

238
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,119
That brat is so brazen.

239
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,640
Why did you bring him along?

240
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,240
He's new. Give him a chance.

241
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,680
He's over there.

242
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,240
Hao Shuai.

243
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
What's up?

244
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,800
Qianyi got a new project,
so she's treating us. Join us.

245
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,920
Yes, join us.

246
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,080
Forget it. I'm not going.

247
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,720
Let's go.

248
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,160
No.

249
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,080
Eat up.

250
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Why are you looking at me?

251
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,920
Are you all right?

252
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,520
Whether I'm okay or not,
I can't work on an empty stomach.

253
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,520
Let's eat.

254
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,040
We heard about what happened to you.

255
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,280
You were a bit too impulsive.

256
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,480
Although we can't help much,

257
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,280
if you really have something on your mind,

258
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,640
you can talk to us.

259
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,360
There's nothing to talk about.

260
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,800
I've always been

261
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,840
a carefree person.

262
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,680
Look at how I am clearly.

263
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,880
I'm like this.

264
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,040
That's all. I really don't have
anything on my mind.

265
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,440
But you have to think of a way.

266
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
What way?

267
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,040
Haven't I thought of everything?

268
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,840
I've done everything I could.

269
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,480
This is my outcome.

270
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,640
Even if you're upset,
you can't bottle it up.

271
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,920
Let it all out.

272
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,320
Yes, you'll get sick
if you keep it bottled up.

273
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,160
Why don't we go out this weekend?

274
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,240
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,680
This weekend,

276
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,080
I'm writing a presentation
for Yin Shengchao.

277
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,280
Then next weekend,

278
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,400
let's go to that new--

279
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,520
Qianyi.

280
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,480
Yiqiu. Sicong.

281
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,960
I know the three of you care about me.

282
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,720
Thank you.

283
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,000
But I'm really fine.

284
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,240
I've thought it through.

285
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,920
It's not Yin Shengchao's fault.

286
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,600
It's my fault.

287
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,720
It's my fault for not knowing
what a workplace is,

288
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,040
what a hierarchy is,

289
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,720
and what the way
of dealing with people is.

290
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,280
I'm no match for Yin Shengchao.

291
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,040
I should've surrendered sooner.

292
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,440
But

293
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,360
now that I know all this,

294
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,160
I don't think it's too late.

295
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,560
Are those your real thoughts?

296
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,680
Not everything

297
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,440
has to be real or fake.

298
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,160
The workplace has its own rules.

299
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,160
There's no need to distinguish
what's real and what's fake,

300
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,600
what's good and what's bad.

301
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,560
Obey.

302
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,720
All I need to do is obey.

303
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,240
I'm full.

304
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,280
I have work to do later.

305
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,520
Qianyi, thank you for your hospitality.

306
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Hi, I'm Sun Yiqiu from King Capital.

307
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,480
Hello.

308
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,600
WU KEZHI: A GREAT BATTLE AWAITS.

309
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,840
SLEEP AND WAKE UP EARLY!

310
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,840
SUN YIQIU: ALL RIGHT.

311
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,800
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

312
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,040
<i>Tomorrow is my last chance.</i>

313
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,400
<i>No matter what,</i>

314
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,720
<i>I have to win the project.</i>

315
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,760
Judging by the time,

316
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,440
Yiqiu should have met the founder.

317
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,360
Fatty.

318
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,800
Have you checked
the documents he prepared?

319
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,360
The preparation was flawless.

320
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,040
The only thing I'm worried about now
is Mr. Sun's performance anxiety.

321
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,480
What if he only said
a few words to the founder

322
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,960
before getting chased out?

323
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,320
What do you think, Mr. Wu?

324
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,000
Why are you asking me? How would I know?

325
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
Aren't you worried about Mr. Sun?

326
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,240
It's all up to him now.
It's none of our business.

327
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,720
Don't worry for no reason. Get to work.

328
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,760
Okay.

329
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,680
I have big news to announce.

330
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,600
Lan Qianyi.

331
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,840
Your solar energy project
has been approved.

332
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,000
Really?

333
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,400
Good job, Qianyi.

334
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,000
Has Mr. Ma approved it too?

335
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,040
Don't worry.

336
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,360
The company has approved it.

337
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,480
No matter how unreasonable Mr. Ma is,

338
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,160
he wouldn't kill his own project.

339
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,640
Mr. Xu.

340
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,320
What did you just say about Mr. Ma?

341
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,440
What did I say?

342
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,080
Did you hear that?

343
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,240
Cui'er, remind me.

344
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,360
It's nothing. I misheard you.

345
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,760
MORFAN APPAREL'S BALANCE SHEET

346
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,480
MORFAN APPAREL'S BALANCE SHEET

347
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,800
What now?

348
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,040
Shengchao.

349
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,360
Didn't you ask me to look into companies
for the past six months?

350
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,880
I found a company called Morfan Apparel.

351
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,800
Morfan?

352
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
I'm in charge of it. Why?

353
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,120
There seems to be a problem
with their report.

354
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,760
I told you to organize
the company information, not nitpick.

355
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,560
Can you even understand the report?

356
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,160
- But--
- But what?

357
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,080
Do what you have to do.

358
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,160
Go.

359
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,880
Hello, I'm Sun Yiqiu from King Capital.

360
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
We spoke on the phone before.

361
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,320
Hold on.

362
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,280
Okay.

363
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,520
<i>This is bad.</i>

364
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,920
<i>I can't just stay silent.</i>

365
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,760
<i>I have to break the silence</i>

366
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,840
<i>and take the initiative.</i>

367
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,160
<i>What can I say?</i>

368
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,560
<i>What should I say?</i>

369
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,600
- Your project--
- Hold on.

370
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,920
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

371
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,240
<i>Our first conversation had a rough start.</i>

372
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,200
<i>Today's negotiation</i>

373
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,760
<i>has zero chance of success.</i>

374
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,480
<i>Cut.</i>

375
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,360
<i>Contain. Take.</i>

376
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,880
Congratulations on your victory, Mr. Sun.

377
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,920
This is called unparalleled dumb luck.

378
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,120
Coincidentally, the founder
of the company you're going to talk to

379
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,640
is a Go enthusiast.

380
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,120
Fatty, what do you mean by dumb luck?

381
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,120
This is called good luck.

382
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,160
Besides,

383
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,560
if Yiqiu didn't prepare in advance,

384
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,720
do you think he would give you the project

385
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,600
just because you know
how to play Go? Right?

386
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,920
No matter what,

387
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,480
we can finally relax.

388
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,360
Once Risk Control approves it,

389
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,160
you'll be in charge of the project.

390
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,000
When the time comes,
your renewal talk with the company

391
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,000
will be smooth sailing.

392
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,760
Mr. Wu, I have something to say.

393
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,400
Mr. Sun is giving a victory speech.

394
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,520
Actually,

395
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
without your help,

396
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,960
I wouldn't have been able
to close the deal.

397
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,320
Because of you,

398
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,120
through the <i>Justice Online</i> project,

399
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,760
I realized what kind of investor
I want to be

400
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,280
and how I should choose a project.

401
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,600
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

402
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,040
And Mr. Ding.

403
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,360
You've accompanied me these past few days

404
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,360
and taught me
how to negotiate with the founder.

405
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,960
I used all your techniques today.

406
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,080
Thank you so much.

407
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
And Mr. Lin.

408
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,480
- No.
- He taught me a lot.

409
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,480
Although some of his teachings

410
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,440
need to be corrected by Mr. Ding,

411
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
I…

412
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,160
What the heck?

413
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
But he…

414
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,800
The takeout he ordered was really good.

415
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,120
What? What are you doing?

416
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,520
To Mr. Lin's takeout.

417
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,120
Cheers to Mr. Lin's takeout.

418
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,800
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

419
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,280
It was really good.

420
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,960
But you don't have to keep
ordering braised pork rice for me.

421
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,440
I can eat something else.

422
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,480
- No.
- You always order braised pork rice,

423
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,800
three-cup chicken, and whatnot.

424
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,440
I really want to stay.

425
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,520
I really

426
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,840
want to stay in Team Four
and work with you guys.

427
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,840
It's true.

428
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,360
I hope my wish will come true this time.

429
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,760
- Bottoms up.
- Come on.

430
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,600
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

431
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,600
Bottoms up.

432
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,400
Mr. Ma.

433
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,800
Qianyi's project is indeed more mature

434
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,680
and Risk Control has approved it.

435
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,800
It's not appropriate to change
the project at the last minute.

436
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,160
Why not?

437
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,600
Wasn't there an offshore
wind project last year?

438
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,040
Do that and resubmit.

439
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,600
That project.

440
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,320
Didn't you reject it during the meeting?

441
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,560
Don't you know why?

442
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,000
It's because you didn't do
your research well

443
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,120
and affected my judgment.

444
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,120
Change to that project.

445
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,400
Mr. Ma.

446
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,080
Why don't we keep Qianyi's project too?

447
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,400
Let's do both together.

448
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,280
Taiping.

449
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,080
How many fools are there
in your Energy Team?

450
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,720
It's just the three fools.

451
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,880
Do you have more people?

452
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,880
We can try.

453
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,800
Try, my foot.

454
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,640
Let me tell you.

455
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,120
Lan Qianyi can't work on projects now.

456
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Jianguo.

457
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,920
Just be honest with me.

458
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,560
Taiping.

459
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,960
You've been with me for so many years.

460
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,120
Think about it.

461
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,800
Have I ever screwed you over?

462
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,640
No.

463
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,600
I haven't, right?

464
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,600
Then I'll tell you now.

465
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,480
Lan Qianyi has high standards

466
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,920
and she's too ambitious.

467
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,040
She hasn't done any projects

468
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,800
and she's already dissing me in my office.

469
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,120
Isn't she just another Wu Kezhi?

470
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,480
I know what you want to say.

471
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,960
You

472
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,560
will sit in my position one day.

473
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,920
Do you want to have a Wu Kezhi under you?

474
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,320
When you go back,

475
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,040
I hope you will teach her some manners

476
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
and make her obedient.

477
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,160
Do you understand?

478
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,640
If you do, go back.

479
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,080
Taiping.

480
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,840
This is for your own good.

481
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,920
Go.

482
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,240
I knew it.

483
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,280
Qianyi offended Mr. Ma too much.

484
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,840
She'll get punished sooner or later.

485
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,880
Mr. Xu, you're at fault too.

486
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,920
We were doing fine.

487
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,440
Why did you make such a promise to her?

488
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,600
That's enough.

489
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,880
Did I call you here to hear your nonsense?

490
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,320
Let's think about what we should do now.

491
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,760
What else can we do?

492
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,520
We have to change since Mr. Ma said so.

493
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,200
But the point is,

494
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,600
who's going to tell Qianyi?

495
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,800
Forget it.

496
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,720
I'll take back what I said.

497
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,880
I guess I have to embarrass myself.

498
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,800
What are you doing?

499
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,200
Boqian.

500
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,320
Qianyi looks quite calm.

501
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,560
It seems Mr. Zhao is done.

502
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,680
Should we go back

503
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,400
or wait here?

504
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,560
APPLICATION FOR PROJECT SUSPENSION
OR TERMINATION

505
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,920
SUBJECT: PROJECT TERMINATION

506
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,760
TO: ZHANG GENGYI

507
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,480
SEND

508
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,960
SEND

509
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,239
Qianyi.

510
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,400
Mr. Su.

511
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,960
Morfan Apparel is your project, right?

512
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,880
Yes, why?

513
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,520
I heard from some friends yesterday

514
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,120
that Morfan seems to have
some problems with the business.

515
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,400
Many of their executives left.

516
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Mr. Su.

517
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,480
Don't listen to people's nonsense.

518
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,200
I know their boss very well.

519
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,080
He likes to mess around,

520
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,640
but he's definitely reliable.

521
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,680
Nothing will go wrong.

522
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,680
Okay.

523
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,800
I'm just asking.

524
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,640
I don't want to get caught off guard

525
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,640
if something happens.

526
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,240
But it's good that you're aware of it.

527
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,320
Don't worry at all.

528
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,240
I'll treat him to a drink in a few days.

529
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,560
I'll show him how much you care about him.

530
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Thank you.

531
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,000
It's what I should do.

532
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,320
What are you looking at?

533
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,760
Get back to work.

534
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,600
Mom, how many times have I told you?

535
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,560
Don't worry about me.

536
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
I have a lot on my plate now.

537
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,920
Gosh, I don't have time to date.

538
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,360
Fine, I won't tell you.

539
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,120
Don't make things worse for me, okay?

540
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,040
I'm begging you.

541
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,200
Okay.

542
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
You said she's very pretty.

543
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,680
But how pretty is she?

544
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,760
All right. Then…

545
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,960
Well, give me
her contact information and photo.

546
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,920
Okay?

547
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,960
I'll decide for myself.

548
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,720
Okay.

549
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,800
Remember her photo.

550
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,920
Send me the photo.

551
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,200
Okay.

552
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,800
Why are you smiling?

553
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,520
I have to be serious
when it comes to marriage.

554
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,400
You just said
you have a lot on your plate.

555
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,040
But when you heard that she's pretty,

556
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,280
you did a complete 180.

557
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,240
It has nothing to do with being pretty.

558
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,680
I'll get back to work.

559
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,400
What do you think?

560
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,480
Is she not pretty enough?

561
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,760
What we mean is

562
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,640
the girl is indeed pretty,

563
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,120
but you

564
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,560
don't stand a chance.

565
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,760
Yes, right.

566
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,600
Mr. Sun?

567
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,040
Kezhi?

568
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,720
I know you don't stand a chance
without looking.

569
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,120
Well, I think you should

570
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,320
seriously consider my older cousin.

571
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,720
Hello.

572
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,680
Mr. Li.

573
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,400
Okay, I'll be right there.

574
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,880
If you all say I don't have a chance,

575
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,320
then I must ask her out.

576
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,360
Risk Control rejected
Yiqiu's project? Why?

577
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,960
Kezhi, calm down.

578
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,640
No, Mr. Li. What's the reason?

579
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,120
I signed off on the project.

580
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,480
I think it's fine.

581
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,960
Yes, Risk Control also said

582
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,080
there's no problem with the project.

583
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,280
It's all good.

584
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,080
But there's a problem

585
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,960
with the signature.

586
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,080
Signature?

587
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,000
What's wrong if it's signed by Sun Yiqiu?

588
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,600
Well, Mr. Wu.

589
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,320
If this project is to be up and running,

590
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,080
it'll take at least a year or two, right?

591
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,760
Yiqiu's contract is almost up.

592
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,160
As the person in charge of the project,

593
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,560
he's not that suitable.

594
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,440
Then renew his contract.

595
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,400
Isn't that why we've been working so hard?

596
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,000
Risk Control also said

597
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,520
that his contract renewal
falls under HR, not them.

598
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,240
Okay, I'll talk to HR.

599
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,760
Kezhi, have a seat first.

600
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,880
I've already asked them.

601
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,400
Have a seat.

602
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,560
What did they say?

603
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,400
According to HR,

604
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,680
Yiqiu hasn't accomplished anything

605
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,040
for our company yet.

606
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,160
So they can't renew his contract.

607
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,040
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

608
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,000
I don't quite understand

609
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,960
the logic here.

610
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,880
What you're saying is that

611
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,440
according to the company's rules,

612
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,120
Sun Yiqiu's contract can't be renewed

613
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,160
because he didn't bring in any business.

614
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,080
But if he wants to renew his contract,

615
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,400
he has to bring in business.

616
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,280
Is that so?

617
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,400
Well,

618
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,160
if you want a simple and crude summary,

619
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,280
that's right.

620
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,240
What kind of bullshit rule is that?

621
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,880
Kezhi.

622
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,800
You're always so anxious.

623
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,840
You're already an old-timer.

624
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,720
Don't you understand?

625
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,560
Since the day we came up with this policy,

626
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,760
we've never planned to let

627
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,960
one-year contract employees
renew their contracts.

628
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,240
Don't you get it?

629
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,080
Mr. Li.

630
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,720
Can you help him?

631
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,520
I also think

632
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,240
that Yiqiu is a good kid.

633
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,560
But rules are rules.

634
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,920
Even if I went to Mr. Qu

635
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
or Chris,

636
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,800
they could shut me up

637
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,160
with just one sentence.

638
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,360
Don't you agree?

639
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,760
