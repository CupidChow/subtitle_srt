1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,966
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

2
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,014
Someone called him "Eun-ho."

3
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:56,931
Eun-ho?

4
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,892
Did you just say "Eun-ho"?

5
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,227
How do you know him?

6
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,021
What?

7
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,398
Answer me! How do you know him?

8
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,277
You, who should've gone to Hell…

9
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,030
You, who knows Eun-ho…

10
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,950
I thought you were an evil person
who caused immense pain

11
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,619
for Hae-sook and me.

12
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,038
That's what I thought, but…

13
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,373
Open the door! Hurry!

14
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,586
Did you sell him? To that animal?

15
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,921
Why my son?

16
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,006
What is this?

17
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,218
If you got your memory back,
why are you mentioning Eun-ho? Why?

18
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,886
Who the hell are you?

19
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,596
Answer me! What are you?

20
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,108
But I was wrong.

21
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,741
I figured you'd come.

22
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,953
So you knew all along.

23
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,624
Do you have a sick hobby
of watching someone fall apart?

24
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,420
I do not interfere in your lives.

25
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,215
I have neither reason nor authority
to do so.

26
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,634
Then what should I do?

27
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,848
As I said, there is nothing you can do.

28
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:24,978
The key to resolving this
lies with Hae-sook, not you.

29
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,939
No, that can't happen.

30
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,067
She won't be able to handle this.

31
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,944
Let me take care of it.

32
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,696
I caused this.

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,409
I understand how you feel,

34
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,453
but she must handle everything

35
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,040
from the beginning until the end.

36
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,129
I finally understand everything.

37
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:55,508
You and I were lovers

38
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,136
-although no one acknowledged us.
-Our…

39
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,388
long-forgotten story.

40
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,766
I felt wronged and wondered
what I'd done to deserve Hell.

41
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,352
-I wish they had all been a dream.
-But I finally get it now.

42
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,646
Those cruel times.

43
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,150
Mom…

44
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,318
The highest score!

45
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,820
She got a perfect score of 100 points!

46
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,531
-Mom…
-It's Hae-sook.

47
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,367
Eun-ho…

48
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,997
is Hae-sook's and my son.

49
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,882
It was like this back then too.

50
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,801
I was powerless.

51
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,804
I couldn't comfort

52
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,474
or scold you.

53
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,310
Goodness.

54
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,479
-Are you Ms. Lee Hae-sook?
-Yes.

55
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,147
Oh my, I saw the lottery show!

56
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,815
I cried with you.

57
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,609
-You lost your precious son…
-Right.

58
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:55,526
-I know.
-Right.

59
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,613
How did you recognize your son instantly?

60
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,866
When it comes to mother and son,
there's this pull that you feel.

61
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,118
-You know?
-Right, a pull. Exactly.

62
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,246
Yes, I'm sure you understand.

63
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,872
-I should get going--
-Hold on!

64
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,250
Could you give me your autograph?

65
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,668
-Just one will do.
-Honey.

66
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,587
-Honey.
-But wait…

67
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,505
Honey.

68
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,716
-Oh my.
-This is my husband.

69
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,135
Gosh, her husband is so handsome.

70
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,637
-I know.
-Goodness.

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,056
-Have a happy life.
-Have a happy life.

72
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,724
-They look so good together.
-I know.

73
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,018
Geez, that was nerve-wracking.

74
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,437
I should just stop going out.

75
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,440
Everyone keeps making a fuss
about the broadcast.

76
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,777
Did you watch it too?

77
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,073
No, I was napping and missed it.

78
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,992
I'm glad you did.

79
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,037
You came to my rescue back there.

80
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,122
You're the best.

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,334
Will you still
be able to look at me and smile

82
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,670
even after finding out about everything?

83
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,349
Ms. Lee, do you remember…

84
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,938
someone named Eun-ho?

85
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,189
Honey, look…

86
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,692
Eun-ho? Who's that?

87
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,821
Does it not ring a bell?

88
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,032
I'm afraid it doesn't.

89
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,784
Do you know him?

90
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,704
I'm not sure.

91
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,915
It doesn't ring a bell for me either.

92
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,844
Didn't I tell you not to talk nonsense?

93
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,431
But why can't she remember her own son?

94
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,185
Didn't you say Eun-ho was your child?

95
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,689
As for me, just the thought of him
makes me tear up.

96
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,151
My heart aches.

97
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,361
I'll ask her myself.

98
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,780
I said no.

99
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,325
I knew you'd react like this.

100
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,870
Did you even love me?

101
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,331
Just answer me that.

102
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,541
And if I do?

103
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:18,961
Will you leave?

104
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,593
You must've been like this back then too.

105
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,512
You still think everything will be fine

106
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,181
if I just disappear, don't you?

107
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,812
Then hate me with everything you've got
like you did then.

108
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:39,690
I…

109
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,612
I can't hate you.

110
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,614
Okay?

111
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,957
I never thought
something like this would happen to me.

112
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,710
If you sincerely pray just like I did,

113
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,672
then you'll surely receive
a blessing like this as well.

114
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,589
-Okay.
-Amen.

115
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,174
-Amen.
-Thank you.

116
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,425
Oh my, here she comes.

117
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,971
Now that you're side by side,
you really look alike.

118
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,724
The mother and son have reunited.

119
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,642
Hallelujah.

120
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,394
Yes, hallelujah indeed.

121
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,232
Pastor, isn't it past our service time?

122
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,985
No, we can take our time.

123
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,319
Sharing our hearts like this

124
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,322
can be more important
than the service at times.

125
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,870
What's wrong with your eye?
Lack of magnesium?

126
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,626
Goodness. Are you feeling unwell, my son?

127
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,086
What should we do?

128
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,213
-Let me see. Let's go inside.
-Okay.

129
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,048
-Let's go inside.
-Goodbye then.

130
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,931
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
You're not to blame.

131
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,809
It's okay.

132
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:01,481
You had to lie just to grant the wish
of a peculiar old woman like me.

133
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,568
Please just think that I was repaying you.

134
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,821
You've practically treated me
like a son all this time.

135
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,284
I wonder
if I'm going to end up in Hell again.

136
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,621
The president knows everything,

137
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,540
so it's even scarier
that he's been silent.

138
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,336
They would've taken you away
during the broadcast if they wanted to.

139
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:24,962
Do you think so?

140
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,926
So what are we going to do now?

141
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:35,097
Everyone in Heaven firmly believes
that we're mother and son.

142
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,062
How long will you and I have to lie?

143
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,206
You shot a dog with an air gun
while driving?

144
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,544
Why shoot an innocent dog?

145
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,420
Get up.

146
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:08,839
Go.

147
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,591
Jjajang, this is her.

148
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,927
She threw Basset off the fifth floor.

149
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,428
-This is her.
-I see.

150
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,972
-So it was her.
-Yes.

151
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,515
Drag her away.

152
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,101
-Stay still! Come here.
-March!

153
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,562
Did you think you could get away
with that? Come here!

154
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,564
Stay still!

155
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,481
Stand here!

156
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,149
Stand up straight!

157
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,947
Our train has arrived at Hell Station.

158
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,084
No!

159
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,808
Hey, are your teeth okay?

160
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,102
-What?
-Take care of them.

161
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,146
One wrong move, and you'll need implants.

162
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,940
By the way, isn't it so fascinating?

163
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,567
We can see their past lives.

164
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,278
Come on, this is Hell.
That should be a given.

165
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,399
What is that?

166
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,193
Is that me?

167
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:00,910
What is this?

168
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,373
I must've been a dog
in my second-to-last past life too.

169
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,419
Where are you going?

170
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,469
You can't do that. You shouldn't do that.

171
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,555
Don't do that. You can't do that.

172
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,767
Jjajang.

173
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,019
What's the matter?

174
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:28,938
I think

175
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,108
I committed a great sin in that life.

176
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,193
What? That was random.

177
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,399
Gosh, I fell asleep again.

178
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,110
Was I out for long?

179
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,904
You were completely out cold.

180
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:19,822
Goodness.

181
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,700
I should sleep in my bed.

182
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,911
Ms. Lee.

183
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,079
Yes?

184
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,000
-During the lottery show…
-Yes?

185
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,919
You said the pastor was your son.

186
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,464
That was a lie, wasn't it?

187
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,508
You're right.

188
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,387
I only said it because I got greedy
thinking about Young-ae.

189
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:48,100
But forced happiness
doesn't equal true happiness.

190
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,271
I feel bad for the pastor too.

191
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,636
REINCARNATION GUIDE BOOK

192
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,268
Reincarnation?

193
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,604
Why, all of a sudden?

194
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,857
Don't tell me it's because

195
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,485
I talked about
how we had to continue lying.

196
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,779
No, that's not why.

197
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,032
A while back,

198
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,118
the president had actually
recommended it to me.

199
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,087
But I was afraid of everything back then,
so I hesitated.

200
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,049
"What if I end up unhappy

201
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,176
even in my new life?"

202
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,971
"What if I get abandoned again?"

203
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,598
But now,

204
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,685
I kind of want to live a normal life
like everyone else.

205
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:18,107
I want to become a son again
and also become a parent myself.

206
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,069
Don't you want to meet your birth mother?

207
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,993
In the past, I didn't want to meet her
because I truly hated her.

208
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,161
But now…

209
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,998
I don't think I need to meet her.

210
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,125
I think

211
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,504
my anger has faded a bit,
and I feel more at peace.

212
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,346
You made the right decision.

213
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,223
You really did.

214
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,482
I'll help you prepare for reincarnation.

215
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,692
I might not look like it,

216
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,153
but I've sent quite a few people
down there.

217
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,740
Is there really anything to prepare?

218
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:12,328
Of course. Even kindergarteners these days
eagerly prepare for a head start.

219
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,664
You can't lose out.

220
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,582
Just trust me.

221
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,711
What should I learn first?

222
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,547
The most necessary thing for living.

223
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,094
Is that the best angle your legs can do?

224
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,597
What?

225
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,100
Can't you do this?

226
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,564
By the way…

227
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,692
Why is this
the most necessary thing for living?

228
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,987
Wherever you go,
you can never look like a pushover.

229
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,530
Humans are animals too.

230
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,782
So the moment they see you,

231
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:54,453
they'll set a hierarchy instinctively.

232
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,958
And once that hierarchy is established,
it won't change even when you get older.

233
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,543
So what then?

234
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,671
Do I have to be like this
from kindergarten?

235
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,090
If possible, start in the nursery.

236
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,468
All the babies will be lying there.

237
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,596
The ones who cry constantly are amateurs.

238
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,808
There are those who sleep quietly

239
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,352
and only cry when they're hungry or wet.

240
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:22,189
The nurse will come running

241
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,567
because the baby
who doesn't usually cry is crying.

242
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,779
I see.

243
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,054
If I disappear,

244
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,225
will you be happy?

245
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,396
Why won't you answer me

246
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,816
whenever I ask if you don't love me?

247
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,945
Is it because you really don't?

248
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,325
I want to tell
that oblivious woman everything

249
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,288
and make her suffer like me.

250
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,385
Last night…

251
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,057
I thought of doing something terrible.

252
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,562
"Three of us won't work."

253
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,939
"It has to be only two."

254
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,779
"But why should I be the one to leave?"

255
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,381
She could leave.

256
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:14,927
And that would make

257
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,221
just the two of us.

258
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,694
You're…

259
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,906
You're hurting so much.

260
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,616
You grabbed onto me.

261
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,870
So end me yourself.

262
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,039
How could I let you go?

263
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,084
How could I?

264
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,683
Gosh.

265
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,227
I think we can stop here.

266
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,437
You have to learn
as much as you can up here

267
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,315
so they'll praise you
for being sharp down there.

268
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,609
How will you date anyone like this?

269
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,279
What? Dating?

270
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,197
Unbelievable.

271
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,992
Dating? Don't be ridiculous. Good grief.

272
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,245
I didn't say much,
so why are you blushing?

273
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,122
What is it?

274
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,375
-Does that word give you butterflies?
-Not at all.

275
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,711
I may not look it, but I'm…

276
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,171
You've never dated before.

277
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,342
Women aren't into guys who've never dated.

278
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,804
How will you know what women want
if you've never dated one before?

279
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,059
Sit down if you want to learn more.

280
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,104
Geez.

281
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,772
There's trash on the floor.

282
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,109
Judging by your words,

283
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,196
you must be some kind of dating expert
or something.

284
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,323
I was single all my life too

285
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,867
until I met my husband.

286
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,329
Wasn't everyone like that back then?

287
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,956
You'd get married
without even seeing your spouse's face.

288
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,874
Even back then,

289
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:13,003
those who were good at dating
would climb over walls to go out and date.

290
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,588
I see.

291
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,882
But I realized
that there's nothing special.

292
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,927
I just believed
that my husband was my fate

293
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,511
and just kept living.

294
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,058
Of course, I was frustrated
with my husband at times.

295
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,854
There's one memory I still can't forget.

296
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,274
His clothes were catching fire,

297
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,945
but he was still patting out
the fire on my clothes.

298
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,155
You were on fire? How?

299
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,075
Good question.

300
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,246
Why did my clothes catch fire?

301
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,123
Was it from the hearth?

302
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,252
No, hold on.

303
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,588
Oh my.

304
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,300
Why can't I remember?

305
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,265
I don't remember a thing.

306
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,687
I see. Could it be because of old age?

307
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,148
It must be.

308
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,070
Anyway, fate is nothing special.

309
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,738
All right then.

310
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:25,617
Where do you go
and how do you make that fate happen?

311
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,369
How?

312
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,204
My throat is a bit dry.

313
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,248
Is it?

314
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,332
Water…

315
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,544
I'll get you some water,
so make sure you tell me. Hold on.

316
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,505
Water…

317
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,551
A cup…

318
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,639
It won't take long. Hold on a second.

319
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,064
"Fate."

320
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,190
HOW TO MAKE NEW FATES

321
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,902
"When a girl asks a guy,

322
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,238
'Babe, did I gain weight?' then say…"

323
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,115
"Where are you…"

324
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,033
"Where…"

325
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,827
Right. "Where?"

326
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,747
"Babe, did I gain weight?" "Where?"

327
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,714
How did you know that I was reviewing
what you taught me today?

328
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,592
Who…

329
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,303
-Hello.
-Hello.

330
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,514
Hey, I thought you guys got a job in Hell.

331
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,349
Well…

332
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,437
Geez.

333
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,940
Jjajang, hurry up and tell him.

334
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:44,738
Jjajang remembered something
after watching that lottery show.

335
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:46,948
You see…

336
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,993
I always had a vague memory of it,

337
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:55,540
but I had no idea that the kid was you.

338
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,583
It's the truth.

339
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,377
I think it's all my fault.

340
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,421
Your fault?

341
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,701
Damn it. That mutt is here again!

342
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,953
Get lost!

343
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,443
Mom.

344
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,781
Mom.

345
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,993
Mom.

346
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:21,209
Mom!

347
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,545
Damn it.

348
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,048
All because of that stupid twisted donut.

349
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,467
If only I hadn't barked…

350
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,221
I'm sorry.

351
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,432
Hey.

352
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,017
Hey, don't cry. Okay?

353
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,644
It's okay.
I already let go of the past. Okay?

354
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:44,274
I didn't remember any of that
until you brought it up. Really.

355
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,694
But it's still my fault.

356
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,201
You were just hungry. It's okay.

357
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,496
I'm even preparing for reincarnation
with a positive attitude now.

358
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,166
So just forget about it, okay?

359
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,210
It's okay. Get up.

360
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,712
Get up now. Upsy-daisy.

361
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,590
-I'm really sorry.
-It's okay.

362
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,518
They used to say that
making sorghum red bean rice cakes

363
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,812
for a 100-day-old baby
would ward off evil spirits.

364
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,440
Since you're basically being reborn,

365
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,359
you should definitely eat this
before you go.

366
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,986
Here. Try one.

367
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:31,780
Here.

368
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:35,951
It's delicious.

369
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:36,868
-Is it?
-Yes.

370
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,286
You're eating so well.

371
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,998
Think ahead
about what you'll want to eat on Earth.

372
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,918
They say whatever a mom craves
during morning sickness

373
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,754
is actually what the baby wants to eat.

374
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,465
Then could I ask her to make

375
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,593
some rice and freshwater snail wraps?

376
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,429
Of course you can.

377
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,183
I doubt she'll make it
quite as good as I do, but still.

378
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,066
I'll miss your cooking

379
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,319
when I leave.

380
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,365
There's so much good food down there
that you'll forget about mine.

381
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,537
I heard kids these days
love eating spicy food,

382
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,830
but it'll ruin your stomach.

383
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:27,127
Well, I'm sure your mom will know
how to take care of you best.

384
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,343
Be a good son to your mother, all right?

385
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:42,434
Of course.
I won't pick fights like you did.

386
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,326
Sonya.

387
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,330
When did you get here?
You could've let me know.

388
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,041
I don't really like you.

389
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,251
Do you still not know that?

390
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,880
Then again,
you always only listened to Hae-sook.

391
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,341
Even so, I adored you.

392
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,261
I wanted to thank you too.

393
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,930
I did that

394
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,057
not for you

395
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,434
but for Mom.

396
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,272
Because Hae-sook would be sad if I died.

397
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,484
Right.

398
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,488
She doesn't deserve to suffer anymore.

399
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,616
You made her suffer her whole life.

400
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,869
And now, you even dragged that thing here.

401
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,373
Did you know?

402
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,626
I told you. I love Mom the most.

403
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,630
How could I not know everything
about the person I love?

404
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,634
Sonya!

405
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,762
I hate anything that makes Mom suffer.

406
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,228
She disappeared again.

407
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,357
She doesn't like me that much, does she?

408
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,240
Gosh, I'm tired.

409
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,203
Give me a piggyback ride

410
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,748
like you did for Ms. Lee.

411
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,052
I know.

412
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,681
I know why
you're suddenly being so nice to me.

413
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,684
You think I'll disappear on my own

414
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,688
if you treat me well.

415
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,067
That's what you want, isn't it?

416
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,783
Let me down.

417
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,461
I may not have my memories,

418
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,922
but I can still figure out that much.

419
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,135
Who I am.

420
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,180
Whether you love me.

421
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,432
Whether you don't love me.

422
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,477
None of that matters anymore.

423
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,105
I just want to be

424
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,316
by your side

425
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,860
forever, Nak-joon.

426
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,573
If I asked you to come with me,

427
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,493
would you go anywhere?

428
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,204
Yes.

429
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:32,872
Anywhere.

430
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,167
Even if it's Hell, I'm coming with you.

431
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,170
Okay.

432
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,589
Let's go.

433
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,177
Whether it be Hell or elsewhere.

434
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,621
Finish all the rice cakes
before you leave.

435
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,958
How could I eat all of them by myself?

436
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,170
All right.

437
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:25,425
I won't share it with anyone.
I'll stuff myself and eat every last bite.

438
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,552
I'll get going then.

439
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:32,015
Tomorrow is a big day,
so go to bed early tonight.

440
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,392
Goodbye.

441
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,317
What is it?

442
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:48,281
I'm going to walk you home.

443
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:49,949
For the last time.

444
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,745
Sounds good. For the last time.

445
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,895
Do you know this flower's name?

446
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,482
Limelight.

447
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,784
You don't know the name of this flower,
do you?

448
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,495
It's a beach rose.

449
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,398
Here we are.

450
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,026
So we are.

451
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:54,032
What are you going to do
when you get bored after I leave?

452
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:58,119
I'll just hang out and crack jokes
with another pastor.

453
00:33:58,953 --> 00:33:59,787
I see.

454
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,292
I'll forget you pretty quickly too, so…

455
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,253
I couldn't tell you yesterday

456
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,130
because you were teaching me
so passionately.

457
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,842
But they say you forget all your memories
from this life when you reincarnate.

458
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:13,760
I know.

459
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,595
You do?

460
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,554
Then why did you--

461
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,098
See? This is how clueless you are.

462
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,895
It was just an excuse.
An excuse to spend more time with you.

463
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,732
I see…

464
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,485
This is why I'm never at peace.

465
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,322
Anyway, let's say goodbye
with a smile tomorrow.

466
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,823
I'll be there to see you off.

467
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:40,078
Geez, don't bother.
What'll you say behind my back this time?

468
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:40,995
Goodbye then.

469
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,372
I'll do what I want!

470
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,380
He's not looking back even once.
That's hurtful.

471
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,911
You're home.

472
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:22,912
Hi.

473
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,498
What's wrong? Were you crying?

474
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,042
No, I wasn't.

475
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,129
What's wrong?

476
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,091
Did something happen at church?

477
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:36,926
No.

478
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,471
The pastor will do fine down below, right?

479
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,182
I hope he finds good parents.

480
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,725
Right.

481
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,185
I really hope he does.

482
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,564
I don't know why I'm so worried about him.

483
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,608
Because you cared so much about him.

484
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,196
Gosh, I tried so hard not to cry.

485
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,449
I was worried that
he might change his mind

486
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,577
if I cried and made a scene.

487
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,915
You did well, Hae-sook.

488
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,086
What would it have been like
if we'd had children?

489
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,091
Why?

490
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,928
I mean, living just with you
was wonderful.

491
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,847
It really was, but…

492
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,848
Honey.

493
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,104
Do you really not remember anything?

494
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:32,607
Remember what?

495
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,026
Why are you crying?

496
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,744
Goodness. What's wrong, honey?

497
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,955
-What don't I remember?
-Never mind.

498
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,375
I mean…

499
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,713
Our happy memories together.

500
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,715
Don't you remember them?

501
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,717
You scared me.

502
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,011
Of course I do.

503
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,056
I thought… Are you going
through andropause or something?

504
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,851
I guess so.

505
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,021
I'm sorry.

506
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,440
I'm sorry.

507
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,402
I was…

508
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,531
happy.

509
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,662
It was enough.

510
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,331
No.

511
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,417
We suffered enough.

512
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,086
We did.

513
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:52,895
No?

514
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,606
I thought I could go to Hell
if I did this.

515
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,612
Send me there!

516
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,615
Let me disappear this instant!

517
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,004
Sonya?

518
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,675
Do you know

519
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,845
how I can go to Hell?

520
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,433
You don't have to try so hard.
You'll be erased from existence soon.

521
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:34,895
What?

522
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,857
You can't stay in Heaven or Hell.

523
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,069
Do you think you're human?

524
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,615
Then what?

525
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,119
You think you lost your memories,
don't you?

526
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:04,925
Then…

527
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,012
what are all these memories?

528
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,598
They're not yours.

529
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:21,650
Then…

530
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,570
who in the world am I?

531
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,112
Should I go with you?

532
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,198
No, the pastor even told me to stay home.

533
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:13,744
I'm just going to take a quick look
from afar and come back home.

534
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,037
You won't cry, will you?

535
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,540
Of course not. I'll be back.

536
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,707
Okay, be safe.

537
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,639
There is something I want to ask.

538
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,227
I'll go to Hell.

539
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,313
But…

540
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,607
I need you to answer me this.

541
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,989
Goodbye.

542
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,997
What am I going to do?

543
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,672
Excuse me. Have you seen the pastor?

544
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,050
Is he not here?

545
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,553
Oh, no.

546
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,016
Where is he?

547
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:29,278
Goodness, my heart…

548
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,990
Tell me who I am.

549
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,329
My memories are just fragments.

550
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:43,167
And they're just memories and emotions
from single moments.

551
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:48,631
I'm missing way too many puzzle pieces
to put the picture together.

552
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,967
Of course.

553
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,136
Is it true…

554
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,640
that I'm not…

555
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,018
human?

556
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,270
It's a vivid memory

557
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:07,233
and the raw emotion itself.

558
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,403
Hae-sook cut off the painful
and sad emotional entity herself

559
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,697
in order to survive.

560
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,450
She couldn't possibly live

561
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,953
while holding onto it.

562
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,080
How…

563
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,043
How is this possible?

564
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,712
Rejected and ignored memories

565
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,091
are buried deep in our subconscious.

566
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,928
After all, they were a part of her too.

567
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,723
You can say that those memories

568
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,852
were intense enough to become personified.

569
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,605
Then what am I supposed to do?

570
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:53,362
It's an emotion separated from her
due to her lack of love for it.

571
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,448
It needs understanding and love from her

572
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,286
to be purified and erased.

573
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,122
Pastor?

574
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,710
Pastor!

575
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,505
Pastor!

576
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,592
Even those painful emotions

577
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,469
still belonged to Hae-sook.

578
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,098
That's why I couldn't let you go.

579
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,311
Now I understand.

580
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,939
I get why
I reached out to you instinctively.

581
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,170
Eun-ho.

582
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,673
Eun-ho.

583
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,175
Eun-ho!

584
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,302
Ko Eun-ho!

585
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,096
Eun-ho!

586
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,389
Eun-ho!

587
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,974
Eun-ho!

588
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,603
Have you seen our pastor?

589
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,773
Have you seen our pastor? Have you…

590
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,192
-Have you seen…
-No, sorry.

591
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,575
My baby.

592
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,747
My son.

593
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,499
Eun-ho!

594
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,304
Our Eun-ho…

595
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,818
It's all my fault.

596
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,611
It's all my fault.

597
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,322
If only…

598
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,494
If only I hadn't left you behind…

599
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,881
Ko Eun-ho, are you not going to stop?

600
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,008
Do you want a spanking?

601
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,846
I can't live without Eun-ho.

602
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,558
Eun-ho! Ko Eun-ho!

603
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,144
Honey.

604
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,771
Our son… Please?

605
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,190
Bring him back quickly.

606
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,151
Please bring him home…

607
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:26,241
Oh my, you're walking so well. That's it.

608
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,451
One more step.

609
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,662
What a good boy.
Just one more step to Mommy.

610
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,998
Yes, one more step. That's it.

611
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:33,916
That's it.

612
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,710
What a pretty boy.

613
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,295
-It's sailing gently
-Hae-sook.

614
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:40,672
Hae-sook.

615
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:42,841
Honey.

616
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,012
Eun-ho's sleeping. Be quiet.

617
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:52,351
To the western land

618
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,774
Hae-sook.

619
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,151
To the western land

620
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,236
Hae-sook.

621
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,117
Hae-sook.

622
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:18,961
No…

623
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,088
No.

624
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,477
Honey.

625
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,603
Hae-sook!

626
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,315
Honey! Lee Hae-sook!

627
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,568
Honey!

628
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,153
Hae-sook!

629
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:47,906
Lee Hae-sook!

630
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,368
Honey! Lee Hae-sook!

631
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,454
Hae-sook!

632
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,186
It's my fault.

633
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,565
It's all my fault.

634
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,026
It's your fault.

635
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,195
It's all your fault.

636
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,198
Eun-ho.

637
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,200
Aren't there many people here?

638
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,661
Don't let go of Mommy's hand. Understand?

639
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,212
Ko Eun-ho.

640
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,714
Mommy, look at this.

641
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,800
What did I tell you?

642
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:52,679
I told you Santa would get it for you
as a Christmas present. Let's go.

643
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,848
Buy it for me!

644
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,017
You have lots of toys at home.

645
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,727
But I don't have this one.

646
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,187
I said no.

647
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,360
You just let go of Mommy's hand.

648
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,320
Mommy is leaving.

649
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,578
Aren't you coming?

650
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:29,049
Fine. You can stay there by yourself.

651
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,926
Mommy is really leaving.

652
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,314
Excuse me.

653
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,235
Excuse me.

654
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,198
Wasn't there a boy…

655
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,408
Eun-ho.

656
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,660
Eun-ho.

657
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:57,744
Eun-ho?

658
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,747
Eun-ho!

659
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,500
Ko Eun-ho!

660
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:06,461
Ko Eun-ho!

661
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,758
I should've just bought it for him.

662
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,429
It wasn't even a big deal.

663
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,773
Excuse me!

664
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,775
Eun-ho!

665
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,197
Eun-ho!

666
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,241
Eun-ho!

667
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:37,868
Eun-ho.

668
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,969
If you ever get lost,
go to the church. Okay?

669
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:58,555
The place where
they give out candies every Sunday.

670
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,765
Wait there.

671
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,101
I'll come get you. Okay?

672
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,811
Eun-ho.

673
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,022
Eun-ho!

674
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,774
Eun-ho!

675
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,153
Excuse me. Coming through.

676
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:14,821
Honey.

677
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,656
Honey…

678
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,574
It's okay.

679
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:18,825
-What do we do?
-It's okay.

680
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,619
Don't cry. Okay?

681
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:21,787
What happened?

682
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,997
Your son went missing.

683
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,501
I should've just picked him up
and brought him with me.

684
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,603
It's all my fault.

685
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,231
All of it.

686
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,817
Yes. It's all your fault.

687
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,443
Yes, you're right.

688
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,488
So you don't deserve to live either.

689
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,407
No!

690
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,826
No, Hae-sook!

691
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:02,828
Hae-sook!

692
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,454
Hae-sook, pull yourself together!

693
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,122
Pull yourself together!

694
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,801
Have some, will you?

695
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:19,678
Honey.

696
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,263
Remember what the officer said?

697
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,182
We need to keep it together
if we want to find him.

698
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:26,852
Okay?

699
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:44,286
MISSING CHILDREN

700
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:47,789
Hello.

701
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,502
I'm the father of the missing child,
Ko Eun-ho.

702
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,671
Did you find anything?

703
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:55,589
Geez.

704
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,132
Look.

705
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,301
We have many missing children.

706
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,594
MISSING FOR 32 DAYS

707
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,014
I'm working like a dog for peanuts
out of a sense of duty.

708
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,229
-Sir, please take this.
-Hey.

709
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,272
What are you doing?

710
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,281
He's a five-year-old boy.

711
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,783
He's been missing
for a little over a month. Please help.

712
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,703
Since I feel bad for you,

713
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,623
I'll look more into your case, okay?

714
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,043
What is this chump change?

715
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,961
Unbelievable.

716
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,094
I'm already busy as it is.

717
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,975
Check thoroughly!

718
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:49,976
Keep it up!

719
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,228
We won't ever find him at this rate.

720
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,148
Search faster. Go deeper inside.

721
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,359
-Hurry up!
-Yes, sir.

722
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,819
Check under the tree.

723
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,613
I'm checking now.

724
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,785
Please help us.

725
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:22,926
What's going on?

726
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,430
Excuse me!

727
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:28,890
Hae-sook!

728
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,058
What are you doing?

729
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,685
Let him go, and let's talk. Hae-sook!

730
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,269
Snap out of it, Hae-sook!

731
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,021
Think about Eun-ho!

732
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:52,622
Are you okay?

733
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,379
Our son…

734
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,381
Please find our son.

735
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,591
Our son… I'm sorry.

736
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,759
Please!

737
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,430
Please just find him! Please…

738
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,265
Hae-sook, open the door!

739
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,018
Hey.

740
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,477
Hae-sook.

741
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,645
Hae-sook!

742
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:25,780
Hae-sook.

743
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,699
Honey.

744
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:30,702
Should we buy Eun-ho a toy car?

745
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,038
Christmas is too far away,
don't you think?

746
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,000
Honey!

747
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,002
You're hurting him.

748
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:45,842
It's sailing gently

749
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:48,553
To the western land

750
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,935
No!

751
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:56,936
Eun-ho!

752
00:55:58,813 --> 00:55:59,647
Lee Hae-sook!

753
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,401
Just pretend Eun-ho never existed!
Come to your senses, Hae-sook!

754
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,029
He's gone now! Understand?
Just pretend he was never here!

755
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:16,915
If…

756
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,418
we never had Eun-ho to begin with…

757
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:23,463
If that were the case…

758
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,716
Could I have protected you

759
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,761
from falling apart every day?

760
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,773
Jeong-gu quit.

761
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,693
He seems to be living comfortably now.

762
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:48,822
Last time, he even went to Hawaii
with his family.

763
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,951
He quit?

764
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:53,868
Yes.

765
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:15,557
Sir.

766
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,893
Check the welfare centers.

767
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,605
It might be too late, but still.

768
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,362
They hand over lost children
to welfare centers and get paid.

769
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,865
The centers register them as orphans
to receive subsidies.

770
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,038
I heard they even send them
for overseas adoption

771
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,248
and get a commission.

772
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:47,297
SEONGMI WELFARE CENTER

773
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:55,847
Nice car.

774
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,891
Not bad, right? I got it in black.

775
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,350
Thanks for all the help.

776
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,685
Kang Jeong-gu!

777
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,687
Damn it.

778
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:08,109
You said you'd find my son!

779
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,863
Stop the car, Kang Jeong-gu!

780
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,615
Stop the car!

781
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:44,562
At that moment,

782
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,232
I thought of you.

783
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:29,649
Honey!

784
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,900
Are you awake?

785
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:35,405
I thought I was losing you…

786
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,824
I was terrified.

787
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,660
Oh my, he's awake.

788
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:41,578
Yes.

789
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:42,745
Oh my goodness.

790
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:46,332
She took such good care of you
every single day.

791
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,917
It's a miracle.

792
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,420
See?

793
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:54,257
If you have the will to live,
Heaven will open a path for you.

794
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,219
You'll forget about your son too.

795
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,222
So keep your chin up, dear.

796
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,224
Thank goodness.

797
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:07,687
Honey.

798
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,564
"Son"?

799
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,401
What was she talking about?

800
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,406
She must've mistaken you…

801
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:22,827
for another patient.

802
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:23,745
Right?

803
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,542
I prayed that you'd pull through.

804
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:32,253
No.

805
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,797
I prayed that you wouldn't suffer.

806
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:37,884
If it was possible,

807
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,721
I prayed you'd forget about all this.

808
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:44,766
If I told you now

809
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:48,478
that I was afraid of losing you as well…

810
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,399
will you forgive me for my prayer?

811
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,402
You just wanted to save yourself.

812
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,779
That's why you forgot Eun-ho.

813
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,197
How could you?

814
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,282
What parent erases their child

815
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,202
just because they're in pain?

816
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:06,746
This is your fault.

817
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,206
Hae-sook.

818
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:09,749
It's not your fault.

819
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:10,875
Hae-sook!

820
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:13,878
Hae-sook.

821
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:14,962
Hae-sook.

822
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,048
Nothing is your fault.

823
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,092
You're the same.

824
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:32,563
Yes.

825
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:35,650
It's my fault.

826
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,736
It's what I wished for.

827
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,406
You didn't let me remember him

828
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:44,200
or grieve properly.

829
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:46,786
You're right.

830
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,500
So…

831
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,380
let's…

832
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:00,508
go together.

833
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,522
-Let me go!
-Don't do this!

834
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:15,606
Let go!

835
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,651
Why would you walk in here?

836
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,529
Please!

837
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,219
Honey…

838
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,137
Honey, no.

839
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,223
Honey, no. Don't…

840
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,391
Mom.

841
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,583
Mom, it's me.

842
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,337
Eun-ho.

843
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:24,467
My baby.

844
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,011
Eun-ho…

845
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,100
Is it…

846
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,145
really you?

847
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:38,606
My son.

848
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,317
Is it really you?

849
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:44,612
Yes.

850
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:51,869
My baby…

851
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,664
Where were you?

852
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,416
I looked everywhere for you.

853
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,838
I even went to the church.

854
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:04,799
I never…

855
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,427
forgot about you even for a second.

856
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:11,597
It's okay, Mom.

857
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,891
I'm sorry.

858
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,726
I'm so sorry, my baby.

859
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:19,438
You must've been terrified and lonely.

860
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,607
You must've cried so much.

861
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:24,402
You must've been so hungry.

862
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:26,654
Where did you sleep?

863
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:29,615
Who took you? It's okay.

864
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,785
You can tell me anything. Tell me.

865
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:34,328
It's okay.

866
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,247
Mom.

867
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,498
You can tell me.

868
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:38,833
Don't feel sorry.

869
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:41,294
Mommy is leaving.

870
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:49,260
Fine. You can stay there by yourself.

871
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:51,137
Mommy is really leaving.

872
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,123
Mom!

873
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,126
Mom!

874
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:28,215
You always told me.

875
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:30,843
Mom!

876
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:34,472
To wait in front of the church
if I ever got lost.

877
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:52,281
Hey, kid. Why are you here?

878
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,784
I'll take you home. Come with me.

879
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:58,746
My mom told me to wait here.

880
01:05:58,829 --> 01:05:59,830
Did she?

881
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:01,415
Where is she?

882
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:03,376
I don't know.

883
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,713
It's cold,
so let's go to the police station.

884
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,065
Hey, kid.

885
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,359
What are you doing out here?

886
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:31,988
Don't you have a mom?

887
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:34,323
Yes, I do.

888
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:40,621
Be quiet! Get inside.

889
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:46,836
Stop crying!

890
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:49,839
I said stop crying!

891
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:51,507
My goodness!

892
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:09,942
Mom…

893
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:32,006
EUNHYE WELFARE CENTER

894
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:58,866
Yes.

895
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:01,327
I was very cold.

896
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,288
I was also in so much pain.

897
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:07,416
But…

898
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,212
I don't want to dwell
on the past anymore, Mom.

899
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,256
No, Eun-ho.

900
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:19,512
You would never hurt me.

901
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:26,894
Mom.

902
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,023
If you can't let me go,

903
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:35,236
I'll always be the five-year-old boy
who lost his mom.

904
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,701
Didn't you also sense it to some extent?

905
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,162
I'm sorry.

906
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,458
I don't quite understand
what you're talking about.

907
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,876
It's Hae-sook.

908
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:56,590
She's your mother whom you despised
and also loved so dearly.

909
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:07,685
Are you happy?

910
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:10,020
Pardon?

911
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:14,191
I'm curious if you're happy
spending time with her.

912
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:21,157
Yes. I was happy.

913
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:24,702
That is, until I found out
she was my birth mother!

914
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:33,377
The mother I had waited for my entire life

915
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,797
had actually forgotten me all along.

916
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,048
And then…

917
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:42,553
We met again as strangers

918
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:46,015
and had a relationship
like that of a mother and son.

919
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:59,361
What… What kind of twisted drama is this?

920
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:17,963
I…

921
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:24,261
I just don't know anything anymore.
It's just…

922
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,514
It's just very upsetting.

923
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,142
That at the end of suffering lies

924
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:34,230
enlightenment that's equal to its weight.

925
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,691
For the preciousness

926
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:39,860
of the smallest things.

927
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:46,283
That at the end of suffering lies
enlightenment that's equal to its weight.

928
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,496
For the preciousness
of the smallest things.

929
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:55,292
That what I earnestly desired

930
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:58,254
has already been possessed.

931
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:01,674
And…

932
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:03,509
Mom.

933
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:08,264
I thank you that my prayers

934
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:10,266
have already been answered.

935
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:17,481
I prayed every single day.

936
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,109
So that I could meet you.

937
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,028
And once we met…

938
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,449
I wanted to apologize

939
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,911
for throwing a tantrum about the toy

940
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:34,832
and for not keeping the promise we made

941
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,377
about meeting in front of the church.

942
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,838
I wanted to apologize for everything.

943
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:44,717
I also wanted to apologize…

944
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:49,763
for making you live

945
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,892
in oblivion and sorrow all your life.

946
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,104
I really wanted to say sorry.

947
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:11,118
I still remember

948
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:13,996
that cold day

949
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:17,249
and that night in the warehouse.

950
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:21,295
But…

951
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:26,342
I also remember
the warmth of your arms holding me.

952
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:31,889
Mom.

953
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:35,059
You can let me go now.

954
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,272
I can only leave once you do.

955
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:43,942
And…

956
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:46,278
once you let me go…

957
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:51,033
I hope you can find peace too.

958
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:00,250
Thank you, Mom.

959
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:28,695
Dad.

960
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:31,407
Eun-ho.

961
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,455
Thank you for protecting Mom.

962
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:47,381
Mom.

963
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,344
Don't be sorry

964
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,348
that you forgot about me
or that you didn't do enough.

965
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:01,979
We did so many things together
here in Heaven.

966
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:07,276
I'll do my best to live a good life.

967
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:11,447
I want to be as happy as I can

968
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:16,243
that I won't even remember this pain.

969
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:20,581
Just for a little while…

970
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:25,252
Why don't you stay just a bit longer?

971
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,676
This is as far as we go in this life.

972
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:37,723
We'll meet again soon in different bodies.

973
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,142
And…

974
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,812
we'll definitely recognize each other.

975
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,066
Because we're family.

976
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,029
Okay.

977
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:56,825
Let me hold you.

978
01:14:59,036 --> 01:14:59,870
My son.

979
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,187
Honey…

980
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:28,565
Our son is gone.

981
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:37,658
Honey.

982
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:40,661
From now on…

983
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:44,206
let's try not to be sad

984
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:46,833
even when

985
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:49,795
we remember him.

986
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:51,838
Okay?

987
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:53,632
Can you do that?

988
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:55,884
Yes.

989
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,493
-No mast
-No mast

990
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:28,542
-No oar in hand
-No oar in hand

991
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:32,379
-It's sailing
-It's sailing

992
01:16:32,462 --> 01:16:36,758
-Gently
-Gently

993
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:42,389
-To the western land
-To the western land

994
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,393
Yes! Good job, Eun-ho!

995
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:48,520
-Mom.
-Yes?

996
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,606
Does the rabbit not have any parents?

997
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:51,773
What do you mean?

998
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,777
Oh, because the rabbit
is all alone on the moon?

999
01:16:58,530 --> 01:16:59,531
We sang…

1000
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:03,243
It's sailing gently

1001
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:06,496
To the western land

1002
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,875
The rabbit's mom and dad
are in the western land.

1003
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,753
That's why
it's in a hurry to see its parents.

1004
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:13,754
Do you get it now?

1005
01:17:15,672 --> 01:17:18,634
But Eun-ho, why did you whisper?

1006
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:21,553
I was worried it'd hear and feel sad.

1007
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:22,888
Who would be sad?

1008
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:28,310
Do you mean the rabbit on the moon?

1009
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:29,227
Yes.

1010
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:32,773
Geez, where did such a cutie pie like you
come from?

1011
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:34,983
You're so adorable.

1012
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:38,111
Whose son are you, Eun-ho?

1013
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:39,655
He's my son. Right?

1014
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:40,989
Don't be silly!

1015
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:42,824
-I'm Mom's son!
-You're my son.

1016
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,785
-You're my son! Come here!
-Are you?

1017
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:46,828
-Come to Mommy!
-How dare you?

1018
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,121
-You're my son.
-You're my son.

1019
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,039
Mommy's son!

1020
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:51,416
-Come to Mommy.
-Where are you going?

1021
01:17:55,879 --> 01:17:56,797
Don't go too far.

1022
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:04,346
You know what?

1023
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,599
I think I'm pretty happy right now.

1024
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:10,060
Me too.

1025
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:14,106
There's nothing more I could ask for.

1026
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:07,033
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

1027
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:10,036
Aren't you entering
Young-ae's dream tomorrow?

1028
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,748
-Ms. Lee!
-Hi.

1029
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,916
What if we reincarnated as well?

1030
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:18,754
You don't want to keep living here
with your old wife?

1031
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:19,796
Stop right there!

1032
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:24,384
You never know. I might be
your 1.98 billion won lottery ticket.

1033
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:26,970
She has also been qualified
for reincarnation.

1034
01:19:27,053 --> 01:19:29,222
You'll go down together once again
and be reunited.

1035
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:31,266
"Once again"?

1036
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:34,603
-How do I look?
-Beautiful.

1037
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:38,482
I want to go back down now
and start afresh with you.

1038
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:41,026
We should stop now.

1039
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:48,700
