1
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,966
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

2
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,354
Wait, what…

3
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,607
What's… What's going on?

4
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,525
Why are you…

5
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:12,113
What is going on? I mean, why are you…
Why haven't you changed?

6
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,948
Hey!

7
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,951
Honey, hold on. Let's go sit over there.

8
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,036
Hang in there.

9
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,417
What in the world…

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,631
Maybe there was a mistake.

11
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,425
It just happened this way.

12
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,635
No, but exactly how?

13
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,804
Why? How? Just tell me what happened.

14
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,181
I'm exhausted. Let me be.

15
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,433
-Gosh.
-Right, of course.

16
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,812
The journey here isn't an easy one.

17
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:47,065
Wait. You weren't sick
before coming here, were you?

18
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,525
No.

19
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,859
Gosh, thank goodness.

20
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,944
Yes.

21
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,073
Did you waterproof the rooftop?

22
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,910
It always leaked during the rainy season,
and mold would grow.

23
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,246
And the kitchen faucet?

24
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,873
You just needed to replace
the rubber seal to fix the leak.

25
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,626
Young-ae will take care of it.

26
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,254
None of that matters right now,
so why are you concerned?

27
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,965
I'm just worried
that you went through the hassle

28
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,050
since I left you to handle everything.

29
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,428
You always hated that old house
and wanted an apartment in your next life.

30
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,265
Apartments have elevators.

31
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,725
Whenever we wanted to take you outside,

32
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,019
Young-ae and I
had to go through the hassle

33
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,438
of carrying so much stuff.

34
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,108
Honey.

35
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,443
I want to show you something.

36
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,904
-Come here.
-What is it?

37
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,948
What? Just follow me.

38
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,839
Honey.

39
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,840
Faster!

40
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,800
What do you want to do
when your legs heal?

41
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,306
I just want…

42
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,351
to run.

43
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,231
Until I'm completely out of breath.

44
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,954
Her husband was young again
and wanted to show off.

45
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,833
Hae-sook always missed this side of him.

46
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:30,835
Honey.

47
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,465
Did you see that? How I ran?

48
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,509
Yes, you run well.

49
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,428
Do you feel better now?

50
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,683
I feel alive again.

51
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,102
Get on my back.

52
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,773
-Here.
-What are you doing? No thanks.

53
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,067
Why not? I want to give you
a piggyback ride.

54
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,487
Forget it. We're too old for this.

55
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,113
You're the only one who's old.

56
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,241
What did you say?

57
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,035
Hurry and hop on my back. Okay?

58
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,453
Come here.

59
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,456
All right. Taking off.

60
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,669
-It's too high. Put me down.
-Here we go.

61
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,046
Aren't you excited
that I'm giving you a piggyback ride?

62
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,424
Right? Don't we look like a lovely…

63
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,467
Mother and son.

64
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,219
Damn it.

65
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,096
What was that?

66
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,764
Let me down.

67
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,099
Okay.

68
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,894
I'm really okay though.

69
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,151
That was nice. Really.

70
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,654
-It felt like she was being pampered.
-You little…

71
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,115
Gosh.

72
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,574
What?

73
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,162
This must be it.
I've only heard about this.

74
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,081
They give these
to oldies in their eighties…

75
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,833
Gosh…

76
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,836
Let's go home. I'm tired.

77
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,671
Okay. Sure.

78
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,633
Honey, you haven't gotten
a house tour yet, have you?

79
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,011
I did all the interior decorating myself.

80
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,388
You'll be so surprised once you see it.

81
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,822
Honey.

82
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,202
This.

83
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:30,913
Do you remember this?

84
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,958
We talked about it
while watching a movie once.

85
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,418
You thought it'd be lovely

86
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,504
to sit in a rocking chair
and knit by the fireplace.

87
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,422
Don't you remember?

88
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,174
You know, like those old ladies abroad…

89
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,181
She did talk about it,
but she didn't mean in Heaven.

90
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,060
She's not saying
exactly what you're thinking, is she?

91
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,227
I don't know.

92
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,732
Now that I'm old, I can't even tell
if this is what I'm actually thinking.

93
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,234
I don't even know if I'm happy or sad.

94
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,904
Don't be like that.

95
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,782
I was so excited to show you everything
when I was decorating.

96
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,493
Aren't you happy to see me again?

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,369
I am.

98
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,579
Then sit down here.

99
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,373
I even did the sanding myself.

100
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,875
Just for you.

101
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,419
Maybe later.

102
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,423
All right then.
You can sit down next time.

103
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,384
Should we look around? Come here.

104
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,156
Oh, those?

105
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,492
Let me explain.

106
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,995
They say couples go hiking together
as they grow old,

107
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,705
so I thought we could do that too.

108
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,707
Sure, hiking is possible.

109
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,417
Really? Can you go?

110
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,337
Not me. I meant you could do it.

111
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:02,922
No.

112
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,633
I don't have to go either.

113
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,344
I'd rather just spend time with you.

114
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,638
-Where's the bedroom?
-The bedroom?

115
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,890
Would you like to take a look? Okay.

116
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,648
What do you think?

117
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,316
Doesn't it look soft and comfortable?

118
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,529
When you're old, it's hard to get up
if the mattress is too soft.

119
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,115
Is that so?

120
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,577
I'll replace it. I'll get a different one.

121
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,005
Right. Honey.

122
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,256
Do you remember

123
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,009
our honeymoon in Suanbo Hot Springs?

124
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,635
We saw this bed for the first time.

125
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,890
Remember how I picked you up
in the hotel room?

126
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,809
You must not remember. I'll show you.
I did this…

127
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,352
Why isn't this working? Hang on.

128
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,937
-I swooped you up--
-That's enough.

129
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,857
We haven't done anything like that
for over 40 years.

130
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,488
Right. Good point.

131
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,406
I'd like to rest a bit.

132
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,034
Rest up. Then let me just…

133
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,204
Should I get you a thicker blanket
instead of this one?

134
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,207
No, it's okay.

135
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,501
Really?

136
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,676
Get some rest.

137
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,804
I'll be in the living room.

138
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,182
Get some sleep.

139
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,708
Seriously. We're too old
to be acting like newlyweds.

140
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,087
He wanted to start over
young again with me.

141
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,590
Shouldn't he at least remember
what he said?

142
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,968
What was that? Did you call me?

143
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,267
Going somewhere?

144
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,894
No, I'm just stepping out
for some fresh air.

145
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,354
Then I'll tag along!

146
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,648
Let me go alone.

147
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,605
You said it.

148
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,066
You wanted us to meet again looking
exactly like we did before dying.

149
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,652
So why is it only me?

150
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,655
This is no Heaven!

151
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,827
I'd rather be in Hell
than be like this, you jerk!

152
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,380
Hae-sook felt like she was the only one
who didn't belong here.

153
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,301
I mean, I wasn't exactly
righteous enough to end up here.

154
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,804
Am I not meant to be here?

155
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,848
That would actually make more sense.

156
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,768
Hell might've been less uncomfortable.

157
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:47,438
If I'm in the wrong place,
then is someone coming to get me?

158
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,121
Why is she staring at me?

159
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,669
What? What is it?

160
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,967
This is a declaration of war.

161
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,304
It's only right to accept it
when someone picks a fight.

162
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,365
Gosh, it's so dry. That hurts.

163
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,827
As you age, your eyes become dry
because the tear glands--

164
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,870
Did I ask you? Damn it!

165
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:49,125
Hae-sook takes her frustration out
elsewhere after having lost the battle.

166
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,589
Where is she?

167
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,138
Where did you go?

168
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,973
Just around.

169
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,185
By the way, is this really Heaven?

170
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,854
Of course. Why do you ask?

171
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,773
It just feels similar
to where we used to live.

172
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,193
And I don't feel
particularly happy either.

173
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,780
That's probably because
everything's still new to you.

174
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,616
I was bored too when I first got here
since I didn't know anyone.

175
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,701
But you have me.

176
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,411
This is all your fault.

177
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,704
What?

178
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,832
She's just blabbering. Ignore her.

179
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,209
I see. Okay.

180
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,044
And…

181
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,506
things will get better
after you go through orientation tomorrow.

182
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,091
-Orientation?
-Yes.

183
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,510
Do I really have to do that? What a pain.

184
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,096
I'll be there with you, so don't worry.

185
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,640
Again, you're to blame for all of this.

186
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,186
Are you positive

187
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:54,190
that she's not speaking your mind?

188
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,691
-Yes.
-No.

189
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,286
Are we sleeping together?

190
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,914
Isn't it normal
for married couples to sleep together?

191
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,841
Hae-sook, where are you going?
You should sleep with me.

192
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,843
We slept in different rooms
when we were alive.

193
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,305
I can't sleep with someone next to me.

194
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,432
Are you…

195
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,394
not happy to see me again?

196
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,612
It's not that I'm not happy.

197
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,448
She wasn't expecting this kind of reunion.

198
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,617
Then why are you acting like this? I mean…

199
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,870
I'm not mad at you.
I'm just genuinely curious.

200
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,249
Perhaps living together

201
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,002
makes my love grow with each passing day.

202
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,259
But you're the most gorgeous
you've ever been right now.

203
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,513
I made a mistake.

204
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,140
I wrote down the wrong age.

205
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,394
Come on, of all the mistakes to make,
how could you…

206
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,190
I know. How could I make that mistake?

207
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,109
Look at you!

208
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,654
Everyone else has turned a new page
while you're all shriveled up…

209
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,781
Is he doing that on purpose?

210
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,954
Fine. Since you've turned out like this…

211
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,706
"Turned out like this"?

212
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,837
Since things have turned out like this…

213
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,507
No, I mean… Look.

214
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,343
I'm happy to see you again.

215
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,387
I don't care if you're 25 or 80.

216
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,973
You're still the same Lee Hae-sook to me.
It's okay.

217
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,309
But I'm not okay.

218
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,479
How do you turn that thing off?

219
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,315
Where is it? Do you have to keep it on?

220
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,275
It'll probably turn off when I sleep.

221
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,904
I'm tired. Let's sleep.

222
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,364
Hey, where are you going?

223
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,619
Hae-sook has seen this look before.

224
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,079
They had gone to Ganghwa Island
and missed the last ferry.

225
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,041
There was only one room
at the guesthouse, and it was cold.

226
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,919
They needed each other's body heat.
Their lips were moist--

227
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,800
It's more comfortable here.

228
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,219
If anything, I should sleep outside.

229
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,221
Sleep here. I'll sleep in the living room.

230
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,307
Okay.

231
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:35,893
Good night.

232
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,895
Sweet dreams.

233
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,074
Faster!

234
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,744
Yes.

235
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,664
As long as you're happy.

236
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,355
Did you sleep well?

237
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,151
What's with the uniform?
Where are you going?

238
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,236
Me? To work.

239
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,529
Work?

240
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,906
Do you have a job? What is it?

241
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,908
You'll find out soon enough.

242
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:19,246
By the way, can you help me with this tie?
It looks weird when I do it.

243
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,664
-Give it to me.
-Okay.

244
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,752
Where do you work?

245
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,087
Do you get paid?

246
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,048
Curious, aren't you?

247
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,050
Aren't you dying to know?

248
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,761
Just tell me.

249
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,554
Nothing in this world is free.

250
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,639
Be cute or something,
and then I'll tell you--

251
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:40,893
Sorry.

252
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,815
I work in the building
you're going to today.

253
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,528
All done.

254
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:58,118
Wow, this really brings back memories.

255
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,246
You always tied my tie before I got hurt.

256
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,540
Then you'd slap my butt like this and…

257
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,751
"Stand tall."

258
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,544
"Always be confident."

259
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,797
So you remember.

260
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,632
You do.

261
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,761
I'm going to wash up.

262
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,038
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

263
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,423
Honey, look at that.

264
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,092
"Special Heaven Tour."

265
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,679
You can visit the New Stone Age
or the Joseon Dynasty.

266
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,098
You can travel anywhere you want.
Isn't that funny?

267
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,143
SAUNA AT THE BOILING CAULDRON HELL!

268
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,519
INCREASE AFTERLIFE MONEY BY 12%

269
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,230
Check that out. Do you see that?

270
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,524
"Personal Trainers from Hell."

271
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,068
Buff men will teach us how to work out.

272
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,947
Now that my legs are healthy again,
how about we exercise together?

273
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,285
-Honey, do you see that?
-Yes.

274
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,746
That's where we're going.
I work at the Heaven Support Center.

275
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,956
I see.

276
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,630
Did you see her? She's a grandma.

277
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,551
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

278
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,637
Is this where
they'll hold the orientation?

279
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,016
It looks like a nice community center.

280
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,019
See? I told you
you'd get used to this place quickly.

281
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,813
-Do you see the staff members?
-Yes.

282
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,857
Everyone here is friendly,
so don't be afraid.

283
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,151
Besides, you have a handsome husband
by your side.

284
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,903
What's there to worry about?

285
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,613
Okay, let's go.

286
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,530
Let's go inside.

287
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,637
Oh, Lord.

288
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,313
Welcome.

289
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,066
Here at the community center,

290
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:38,237
we treat each and every one of you
like family with kindness…

291
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,030
-Lord.
-Hold on.

292
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,366
I have just one request.

293
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,160
-Could I just go back--
-One moment, please.

294
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,162
Turn off that echo right now.

295
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,543
Ma'am, I'm not God.

296
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,380
I'm the president
of the Heaven Support Center.

297
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:02,177
If you have any issues or requests,
you can visit the Service Center inside.

298
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,264
-Goodbye then. Wait--
-Please hear me out.

299
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,807
-I--
-Could you help me?

300
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,767
Right. Honey, just let go.

301
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,269
-Gosh!
-Let's wait a little bit.

302
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,562
I'm busy, so I should go.

303
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,400
Goodbye.

304
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,527
What are we having for breakfast today?

305
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,446
-How about some jajangmyeon?
-That's too heavy for breakfast.

306
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,323
Let's go with something fresh and light.

307
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,492
Sundae and rice soup. Yes, that's good.

308
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,911
Honey, he isn't God.

309
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,038
-No?
-No.

310
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:34,209
-He's the president of the Support Center.
-Then why was he glowing like that?

311
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,337
High-ranking civil servants
all glow like that.

312
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,422
I see.

313
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,300
I guess you're not high-ranking, are you?

314
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,801
Me? Well…

315
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,595
I'll probably get promoted if I work hard.

316
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:59,318
Residents come to this Service Center
to consult about their issues.

317
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,360
-I see.
-Yes.

318
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,364
Oh my.

319
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,199
Wait. What are you doing?

320
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:11,872
Maybe having a younger husband
isn't such a bad thing after all.

321
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,373
Sir.

322
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,962
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

323
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,088
-Really?
-Yes.

324
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,424
Let's keep walking, shall we? All right.

325
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,718
You shouldn't be
wandering around like this.

326
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,470
I already explained this to you.

327
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,806
You haven't actually passed away yet.
This is just a near-death experience.

328
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,561
You'll wake up in about an hour.

329
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,481
Please go to the Security Office
to fill out some paperwork.

330
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,692
Finish your tour, have your memory wiped,
and then you can return. Understand?

331
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,028
Can I not have it wiped?

332
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,742
You can't go back to Earth if you don't.

333
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,294
Hello.

334
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,545
Hello.

335
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,963
This is my wife.

336
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,424
-She just arrived yesterday.
-I see.

337
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:09,387
People think no one knows
what they do down there,

338
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,139
but we can see everything.

339
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,770
That's why you have to live a good life.

340
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,731
Hey!

341
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,191
Don't watch unnecessary things.

342
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,567
-It's a little scary here.
-Yes.

343
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,152
The next place will be fun.

344
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,863
They said the orientation
will be held there. Let's check it out.

345
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,743
Here at the Heaven Support Center,

346
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,621
we provide generous support for clubs

347
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,125
to give you a fulfilling afterlife.

348
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,795
Our featured clubs include
the cooking club,

349
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,755
Killer Dishes.

350
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,176
The fitness club,
Good Muscle Morning, Everyone!

351
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:52,305
And the hiking club, Mind Your Knees.

352
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:58,353
Gosh, I didn't realize
we had so many clubs.

353
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,983
Find new vitality in your heavenly life
through club activities.

354
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,569
-It's like a cultural center.
-Okay.

355
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,863
You can pretty much pursue any hobby here.

356
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,489
Is there anything you'd like to learn?

357
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,408
-No, not really.
-I see.

358
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:15,036
An orientation session for new arrivals

359
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,414
will begin shortly,

360
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,042
so please gather in the auditorium.

361
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,295
Let me repeat.

362
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,260
There's nothing to worry about.

363
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,429
Just listen to what they tell you.

364
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,097
Okay?

365
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,016
-Okay.
-Good.

366
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:39,853
Honey.

367
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,230
You can do this.

368
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:43,982
I can do this.

369
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,830
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

370
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,014
Hi there.

371
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,226
My, aren't you pretty?

372
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,936
What's your name?

373
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,980
-It's Park Gap-rye.
-What?

374
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,233
This is my mother-in-law.

375
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,193
Her name is Park Gap-rye.

376
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,487
Oh my, excuse me.

377
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,239
I'm sorry, ma'am.

378
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,324
That's okay.

379
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,742
It's nice to meet you.

380
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,162
You guys are in opposite bodies.

381
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:40,747
She…

382
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,750
granted my wish.

383
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,391
I'm sorry, Mother.
You're suffering because of me.

384
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,726
Don't be sorry.

385
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,813
Once you're cured
of this terrible disease,

386
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,648
divorce that good-for-nothing husband.

387
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,485
I'll happily find you a new match.

388
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,113
Start anew and fly free.

389
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,117
Goodness.

390
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:22,414
What am I supposed to tell your mother
when I meet her in the afterlife?

391
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,167
Her beautiful daughter ended up like this.

392
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,587
Still, I've been blessed

393
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,465
beyond what I deserve, thanks to you.

394
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,176
Even my birth mother abandoned me.

395
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:40,348
But you bathed me, dressed me…

396
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,561
Mother.

397
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,606
Promise me one thing.

398
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,361
Let's meet again

399
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,365
in our next life.

400
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,700
Stop it.

401
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,370
I told you to stop talking such nonsense.

402
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,290
If there is another life,

403
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,793
please come back as my child.

404
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,256
That's the only way

405
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,925
I could ever repay your kindness.

406
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,221
So please promise me.

407
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,849
All right.

408
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,560
I will become

409
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,438
your child

410
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,192
in our next life, okay?

411
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,155
Sweetie, I'm sleepy.

412
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,157
Okay, Mother. Come here.

413
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,789
Let's begin the orientation.

414
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,248
Give a round of applause!

415
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,929
Hello, everyone.

416
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,015
I am the president
of the Heaven Support Center.

417
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,977
First of all, welcome to Heaven!

418
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,484
All right.

419
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,822
As you may have noticed
when you first arrived,

420
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:24,244
Heaven is very similar to the world
you lived in during your lifetime.

421
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,621
We've prepared a familiar environment

422
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:29,624
so you can finish the things

423
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:33,002
you left incomplete in your previous life.

424
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,171
All right then.

425
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,590
How should you live

426
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,385
and what should you do here in Heaven?

427
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,512
Everyone.

428
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:46,349
You've all experienced death, haven't you?

429
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,894
Right.

430
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,396
So how was it?

431
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:56,359
That's right.
Most of your deaths were sudden.

432
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,654
You never knew when or how you would die.

433
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,033
Then did you truly
live your life to the fullest?

434
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,705
You were too busy to do that.

435
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,207
You regretted the past.

436
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,418
You worried about the future.

437
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,589
You were too busy being anxious
to truly live.

438
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,552
Would you have done so
had you known when you'd die?

439
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,515
That's why here in Heaven,
we want to give you the chance

440
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:32,228
to truly live without having any regrets
even if you die.

441
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,607
"But I'm already dead."

442
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,859
"Why should I do that
when I won't die anyway?"

443
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,654
Some of you might be thinking this.

444
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:47,577
However, in terms of time
as you understand it,

445
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,329
even this place isn't eternal.

446
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,916
I understand that our concept of time

447
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,376
might be difficult for you to fully grasp.

448
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,377
Sir.

449
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,755
Excuse me. Yes?

450
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:01,841
Again?

451
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,847
Report this and have it handled.

452
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:08,848
Yes, sir.

453
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,145
Everyone.

454
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,400
Please don't jump from high places.

455
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,363
Some people do reckless things
because they're already dead.

456
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,781
But please don't do that.

457
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,242
Every year,
several people jump from heights

458
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,702
and get injured.

459
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,372
You can't fly.

460
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,791
You can't run like Usain Bolt.

461
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,376
Lasers don't shoot from your eyes.

462
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,003
And you can't shoot spider webs
from your hands either.

463
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,256
You can't instantly heal
when you get hurt,

464
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,341
so you'll just end up
suffering tremendously.

465
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,263
Just like in the world you came from,

466
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:52,225
you only have abilities appropriate
to your age and physical condition.

467
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,142
Understood?

468
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,565
I'm done for.

469
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,149
Aren't you curious?

470
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,277
"But this is Heaven."

471
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,113
"Why can't we fly or instantly heal?"

472
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,240
It's simple.

473
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,618
It's because Heaven isn't a reward.

474
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,706
You didn't come here as a prize.

475
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,666
Heaven is just

476
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:21,754
where people who didn't go to Hell end up.

477
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,465
What does that mean?

478
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,051
It means if you mess up here,

479
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,763
you can still end up in Hell.

480
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,394
All right then.

481
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,814
What should you do to avoid going to Hell?

482
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,859
You shouldn't do
what you're told not to do.

483
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,111
Violence is forbidden.

484
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,947
Pulling other people's hair
isn't allowed either.

485
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,742
You also can't swear.

486
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,537
"You jerk! How dare you?"

487
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,123
"Gosh, you wicked brat."

488
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,711
We can overlook these
as playful banter. However…

489
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,088
"You fucker."

490
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,759
"What the fuck is wrong with you?"

491
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,595
-"You son of a bitch--"
-This is not allowed! Absolutely not!

492
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,932
Jealousy, rage, envy, lies.

493
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,352
Even the gentlest form of threat
isn't allowed.

494
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,521
As for giving the finger…

495
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,443
We can allow this. However…

496
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,071
This is not allowed!

497
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,574
Some pretend to adjust their glasses

498
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,826
and sneak in the middle finger.

499
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,245
We catch all of that.

500
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,918
Haven't you been to the Security Office?
There's not a single blind spot in Heaven.

501
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,212
Do you think
you luckily avoided the cameras?

502
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,340
We still know everything up here.

503
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,635
If you're really curious,

504
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:56,849
give it a try and land yourself in Hell!

505
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:09,070
I hope none of you will go there.

506
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,033
Come to think of it,

507
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:18,579
Hae-sook did everything Heaven forbade
throughout her life.

508
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,582
ORIENTATION FOR NEW HEAVEN RESIDENTS

509
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,461
Thank you.

510
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,922
HEAVEN BROADCASTING

511
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,553
Let's go.

512
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,810
WELCOME TO HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

513
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,399
Goodness.

514
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,572
That gaze feels
somehow familiar yet strange.

515
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,198
Who is she?

516
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,660
Is she someone with a grudge against me?

517
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,662
But there are so many.

518
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,665
-I'm sorry!
-Is she Nak-gu's mom from Ssangmun-dong?

519
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,293
-You foolish, fraudulent floozy…
-The rice shop owner?

520
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,753
Or…

521
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,424
Who could she be? Should I go and ask?

522
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,432
They should just send me to Hell
if I did something wrong.

523
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,392
I'm so anxious for no reason.

524
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,948
-We should all live good lives.
-Right.

525
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,784
-I think…
-Honey!

526
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,078
What are you doing over there? Come here.

527
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,497
What? What's wrong?

528
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,417
You must be hungry. Let's go get lunch.

529
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,253
Okay? Let's go.

530
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,506
Did you have fun?

531
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,092
How was the orientation?

532
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,968
-Nothing special, right?
-Yes.

533
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,429
-By the way…
-Yes?

534
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,599
They say sometimes
people come here by mistake, right?

535
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,559
Yes. There were more than I expected.

536
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,895
But you don't need to worry.

537
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,939
You lived a good enough life to be here.

538
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,359
-I'm not so sure about that…
-Payment is complete.

539
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,367
Even that's on the menu?

540
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,661
You can get whatever you want here.

541
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:25,206
Just think about what you want to eat
then pay with this.

542
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,917
But he just took it without paying.

543
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,418
He paid with his hand.

544
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,714
They say all the good deeds you do in life
are stored up in the afterlife.

545
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,385
They're all accumulated in your hand
like a bank account.

546
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,762
So instead of money, you use this.

547
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,058
Hae-sook was scared.
"Would I even have any money?"

548
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,769
Try making a payment yourself.

549
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:47,812
-Me?
-Yes.

550
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,565
Why not? Give it a try.

551
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,908
Payment is complete.

552
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,078
Hooray! It works for me too!

553
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,873
Goodness, I can't believe it!

554
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,213
No way. I just thought about this,
and it actually appeared!

555
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,048
-Goodness.
-Were you craving this?

556
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:16,966
Yes.

557
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,926
Don't you remember this dish?

558
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,469
It's from our first date.

559
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,470
What?

560
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,848
Right!

561
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,601
Viola Outside the Window! That restaurant!

562
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,020
You had the beef cutlet,
and I had the pork.

563
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,229
Right.

564
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,732
You ordered cream soup,
and I ordered vegetable soup.

565
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,364
What is it?

566
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,826
You're still so cute.

567
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,536
You are.

568
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,873
Geez, hearing that
doesn't make me happy one bit.

569
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,791
Hehe, I'm blushing.

570
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,753
-When will the batteries die?
-Look who's blushing!

571
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,672
Does this thing never break down?

572
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,183
When I was alive…

573
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,438
I always wanted
to walk home with you like this.

574
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,774
But I never got to.

575
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,109
I know this is trivial.

576
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,128
Did you check the forecast today?

577
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,005
Should I take an umbrella?

578
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,218
It's bright and sunny outside.

579
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,971
I don't think it'll rain today.

580
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,473
I'm heading out now.

581
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:48,891
Okay.

582
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,089
I'm heading out now.

583
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:23,968
I'm heading out now.

584
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,847
I'm heading out now.

585
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,187
I know this is trivial.

586
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,775
At sunset,

587
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,529
my heart felt heavier

588
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,614
than my immobile body.

589
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,494
You had to get through the entire day
alone in my place.

590
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,956
It must've been so difficult.

591
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,125
It wasn't difficult at all.

592
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,003
You had it harder being stuck at home.

593
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,757
I could go outside and get some fresh air.

594
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,219
Still, I enjoyed
going grocery shopping at sunset.

595
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,807
I'd think, "I should hurry and go home
so I can eat with him."

596
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,228
Just imagining how much
you'd enjoy the food

597
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,230
made me skip home.

598
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,531
Let me hug you,

599
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,200
my dear wife.

600
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,160
Why are you doing this now?

601
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,411
No thanks.

602
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,913
Why not?

603
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,248
You've been feeling awkward
and avoiding me all along.

604
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,333
It's okay.

605
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,710
We're married after all.

606
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,172
People will say
I'm senile or something. Forget it.

607
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,507
If she really didn't want to,

608
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,927
she would've run home by now
instead of being here.

609
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,844
Good point.

610
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,013
I should've realized that.

611
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,476
-What's that?
-What?

612
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,852
-What's wrong?
-Look!

613
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,191
I don't see anything.

614
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,776
-What?
-Is something there?

615
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,580
Who could she be?

616
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,762
Where's your dad?

617
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,099
I don't know.

618
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,935
He borrowed money from me, you know?

619
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,062
So call him and tell him to come home.

620
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,064
I don't know where he is.

621
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,609
Did he tell you to say that?

622
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,158
You've never met someone
truly stubborn, have you?

623
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,165
I'm incredibly stubborn.

624
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,168
I'm not moving an inch
until I get my money.

625
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,837
I'll lie down right here
and wait until I get paid.

626
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,631
Do as you please.

627
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,800
What a bold kid you are.

628
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,427
Don't say I didn't warn you.

629
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,935
Gosh, it's cold.

630
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,103
This is colder than ice.

631
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,899
My lips are already going numb.

632
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,984
It's cold since the heat isn't on.

633
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,819
You could've told me sooner.

634
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,365
Don't mind me. I'm not budging an inch.

635
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,196
This is too thin for winter.

636
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,702
I'm staying right here, so call your dad.

637
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,747
I'm off to school.

638
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,750
Why are you saying goodbye to me?

639
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,960
Are you not taking a lunchbox?

640
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,296
I'm okay.

641
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,809
Eat this, and make sure you call your dad.

642
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,778
This is crazy.

643
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,239
I've never packed lunches in my life.

644
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,075
Not bad though.

645
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,745
Maybe I should start a lunchbox business.

646
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,009
Did he do that?

647
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,055
Didn't it hurt?

648
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,350
Why didn't you cry?

649
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,102
If I cry,

650
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,688
he hits harder.

651
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,284
Instead of having you pay me back,
I'll just take your daughter.

652
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,869
That contract gives me the right.

653
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,412
Hurry up and stamp it.

654
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,960
I GIVE UP MY RIGHTS TO MY DAUGHTER.

655
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:08,140
We'll be living together from now on.

656
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,142
I can't promise much,
but I'll pack you lunches.

657
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,353
Take it or leave it.

658
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:48,949
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

659
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,243
WELCOME TO HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

660
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:53,996
Honey.

661
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,707
You'll feel more comfortable today, right?

662
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:00,877
I put a water bottle,
in case you get thirsty,

663
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,462
and a handkerchief in your bag.

664
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,339
I'll come pick you up again
when you're done.

665
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,091
You can do it.

666
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,634
I can do it!

667
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,927
-You can do it!
-I can do it!

668
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,178
-Okay. Goodbye.
-Bye.

669
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,571
I went from being an intimidating creditor
to a student.

670
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:30,240
Getting used to this is really hard.

671
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,743
Please come this way.

672
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,612
Do I smell?

673
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,845
No, thank you. I don't need it.

674
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,814
What am I supposed to do?

675
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,619
Which one of you took a dump
in the alleyway yesterday

676
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,871
and just walked away?

677
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,290
Geez.

678
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,086
Maybe they couldn't hold it in anymore.

679
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,547
Come clean
before we check the CCTV footage.

680
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,929
-It's you again?
-I'm sorry.

681
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:18,682
And which one of you peed
on the utility pole out front?

682
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,851
It was me.

683
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,232
And who peed right on top of that?

684
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:35,157
All right. No snacks for you three today.

685
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,075
Let me remind you again.

686
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,494
Public urination and defecation
are forbidden.

687
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:45,709
Is she looking down on us
just because we're old?

688
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,884
It seems like
you're in a similar situation as me.

689
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,469
Why did you do it?

690
00:50:56,678 --> 00:51:00,056
Were you also fooled
by your husband or something?

691
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,391
Husband?

692
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,144
I was already old when I met mine.

693
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,104
I just wanted my owner
to recognize me easily.

694
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,439
Owner?

695
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,068
Why would she call her husband
her "owner"?

696
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,074
What are you doing?

697
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,911
I've always been known
for being really hygienic.

698
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,207
All right. Thank you for your patience.

699
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,834
Your owners will be arriving today.

700
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,754
You can greet them
accordingly to how you were trained

701
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,839
once you're reunited.

702
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,257
Owners?

703
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,306
You're really the annoying type.

704
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,308
You hear that a lot, don't you?

705
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,947
I think I've come to the wrong place.

706
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,073
Right now?

707
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,741
Okay, understood.

708
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,327
Okay, they're here! Let's get moving!

709
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,870
This way!

710
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:04,788
All right.

711
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,289
Let's move!

712
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,374
Move it!

713
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,886
They just arrived, so please be patient.

714
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,375
-Choco!
-Come here!

715
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,336
-Hong!
-Toto!

716
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,479
Toto, I'm sorry.

717
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,481
I came too late, didn't I?

718
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,900
Toto, let's stay together from now on.

719
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,610
I missed you, Hong.

720
00:53:58,693 --> 00:53:59,778
Are you okay?

721
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,571
Bbomi, is your leg okay?

722
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,156
Are you running now?

723
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,658
You were running so fast.

724
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,076
Are you okay?

725
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,954
I missed you.

726
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,122
Oh my, they weren't human.

727
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,088
-I missed you.
-Let me see.

728
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,840
Thank you for being alive.

729
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,175
-Okay?
-Okay?

730
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,139
Is that…

731
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,102
you, Benji?

732
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:40,819
This is my scent.

733
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,404
Do you remember?

734
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,409
You do remember.

735
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,370
Yes.

736
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,999
It's me, Benji.

737
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,511
GUIDE DOG FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED

738
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,847
So this is what you looked like.

739
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,144
You went through so much because of me.

740
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,481
I've always felt so guilty, Benji…

741
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,321
Thank you, Benji.

742
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,245
Were you waiting for me?

743
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,124
For all these years?

744
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:47,052
Those of you who've met your owners
can move along together now.

745
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,183
Is someone coming for us too?

746
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,852
Of course not.

747
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,103
We're abandoned dogs.

748
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,731
I wish we had good owners too.

749
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:04,861
Are you guys dogs too?

750
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:07,947
Yes.

751
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,325
I'm Jjajang.

752
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:11,993
He's Jjampong.

753
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:13,870
And he's Mandu.

754
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:18,708
Everything…

755
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,668
was normal that day.

756
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,921
The leftover food was delicious too.

757
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,174
I had a bad feeling that day though.

758
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,427
HWARU DELICIOUS CHINESE RESTAURANT

759
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,398
Hey, Jjajang's running away! To the side!

760
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,449
Let's see.

761
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,370
1011-309.

762
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,956
"Timid, defensive biter."

763
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,292
310.

764
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,086
"Curious and energetic."

765
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,173
311.

766
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,426
"Calm but acts tough."

767
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,387
Okay, I posted them online.

768
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,722
We should get adoption inquiries soon.

769
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,767
I truly believed
I was qualified to be adopted.

770
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,810
Hey.

771
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,520
I told you mixed breeds have it rough.

772
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,981
I'm even neutered.

773
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,567
But I was a lost cause from the get-go
due to my age.

774
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,820
Hey, but didn't he have a chance?

775
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,825
Everyone else found their owners.

776
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,661
They all got adopted.

777
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:37,912
Except for us.

778
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,791
We told him to stop
since we were a lost cause.

779
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,044
But this guy had absolutely no clue.

780
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,716
He couldn't even read the situation.
He was just so excited.

781
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,135
I had no idea back then.

782
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,512
I didn't know that was our fate.

783
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:04,772
It's okay.

784
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,193
I'm sorry.

785
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:15,366
I thought

786
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,370
this might be better.

787
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,302
But since we don't have
an owner here either,

788
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,804
will we have to live like this forever?

789
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,265
Hey, this is a vast world.

790
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,809
-Surely someone will take care of us.
-Listen up, you two.

791
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,103
Let's start living on our own terms.

792
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,398
We need to stop relying on human toys.

793
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,859
Geez.

794
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,162
What's your name?

795
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:02,830
Hae-sook.

796
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:04,249
Hae-sook?

797
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,549
What's your favorite toy?

798
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,594
I'm not a dog. I'm a human.

799
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,348
All the other dogs say the same thing.

800
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,809
It's true.

801
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,868
Gosh, it's hot.

802
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,320
Sonya?

803
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,113
What took you so long?

804
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,782
Goodness, Sonya. Is that really you?

805
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:25,622
Let me see.

806
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:28,750
Did the swelling in your ear
finally go down?

807
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,419
Yes, it did.

808
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:32,837
I'm so relieved.

809
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,924
But why are you talking
so casually to your mom?

810
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,177
Because I feel like it.

811
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,680
Right, you were always like that.

812
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,601
Anyway, I'm very grateful to you.

813
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,062
That time…

814
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,481
You were protecting Dad, weren't you?

815
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,777
Well, think however you want.

816
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,820
Thank you so much.

817
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:01,366
Gosh, look at what
a beautiful young lady you've become.

818
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,076
Yes.

819
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,162
But why haven't you changed?

820
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,122
What do you mean?

821
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,916
Your appearance.

822
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,503
Do you think I look strange too?

823
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,046
Yes.

824
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,340
You look different
from everyone else here.

825
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,218
Right, I do.

826
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,261
Are you going to live like that?

827
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:23,888
All alone?

828
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:25,390
Here?

829
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,060
Like that?

830
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,022
Honey.

831
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,024
Honey!

832
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,567
Oh my.

833
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,986
Everyone is looking for you. Let's go.

834
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:40,780
Okay? What…

835
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,491
Did something happen?

836
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:46,369
What's the point of learning all that?

837
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:49,205
What's the point of being good
and following all the rules?

838
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,834
Nothing's going to change anyway.

839
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:54,419
Gosh.

840
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:56,671
This again?

841
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,214
Again?

842
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,135
You've gotten younger,
so you have no regrets.

843
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,220
But do you know how I feel?

844
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,515
I miss my youth too.

845
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:10,643
I didn't know how precious it was
and just wasted it away.

846
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,311
I pity my wasted youth.

847
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,442
I let my youth slip away again,
not knowing it was my last chance.

848
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,819
I wish to be young again.

849
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,281
You should've come a bit younger--

850
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,158
I did it for you!

851
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,828
I'm like this because of you!

852
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:30,997
Me?

853
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,916
Because of me? What did I do?

854
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,671
You told me back then
that I was at my most beautiful.

855
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:43,634
They say a woman will give her life
for the one who loves her.

856
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,679
Hae-sook didn't hesitate
to choose to appear in her eighties

857
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,098
just for Nak-joon.

858
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,016
Did I?

859
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:51,517
Yes.

860
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,604
Really?

861
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,065
Was I perhaps…

862
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:01,194
-Was I half-asleep or something?
-Hey!

863
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,530
No, you're still very beautiful.
I mean it.

864
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,949
You're probably the prettiest senior here.

865
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,328
It's not comforting one bit.

866
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:13,956
Honey.

867
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:16,793
Let's go.

868
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,003
-Okay?
-You always say that.

869
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,297
Forget it.

870
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,051
Why should I follow a man
who can't even keep his word?

871
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,094
Let's go.

872
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:31,349
Let's go and ask them
to make you young again.

873
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:34,644
I'll make it happen.

874
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,730
Trust me, okay?

875
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:44,695
That's not possible.

876
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:47,073
Excuse me?

877
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:48,741
Why not?

878
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,577
Once you've selected an age,
you can't change it forever.

879
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:55,164
We notify you of this
before you make your decision.

880
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,249
Didn't you hear it?

881
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,502
But still,

882
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,129
shouldn't there be some exceptions?

883
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,257
If there were,
why would we give prior notice?

884
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,218
Just a moment.

885
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,596
I work here, you see.

886
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,849
Then you should know better.

887
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:17,019
Out of respect for seniors…

888
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,271
Let's go.

889
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,814
-Let's just go.
-Honey, one minute.

890
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,065
It's okay. Just wait.

891
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:22,692
Come on.

892
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,236
Will this place collapse or something
if you change her age?

893
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,906
-That's enough. Let's go.
-No, it's fine.

894
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,658
Hold on. Just trust me.

895
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:34,161
Do you want me
to take this to court or something?

896
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,496
Do as you please.

897
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,623
Come on!

898
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,333
Can you please just do it?

899
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,420
Ma'am.

900
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:45,590
I understand that
you can't make me younger.

901
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:50,011
But can you make him as old as me?

902
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,888
Honey…

903
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,391
You can't do that, can you?

904
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:56,392
I'm not sure.

905
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,520
I'll need to check the regulations.

906
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:05,192
If making someone younger isn't allowed,
then shouldn't the same rule apply here?

907
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,822
What is it? Do you not want that?

908
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:13,492
No, that's not it. It just seems unfair…

909
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,161
However…

910
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:19,916
while it might be unfair,

911
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,170
I think it could possibly be a solution.

912
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:28,549
Then…

913
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,970
Honey, can we just try
to think of another solution?

914
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:34,931
Forget it then.

915
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:37,850
No.

916
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:39,644
No.

917
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:43,731
In that case,

918
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:46,943
make me look older instead.

919
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,241
Are you crying?

920
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,082
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

921
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:03,334
Should I go and ask
the president for help?

922
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:06,587
Forget it. Let's just live like this.

923
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,214
She said it's not possible.

924
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,382
No, still--

925
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:12,218
I know you were hoping it wouldn't work,
so don't bother.

926
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:16,430
I actually don't mind you looking younger.

927
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:20,685
I married you
because I fell for how you look now.

928
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:27,066
I noticed that there are plenty of couples
where the woman is older.

929
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:31,237
It's like a fresh start. It's not bad.

930
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:35,116
It feels like

931
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,661
I'm only thinking of myself.

932
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,748
Both down there and here.

933
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,291
That's not true.

934
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,003
You were never self-centered.

935
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,171
You suffered your entire life
because of me.

936
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:52,550
Please. I didn't suffer much.

937
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:56,053
I'm sorry.

938
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,057
You did such difficult work

939
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,770
as a woman, just to support me.

940
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,648
I knew everything all along.

941
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:14,905
But I pretended not to.

942
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:17,992
Someone as timid as you

943
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,663
who can't say no to people
did that because of me.

944
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:23,831
You knew?

945
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:26,459
But how?

946
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:27,960
Well…

947
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:31,839
The caregiver who came occasionally
thought I knew everything.

948
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:37,136
She told me
how you got drenched at the market.

949
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,223
It just broke my heart.

950
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:44,518
Geez, how could they do that to a senior?

951
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:48,147
Those vendors were young enough
to be her children,

952
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:51,734
yet they pointed their fingers at her
and threw dirty water on her.

953
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,403
I know.

954
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,281
I feel

955
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:00,910
so sorry for her

956
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,412
that I can't look her in the eye.

957
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,039
So this is what I said.

958
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:08,959
"Both she and I must have
terrible luck with husbands."

959
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:10,628
No, wait.

960
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:14,799
"Our husbands must be utterly blessed
to have us as their wives."

961
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:18,594
That's what I said to myself.

962
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:21,138
You're right about that.

963
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,185
You're all done.

964
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:27,853
Okay.

965
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,147
I'm going to clean up and head out.

966
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,315
Okay.

967
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:33,442
Thank you.

968
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:54,046
I don't even deserve to cry.

969
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:56,340
Who am I to sob my heart out?

970
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,146
All I could ever do was tell you

971
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,983
to take your umbrella every single day.

972
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:23,742
No wonder all your weather forecasts
were wrong.

973
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,542
I prayed every day so I could die quickly
and spare you the suffering.

974
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:34,545
But even that wasn't easy.

975
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,388
We've been through a lot.

976
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:46,473
Both you and I.

977
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:49,310
I'm sorry.

978
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,730
I'm sorry you had to marry me.

979
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:54,315
What do you mean?

980
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:58,819
I married you just for your looks anyway.

981
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,197
Just looking at you fills me up.

982
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:05,367
I feel full even without eating.

983
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:07,912
Really?

984
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,379
This must be Heaven after all.

985
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:20,341
Did you think it wasn't?

986
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:24,303
Let's go.

987
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,972
-To our home.
-Okay.

988
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,999
CELESTIAL MAIDEN
SPECIALIZES IN COMMUNICATING WITH THE DEAD

989
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:55,960
Stop!

990
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:06,470
Is that you, Young-ae?

991
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:08,806
My daughter--

992
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:10,224
Ms. Lee.

993
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:11,308
Is that really you?

994
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,018
You were like a daughter to me.

995
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:13,936
Oh dear.

996
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,063
My poor Young-ae…

997
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:19,650
I…

998
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:22,945
couldn't bear

999
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,365
to leave you behind.

1000
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,909
So I'm still here.

1001
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,119
I just can't leave…

1002
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,164
Are you not in Heaven yet?

1003
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,458
Is that true?

1004
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:40,379
How could I possibly leave you behind?

1005
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:46,635
How could I make
that long journey without you?

1006
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:48,929
Ms. Lee.

1007
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:52,099
Just wait. I'll give you a piggyback ride.

1008
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:53,559
Really?

1009
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,270
Will you really give me a piggyback ride?

1010
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:58,731
Yes, I'll come.

1011
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,733
I'll come see you.

1012
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:02,484
I'll come right away!

1013
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:13,287
Let's eat something nice.

1014
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,832
Look at the sunset. It's beautiful.

1015
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:19,710
-Honey.
-Yes?

1016
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:21,587
-There's something…
-Yes?

1017
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,130
I've prepared for you.

1018
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:24,715
-Again?
-Yes.

1019
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:28,177
Hae-sook was secretly
hoping for more after that hug.

1020
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,678
She's lost her mind.

1021
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:31,680
Okay.

1022
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,808
On the count of three,

1023
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,144
-look over there, okay?
-Okay.

1024
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:39,605
Check what I've prepared for you.

1025
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:42,191
Ta-da!

1026
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,286
Who are you looking for?

1027
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:58,499
Are you Mr. Ko Nak-joon?

1028
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,209
Yes, that's me.

1029
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:01,794
Nak-joon, is that you?

1030
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:03,921
Nak-joon!

1031
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,423
What? Who…

1032
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:09,593
Is this what you prepared for me?

1033
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:11,887
I came all this way thinking only of you.

1034
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:14,515
Excuse me. Hold on.

1035
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:16,141
Snap!

1036
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,101
What was that sound?

1037
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,812
That's the sound
of my last thread of sanity breaking!

1038
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,647
Honey! Wait!

1039
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:24,817
Wait!

1040
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,610
-That hurts! What are you doing?
-Let go!

1041
01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:27,986
-Honey!
-Ko Nak-joon!

1042
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,446
Whose side are you on right now?

1043
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,281
I'm not trying to take anyone's side--

1044
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:33,367
Tell me! Are you on my side or hers?

1045
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:37,454
He wasn't on my side.

1046
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:42,251
You little bastard!

1047
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:46,505
Cut all that bullshit!

1048
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,674
Honey!

1049
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:16,118
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

1050
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:20,497
My mind went completely blank
from the moment I got off the subway.

1051
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:21,748
The only thing I remember…

1052
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:25,752
"Ko Nak-joon." That's all.

1053
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,672
I have a name. Som-i.

1054
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:30,799
Nak-joon gave me that name.

1055
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:32,885
Did you even go out of your way
to give her a name?

1056
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,470
You took her with you.

1057
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,638
What? So you could have
a cozy little date?

1058
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,099
Kick her out.

1059
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:42,019
That woman better not be here

1060
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:44,188
by the time I return
from the Reformation Center.

1061
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,815
Our sister is walking very slowly.

1062
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:48,358
Madam.

1063
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,903
-I've missed you.
-I'm the idiot.

1064
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,614
I'm an idiot
for choosing to live with you again

1065
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:56,158
after all those decades together.

1066
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:59,786
I'm going to find
the life that's right for me…

1067
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:02,873
Live however you want, Ko Nak-joon.

1068
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:08,420
