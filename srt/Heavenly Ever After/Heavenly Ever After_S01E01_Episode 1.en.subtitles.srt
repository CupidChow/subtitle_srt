00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,966
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

2
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,189
Hey, Jang Gi-hwan!

3
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,692
I know you're in there,
so stop pretending and open the door!

4
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,364
Why did you borrow money
if you couldn't pay it back?

5
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,035
Hey. Open it.

6
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,460
Who are you?

7
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,254
Are you Jang Gi-hwan's mom?

8
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,048
Yes, why?

9
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,674
He's inside, isn't he?

10
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,219
He went to the Hangang River.

11
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,888
Your excuses never change.

12
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,390
We already checked the Hangang River.
Move aside.

13
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,396
Why would you lend money
to someone who can't pay it back?

14
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,816
The one who doesn't pay is the asshole,

15
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,109
not the one who lent it.

16
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,154
She sure worked hard raising such garbage.

17
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,369
Do you consider yourselves good sons
by making money this way?

18
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:03,623
Were your folks delighted when you bought
them gifts with the money you made?

19
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:07,127
Fucking hell.

20
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,211
Lady.

21
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,588
What are you trying to do?

22
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,883
You kids have nothing better to do
than intimidate people.

23
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,801
That's right.

24
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,596
Then why don't you pay your son's debt,
Ms. High-and-Mighty?

25
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,974
Yes, it's only right.

26
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:24,561
I have nothing but this body of mine.

27
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,730
So take me and use me however you want.

28
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,650
Seriously. What are you doing?

29
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,569
I said, take me.

30
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,863
You won't find a single penny in here.

31
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,365
Get me out of here. Just take me.

32
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,576
Come on! What the hell are you doing?

33
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,287
-Take me.
-Damn it.

34
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:43,955
What a shitty day.

35
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,082
Lady.

36
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,168
I'll be back.

37
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,503
See you then.

38
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,590
Geez.

39
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,446
HORSE RACING NEWS

40
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,120
Pegasus! You shouldn't have tripped…

41
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,792
What is it? Did I wake you
from your horse-racing dream?

42
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,962
What's wrong?

43
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,425
How much did you borrow from them?

44
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:38,927
Was someone here?

45
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,180
I mean those rough-looking guys.

46
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,058
Well, about 30 million.

47
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,227
Gosh, that's a lot.

48
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,437
When? Before me?

49
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,855
I guess so.

50
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,233
What about my money?

51
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,984
How much was it?

52
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,033
You initially borrowed 600,000 won.

53
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,660
You paid well the first month

54
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,703
then disappeared without a word
last month.

55
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,332
It's 650,000 won now
including the interest.

56
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,875
You see…

57
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,962
I couldn't work
because it's been raining a lot.

58
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,589
Rain didn't stop deliverymen
from delivering parcels and food.

59
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,553
Those muscleheads are still young,
so they can keep coming.

60
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,514
So let's settle
this old lady's debt first.

61
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,099
Come on!

62
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,768
This old hag just won't quit. Damn it.

63
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,899
I'll pay back your lousy 600,000 won,
so just leave.

64
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,193
Right? You're loaded anyway.

65
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,737
My money doesn't mean jack shit to you,
does it?

66
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:41,864
"Jack shit"?

67
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,450
I didn't know you knew how to curse.

68
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,910
That's not all.

69
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,831
I kill people too.

70
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,251
See? I'm wearing rubber gloves.

71
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,172
Kill me if you want.

72
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,174
Go ahead. Do as you please.

73
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,677
You're not reading the room, are you?

74
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,804
What room?

75
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,108
-What's that?
-Which one should I use?

76
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,402
What?

77
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,696
Damn it!

78
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,838
Hold on, sir.

79
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,173
Let me explain…

80
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,257
Ma'am?

81
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,760
No…

82
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,097
Wait. I…

83
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,104
This is all I have.

84
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,939
I'm telling the truth.

85
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,483
Pickle it.

86
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,152
Wait. Pickle what? What?

87
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,612
Why?

88
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,490
I gave you the money.

89
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,667
More salted seafood.

90
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,760
Why are you making kimchi?

91
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,595
And in someone else's house too!

92
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:30,181
I told you our mister's eyes burn
when we do it at our place!

93
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,101
-Should we pack it now?
-Yes.

94
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,282
What a nasty old hag.

95
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,369
There they go again.

96
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,631
Damn it.

97
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,424
Hey, did you just splash water on us?

98
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:06,968
No.

99
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,470
I was just emptying the bucket.

100
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,638
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,280
You think you won't need money
just because you've paid it back?

102
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,616
Some may never borrow money,

103
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,162
but nobody borrows just once.

104
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,792
I'll see you again, valued customer.

105
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,139
You're lacking one day.

106
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,851
Tomorrow, you'll owe me two days' worth.
Remember that.

107
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,936
Daily payments mean daily.

108
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,692
See you tomorrow.

109
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,530
What a nasty old hag.

110
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,865
Do you have a death wish?

111
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,535
Go to a bank
if you want the royal treatment.

112
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,622
You're the one who borrowed money from me
because you couldn't get a loan.

113
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,123
Don't expect special treatment.

114
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,124
Who's asking for that?

115
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,085
Stop by when there aren't customers.
It's embarrassing.

116
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,420
Who's embarrassed?

117
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,214
Me, who everyone talks badly about?

118
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,341
Or you, who borrowed
from someone they badmouth?

119
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,843
Geez. Here.

120
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,639
Take it and go.

121
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,683
Why associate with those
who barely act human?

122
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,143
You better watch your mouth!

123
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,354
Do you want to die?

124
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,400
Should I crack your head open
like this watermelon?

125
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,110
You gave me excess money.

126
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,662
Forget it!

127
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,915
Are you trying to be nice now?
I don't want money for it!

128
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,459
I want a new one.

129
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,546
The way it split so cleanly
shows it's perfectly ripe.

130
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,463
Here.

131
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,192
Come on. Do you really think
this gets rid of bad energy?

132
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,194
Words carry energy.

133
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:35,241
We can't let all those nasty things
we hear and say outside latch onto him.

134
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:38,911
Let me.

135
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,343
I'm home.

136
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,680
I made some fresh kimchi
just the way you like it.

137
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,849
I'll get dinner ready right away.

138
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,698
No.

139
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,231
"Yes, that's the flavor."

140
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,566
-Bowl.
-Right.

141
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,656
It looks delicious.

142
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,034
-You forgot to bring utensils.
-Right.

143
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,454
You're so in love.

144
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,624
You see him every day,
yet you're so eager to see him again.

145
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,708
I'm not eager.

146
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,128
I just pity that poor soul since
I'm the only one who'll take care of him.

147
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,091
Honey, I'm coming in.

148
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,762
You're back.

149
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:26,060
I made some red bean noodle soup
and fresh kimchi, your favorites.

150
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,687
Gosh, it must've been a lot of work.

151
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,608
It took some time
to make the dough from scratch.

152
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,276
You must be hungry. Did you wait long?

153
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,905
I wasn't waiting for the food.
I was waiting for you.

154
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,448
For me? Why?

155
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,616
Isn't it obvious?

156
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,536
Because I missed you.

157
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,620
Goodness.

158
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,580
Let me raise your bed.

159
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,962
I'll raise it now.

160
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,641
I did it the usual way,
but I'm not sure how it turned out.

161
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,689
I knew it.

162
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,275
I wanted to buy freshly salted seafood,
but there was none.

163
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,318
So I used the one at home.

164
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,240
It's so delicious
I almost jumped out of the bed.

165
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,491
Geez!

166
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,870
I can't stand your jokes!

167
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,163
I'm serious.

168
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,999
Should I try to get up then?

169
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,506
It's not working.
Maybe I didn't eat enough.

170
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,341
Is this really that funny to you?

171
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,677
What about your meal?

172
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:46,307
Well, I'll just eat with Young-ae
after you finish.

173
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,308
Goodness.

174
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,268
Here.

175
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,565
Oh my, this is embarrassing.

176
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:59,445
What's embarrassing about a husband
feeding his wife? Here.

177
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,155
That's true but…

178
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,913
No, stop it.

179
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,665
I don't want to.

180
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,921
I don't know! I'm so embarrassed!

181
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,340
This won't work for today.

182
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,845
MORNING, AFTERNOON, NIGHT

183
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,275
I know you're not sleeping.

184
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,907
Why do you always do this?
You've taken these your whole life.

185
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,827
That's exactly why

186
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,373
I want to stop taking them now.

187
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,376
It's not like taking them

188
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:59,338
is suddenly going to make
my legs move again.

189
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,552
I've lived a comfortable life,

190
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,972
thanks to you.

191
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,350
So I should at least cut down
on medication costs now.

192
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,019
I'm not doing this because of your legs.

193
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,773
I don't want the burden
of looking after you alone in my old age.

194
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,984
Don't worry.

195
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,904
I won't give you a hard time.

196
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,448
I won't be sick for long.

197
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,453
I'll go quietly when the time comes.

198
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,247
You better.

199
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,250
Or I'll follow you and nag you forever.

200
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,545
Now, why would you follow me?

201
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,550
You'll finally be free from this burden.

202
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,264
So fully enjoy the spring breeze.

203
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,227
You can take your time in joining me.

204
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,690
What spring breeze?

205
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,781
Sonya.

206
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,326
Your dad is unbelievable.

207
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,162
He talks about dying so casually.

208
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,127
Of course, I know he's just joking.

209
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:25,090
He used to play pranks like that
when he was younger too.

210
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,509
He'd put red pepper paste on his finger

211
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,386
and pretend he'd cut it off.

212
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,059
But then, one day,
he had actually gotten into an accident.

213
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,126
It would've been hard if I'd always
thought I was caring for a sick person.

214
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:06,507
But I just think
he's still trying to mess with me.

215
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,051
And that makes it less difficult.

216
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,940
You don't have to do this.

217
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,693
What? Why not?

218
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,945
I'm also part of the family.

219
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,206
I'll do things like that
while I'm still alive.

220
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,544
-I'll be going now.
-Okay.

221
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,212
Be careful.

222
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,256
It might rain,

223
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,258
so take an umbrella.

224
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:56,640
Geez, I definitely could've blocked it.

225
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,394
Ms. Lee, how do you predict it every time?

226
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,688
It's not a skill to be proud of.

227
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,233
And definitely not one to teach others.

228
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,527
Let's go.

229
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,825
Please teach me anyway.

230
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,410
That way,

231
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:20,414
I can protect you when you grow weak.

232
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,464
What?

233
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,591
That old man passed away.

234
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,760
Stay here.

235
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,803
Why?

236
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,181
You're not dressed for a funeral.

237
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,810
Are you going in there?

238
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,853
I have to.

239
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,147
But he passed away.

240
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,941
He might've died, but his debt remains.

241
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,027
Still…

242
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,947
It's not like he drank
and gambled away his money.

243
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,533
He just needed help
with his hospital bills

244
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,993
since his daughter was struggling.

245
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,078
I feel sorry for him.

246
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,370
Don't you feel sorry for me?

247
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,248
My husband's accident left him paraplegic.

248
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,293
I started giving out loans
using his insurance money

249
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,669
before I was even 30.

250
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,089
I get humiliated at the market every day.

251
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,258
They say I'm heartless and cruel.
Don't you feel sorry for me?

252
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,844
I do. It's the saddest thing.

253
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,283
Your father borrowed money from me.

254
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,202
What?

255
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,247
Are you here to collect money?

256
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,875
If you borrow money,
it's only right to pay it back.

257
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,544
"It's only right"?

258
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,799
Then is it also right to rush over here
and demand money from the dead?

259
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,219
Your father borrowed
a total of 370,000 won from me.

260
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,131
I don't need your money, so take it!

261
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,515
Do you think you'll live forever?

262
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,769
Won't you be ashamed to see him
when you die?

263
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,815
I hope you go straight to Hell
with that money!

264
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,110
I'll pray and pray for you to go to Hell!

265
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,695
Unbelievable!

266
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,323
Go to Hell!

267
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,792
Do you think

268
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,545
Heaven really exists?

269
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,965
Heaven? I'm sure it does.

270
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,220
Don't you think
Heaven would smell sweet like this?

271
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,055
-Right?
-Right.

272
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,015
It must exist, right?

273
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,643
It'd be unfair if it didn't.

274
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:32,105
It'd be very messed up if bad guys
and those who lived righteous lives

275
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,775
ended up in the same place.

276
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:41,531
Then I guess Hell must exist too.

277
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,284
There has to be one.

278
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,289
People who were evil and got away with it
have to end up there.

279
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,292
It's only right to gouge out their eyes
and cut off their tongues.

280
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,214
Why do you ask?

281
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,717
Something happened at the funeral home.
Those bastards…

282
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,095
No, that's not why.

283
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,848
I was just wondering
what happens after we die.

284
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,600
Why?

285
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,019
Are you afraid you'll go to Hell?

286
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,315
No, I'm not afraid.

287
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,153
You see,
my husband lived a righteous life.

288
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,785
Are you worried
you won't see him after you die?

289
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,538
It's not exactly that.

290
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,582
You'll go to Heaven too.

291
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,669
-Me?
-Yes.

292
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,546
Why?

293
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,341
Honestly, I don't know about others.

294
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,885
But you're nice to me.

295
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,015
Geez, I'm destined for Hell.

296
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,895
Instead of having you pay me back,
I'll just take your daughter.

297
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,355
That contract gives me the right.

298
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,024
Hurry up and stamp it.

299
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:39,858
What is this?

300
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,277
Gosh, what is this?

301
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,197
Honey!

302
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,491
Honey, there's a fire!

303
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,553
No!

304
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,013
Honey…

305
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,120
Goodness.

306
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,918
Did you have a nightmare?

307
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,212
No.

308
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,674
It seems like you had a scary dream.

309
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,634
No.

310
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,178
Do you need my hand?

311
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,302
What?

312
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,054
Why are you coming out of that room?

313
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,556
Did you two…

314
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,767
You must be crazy.

315
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,103
Can't a married couple share a room?

316
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,647
Right. You're married.

317
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,109
What's that on your face?

318
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,073
He must've played a prank on you.

319
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,286
Do you want a hand mirror?

320
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,206
It's okay. Look at how happy he is.

321
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,336
-Who's here at this hour?
-I'm not sure.

322
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,253
Who is it?

323
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,591
I'm here to see the lady who lends money.

324
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:16,890
I even thought about
just ending it all with my kids.

325
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,976
But I thought I should persevere.

326
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,520
Young-ae.

327
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,565
Go get the juice bottles
she brought with her.

328
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,318
The box as well.

329
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,111
Okay.

330
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,952
So I want to join the loan business too.

331
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:41,790
I've seen you around the market
many times in the past.

332
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,541
I thought you were amazing.

333
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,552
Wait. Why aren't you drinking that?

334
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,762
Give me the box.

335
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,019
Take this back and focus
on getting your life back together.

336
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,146
But that's exactly why I'm here.

337
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,358
You don't have it all that bad yet
if you can bring gifts like this.

338
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,278
You can only do this job

339
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:15,532
when you don't even have the decency
to bring something like this.

340
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,416
Does that mean I shouldn't do it either?

341
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,168
-Do what?
-This job.

342
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,254
You said this job is only for those

343
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,339
who don't even have
the decency to bring gifts.

344
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,757
Is this a job you want to do?

345
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,969
After witnessing everything with me?

346
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,054
I know it's immoral,
but this is all that I know.

347
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,851
That doesn't mean
you should continue doing it.

348
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,061
You should try to learn something better.

349
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,649
Didn't you say it all started
with you collecting money from someone?

350
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,863
I received a tiny amount
as my husband's compensation.

351
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:59,075
Then someone asked to borrow it
because their son had an accident

352
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,036
and needed surgery.

353
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,165
We were in the same boat.
How could I not lend it? So I did.

354
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,294
But they never paid me back
and made countless excuses.

355
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,005
They called me their savior
when I lent it to them

356
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,258
but swore at me
when I came by to collect their payment.

357
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,594
I should have been there.

358
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,179
Back then, my heart would race

359
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:23,683
even when someone's voice
got a little louder while talking.

360
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:28,104
But now, there's nothing that scares me.

361
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,106
Except for one thing.

362
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,441
Which is?

363
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,068
My husband.

364
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,447
I'm afraid he might die later than me.

365
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,491
That's what scares me.

366
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,368
You have me.

367
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,287
That's what I'm terrified about.

368
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,921
Is the owner here?

369
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,174
Yes, hello.

370
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,675
Do we look like a joke to you?

371
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,593
No!

372
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:00,887
What? No?

373
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,680
What's the name of this flower?

374
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,391
They're trumpet vines.

375
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,892
They're beautiful.

376
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,150
They're very beautiful.

377
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,485
Aren't they?

378
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,405
Their beauty caught my eye.

379
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,409
The back of the flowers

380
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,662
looks just like you from behind.

381
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,705
The back?

382
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:32,001
Are you saying
I look prettier from behind?

383
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,336
No.

384
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,088
We see faces

385
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,258
all the time

386
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,135
when we're talking

387
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,054
or looking.

388
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,224
So we quickly notice the beautiful parts.

389
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,561
But the back of the head is different.

390
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,565
You need to care and have affection

391
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,693
to even notice the back of someone's head.

392
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,613
Then tell me
how the back of my head looks.

393
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,117
It's something
I'll never get to see in my lifetime.

394
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,788
It's saddening.

395
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,754
It's beautiful because it's saddening.

396
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,466
What does that mean?

397
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,011
I see

398
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,055
the 60 years of your life

399
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,976
that you wasted

400
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,353
because of me.

401
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,981
That's why

402
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,400
it's saddening

403
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,611
and beautiful.

404
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,155
You say the strangest things,

405
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,783
calling an old lady like me
pretty and whatnot.

406
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,204
People will think you've lost your mind.

407
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,830
Let them think what they want.

408
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,919
I can say that my wife is pretty
if I want to.

409
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,464
You were pretty at 20.

410
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,926
And you were pretty at 40.

411
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,262
But you…

412
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,976
You're the prettiest now.

413
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,564
Perhaps living together

414
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:20,527
makes my love grow with each passing day.

415
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:28,451
But you're the most gorgeous
you've ever been right now.

416
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,954
Yes.

417
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,040
And you're the most handsome
you've ever been right now.

418
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,632
ACCEPT JESUS AND GO TO HEAVEN!

419
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,804
HWADUNG CHURCH

420
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,523
I don't care where I go.

421
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,694
But please allow my husband
to go to Heaven.

422
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,780
And if possible,

423
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,491
let me go with him.

424
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,953
No, you don't need to send me there.

425
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,211
Oh my.

426
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,766
No, not my husband!

427
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,185
No!

428
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,444
Father! Lord!

429
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,150
Oh my.

430
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,257
We don't even go to church.

431
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,885
Is it okay for us to stick a cross here?

432
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,097
You have to believe to go to Heaven.

433
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,183
Sonya needs to go to Heaven.

434
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,770
Animals go to Heaven too, don't they?

435
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,731
I hope so.

436
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:05,733
Sonya.

437
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:10,947
Thank you for protecting my husband.

438
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,931
Stop right there!

439
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,016
-You bastard!
-Damn it.

440
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,398
Stop right there, you bastard!

441
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,662
Where do you think you're going?

442
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,010
Let us pray.

443
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,180
We pray that

444
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,392
Mr. Jang will pay off all his debt
before going to Heaven.

445
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,227
Amen.

446
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,651
Where are we going?

447
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,613
Father…

448
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,947
Not the face!

449
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,291
Leave it.

450
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,294
The stain won't come out
if you don't wipe it right away.

451
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,923
Your umbrella doesn't have holes, does it?

452
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,426
I guess my time is almost up too.

453
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,181
You could tell
that he was pretty athletic.

454
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,018
The kimchi juice was a curveball.
He didn't throw it straight.

455
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:10,316
Let's buy some chives and clams
and make some pancakes.

456
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,901
CHEOLSEONG MART

457
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,277
Should we go grocery shopping?

458
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,798
What's the matter with you?

459
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:39,262
I had a rough day, so cut it out. Geez.

460
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,513
What's wrong?

461
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,348
Really?

462
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,768
Are you really going to give me
a tough time?

463
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,104
Ms. Lee, what's wrong?

464
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:53,067
I just came home after a long day,
and he's pulling a prank again.

465
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,404
Whatever, I don't care
if you get up or not.

466
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,620
Is he gone?

467
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:48,831
Yes.

468
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,461
That was long.

469
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:56,923
That took…

470
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,009
a long time.

471
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,221
Ms. Lee…

472
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,097
Did you take your medicine?

473
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,183
Yes, I did.

474
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,437
You're not lying to me again, are you?

475
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,066
I'm taking it on time, so don't worry.

476
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,341
Geez, she didn't…

477
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,729
RICE CAKE MILL

478
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,522
Hello.

479
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,107
What can I get for you, ma'am?

480
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,650
Where's the owner?

481
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,736
Are you looking for my mother?

482
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,281
She's at the hospital
for knee replacement surgery.

483
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,743
So she has money
for knee replacement surgery

484
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,745
but none to pay me back.

485
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,959
What are you doing?

486
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,961
Right. You…

487
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,131
Gosh, they're heavy.

488
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,760
My arms hurt.

489
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,015
How about this one?

490
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,558
No, I want one in pink.

491
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,560
-Pink?
-I need a large size.

492
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,403
Hello, ma'am.

493
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,742
RICE CAKE MILL

494
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,581
Does it fit?

495
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,334
Yes, it does.

496
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,128
But it feels a bit awkward
to wear a dress.

497
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,797
You look pretty.

498
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,465
-Really?
-Yes.

499
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,758
Let's go.

500
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,510
Like this?

501
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,677
Yes.

502
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,310
What are you doing?

503
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,687
This dress is uncomfortable.

504
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,440
Try to walk more modestly.

505
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,532
I'm going to stop by another shop.
Go inside and take your time.

506
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,784
In there? Why?

507
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,537
What?

508
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,251
Am I supposed to go in there?

509
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,585
What? Do you not want to?

510
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,797
No, it's not like that but…

511
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,015
Damn it! What the hell?

512
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,017
Pay back my money!

513
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,811
Damn it! Come on!

514
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,730
Why aren't you paying me back?

515
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,482
Give me my money!

516
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,533
Give it to me! Pay up!

517
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,244
-Pay me back!
-What are you doing?

518
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,996
-Let me go!
-Just go.

519
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,080
What are you looking at?

520
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,917
What's wrong?

521
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,711
What are you doing all of a sudden?

522
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,672
What do you think?
I'm doing what I always do.

523
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,716
But I didn't ask you to do that.

524
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,260
Why did you lie to me?

525
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,511
About what?

526
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:16,015
He said you promised
to forget about the debt they owed

527
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:20,186
and offered to help their mill
with the money you've saved up!

528
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,354
That's because I thought--

529
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,064
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

530
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,651
You suddenly made me wear this dress
and introduced him to me!

531
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,154
That's because I thought you liked him.

532
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,989
That's not what this is about!

533
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:38,037
You're planning to leave me behind
before you go off on your own!

534
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,540
Everyone dies when they get old.

535
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,042
Who doesn't know that?

536
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,544
I'm so hurt and upset.

537
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,339
I know you'll die one day,

538
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,717
but you shouldn't try so hard to leave.

539
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,179
I'm tired of taking care of people now.

540
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,348
I want to stop.

541
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,309
I'm all grown up now.

542
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,520
You don't need to take care of me.

543
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,605
I'll take care of you from now on,

544
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,273
so don't worry.

545
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,441
You don't need to.

546
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,216
Then at least teach me

547
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,094
how to use an umbrella.

548
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:42,977
Water ahead.

549
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,564
To the left…

550
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,107
Kimchi juice.

551
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,568
To the right…

552
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,652
Croaker.

553
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,572
Behind you…

554
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:55,698
Mackerel.

555
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,452
That's not right for mackerel.

556
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,745
Is it different?

557
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,122
Of course, it is.

558
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:06,125
Mackerel is a blue-backed fish,
so it has good elasticity.

559
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,085
So, when it hits the umbrella,

560
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,545
it bounces off like this.

561
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,839
Since croaker is a white fish,

562
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,550
it bounces off the umbrella like this.

563
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,136
I see.
One is fresh while the other is frozen.

564
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,513
You're starting to get it now.

565
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,651
You've mastered it now.

566
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,403
THE LATE LEE HAE-SOOK
CHIEF MOURNER: LEE YOUNG-AE

567
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:22,284
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE

568
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,669
Were you a client of Ms. Lee's?

569
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,546
Yes, we knew each other for a long time.

570
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,717
I know all of her friends,

571
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,427
but I've never met you before.

572
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:42,805
You wouldn't know me.

573
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,890
I knew her
before you even met her, Ms. Lee.

574
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,434
Oh, you know my name.

575
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,436
Well…

576
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,315
Of course.

577
00:44:55,442 --> 00:45:01,115
THE LATE LEE HAE-SOOK

578
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:10,749
Lee Hae-sook.

579
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,752
Lee Hae-sook.

580
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,713
Lee Hae-sook.

581
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:26,807
Am I…

582
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,183
Am I dead?

583
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,810
Goodness. What's happening?

584
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:30,811
Oh my…

585
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,229
What's happening to me?

586
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,398
It's because there's no gravity.

587
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,358
Every soul that dies
asks the same question.

588
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,734
Do you understand now?

589
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:38,819
Yes…

590
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,239
There. That should do the trick.

591
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,914
Does your body get this light
when you die?

592
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,083
Gosh, I'm asking questions again.

593
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,878
It'd be nice if you'd think before asking.

594
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,463
Anyway, you need to leave this world.

595
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,506
It would be hard
if your body was heavy, right?

596
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,925
Wait. All my pain is gone too.

597
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,803
I was just thinking out loud.

598
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,930
You're a bit clever, aren't you?

599
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,098
Well…

600
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:09,850
When you die,

601
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,144
you can't take anything with you.

602
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,854
Not even your illnesses.

603
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,314
That's a relief.

604
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,649
My husband must've gone without pain then.

605
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,359
You don't know him, do you?

606
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,696
My husband passed away last year.

607
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,490
Mr. Ko Nak-joon.

608
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:26,909
How did you know?

609
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,079
I escorted him as well.

610
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:36,877
Let's go.

611
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:39,922
Sir!

612
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,174
Do you know what'll happen
if you cut this?

613
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,801
You'll neither go to the afterlife
nor meet your wife again.

614
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:45,719
Is that okay?

615
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,892
Will you be the one

616
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,979
who'll escort her when she dies?

617
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,941
Probably, since this is my turf.

618
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,734
In that case,

619
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,362
could you tell her

620
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,407
that I walked to the afterlife…

621
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,245
on my own

622
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,664
when you see her?

623
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,209
Are we done with questions now? Let's go.

624
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,294
-Hold on.
-What now? What?

625
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,588
What is it?

626
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,006
Where am I going?

627
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,677
You're dead,
so I'm guessing either Heaven or Hell.

628
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,430
But why are you upset?

629
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,976
Because you keep
asking questions so painfully.

630
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,896
Everyone dies for the first time.
No one is experienced.

631
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,732
I'm only asking
since I have no experience.

632
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,195
You're right.

633
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,738
-That was my mistake.
-Right.

634
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,448
Yes, you're right.

635
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,491
All right then.

636
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,661
Taxi, bus, bicycle, airplane, subway.

637
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,579
Pick one.

638
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,330
This must be like a personality test.

639
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,458
Like "what would you bring
to a deserted island?"

640
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,460
No. What transportation
do you want to take?

641
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,088
Are you going to walk to Heaven?
Will you fly to Hell?

642
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,881
I see.

643
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,425
Is it a premium taxi?

644
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,845
I could never afford anything expensive.

645
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,222
Give me your hand.
I'll untie that so you can fly away.

646
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,682
No, that's okay.

647
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,978
The others make me nauseous,
so I'll take the subway.

648
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,647
Subway it is.

649
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,693
-You can't change it now.
-Okay.

650
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,236
AFTERLIFE SUBWAY

651
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,656
THE SUBWAY TO THE AFTERLIFE
IS OPERATING NORMALLY

652
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,657
All right.

653
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,909
It'll be here in three minutes.

654
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,875
THE LATE LEE HAE-SOOK

655
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,628
Are you the Grim Reaper?

656
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,465
They used to call us that,
but not anymore.

657
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,427
Those were the good old days.

658
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,640
Everything's automated now,
so they don't need Grim Reapers anymore.

659
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:58,143
We just make sure the dead
don't float away due to zero gravity.

660
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,561
When I was little,

661
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,856
I thought the Grim Reaper harvested crops.

662
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:06,276
You know, since they're called "reapers."

663
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,241
Do Heaven and Hell really exist?

664
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:17,162
Yes, they do. They absolutely do.
I already told you so.

665
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,668
My husband probably went to Heaven, right?

666
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,002
I don't know.

667
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,755
Am I going to Hell?

668
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,095
I'm just anxious.

669
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,767
The judgment process is automated now too.

670
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,561
You'll know
whether you're headed to Heaven or Hell.

671
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,021
Your body will react.

672
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,274
If your body suddenly moves
at Hell Station, you're going to Hell.

673
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,484
If not, you'll go to Heaven.

674
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,362
There it comes.

675
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,137
Thank you for everything.

676
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:19,182
Is there a rating system?

677
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,226
No, there isn't.

678
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,644
What a shame.

679
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:57,345
-Our Father in Heaven…
-Father.

680
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,098
-…hallowed be your name.
-Father.

681
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,600
Your kingdom come.

682
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,686
Your will be done,
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

683
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:07,898
-Father…
-Give us this day our daily bread.

684
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:12,235
Forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.

685
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,695
-Father…
-Lead us not…

686
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:36,092
Attention, please.

687
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,803
This train is bound for the afterlife.

688
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,973
We are currently passing Sacheon Mountain
and crossing the Samdo River.

689
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:56,321
All passengers should remain calm
and wait for further instructions.

690
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,322
Thank you.

691
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:08,333
In a moment,
our train will arrive at Hell Station.

692
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,503
Please remain seated, everyone.

693
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,213
Will it be all right to sit?

694
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,966
-Let's sit for now.
-We can't get off.

695
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,802
-I can't go to Hell.
-Please…

696
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,346
Please, no…

697
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,014
I should've gotten off the train.

698
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,535
Our train has now arrived at Hell Station.

699
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,023
What?

700
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,816
What's wrong? Why am I moving?

701
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,407
I volunteered my entire life!

702
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,700
Why is this happening to me?

703
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,994
No!

704
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,541
-Hey!
-Help me!

705
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,542
Don't let go!

706
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:37,672
Ma'am!

707
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:38,798
Please grab onto me!

708
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,051
Please hold onto me!

709
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,095
I regret disappointing my parents.

710
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,555
Help me!

711
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,102
Lord…

712
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,188
Am I…

713
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,357
Am I going to Heaven?

714
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,192
Am I allowed to?

715
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,403
After all I've done?

716
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,460
Our train will soon arrive
at Heaven Station.

717
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,588
All remaining passengers,
please prepare to disembark.

718
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,260
You can't take anything with you
from here on.

719
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,386
Leave everything behind.

720
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,597
Leave what behind?

721
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,312
PREMIUM MATH FOR 10TH GRADE

722
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,743
I can't leave this.

723
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,828
If you don't, you can't enter.

724
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,665
My dog and I spent 20 years together.

725
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,626
I can finally see him now.

726
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,295
I need to meet him now, but without this…

727
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,130
You can leave it here.

728
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,091
You'll be able to meet him soon.

729
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:28,176
You can't take that with you.

730
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,430
I had no money, so I had to send
my children to an orphanage.

731
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,184
I worked like a dog and saved every penny

732
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,729
so I could get my children back.

733
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,274
But…

734
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,654
I died before I could even
give this money to them.

735
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,283
I'll leave this here.

736
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:53,868
So please…

737
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:55,829
Please…

738
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,165
Please give this to my children.

739
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,583
Okay?

740
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,128
I beg you…

741
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,381
Please don't let them

742
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,134
follow my footsteps

743
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,888
because of having no money.

744
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:24,816
This way.

745
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,947
You can put down the oxygen mask.

746
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:34,993
Please put it down.

747
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,453
No.

748
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,498
This isn't for me!

749
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,834
It's for that girl! That girl!

750
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,342
I'm at the emergency stairwell
on the sixth floor.

751
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,344
The door to the rooftop is sealed.

752
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,431
I can't see anything due to the smoke.

753
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:59,350
I'm currently with a child.

754
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,435
I have

755
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,520
five minutes of oxygen left.

756
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,147
Captain!

757
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,900
We're clearing a path to you now,
so hang in there!

758
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:10,195
Let's wrap this up quickly
and have some soju and pork belly.

759
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,031
Sounds good.

760
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:16,993
The other firefighters

761
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,287
are on their way.

762
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:22,040
Hang in there a little longer, okay?

763
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,416
I promise

764
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,044
I'll save you.

765
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,187
Please tell me

766
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:45,772
if the girl survived.

767
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,273
That's all I ask.

768
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,325
Hey. You're…

769
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,295
I'm sorry

770
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,382
I couldn't save you.

771
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,425
I'm sorry…

772
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,804
Why are you sorry?

773
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,682
It's my fault

774
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:23,351
that you're here.

775
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:29,148
They said I have to go alone
without Mom or Dad from here on.

776
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,652
I can't even sleep alone yet.

777
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,407
Can you come with me?

778
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:42,287
Protect me like you did before.

779
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,307
Do I have anything on me?

780
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,808
Please come forward.

781
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:10,940
Oh my.

782
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,276
I… What was that?

783
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,111
You may enter.

784
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,454
What?

785
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,164
Why don't I have anything?

786
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,292
Did I throw it away?

787
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,085
Did I forget to bring it?

788
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,421
Please go ahead.

789
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:40,470
Ma'am, please head over there.
You'll have your individual consultation.

790
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:43,973
Just answer a few questions,
and everything will be over.

791
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,664
Hello.

792
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,416
Ms. Lee Hae-sook born in 1945, correct?

793
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:11,876
Yes.

794
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:15,088
Okay. I need your signature of consent
on the part highlighted in yellow.

795
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,423
Flip through the pages.
There's quite a lot.

796
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,675
Please sign it.

797
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,771
Now, you'll make some decisions

798
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,524
regarding some matters
related to living in Heaven.

799
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:38,319
I'll ask you two questions,
and you just need to answer them.

800
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,238
Did you sign it?

801
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,824
All right then.

802
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,534
Here's the first question.

803
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,579
Welcome. You have arrived in Heaven.

804
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:51,332
Who would you like to live with?

805
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,628
You can't change your mind
once you make your decision.

806
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:58,881
And you can't live with them
if they're not in Heaven.

807
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:03,553
And of course, you can only live with them
if they agree as well.

808
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,263
Excuse me.

809
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,182
Where is Mr. Ko Nak-joon?

810
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,809
Mr. Ko Nak-joon?

811
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,102
One minute.

812
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:14,564
Mr. Ko Nak-joon, born in 1940,
is in Heaven.

813
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,190
Thank goodness.

814
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,275
Then--

815
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:19,777
And Mr. Ko…

816
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,824
He chose you as well,
so you can live together.

817
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,369
Okay. Here's the second question.

818
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,539
You have arrived in Heaven.

819
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:34,125
What age would you like to appear as
during your time here?

820
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:38,212
Once again, you can't change your mind
once you make your decision.

821
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:43,342
I looked my best at 20 and 25.

822
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:48,181
Should I pick 25
since that's when I met my husband?

823
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,183
Perhaps living together

824
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:53,978
makes my love grow with each passing day.

825
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:59,400
But you're the most gorgeous
you've ever been right now.

826
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:02,862
I pick 80.

827
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:04,947
Okay, 80.

828
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,325
Eighty… Eighty?

829
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,327
Yes.

830
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:10,828
Are you sure?

831
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,580
Yes.

832
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,290
Are you really sure about this?

833
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:15,958
Absolutely.

834
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,380
It's been a while since I've had
a case like this. One minute.

835
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:23,758
Let's see…

836
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,305
Here you go.

837
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:32,099
What's this?

838
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,520
It's a narration button we give
to those who are 80 or older.

839
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:38,231
Press it,
and you won't need to struggle to speak

840
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,482
since it'll speak for you.

841
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,442
You know, it's that voice in your head.

842
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,111
The one that chatters nonstop
inside your mind.

843
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:47,573
It's meaningless, unhelpful,
and only caused problems in your life.

844
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,574
Right.

845
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,619
You could be a bit annoyed at first

846
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:54,080
since it sounds different
than when you heard it inside.

847
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,164
But…

848
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,958
Why do I need this?

849
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,001
Well…

850
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,545
You'll probably be short of breath.

851
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,338
You'll need it for a while.

852
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:04,173
The button will naturally disappear

853
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,884
once the voice in your head
no longer bothers you.

854
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,015
Hae-sook's heart was already racing.

855
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,141
Hae-sook's heart--

856
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,977
Hae-sook--

857
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,771
Hae-sook--

858
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,356
Here you go.

859
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,821
Hae-sook's heart was already racing.

860
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:29,949
What would she do first
when she meets her husband?

861
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,450
She'll hold his hand

862
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,911
and gaze at the face
that she missed so much.

863
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,289
-Then she'll passionately kiss him--
-This is nuts.

864
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,915
Stop.

865
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,419
I won't keep you for long.

866
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:43,087
How would you like to travel?

867
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,338
So there's the fast option,

868
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,799
the faster option,
and the superfast option.

869
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:51,137
Hae-sook wanted to ask
for the superfast option

870
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,972
to see her husband.

871
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,433
But she was embarrassed.

872
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,268
She's crazy. Goodness.

873
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,104
Isn't it convenient
having it speak for you?

874
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:02,064
She's just making things up.

875
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:05,401
Hae-sook wanted to pretend
like it wasn't true.

876
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,737
You must miss him a lot.

877
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:12,074
The fast option is for traditional methods
such as ship, airplane, train, and so on.

878
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:15,244
But since Heaven is so vast,
it'll take several days.

879
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,663
It could even take over a month.

880
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,207
Then what about the superfast option?

881
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:24,837
It's very humane
while being the fastest method.

882
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,839
Then I want that one.

883
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:30,092
But there are some risks involved.
Would that be okay?

884
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:31,761
Risks?

885
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:33,304
Yes, well…

886
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:37,099
You might get misdelivered
or have to live with a complete stranger.

887
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,728
I don't care. I'll do it.

888
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,898
Understood.

889
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:45,608
Please wait a moment.

890
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:23,938
WELCOME TO HEAVEN, EVERYONE!

891
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,962
Wait, why did she choose that age?

892
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,881
Ms. Lee Hae-sook! Wake up!

893
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:56,220
Oh my.

894
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:02,059
Ms. Lee.

895
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:04,353
You've arrived safely.

896
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:08,149
You met a talented magician.
It's rare to get here in one go.

897
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:09,984
All right.

898
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,486
This is the Heaven User Manual.

899
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,156
Enjoy your reunion
with your husband today,

900
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,491
and please visit
the community center tomorrow.

901
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,243
Have a nice day then.

902
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:22,413
-Wait.
-Yes?

903
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:24,331
I don't know where he lives.

904
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:25,249
Right.

905
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:29,545
Walk around a bit first.

906
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:32,631
Once your heart starts racing

907
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,383
and you feel excited,

908
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:36,927
continue walking in that direction
to find him.

909
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,055
Simple, isn't it?

910
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:43,684
Where my heart starts racing?

911
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:55,112
Goodness.

912
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,869
Oh my, it must be that way.

913
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:03,579
Goodness.

914
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:07,416
Her heart races like when she was 20,

915
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,086
but her knees are painfully frail.

916
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:15,800
Just hang in there for today.

917
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,385
I beg you.

918
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:47,081
You know that stone wall you talked about?

919
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:51,127
I'll neatly build one along the path.

920
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:54,338
And to make you feel welcome,

921
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:58,050
let's plant some trumpet vines

922
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,970
that you said were pretty, okay?

923
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,472
Like a traditional Korean house

924
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,307
yet also like a Western one,

925
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,269
let's put two houses together.

926
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,316
Let's also have a small garden

927
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,610
where you can grow
lettuce and perilla leaves

928
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:19,947
without exhausting yourself.

929
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,950
"This is the exact house
my husband described."

930
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:27,079
"He's waiting for me in there."

931
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:33,210
But suddenly,
anxiety sprouts in Hae-sook's heart.

932
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,672
"Could he really be waiting for me?"

933
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:39,758
"What if he's forgotten about me?"

934
01:09:40,384 --> 01:09:43,554
"What if he left me behind
at Heaven's checkpoint

935
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:46,140
where everyone leaves everything behind?"

936
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:53,147
KO NAK-JOON
LEE HAE-SOOK

937
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,273
"Of course."

938
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,025
"He'd never do that."

939
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,944
"He'd never forget me."

940
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,456
Who is it?

941
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:12,041
"It's him!"

942
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,085
"I could never forget his voice."

943
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:16,712
"But…"

944
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:23,260
One minute.

945
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:51,247
Honey…

946
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:52,665
Sorry?

947
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:56,877
Hae-sook… What?

948
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:58,879
I'm screwed.

949
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:04,093
Right. What?

950
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:42,214
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

951
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,216
So why is it only me?

952
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,468
This is no Heaven!

953
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:50,222
Everyone else has turned a new page
while you're all shriveled up…

954
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,099
We're too old to be acting like newlyweds.

955
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:55,728
He wanted to start over
young again with me.

956
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,856
-Honey. I want to show you something.
-What is it?

957
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:00,482
-Choco!
-Come here!

958
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:03,193
-Hong!
-Bbomi!

959
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:06,155
Heaven isn't a reward.

960
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:10,784
It means if you mess up here,
you can still end up in Hell.

961
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:13,245
They say sometimes
people come here by mistake, right?

962
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,914
If I'm in the wrong place,
then is someone coming to get me?

963
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:18,542
-What's that?
-What?

964
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:20,753
I'm so anxious for no reason.

965
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,838
Who are you looking for?

966
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:24,256
Nak-joon, is that you?

967
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,549
Nak-joon!

968
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:27,259
Excuse me. Hold on.

969
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:31,055
I'd rather be in Hell
than be like this, you jerk!

970
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:37,269
