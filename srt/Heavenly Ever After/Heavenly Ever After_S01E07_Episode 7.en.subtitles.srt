1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,966
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

2
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,686
Som-i.

3
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:03,980
Som-i!

4
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,276
I have to rush off somewhere,
so please wait here!

5
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,493
Excuse me.

6
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,702
Ma'am.

7
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,705
Didn't a senior come in here
a few days ago?

8
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,707
I was told you'd know him as Mr. Hwang.

9
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,126
-Oh, Mr. Hwang?
-Yes.

10
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,213
His condition suddenly worsened,
so he was transferred to a large hospital.

11
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,632
I heard he passed away there.

12
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,549
What?

13
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,058
The train to the afterlife
is now arriving.

14
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,484
What were you staring at earlier?

15
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,070
You looked completely lost.

16
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,573
I just saw someone,

17
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,992
and I suddenly felt rage.

18
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,744
Rage?

19
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,329
Why?

20
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,374
I don't know.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,837
But the scenery I saw in my dream

22
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,089
was on his clothes.

23
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,552
Whatever it is,

24
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,222
it's likely someone
related to your memory.

25
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,644
Next time, let's look for him together.

26
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:27,981
Thank you.

27
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,734
How did things go for you?

28
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,116
I thought I was onto something.

29
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,911
But I'm back to square one.

30
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,804
The Rainbow Bridge has been set up
for the companion animals.

31
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,433
Attention, all Heaven guide dogs.

32
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,519
Please go to the waiting room
to escort the companion animals.

33
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:12,233
HEAVEN GUIDE DOG

34
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,126
Hey, you shouldn't mark there!
Don't do it.

35
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,629
Jjajang, what's wrong with him?

36
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,756
Oh, he was tied up his whole life.

37
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,092
His entire world
was just the length of his leash.

38
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,764
Geez, that one must've been really loved.

39
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,307
How can you tell?

40
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,142
She has no tear stains.

41
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,519
You can tell she was fed premium food.

42
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,565
Just look at her coat.
It's so silky and shiny.

43
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,028
I don't see a single knot.
She's clearly well-groomed.

44
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,947
Oh, boy.

45
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,490
Look at them in the corner.

46
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,408
Do you see how dull their coats are?

47
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,119
They're on high alert.

48
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,039
They have a strong protective instinct.

49
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:12,460
It's a classic symptom in abandoned dogs.
Poor them.

50
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,461
-Jjajang.
-Yes?

51
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,545
What about that one?

52
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:20,677
I see. She lived with just her owner
who was extremely busy.

53
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,763
Dogs like her
usually have separation anxiety.

54
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,642
They spend all day just waiting
for their owners to come home.

55
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,143
What a shame.

56
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,357
We will now move to the treatment center.

57
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,401
Come slowly.

58
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,361
All right.

59
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,196
This is where we treat

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,366
the bad habits we developed
during our time on Earth.

61
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,369
You'll all be getting treatment soon,
so pay close attention.

62
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,413
Deokgu, how was your day?

63
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,125
I didn't think about it at all today.

64
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,713
I think I'm finally cured.

65
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,715
Let me see if that's true.

66
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,391
Deokgu, we're extending
your shoe syndrome treatment!

67
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,688
Gaeddong, how was your day?

68
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,689
That's me!

69
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,568
I was tempted on my way here.

70
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:23,114
I thought I was over it, but seeing it
right in front of me was hard to resist.

71
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,616
But I couldn't give in.

72
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,578
I remembered my owner's look of disgust.

73
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,622
I told myself, "I shouldn't do this,"
and resisted.

74
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,501
I don't want to be a poop-eater anymore!

75
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,794
Well done.

76
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,298
Bravo! Applaud!

77
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,803
Now, it's time for group therapy.

78
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:46,804
Let's begin.

79
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,480
Delivery!

80
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,741
Darn it, those dogs are yapping so much.

81
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,742
Let's move along!

82
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,118
Watch your ears.

83
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,787
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

84
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,580
PSYCHOTHERAPY CENTER

85
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,291
This is the Psychotherapy Center
for abandoned dogs.

86
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,418
This is where you'll overcome your traumas

87
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,921
related to defensiveness,
depression, and more.

88
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,672
Hey, explain it simply.

89
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,675
Everyone, do you see
those tools over there?

90
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,135
-Yes.
-We're going to help you

91
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,763
not be afraid of them anymore.

92
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,098
-Okay?
-Okay.

93
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,726
You guys need to pay extra attention
to this class, all right?

94
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,896
Okay. Why should we write
compliment journals?

95
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,859
Life as an abandoned dog
can damage your self-esteem.

96
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,070
And that leads to depression.

97
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,406
Writing compliment journals helps rebuild

98
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,784
your self-esteem.

99
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,245
Any kind of praise works just fine.

100
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,372
Would you like to read yours?

101
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,675
"I praise myself

102
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,428
for no longer being frightened
by small noises."

103
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,100
"I praise myself
for not worrying about getting hurt

104
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,271
whenever I see a stone."

105
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,946
"I praise myself for not being afraid
of drunk people kicking me

106
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,865
for no reason at all."

107
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,207
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,418
That was excellent.

109
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,211
Applaud.

110
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,264
"I praise myself for not hating

111
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,350
the animal shelter staff

112
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,395
who captured me."

113
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,192
"I praise myself for not resenting

114
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,695
all the humans who didn't adopt me."

115
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:14,202
"I praise myself
for empathizing with the vet

116
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,662
who put me down."

117
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,541
"And finally…

118
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,838
I praise myself

119
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,508
for forgiving

120
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:34,305
my owner who abandoned me."

121
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,775
Well done.

122
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,277
But honestly, that's just talk.

123
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,239
You can't actually forgive them.
Aren't I right?

124
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,408
Why would you forgive them?

125
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,411
If that were true,
I wouldn't have gone to Hell.

126
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,812
Did you lose something?

127
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,690
No, I didn't.

128
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,608
I just feel anxious for some reason.

129
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,860
My heart's racing.

130
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,612
Could it be arrhythmia?

131
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,240
They get rid of all that stuff
when you come here.

132
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,993
Then what's the matter?

133
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,328
I don't know. You know those days.

134
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,998
You feel like
something terrible is about to happen.

135
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,417
You feel anxious.

136
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,503
As if a debtor is going to skip town
in the middle of the night?

137
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,965
Well, that would be pretty serious.
But this feels like an even bigger…

138
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,849
Could you be the bigger problem?

139
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,310
I'm trying to live differently here.

140
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,478
Do I look weird?

141
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,315
Not at all.
You can do whatever you want here.

142
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,232
You look pretty.

143
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,569
-Don't wait up for me tonight.
-Why not?

144
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:15,031
I might not come home tonight
if things go well.

145
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,565
What? Why is she getting closer?

146
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,362
What is it?

147
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,739
Sorry? What is what?

148
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,867
You made eye contact with me.
That's why I came over.

149
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,036
Could you see my eyes
from all the way there?

150
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,913
Of course. They're quite intense.

151
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,707
Am I right?
Did you make eye contact with me?

152
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,877
Look, that sounds a bit suggestive.

153
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,215
I think there's been a misunderstanding.
If there's nothing else, I'll be going--

154
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,842
Look.

155
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,011
There is actually something.

156
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:23,474
Since coming here,
I've had so many questions.

157
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,518
I'm even tossing and turning in bed.

158
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:31,399
It's normal to have many questions
when you first arrive here.

159
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,943
What are you so curious about?

160
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,071
-Are you single?
-Sorry?

161
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,114
Or are you divorced?

162
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,283
If you have any questions,
please visit the Service Center.

163
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,287
Gosh, he's adorable!

164
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,791
But that Service Center is in the way.

165
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,460
Without it, I could talk to him directly.

166
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,130
Darn it. Should I get rid of it?

167
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,593
Darn it!

168
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,637
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER
HOBBY CLASSES

169
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,808
MEET THESE INSTRUCTORS!

170
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,854
PRESIDENT OF HEAVEN
EVERYTHING ABOUT HEAVEN

171
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,860
NAME: KIM HA-NA
REGISTERED CLASS: EVERYTHING ABOUT HEAVEN

172
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,451
What's wrong?

173
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,661
Why this class of all classes?

174
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,080
Well, I'm curious.

175
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,167
And the president is handsome.

176
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,753
You're not very quick, are you?

177
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,297
Sorry?

178
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,716
If you have a slow brain, take math!

179
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,677
Take the beginner's math class.

180
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,721
But still…

181
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,684
Beginner's math class it is.

182
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,729
-I'm glad you understand.
-Right.

183
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,569
-I should take the acupressure class.
-Sounds good.

184
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,362
I'll take the fun science class.

185
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,156
-Yes, science is necessary.
-Right.

186
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,575
-Heaven class is a no.
-No.

187
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,785
SEPARATION ANXIETY TREATMENT CENTER

188
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,829
Now, don't be too nervous.

189
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,914
Let's go.

190
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't be anxious.

191
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,169
This way, please.

192
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,926
Separation anxiety doesn't
just disappear overnight.

193
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,929
It's a gradual process.

194
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:30,017
Here, you'll learn that
there are many other fun things

195
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,519
than waiting for your owner.

196
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,939
-Minky!
-Hey…

197
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:35,981
Hey!

198
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,733
Hey! Darn it!

199
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,322
Minky, what are you doing?
Go back to your spot right now.

200
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,616
No, I'm going to wait for my mom.

201
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,951
Minky.

202
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,786
Your owner isn't here.

203
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,038
And there are
lots of fun things to do here.

204
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,249
There's nothing fun here.

205
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,336
When my mom goes to work,
she leaves the TV on so I won't get bored.

206
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,672
She also puts out lots of toys

207
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,424
and even hides treats
for me to find and eat.

208
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,218
But none of that is fun.

209
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,845
TV is only fun when I watch with her.

210
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,598
Toys are only fun when I play with her.

211
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,227
And treats only taste good
when she gives them to me.

212
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,479
That's why I wait all day long.

213
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,566
For my mom.

214
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,112
For my owner.

215
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,293
Jjampong, where is Minky?

216
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,337
She's at the Separation Anxiety
Treatment Center.

217
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,048
She needed treatment anyway.
It's all for the best.

218
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,467
One moment, please.

219
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,760
Attention.

220
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,680
Once we've completed our treatment,

221
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,017
we'll all get to live here.

222
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,977
Will we be living here forever?

223
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,938
No, not forever.

224
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,357
We'll meet our owners again

225
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,693
and spend happy times here together.

226
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,405
Then when the time comes,
there's a place we'll go to.

227
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,241
This way, please.

228
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,784
Take your time and follow me.

229
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,874
This is the Gate of Rebirth.

230
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,544
You all love doggie doors, don't you?

231
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,130
Pass through that door,
and you'll be reincarnated.

232
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,883
Will we get reincarnated as humans?

233
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,762
No, you'll reincarnate as animals first.

234
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,472
It's like building up mileage points.

235
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,599
You'll eventually reincarnate as a human.

236
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,726
Can we reincarnate whenever we want?

237
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,396
No, that's not how it works.
You need to be qualified.

238
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,484
When it's time for reincarnation,
your body begins to glow.

239
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,611
Then you'll know that you're qualified.

240
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,238
What? Mandu!

241
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,742
-What?
-What? You…

242
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,333
Why do we need to be reincarnated anyway?

243
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,168
That's a good question.

244
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,171
Why do we need to be reincarnated?

245
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,341
It's a bit difficult to explain.

246
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,469
-You don't know, do you?
-Of course, I do!

247
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,679
Sir…

248
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,056
Right.

249
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,976
Gosh, that was close.

250
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,855
Once you're spiritually mature

251
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,442
through reincarnation,

252
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,111
you'll feel the joy of loving

253
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:32,408
without any specific reason or person.

254
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,912
Why have I become so irritable lately?

255
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,500
Am I right?
Did you make eye contact with me?

256
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,751
Damn it.

257
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,256
Can't I just not reincarnate
and live with them instead?

258
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,720
Heaven isn't a place to live forever.

259
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,304
It's just a temporary stay.

260
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:58,225
This is merely a step
toward what comes next.

261
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,145
Here.

262
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,397
This is the reincarnation list.

263
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,859
You can choose where to be reincarnated.

264
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,659
I'm back, Ms. Lee…

265
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,121
It's not Young-ae or Nak-joon.

266
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,581
And it's not her either.

267
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,834
What is this anxiety I'm feeling?

268
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,052
Your pulse is strong.

269
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,679
No fever.

270
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,932
There's no high blood pressure
or diabetes here, so it's not that.

271
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,559
So why are you so anxious?

272
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,687
Could it be that

273
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:48,400
you're worried about
your handsome husband going out and about?

274
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,486
No, that's not it.

275
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,697
Don't you worry.

276
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,618
When I go out, I'll stick
a huge label on my forehead that screams,

277
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,203
"I'm Hae-sook's!" Hold on.

278
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,371
Do we have any large stickers?

279
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,462
FINAL DEBATE

280
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:12,341
Hello, welcome to our Final Debate,
"Is Heaven Fine As It Is?"

281
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,717
I'm Won Gwang-dong, your host.

282
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,511
Today's debate topic is

283
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,555
"Is marriage in Heaven
a benefit or a burden?"

284
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,848
Let's begin.

285
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,850
We've invited

286
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,394
Ms. Lee Eun-suk,
representing the Anti-Marriage Coalition.

287
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,606
Hello, I'm Lee Eun-suk
from the Anti-Marriage Coalition.

288
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,442
We also have the president
of Heaven's Couples Association,

289
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,568
Lee Han-seok.

290
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,404
Hello, I'm Lee Han-seok.

291
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,492
The hottest issue
in Heaven these days is divorce.

292
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:43,038
After thousands of years without divorces,
we've already had two cases this year.

293
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,834
And there are more than five couples
currently waiting to get divorced.

294
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,253
A sudden increase in the divorce rate.

295
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,712
What's your take?

296
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,882
The generation now arriving in Heaven

297
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,927
is Generation X,
also called the Orange Tribe.

298
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,472
They're assertive,
impatient, and impulsive.

299
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,308
Some people blame them
for the rise in divorces,

300
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,894
but that's absolutely ridiculous.

301
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,606
Look. Do you know how many couples
actually choose to live together

302
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,525
even in Heaven?

303
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,069
Among countless Heaven-dwellers,

304
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,863
it's only 0.5%.

305
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,322
We're in that percentage.

306
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,492
After all that bickering on Earth,

307
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,328
who'd want to live together again up here?

308
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,122
A 0.5% couple?

309
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,332
Fine. However…

310
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,794
We endured our marriage on Earth
because time was limited.

311
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,130
It was 50 years at most. But here?

312
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,923
It's infinite.

313
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,843
You'll have to live
with your spouse for thousands of years.

314
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,262
How can anyone stand that?

315
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:44,933
So you're saying divorce in Heaven
is inevitable and natural.

316
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,602
-Do you agree?
-I absolutely

317
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,812
do not agree.

318
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:54,276
There are
no meaningless connections in life.

319
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,280
All our encounters
and relationships happen for a reason.

320
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,700
Recently, we've had a model example.

321
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,660
It's about someone who just arrived.

322
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,580
Ms. Lee Hae-sook. Yes, Ms. Lee Hae-sook.

323
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,790
And her husband from Earth,
Mr. Ko Nak-joon.

324
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,167
-Those two…
-He's talking…

325
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,793
-…are still married…
-…about us.

326
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,378
…even in Heaven.

327
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,671
Are we that famous?

328
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,590
-My goodness, what an honor.
-I know.

329
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,134
They're truly remarkable.

330
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,179
The husband has the appearance
of a young man,

331
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,974
while Ms. Lee still looks like
an 80-year-old senior.

332
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,851
That's why
they became the talk of the town.

333
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,021
That's right.
I believe what connected them

334
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,941
wasn't age or appearance.

335
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:38,904
It's the bond of marriage itself.

336
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,323
They'll regret it soon enough.

337
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,158
Regret? Who?

338
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,743
Ms. Lee.

339
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,163
Have you met

340
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,831
your mother-in-law

341
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,667
here in Heaven yet?

342
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,253
This was the source

343
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,421
-of Hae-sook's anxiety.
-Do you think Heaven

344
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,465
will be any different?

345
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,640
Come on, they're being so dramatic.

346
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,103
Really?

347
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,647
Even my mom?

348
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,066
Hold on.

349
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,528
Didn't you say your mother was in Heaven?

350
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,115
Yes. Why?

351
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,826
Did you mention me by any chance?

352
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,161
I'm not sure. No…

353
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,080
No, I didn't.

354
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,999
I haven't visited her ever since you came.

355
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,168
Does she live far away?

356
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,670
Yes.

357
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,171
I see.

358
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,007
We could visit her
if you're that curious--

359
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,176
What's wrong?

360
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,596
It's nothing.
I just suddenly felt anxious.

361
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,850
KO NAK-JOON
LEE HAE-SOOK

362
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,602
KO NAK-JOON

363
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,314
This is the least she can do.

364
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,066
She can't leave any trace
of her presence here.

365
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,067
Am I right?

366
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,736
Yes, you're right.

367
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,781
"Don't let the enemy know of my death."

368
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,846
Hae-sook, is that you?

369
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,475
Who are you?

370
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,603
Are you not my daughter-in-law?

371
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,564
Even with those lines on your face,

372
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,483
your face looks familiar.

373
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm sorry,
but I don't think we've ever met before.

374
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,655
How strange.

375
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:51,036
She'd also open her eyes wide
whenever she lied.

376
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:55,082
I really don't understand
who you're talking about.

377
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,920
If you say you're not her,
then I guess you're not.

378
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,130
Hold on.

379
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,966
My son gave me his house key
and told me to visit

380
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,010
whenever I wished. Where is it?

381
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,637
Did Nak-joon give you a key?

382
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,764
How do you know my son's name

383
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,266
when you're not even my daughter-in-law?

384
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:15,769
Damn it.

385
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,315
Mother?

386
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,859
Is that really you?

387
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,988
I didn't recognize you
because you look so young.

388
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:31,201
I was actually
going to come visit you, Mother.

389
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,328
…funeral hall…

390
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,413
Mom.

391
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,583
Why did you come without calling?

392
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,505
It was so hard to see your face,
so I decided to come to you myself.

393
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,716
You should've called first.
Hae-sook doesn't like surprise visits.

394
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,221
-Is that true?
-Not at all. I'm glad you came.

395
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,557
Can I get you something to drink?

396
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,474
No thanks.

397
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,241
The blanket is a bit thick.

398
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:14,035
I was going to throw it out
and buy a new one.

399
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,595
Well…

400
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,723
They somehow ended up living with us.

401
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,933
I was going to throw them out too.

402
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,607
I…

403
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,821
There's nothing special.

404
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,073
They're some pots and pans
I've been using.

405
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,664
There's nothing special.

406
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,625
They're some dishes I've been using.

407
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,555
I was going to organize them anyway.

408
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,103
Do you taste your food?

409
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:27,150
I may not look it,
but I season my food quite well.

410
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,239
Cooking is all about the touch.

411
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,494
I'm leaving.

412
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:38,995
Already?

413
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,332
Are you sick of me?

414
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,667
Not at all. I just--

415
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,834
Don't lie.

416
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,713
This house is screaming for me to leave.

417
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,840
Is that why
you didn't tell me that you died?

418
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,302
No, it's just that
this was my first time dying.

419
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,888
I've been busy adjusting to everything.

420
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,682
I'm sorry.

421
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:00,892
I'm leaving.

422
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,560
Don't see me out.

423
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,815
What? Are you leaving already?

424
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,401
At least stay for a meal.

425
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,736
Wait. Let me walk you out.

426
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,626
What's with the lock?

427
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:29,796
Is it because of my mom?

428
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:34,175
It's not like she broke in or something.

429
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,261
She didn't say anything either
and left right away.

430
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,846
True.

431
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,639
She didn't break in,

432
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,350
but she did show up without warning.

433
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,935
True, she didn't say anything.

434
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,730
But she opened
every cupboard in our messy house

435
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,815
and examined everything thoroughly.

436
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,651
Then she deliberately showed
how irritated she was

437
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,611
before leaving soon after.

438
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,739
So, yes. You're right about everything.

439
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,284
You have some amazing observation skills.
How did you catch all that?

440
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:03,038
If she asks for the passcode,
tell her you don't know it.

441
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,665
How can I?

442
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,793
It's not like
she came and stole something.

443
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,963
-If anything, she'd bring us stuff.
-That's exactly what I don't want!

444
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,634
This is our house, not hers.

445
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,137
But she comes and goes
like it's her own place.

446
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,389
Then she judges
every aspect of my housekeeping.

447
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,183
It makes me uncomfortable.

448
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:27,896
How would you feel if your boss
secretly watched you work and graded you?

449
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,107
My mom isn't your boss.

450
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,776
She is to me.

451
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,444
She's only a mother to you.

452
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,490
Is it really impossible
for a mother-in-law

453
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,450
and daughter-in-law to get along?

454
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,493
Geez.

455
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,871
She needs to cooperate too.

456
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,670
I'm really curious…

457
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,757
"I'm about to say something
that'll anger you, but don't get mad."

458
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,509
In case you misunderstand…

459
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:01,137
"I warned you,
so you'd be petty if you get angry."

460
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,848
-Promise you won't get angry?
-Go ahead.

461
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:08,603
Usually, when I look at women who don't
get along with their mothers-in-law,

462
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:12,148
it's either because the latter
gave them a really tough time

463
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:16,361
or they've had conflicts
over a very long period of time.

464
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,198
But didn't you and my mom
only see each other for about five years?

465
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,783
"About five years"?

466
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,036
Okay. Let's calculate it.

467
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:29,707
Those "about five years" must seem short
since I lived until I was 80.

468
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:35,505
Now, from those 80 years, subtract 20
since that was before we got married.

469
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,550
Then subtract another 50 years
you spent bedridden.

470
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,301
That leaves only ten years.

471
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:46,891
Those five years you just mentioned
comes from there.

472
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,686
I'll be right back.

473
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,895
Mandu, what about this place?
It's a wealthy family's house.

474
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,146
If you reincarnate there,

475
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,899
you'll be fed this expensive dog food.

476
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,610
And occasionally,
they even give you boiled chicken.

477
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,611
Gosh.

478
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,489
The doghouse is huge too! Hey!

479
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,365
You'll even have
your own personal groomer!

480
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,326
Don't you see the fine print?

481
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,660
What? Where?

482
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,496
Look closely.

483
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,289
He'll reincarnate as a Doberman.

484
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,707
What's wrong with that?

485
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,501
He'll be a guard dog.

486
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,961
There's a reason he'll live luxuriously.

487
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,131
You'd be constantly on edge
watching for intruders.

488
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,550
Your ears will perk up
at the slightest sound.

489
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,094
If you ever dare
wag your tail at a stranger,

490
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,013
you'll be kicked out immediately. Got it?

491
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,807
You'd be living in constant stress.

492
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,433
That won't work then.

493
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,770
Then… How about this one?

494
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,022
"A newlywed couple's home full of love."

495
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,149
That sounds nice.

496
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,778
But there's no job security there.
It's a lifetime contract position.

497
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,697
Why? It's a newlywed couple's home
full of love, isn't it?

498
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:28,076
What if all that overflowing love
produces a baby?

499
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,954
"The baby got bitten."
"The baby is allergic." "It's unhygienic."

500
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,290
They'll make all kinds of excuses
to avoid keeping you permanently.

501
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,460
Then they'll send you straight
to their in-laws or friends' house.

502
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,671
Really?

503
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,755
Wait a minute.

504
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,340
Yes. Then how about this one?

505
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,425
It's a ranch, and you'd be a sheepdog.

506
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,136
Follow me!

507
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:48,930
Say it.

508
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,724
Follow me!

509
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,018
You have zero charisma.

510
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,395
No sheep will follow you.

511
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:59,607
He lacks leadership, so it won't work.

512
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,694
Jjajang, then where should he go?

513
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,153
Mandu.

514
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,198
When are you the happiest?

515
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,455
He doesn't think at all.

516
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,040
Mandu.

517
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:29,846
Hi, Mandu.

518
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,724
Why is he here?

519
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,602
We need his help today.

520
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,686
I'm counting on you.

521
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,855
Let's finish our work quickly,

522
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,023
then go find that man.

523
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,566
Okay.

524
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,779
Are you going out?

525
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,239
Oh, yes.

526
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,491
I'm fine with you dating,

527
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,244
but don't just date any man.

528
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,204
He has to be qualified.

529
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,123
As in he must be wealthy?

530
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,793
No, I'm talking about his mother.
Your mother-in-law.

531
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,339
I thought I only needed
to treat her well on Earth,

532
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,215
but I forgot about Heaven.

533
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,676
I see…

534
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,638
-Are you going somewhere too?
-Yes, to church.

535
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,598
I have something urgent to pray for.

536
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,819
Why is it as quiet as a temple…

537
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,321
I'm sorry.

538
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,305
Pastor. Are you not feeling well?

539
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:56,808
No…

540
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,727
Do you get sick too?

541
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,648
Am I not allowed to get sick?

542
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,901
But we're in Heaven, and you're a pastor.

543
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,280
I was out all day collecting snails,

544
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,658
and I even carried you on my back.

545
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,954
This is because
I only lived until I was five.

546
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:23,251
At that age, kids get sick

547
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,170
just from going on field trips
or sports days.

548
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,131
What about food?

549
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:29,590
Have you eaten?

550
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,094
How could I when I'm this sick?

551
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:37,432
Or should you pray first
so you'll feel better?

552
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,852
How could I possibly pray
when I'm this sick?

553
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,145
Should I make you some rice?

554
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:46,315
How could I eat rice when I'm this sick?

555
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,674
It's mung bean porridge.

556
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:15,386
Mung beans are good for detoxing.

557
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,017
Are you not going to eat?

558
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,687
I don't have the strength to hold a spoon.

559
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,608
Geez, you're really a handful.

560
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,243
What now?

561
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:57,970
Does it taste bad?

562
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:04,018
Porridge isn't supposed to be
a culinary delight.

563
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,063
I can't swallow it.

564
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,023
My throat hurts too much.

565
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,983
Can you not even swallow this?

566
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:12,902
No.

567
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,130
Is this better?

568
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:33,840
Yes.

569
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,508
Thank goodness.

570
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,970
You still need to eat some grains,
so let's try having

571
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,139
some more porridge after this.

572
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,224
Okay.

573
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:03,661
EVERYTHING ABOUT HEAVEN
INSTRUCTOR: PRESIDENT OF HEAVEN

574
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,832
Hello, welcome…

575
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,335
Where should I sit?

576
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,464
Over there.

577
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,717
Wait…

578
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,263
Why sit here…

579
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,559
I'll start once the others arrive.

580
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,560
I'm the only one here.

581
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,772
-How do you know that?
-I just have a feeling.

582
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:37,069
That it's going to be
just you and me in this room.

583
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,533
It's time for class.

584
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,077
That's really strange.

585
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:49,165
This class has always been very popular.

586
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,626
Anyway, let's begin then.

587
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,378
All right.

588
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,714
Everything About Heaven

589
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,801
is a Q&A class where you can ask questions

590
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,472
about anything related to Heaven.

591
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:08,893
Heaven, Hell, reincarnation,
connections, soul development, and more.

592
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,938
Anything is fine. I'll take any questions.

593
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,773
I have a question.

594
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,858
-What is it?
-Are you married?

595
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,360
-Not that.
-Do you have kids?

596
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,237
-Not that either.
-What is your mother--

597
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,238
That's off-limits too.

598
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,323
-Then what's your ideal type--
-Also off-limits!

599
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,116
Then I have nothing to ask you.

600
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,622
There are plenty
of other good questions you could ask.

601
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,999
Like about connections?

602
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,293
Exactly.

603
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,213
Now that's a healthy, proper question.

604
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,507
When it comes to connections,

605
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,842
the present
isn't the only important thing.

606
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:46,681
Past life connections are just as crucial

607
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,935
because our current connections stem
from our past lives.

608
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,853
But why?

609
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:59,151
We meet again and again
to complete an unfinished business

610
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,654
from the past.

611
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,030
In that case,

612
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,992
you and I must also have a connection.

613
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:09,745
Of course.
Every connection happens for a reason.

614
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:14,750
Then what unfinished business could've
brought us together again like this?

615
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,460
I'm not sure.

616
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,087
I think I have an idea.

617
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,255
And what might that be?

618
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,007
Dating, marriage, and having children.

619
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,133
Class dismissed.

620
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,593
-It's been only three minutes.
-It's a three-minute class.

621
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,513
What do you mean?
What class only lasts for three minutes?

622
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,724
Sir!

623
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,695
Let's go.

624
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,363
You're going too fast.

625
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,575
Yes, good job.

626
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,746
That's my boy.

627
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,007
Minky.

628
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,428
Mandu.

629
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:08,763
Mandu.

630
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,264
Hey, Mandu!

631
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,769
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine.

632
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,020
I thought it was Minky.

633
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,192
I see. You must have the same breed.

634
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,151
Yes.

635
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,322
But recently…
she crossed the Rainbow Bridge.

636
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,991
Oh, dear. I see.

637
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,661
You must miss her a lot.

638
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,664
I wish I didn't,

639
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,209
but I can't help it.

640
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,920
You must've loved her.

641
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,840
Only in my heart.

642
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,510
I only loved her in my heart.

643
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,055
She was left all alone

644
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,600
when I went to work.

645
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,229
I made her wait by the door all day.

646
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,816
I thought, "When I'm a little less busy…"

647
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,319
"I'll play with her more
when I have more time."

648
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,114
But…

649
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,576
I never really played with her properly.

650
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,038
Looking back,

651
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,083
all she did in this world…

652
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,837
was meet me…

653
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,883
and spend her entire life waiting for me.

654
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,310
I also lost a dog…

655
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,356
in a similar way.

656
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:47,403
Whenever I felt guilty, I wrote letters.

657
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,781
I hoped my words would somehow reach it.

658
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,914
You should try that too.

659
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:03,461
Write anything
you wanted to tell her but couldn't.

660
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,632
It might bring you some peace.

661
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:13,304
HEAVEN POSTCARD

662
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,169
Good job!

663
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,712
Let's go.

664
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,661
Som-i.

665
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:20,829
What are you doing?

666
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,376
Why can't I grab this?

667
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,002
You could do it.

668
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,838
Oh, I'm not supposed to be able to either.

669
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,467
I can only grab things
because of this watch

670
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,678
that I have for my special mission.

671
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,097
Like this.

672
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,560
Let's find your guy now.

673
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,478
Okay.

674
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,196
It was here.

675
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,490
This was where I saw him.

676
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,746
Which way did he go?

677
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,138
Please…

678
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,015
I'm begging you!

679
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,602
Please!

680
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:36,822
Som-i.

681
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,033
Are you okay?

682
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,245
What's wrong? Did you remember something?

683
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,292
I kneeled down in front of him and begged.

684
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,085
I must have done

685
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,213
something terribly wrong.

686
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,965
If we follow him a bit more…

687
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,096
Next time.

688
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,767
We'll have to take a rain check. Let's go.

689
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,653
Minky.

690
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,907
I overlooked how much faster
time was passing for you than for me.

691
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,328
I made you spend most of your short life
just waiting for me.

692
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,538
I'm truly sorry.

693
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,835
Minky was by my side
throughout my difficult growing years.

694
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,339
I miss her so much
now that she's in Heaven.

695
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,801
I can only remember
what I couldn't do for her.

696
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,136
I'm filled with regret and sorrow.

697
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:46,392
I hope she's happy in Heaven.

698
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,547
My owner embraced my difficult past
and stayed by my side.

699
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,258
I miss her so much down there.

700
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,136
All I remember
are the good things she did for me.

701
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,555
My heart is full of love
and precious memories.

702
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,307
Please be as happy as me.

703
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,061
Gosh.

704
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,813
Jjampong, why are you wearing that cone?

705
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,773
Don't get me started.

706
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,775
He's started obsessively licking his paws.

707
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:40,237
He licked them so much
they had to put this on him.

708
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,655
You're so nasty.

709
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:44,116
It's impossible to stop
once you've started it.

710
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:48,537
This is all because I'm so stressed
about your reincarnation.

711
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,080
You don't need to stress anymore.

712
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:50,998
What?

713
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,208
What are you saying?

714
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,211
You've made up your mind?

715
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,922
Yes, I submitted the application.

716
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,716
Hey, where are you going?

717
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,012
Somewhere nice.

718
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,473
You… You didn't even tell me.

719
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,518
Come on!

720
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,769
Don't be so dramatic.

721
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:20,527
Hey.

722
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,280
Take care of yourself wherever you go.

723
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,533
And don't go chasing birds
or butterflies and get yourself lost.

724
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,870
And don't go gnawing on the table legs

725
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,414
when your teeth get itchy.

726
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:37,586
And… don't keep shoving toys
under the couch.

727
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,713
They'll stop taking them out.

728
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:44,468
And don't pick fights
with the robot vacuum.

729
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,429
They'll put you in a room
during cleaning time.

730
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,014
Also,

731
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,727
don't bark every time
the deliveryman comes.

732
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:58,565
Your treats come in those packages too.

733
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:04,196
And… stop showing tricks
only after getting a treat.

734
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:08,992
Try changing your mindset
to "tricks first, treats after."

735
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,120
And…

736
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:19,044
Do your humping business
out of sight as much as possible.

737
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,007
And just when you start humping,

738
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:27,052
they'll suddenly give you a bath
and put you in the car.

739
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,681
They're definitely

740
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,684
getting you neutered,

741
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:34,851
so don't be too shocked.

742
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,437
Stop!

743
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,815
He won't remember all of this anyway.

744
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,985
It's fine even if you don't remember.

745
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,906
But don't forget us.

746
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:50,701
Okay.

747
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,039
Let me give you a hug.

748
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:58,875
That hurts.

749
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,877
I can't help it.

750
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,754
Mandu!

751
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,089
Mandu.

752
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,173
You have to be happy…

753
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,301
We really

754
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,219
went through so much.

755
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,554
We did.

756
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:12,889
Mandu.

757
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,323
Hello, Mother.

758
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,620
The young ones need to be diligent
if they want a clean house.

759
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,874
-In any case, I have more energy than you.
-But this is my job.

760
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,960
As long as you know.

761
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,554
I brought some side dishes.

762
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,722
Put them in the fridge.

763
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,890
Yes, Mother.

764
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,312
Stay away from food
that's too spicy or salty.

765
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,731
What's bad on Earth is bad here too.

766
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:03,815
Okay.

767
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,320
Throw all of these out.

768
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,321
Okay.

769
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,908
-Do you think it's wasteful?
-Not at all.

770
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,663
You'd rather throw me out, wouldn't you?

771
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,123
Not at all, Mother.

772
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,708
Your eyes got bigger.

773
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,548
Young-ae.

774
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,385
What are you doing out here?

775
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,720
Your mother is here.

776
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,054
Then why are you out here?

777
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:19,349
I think it's best
that Som-i and I stay out of sight.

778
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,435
We'll wait outside.
Let us know when she leaves.

779
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,311
Let's go.

780
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,813
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

781
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,121
Mom, what are you doing?

782
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,331
I'm doing laundry.

783
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,917
What laundry? You're replacing the dishes.

784
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,252
So you know.

785
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:48,920
Then why ask?

786
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,505
Geez.

787
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,716
What? Can't I even ask?

788
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,720
If you do that, Hae-sook won't--

789
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,806
You should get changed.

790
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,189
Oh, my.

791
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,441
I could've set the table.

792
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:12,444
There's a beast growling in my stomach.

793
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,613
I'm sorry, I'll quickly…

794
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:22,496
What now?

795
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,914
What are you wearing?

796
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,792
What would she say if she saw you?

797
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,085
She'd get mad and say you look terrible.

798
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,712
Let me talk to her.

799
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,256
Just get changed, will you?

800
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,174
Fine!

801
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,634
I got it!

802
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,349
Goodness.

803
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,691
Hae-sook.

804
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:52,943
Did you scold him?

805
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,528
Not at all.

806
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,323
What did I do?

807
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,493
I have no appetite.

808
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,995
I'll clean up.

809
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,167
What? I got changed.

810
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:13,964
Let me.

811
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,801
-Seriously.
-It's okay. You must be tired.

812
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,511
-Just go.
-I said it's fine.

813
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,514
Oh, boy.

814
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:25,433
Who does our daughter take after
to be such a good housewife?

815
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,935
What are you on about now?

816
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,480
Are you still a man down there?
After going into the kitchen so often?

817
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,149
Mom, times have changed.

818
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,443
People will criticize you.
Change your mindset.

819
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,029
Other moms go shopping
with their daughters-in-law

820
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,739
and even go to saunas together.

821
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,199
Fine.

822
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,536
In that case,
I need to get with the times too.

823
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,247
-Hae-sook.
-Yes?

824
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,041
You and I need to go somewhere tomorrow,
so be home.

825
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,251
Okay.

826
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,086
No, don't go together. I'll go instead.

827
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,629
Stay out of it.

828
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,214
Just check if you're still a man.

829
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,518
-Go.
-Call us.

830
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,186
Hey, how will he do that?

831
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,523
Just go already.

832
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,903
Mandu, we'll begin
the reincarnation process.

833
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,239
The reincarnation location is
Seoul Station Exit Four, correct?

834
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,157
Yes.

835
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,492
Seoul Station Exit Four?

836
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,785
Is he going to a restaurant?

837
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,454
One minute, ma'am.

838
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,081
Is he out of his mind?

839
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,166
Hey.

840
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,043
Pick a different place. Okay?

841
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,085
What's the matter?

842
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,253
Are you insane?

843
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,589
Why choose a homeless of all owners?

844
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,090
-I'm leaving now. Bye.
-Hey!

845
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,467
-Mandu!
-Ma'am!

846
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,718
-No!
-Ma'am!

847
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,011
-Mandu!
-Ma'am!

848
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,346
Mandu!

849
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:53,313
ESSENTIAL APPLIANCES

850
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,923
TV is only fun when I watch with her.

851
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:23,426
Toys are only fun when I play with her.

852
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,515
And treats only taste good
when she gives them to me.

853
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,978
That's why I wait all day long.

854
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,106
For my mom.

855
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,566
For my owner.

856
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,828
You seem to be feeling better.

857
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:51,663
I am.

858
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,916
I mustered up the strength to pray,
and it helped.

859
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,377
I wonder who's responsible
for giving you that strength.

860
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,339
Are you fishing
for a "thank you" or something?

861
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,674
Yes.

862
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,676
All right.

863
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,470
Thank you. I feel better, thanks to you.
Happy now?

864
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,388
Yes.

865
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:14,978
What's wrong?

866
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,188
I'm not sure.

867
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,441
Nothing seems to
give me energy these days.

868
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,443
Should I pray for you?

869
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,695
This is unbelievable.

870
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,363
Even now,

871
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,491
I'm worried that you haven't eaten yet.

872
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,952
I knew you'd say that, so I didn't eat.

873
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,704
I'll cook up something right away.

874
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,706
No, I don't want rice.

875
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,876
After I got sick,
I started craving something unusual.

876
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:55,185
Goodness. You need to coax it out gently.

877
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,522
-Do sweet potatoes need coaxing?
-Of course, they do. Watch.

878
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,233
Brush off the soil like this.

879
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:06,029
If that doesn't work, dig a little more.

880
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,657
Then try shaking it again. Yes.

881
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:10,658
Dig.

882
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,243
Then coax.

883
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,414
Once it feels loose enough,

884
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,084
you can pull it out. See?

885
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,502
Dig and…

886
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,265
Just a bit more, and they'll be done.

887
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,977
We dug up sweet potatoes for a while,
but it's barely taken any time.

888
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:38,895
What do you mean?

889
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,565
You and I need to go somewhere tomorrow,

890
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,483
so be home.

891
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,276
Don't you think

892
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,987
it'd be tastier
to have some fresh kimchi with this?

893
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,199
Yes, but won't that take
a long time to make?

894
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:54,661
Who cares how long it takes
if it's going to be tasty?

895
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,878
I'm sure she'll come home sometime today.

896
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,274
What? What's wrong?

897
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:27,861
When you get old,
your skin gets thin and cracks.

898
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:28,945
It hurts.

899
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:30,864
Hold on.

900
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,365
Where did I put that ointment?

901
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,242
I can't do this with ointment on.

902
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,160
Come on now.

903
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,370
I can at least handle the mixing part.

904
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:46,504
Don't be so rough.
It'll make it taste raw.

905
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,466
Be gentle as if you're handling a baby.

906
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,301
-Like handling a baby?
-Yes.

907
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,517
That's it.

908
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:02,604
Be gentler.
As if you're soothing a crying baby.

909
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,356
-A crying baby?
-Yes.

910
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:07,734
A crying baby?

911
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,908
That's it.

912
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,035
Soon, that kimchi will get a job,

913
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:19,704
buy you red long johns, and bow to you.

914
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,289
Come on.

915
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:22,874
Were you teasing me?

916
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,919
You're making me smile.

917
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:28,463
Here.

918
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:33,968
Oh, my.

919
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:37,388
You really have magic hands
when it comes to making food.

920
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,517
But it's missing one thing.

921
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,476
What is it?

922
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,936
Sweet rice drink.

923
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,563
-Sweet rice drink?
-Yes. You top a sweet potato

924
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,232
with fresh kimchi.

925
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,984
Then you drink some sweet rice drink
when it gets too spicy,

926
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,236
and it's perfect.

927
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,864
-But doesn't it take longer to make it?
-It sure does.

928
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:55,949
Is that okay with you?

929
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,784
Of course it is.

930
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,179
I should get going now.

931
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,849
She's probably left by now.

932
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,351
Are you leaving?

933
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,436
I should.

934
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,278
For me, church was…

935
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,530
a place of waiting.

936
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,075
Mom…

937
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,953
I waited for my mom to find me.

938
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,832
I waited again the next day,

939
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,460
thinking that maybe she'll come then.

940
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:38,384
I wanted to know the reason
for my cruelly short and miserable life.

941
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,762
I wanted an answer,

942
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:44,682
so I spent many nights
waiting in prayer at my church.

943
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,569
Even to this day, church is…

944
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:58,655
a place of waiting.

945
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,509
Hello.

946
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:21,678
-You must live here.
-I do.

947
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,222
Nak-joon told me about you.

948
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,348
Where's Ms. Lee?

949
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,059
I told her to be home,

950
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,812
but I've been waiting for her all day.

951
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,939
I'll call her.

952
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,233
Don't bother.

953
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:39,445
Hae-sook must find me uncomfortable.

954
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:51,999
I'll be honest.

955
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,044
I wasn't very nice to her.

956
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,297
I'm aware of that.

957
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,719
But that was how
my mother-in-law treated me.

958
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,472
I thought that was
just how everyone lived.

959
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,393
Having experienced the treatment myself,

960
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:13,187
I shouldn't have treated Hae-sook
the same way.

961
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,107
I guess I'm too set in my old ways.

962
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,027
But one day,

963
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:22,655
I was watching TV and saw her.

964
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,075
She was still in her old body

965
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:27,952
like overripe kimchi.

966
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:32,331
Meanwhile, Nak-joon and I looked so young.

967
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,667
I was curious.

968
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:36,961
So I came and…

969
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,172
Oh, dear.

970
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,924
She was working so hard.

971
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:46,554
She was lifting heavy blankets and pots

972
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,015
with that old body of hers.

973
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,226
She'd wear herself out.

974
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,395
So that's why…

975
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:56,063
That's right.

976
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,900
But she didn't feel the same way I did.

977
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,653
It was obvious
that she didn't like me here.

978
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,240
And Nak-joon looked so flustered.

979
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,118
So of course I felt awkward too.

980
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:11,829
You see…

981
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,957
We're often dissatisfied
with our own parents.

982
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,543
So it must be worse with in-laws.

983
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,713
Not at all. I think it'd be nice

984
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,758
if you could tell her these things
when she comes home.

985
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,051
No thanks.

986
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,263
You need to
experience it yourself to know.

987
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,518
She needs to experience it

988
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,562
before walking in my shoes.

989
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,653
Don't come out.

990
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,706
Sorry for rushing back home.

991
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,875
We'll find him tomorrow.

992
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:03,381
I'm starting to feel scared.

993
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:08,344
I don't know what's waiting for me
at the end of my memory.

994
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,055
What should I do?

995
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:16,143
What if I was truly evil enough
to go to Hell?

996
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:20,147
What if I'm someone
who's beyond forgiveness?

997
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,528
Do you want

998
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,447
to stop looking then?

999
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,410
No, I want to go through with it.

1000
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,829
Because

1001
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,249
life is already Hell for me right now.

1002
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:41,836
Your mother…

1003
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,214
Mom. Are you leaving?

1004
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,050
Did you and Hae-sook go out today?

1005
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:52,555
Tell her to relax
since I won't be coming by again.

1006
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,309
She must be relieved
she'll never see me again.

1007
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:58,978
Darn it.

1008
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,396
I have a terrible temper.

1009
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:04,358
Don't relay what I said word for word.

1010
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,068
She had it rough.

1011
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,906
Having me as a mother-in-law?

1012
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,115
That's no small thing.

1013
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:14,452
And on top of that,
she even took care of you.

1014
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:16,329
She deserves a medal.

1015
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,998
Being filial isn't complicated.

1016
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:22,960
It's okay to fight and bicker
as long as you two are happy together.

1017
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:27,965
Don't visit me anymore.

1018
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,635
I won't come here either.

1019
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:31,552
Why not?

1020
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:34,889
Are you getting married?

1021
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:36,599
You little…

1022
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,269
Then why talk like that?

1023
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:42,688
Wait, let me get changed--

1024
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:43,773
Don't bother.

1025
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,524
-Why, Mom?
-Rest up. Don't follow me.

1026
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:47,693
Mom.

1027
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:57,536
Honey.

1028
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,104
Did you see your mother?

1029
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:28,526
Why? Did she say something?

1030
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,374
Did you really have to do that?

1031
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,585
Not really.

1032
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,337
-But--
-You know

1033
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,298
that my mom died young.

1034
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,970
Unlike other families,
she didn't live long enough

1035
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:57,555
for us to take care of her.

1036
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,015
You're right.

1037
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:02,059
But I feel uncomfortable around her.

1038
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:07,314
And I really hate
arguing with you about her.

1039
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:11,068
Can't you just like her
if you care about me?

1040
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:14,488
I'm her son, so what am I supposed to do?

1041
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:19,285
Should I cut ties with her
and become strangers?

1042
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,203
I never asked you to do that.

1043
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:25,041
I just wish you'd be firmer
when she crosses the line--

1044
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:27,376
What line is there
between parent and child?

1045
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,921
Do we draw boundaries between us?

1046
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,090
Young-ae isn't family, but we get along.

1047
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:35,509
Can't we do the same?

1048
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,845
I would've done it already if that worked,

1049
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:39,555
but it doesn't.

1050
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:40,806
You haven't even tried.

1051
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,142
You don't bother to.

1052
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:44,727
Stop it.

1053
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,479
I'm about to say something petty.

1054
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:54,361
You're already being petty.

1055
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,415
Why is he so upset?

1056
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,461
WELCOME TO HEAVEN, EVERYONE!

1057
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:12,755
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

1058
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:15,341
EVERYTHING ABOUT HEAVEN
CHAPTER 2

1059
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:20,888
NO PERSONAL QUESTIONS!

1060
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:39,949
Why did you lock the door?

1061
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,408
Just in case.

1062
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,162
In case of what…

1063
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,001
Well…

1064
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:53,629
There are so many seats,
so why sit so close…

1065
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:54,672
Just in case.

1066
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:55,881
In case of what?

1067
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,092
I don't know.

1068
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,137
The one who does it knows, not me.

1069
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,849
Darn it. I'll just erase you--

1070
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,017
No. Okay.

1071
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:08,269
I'll sit here.

1072
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:13,357
Okay, this is our final lesson
on Everything About Heaven.

1073
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,901
What? But it's only the second day.

1074
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,195
My course has only two sessions.

1075
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,238
Any questions?

1076
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:20,948
-If not, we're done.
-I do.

1077
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:21,991
No weird questions.

1078
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:23,617
It's not a weird one.

1079
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:25,953
Why do married couples

1080
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:28,831
still fight even in Heaven?

1081
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,125
Right.

1082
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:33,878
In life, everyone has certain experiences

1083
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,088
they're meant to go through.

1084
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,257
And marriage is no exception.

1085
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,259
In a marriage,

1086
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:44,096
you're bound to experience
a whole range of emotions.

1087
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,183
But in the case of Nak-joon and Hae-sook,

1088
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:51,520
they missed out
on those mandatory experiences

1089
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,189
due to a major event.

1090
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:58,277
So those unfinished experiences
are continuing here.

1091
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,778
I see.

1092
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:06,911
In that case, where do you think we are

1093
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:10,497
in that emotional spectrum?

1094
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,958
No! That's a bad question!

1095
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,335
No for you as well!

1096
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:16,962
Gosh, that face you're making is so cute.

1097
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:23,928
Stop…

1098
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,679
I said stay there…

1099
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,313
Stop… Stop right there.

1100
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:06,136
Hae-sook's anxiety was never
about her mother-in-law.

1101
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,055
It was about how Nak-joon

1102
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:10,683
became a stranger
whenever he was with his mother.

1103
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:39,169
Som-i, the train
will be arriving soon. Let's…

1104
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:00,983
What the hell? Let go!

1105
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:03,277
Let go, you bitch!

1106
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,212
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

1107
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:05,756
Do you think I was evil in the past?

1108
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:09,760
That's exactly why you need to
regain your memory. I'll help you.

1109
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:13,972
Come to think of it,
those two seem a lot closer.

1110
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,974
Who cares? Let them do whatever they want.

1111
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:20,354
-Did you two have a fight?
-Let's just drink it ourselves.

1112
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:22,481
Are you telling a pastor to drink?

1113
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,275
Do you see me riding this bicycle?
Sister Hae-sook?

1114
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:27,361
Ring, ring, coming through

1115
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:30,030
I can even touch things
like this now, thanks to you.

1116
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:31,907
-What is this?
-A gift.

1117
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,119
-I signed up for reincarnation.
-Reincarnation?

1118
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:36,745
-As in you're being reborn?
-No--

1119
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,914
-Hold on.
-Does Nak-joon know about this?

1120
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:45,337
