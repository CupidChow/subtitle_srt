1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,966
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

2
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:03,980
Kang Jeong-gu.

3
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,525
Are you Detective Kang Jeong-gu?

4
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,071
Why are you staring at me?

5
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,781
Do you know me?

6
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,657
You know me, don't you?

7
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,202
Who are you?

8
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,412
Don't you recognize me?

9
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,582
Ko Nak-joon.

10
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,167
"Nak-joon"?

11
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,253
Who's that?

12
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,423
"Ko Nak-joon"?

13
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,341
Hold on.

14
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,260
The Ko Nak-joon I know

15
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,431
can't be standing
in front of me like this.

16
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:39,933
What did you do?

17
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,686
-What?
-Who did you sell him off to?

18
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,355
-Help me!
-Answer me!

19
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,357
-Someone help me!
-Answer me!

20
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,776
You know my Eun-ho! You know him!

21
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,070
Where is he? Who did you sell him off to?

22
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,780
-Eun-ho!
-Let go!

23
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,658
You know my Eun-ho! Eun-ho!

24
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,451
Hey! Kang Jeong-gu!

25
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,161
-Come on.
-Get back here! Kang Jeong-gu!

26
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,497
Yes, I remember now.

27
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,422
The Grim Reaper will be here soon.

28
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,174
Answer me. Who did you sell him off to?

29
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,009
Did I die for nothing

30
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,638
because of you?

31
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,182
It's all your fault!

32
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,852
If it wasn't for you…

33
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,689
It's all your fault!

34
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,650
My son…

35
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,901
Where is he?

36
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,696
I'll kill you too, you bastard.

37
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,948
I'll kill that bitch too!

38
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,285
That damn leech!

39
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:45,290
That bitch got me fired.

40
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,877
Where is that bitch? Where is she?

41
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,091
You bastard!

42
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,645
Kang Jeong-gu.

43
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,439
Kang Jeong-gu.

44
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,732
Kang Jeong-gu.

45
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,525
Som-i.

46
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,360
Som-i!

47
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,919
Som-i.

48
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,337
Let go. Okay?

49
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,505
He could erase you, Som-i.

50
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,227
Som-i.

51
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,438
Mr. Ko Nak-joon.

52
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,609
Since you were unable to return,
you'll be erased.

53
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,819
Even if you manage to return,

54
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,697
you won't get off easy this time.

55
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:11,376
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE

56
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:19,884
In that moment,

57
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,681
I couldn't hear or see anything.

58
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,768
He was the only thing I saw.

59
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,814
I didn't care if I disappeared

60
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,566
as long as

61
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,569
I could protect him.

62
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,763
But you're the first person
I actually grabbed onto.

63
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,861
He's someone I shouldn't covet.

64
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,490
But even if my entire life

65
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,786
in my lost memories
was filled with misfortune,

66
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,248
I would gladly endure it all over again

67
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,252
if I was allowed

68
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,963
to have him.

69
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,064
Eun-ho.

70
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,816
Eun-ho.

71
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,323
Who was that?

72
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,541
That's just how we are.

73
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,795
When you're told not to do something,
you want to do it even more.

74
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,924
When you're told to stay away,
you want to cling even tighter.

75
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,637
She's not an ingrate.

76
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,139
She'll sort out her feelings and back off.

77
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:43,528
I've decided to just follow my heart.

78
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,406
Geez.

79
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:56,499
The only person in Heaven
who'd hang a clothesline would be you.

80
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,215
I want to go with you.

81
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,176
You do?

82
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,846
If you suddenly go to work alone,

83
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,849
Ms. Lee might catch on
to what happened to you.

84
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,601
Plus, I feel like
I might remember something more

85
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,020
if I tagged along with you.

86
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,317
Right. That could be possible.

87
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,019
Do you think he's among these people?

88
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,104
That old man who died.

89
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,401
Does that mean he's too evil to be here?

90
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,823
That was something I wanted to find out.

91
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,326
But now…

92
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,785
Gosh.

93
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,829
There's no way to find out.

94
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,125
Why don't we just tell her
that I caused some trouble?

95
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,044
I don't want to make Hae-sook worry.

96
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,298
She's already suffered too much
because of me.

97
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,720
I envy her.

98
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,100
We should get going.

99
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,685
I have something to tell you.

100
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,146
What is it?

101
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,192
I had

102
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,278
a strange dream.

103
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,367
I don't know
if it's part of my lost memory,

104
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,329
but I saw a child.

105
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:32,863
Eun-ho.

106
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,702
Eun-ho.

107
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,001
Someone called him "Eun-ho."

108
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,631
Eun-ho?

109
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,178
Eun… Eun-ho?

110
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,516
Did you just say "Eun-ho"?

111
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,226
Yes.

112
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,603
How do you know him?

113
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,146
What?

114
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,523
Answer me! How do you know him?

115
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,568
That's it. I don't remember anything else.

116
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,905
Nak-joon, you're hurting me.

117
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,782
I'm sorry.

118
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,577
And then?

119
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,371
That was all.

120
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,168
Who's Eun-ho?

121
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,006
Is he connected to you somehow?

122
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:35,760
Yes.

123
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,181
If I remember anything else,

124
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,267
I'll tell you right away.

125
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,003
We can't…

126
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,048
stay like this

127
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,468
forever, can we?

128
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,687
Answer me! How do you know him?

129
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,231
Is he connected to you somehow?

130
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:32,817
Yes.

131
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,571
Judging by his reaction,
they must be very close.

132
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:39,824
Could he be

133
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,326
Nak-joon's son?

134
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,246
But…

135
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,292
I don't recall Ms. Lee ever mentioning
that they had a child.

136
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:58,884
I had

137
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,429
a strange dream.

138
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,681
I saw a child.

139
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,975
Someone called him "Eun-ho."

140
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,687
What should I do?

141
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,608
What if I was truly evil enough
to go to Hell?

142
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,653
What if I'm someone
who's beyond forgiveness?

143
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:46,765
I pray.

144
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,313
That at the end of suffering lies
enlightenment that's equal to its weight.

145
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,941
For the preciousness
of the smallest things.

146
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,279
That what I earnestly desired
has already been possessed.

147
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,452
And…

148
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,080
I thank you that my prayers

149
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,375
have already been answered.

150
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,851
Mom.

151
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,607
I've prayed every single day

152
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,985
ever since I came here.

153
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,820
I prayed that I could meet my mom.

154
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,242
And you're the first person

155
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,787
who came to me after all this time.

156
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,124
You're…

157
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,502
my mom, aren't you?

158
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,756
I…

159
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,175
don't have any children.

160
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,054
Sorry?

161
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:11,475
My husband and I never had children.

162
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,439
I see.

163
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,651
Why did you think I was your mother?

164
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,286
I was just kidding. It was a joke.

165
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,038
Don't lie. You're even crying.

166
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,083
I was just acting. Okay?

167
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,919
I should put my heart into it
if I'm going to prank you.

168
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,130
It seemed pretty real to me.

169
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,049
Would you like me to be your foster mom?

170
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,802
Geez, I'm telling you. You're wrong.

171
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,762
Then forget the "foster" part.

172
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,848
You can just call me "Mom" if you want.

173
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,976
Good grief.
You're driving me crazy, so leave.

174
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,186
Unbelievable.

175
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,105
Good grief.

176
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,003
Are you the humans

177
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,756
who signed up for the Hell post this time?

178
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,341
Mr. President?

179
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,508
No, it's not him.

180
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,762
Well… We're not humans.

181
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,597
We're dogs.

182
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,058
Jjajang, I'm sure that's him.

183
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,643
You're wrong.

184
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,937
Look how disrespectfully he talks.

185
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,104
Dogs?

186
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,566
Then turn into dogs.

187
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,324
Damn it.

188
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,202
Anyway…

189
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,121
I've only seen awful bastards
for the past tens of thousands of years.

190
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,624
Seeing a couple of puppies
really cleanses my soul.

191
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,585
How does it feel to be in Hell?

192
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,964
Well, I thought
it would be very scary here.

193
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,300
But it seems better than I imagined.

194
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,053
And I smell something delicious.

195
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,097
That's the smell
of people burning in hellfire.

196
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,348
What?

197
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,100
That can't be.

198
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,186
I also smell something sweet.

199
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,855
That's the smell
of people frying in sewage.

200
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,816
What? Sewage?

201
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,571
-Jjajang, I'm so scared! What do I do?
-Good grief.

202
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,408
How will you softies
manage to work in Hell?

203
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,036
We are not as soft as you think.

204
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:40,249
I came here to punish
all the animal abusers.

205
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,626
I see.

206
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,546
I get it now, looking at you two.

207
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,174
No one should abuse
cute and harmless animals like you.

208
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,384
-Of course!
-That's right.

209
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,635
All right.

210
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,888
Go and hunt down those bastards right now!

211
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,056
Really?

212
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,475
We did it!

213
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,477
-Thank you so much!
-Thank you so much!

214
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,604
Let's go.

215
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,856
-Hold on.
-Yes?

216
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,400
I have one last thing to say.

217
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:10,738
Wanna go for a walk?

218
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,410
Come on!

219
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,454
Let's go.

220
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,872
Do you want to go for a walk?

221
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:21,957
A walk!

222
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,667
Can you please stop it?

223
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,965
Jjajang, I'm terrified.

224
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,384
-I'm about to tuck in my tail.
-Me too.

225
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,178
But we have to stay sharp.

226
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,681
We need to do our job right
if we want the humans on Earth to behave.

227
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,184
But how will we find the animal abusers?

228
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,270
-Bad guys always give off a bad smell.
-Really?

229
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,316
-Right, we're in Hell.
-Jjajang!

230
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,527
-Jjampong, forget the smell--
-He's one of the bad guys!

231
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,696
-Everyone here is bad.
-That's not what I mean.

232
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:57,117
This is the guy who ran that puppy mill!

233
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,286
He locked up the dogs

234
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,413
and forced them to have puppies
until they died!

235
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,499
And he never treated them
when they got sick.

236
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,002
He just left them there to die.

237
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,754
What are you talking about?

238
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,923
When did I do that? Do you have proof?

239
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:11,924
Do you?

240
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,344
Jjampong, are you positive?

241
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,096
Yes, I am.

242
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,306
I was born in that very mill.

243
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,643
Hold on!

244
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,979
Jjampong has one last thing to do.

245
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,083
You're back.

246
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,213
Gosh, it must've been so hard.

247
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,175
Hey, honey.

248
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,093
Yes?

249
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,427
Young-ae is gone.

250
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,431
I see.

251
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,351
But it was for the best.

252
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,771
She'll live a happy life on Earth
before coming here.

253
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,775
I'm so tired.

254
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:13,861
I know.

255
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,238
Hop on my back.

256
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,408
You deserve a piggyback ride
since you're tired.

257
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,452
I can still walk. Let's go.

258
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,412
Okay.

259
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,122
All right then.

260
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,625
Let's have dinner and get some rest.

261
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,543
Okay.

262
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,590
-Today…
-Yes?

263
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,092
Do you know what happened at church?

264
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,010
What happened?

265
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,430
The pastor suddenly asked me
if I was his mom.

266
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,435
He asked so seriously
that I couldn't even joke around.

267
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,688
So I said,
"My husband and I never had children."

268
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,024
I just told him the truth.

269
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,820
They never had children?

270
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,824
Then whose child is Eun-ho?

271
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,505
Eun-ho.

272
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,427
Eun-ho.

273
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,275
Eun-ho.

274
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,277
Eun-ho.

275
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,613
Eun-ho!

276
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,823
Eun-ho!

277
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,283
Eun-ho!

278
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,121
My baby…

279
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,457
Please give him back…

280
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,211
Eun-ho!

281
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,926
My baby, Eun-ho…

282
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,936
Nak-joon.

283
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,229
That child, Eun-ho.

284
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,232
I think he was my son…

285
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,400
Fire in the hole!

286
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,373
Mom!

287
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,146
What do you mean?

288
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,234
Eun-ho was your son?

289
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,487
Who told you that?

290
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,158
Who the hell told you that?

291
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,956
Never mind.

292
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,668
I must've been mistaken.

293
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,380
I'll be in my room.

294
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,143
Open the door.

295
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,438
Open the door!

296
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,649
I said, open it! Open this door!

297
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,402
Open this door!

298
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,655
Open up!

299
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,006

Open this door right now!

305
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,078
Open the door! Hurry!

306
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,329
Open up!

307
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,290
Did you sell him?

308
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,875
To that animal?

309
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,503
What are you talking about?

310
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,712
Eun-ho.

311
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,297
Why my son?

312
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,550
Your son?

313
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,427
What do you mean?

314
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,847
Where is he? Where is my son?

315
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,473
What is this?

316
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,475
Is your memory back?

317
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,812
Is your memory back? Answer me!

318
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,697
Answer me!

319
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:14,327
If you got your memory back,
why are you mentioning Eun-ho? Why?

320
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,288
Your son? Damn it.

321
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,039
Who the hell are you?

322
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,031
I figured you'd come.

323
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,868
So you knew all along.

324
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,421
HEAVEN GIMBAP
HEAVEN TOUR

325
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,256
Is something going on today?

326
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,717
Why is it so quiet?

327
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,511
Is there a good drama on TV or something?

328
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,430
I see.

329
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,390
Maybe it's because
of the Lottery Festival.

330
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,227
-Lottery Festival?
-Yes.

331
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,145
That's a thing?

332
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:26,233
You know how some people win the lottery
after dreaming of their ancestors.

333
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,276
Not just anyone can enter those dreams.

334
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,739
Their ancestors need to go through a lot
to get into those dreams.

335
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,242
Mr. Kim who sold vegetables at the market

336
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,536
dreamed of his late mother
then won first prize.

337
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,955
Oh dear.

338
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,041
His poor mom must've gone through a lot
to appear in his dream.

339
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,419
Do you have to fight each other
to get into the dream?

340
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,797
Do you think this is the Roman Colosseum?

341
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,507
Then how do you get in?

342
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,969
The broadcast should've begun by now.

343
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,472
Yes, over there. Follow me.

344
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,560
Excuse me.

345
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,271
Excuse me.

346
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,564
It's the biggest event in Heaven.

347
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:10,735
You will appear in the dreams
of your family or friends

348
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,405
to give them the winning lottery numbers.

349
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,408
It's Heaven's Lottery Festival!

350
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,743
I didn't know Heaven had lotteries.

351
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,081
Mr. Kim's family fell apart

352
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,667
after he won the lottery.

353
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,838
The couple fought over the money
and even ended up in court.

354
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,424
The brothers got into a knife fight too.

355
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,843
It was a total disaster.

356
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,761
That wasn't our lottery.

357
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,679
Sorry?

358
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,931
That was Hell's lottery.

359
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:41,850
Hell's lottery?

360
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,893
Hell has their own lottery too.

361
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,355
You can win that one as well,
but your descendants will be miserable.

362
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,275
That's why we call it
the Lottery Festival.

363
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,361
But in Hell, it's called the Lottery Trap.

364
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,113
I see.

365
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,282
By the way, can you hear me?

366
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,867
Of course not.

367
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:00,952
What?

368
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:05,623
So what do you have to do
to enter a descendant's dream?

369
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,252
First, you need to find these Lottery Keys

370
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,630
which are hidden all over Heaven.

371
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,509
Can I just look for them anywhere?

372
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,845
Last year,
the keys were found at a lighthouse,

373
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,013
on a hiking trail,

374
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,348
at a reservoir,

375
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,892
at the Heaven Support Center,
and downtown.

376
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,353
That's right.

377
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,480
Find the keys in various places,

378
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,358
and come to the plaza
by the Support Center.

379
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,525
At the plaza,

380
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,280
you'll find six boxes like these.

381
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,034
Use the keys you found to open them.

382
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,537
You can't just use any key.

383
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,832
You can only open them
with the Lottery Keys.

384
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,959
All right, once you open them,

385
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,714
you'll be eligible to participate
in the final contest.

386
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,133
The six of you

387
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,844
will compete in the final round.

388
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,764
Compete? How does that work?

389
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,892
Well, the participants
sometimes yield to each other.

390
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,937
Others share their personal stories
to get votes.

391
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:16,069
Everyone in Heaven
can participate in the voting.

392
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,657
Once the final winner emerges,

393
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:26,413
they will take the winning lottery numbers
and visit their descendant in a dream.

394
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,289
From what I've seen,

395
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,668
the more tragic your story,
the more votes you get.

396
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,588
Who will be the one to claim victory?

397
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,341
We look forward to all of you
taking up the challenge.

398
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,644
Sister, what is it? What's with your eyes?

399
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,021
-Don't get competitive just yet.
-Why not?

400
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,106
It starts tomorrow.

401
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,863
Honey!

402
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:00,780
Honey!

403
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,746
Honey, I've found something
I really want to do.

404
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,539
It's that lottery thing.

405
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,292
I want to do this for her at all costs.

406
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,670
I couldn't do much for her
when I was alive.

407
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,757
I'll make sure
Young-ae lives a comfortable life.

408
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,134
Right.

409
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:22,802
Young-ae?

410
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,722
Look…

411
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,391
Honey.

412
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,938
What's wrong?
Do you have something to say?

413
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,401
-Are you…
-Yes?

414
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,196
…happy?

415
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,409
I'd be happy
if I could give the lottery to Young-ae.

416
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:50,955
I see.

417
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,376
As long as you're happy.

418
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,589
Where's Som-i? It's quiet in here.

419
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,382
You're right.

420
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,676
I don't think she's home yet.

421
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,768
Who the hell told you that?

422
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,019
Who the hell are you?

423
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,233
Ko Nak-joon.

424
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,693
Who are you?

425
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,338
What are you doing?

426
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,383
Geez.

427
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,844
What are you doing?

428
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,847
I'm going to make some rice cakes
and roasted grain powder.

429
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,808
What? Are they for me?

430
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,142
Oh, please.

431
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,396
I'm trying to win the lottery.

432
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,022
The lottery?

433
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,568
But what does that
have to do with rice cakes?

434
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,571
Let's just call it life wisdom.

435
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,617
Sure, but why exactly are you practicing
your life wisdom here?

436
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,246
Come on. We're buddies for life.

437
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,818
You're still a child at times like this.

438
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,113
By the way,

439
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,240
you said you didn't have kids.

440
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,075
Whose dream are you trying to enter?

441
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,289
There's someone
whom I consider like my own child.

442
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,448
Hey.

443
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,284
Do you need extra money? Low interest.

444
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,662
Why? Is business slow?

445
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,166
Can't you tell?
A lender's asking you to spend money.

446
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,795
Didn't that old hag leave you anything?

447
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:49,717
Geez, she was so awful
and cold-hearted to everyone.

448
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,845
She treated you like a servant too.

449
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,057
Then shouldn't she have
at least left you something?

450
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,017
God, what a scrooge.

451
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,728
She left me plenty.

452
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,064
More than I can spend in a lifetime.

453
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:04,774
I thought you had no money.

454
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,361
Imagine if word got out that I was rich.
No one would want to pay up.

455
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,198
Don't tell others that I'm rich.

456
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,369
Are you leaving?

457
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,413
And…

458
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,791
Talk about Ms. Lee like that again,

459
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,627
and I'll tear you to pieces.

460
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,340
Nod if you understand.

461
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,351
The only thing I left her

462
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,104
is an IOU that's worth a small amount.

463
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,897
Then that makes sense.

464
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,482
By the way,

465
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,401
why are we here?

466
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,822
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

467
00:33:56,492 --> 00:34:00,163
MAP OF HEAVEN

468
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:05,001
I've finally come to my senses
after going through a lot.

469
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,962
And the person I'm most grateful to

470
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,423
is you.

471
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:15,678
I don't know if this is enough
to convey my feelings.

472
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,513
It's more than enough.

473
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,348
What a relief.

474
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,977
I'm planning to take it easy from now on.

475
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,647
I want to travel around Heaven

476
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,358
and open up my closed-off heart.

477
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,111
Yes, that's a very good idea.

478
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,323
There are many beautiful places here.

479
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,992
Any recommendations?

480
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,996
Where should I go
to open up my closed heart?

481
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:47,752
Where might the key
to unlocking my heart be hidden?

482
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,590
The sea? Mountains?

483
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,468
Or perhaps a reservoir?

484
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,263
A hiking trail?
Somewhere in this building?

485
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,809
Anywhere is fine.

486
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,771
But what if you had to pick
a place for me?

487
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,651
Take your time and visit them all.

488
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,404
Right, I could do that.

489
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,202
Geez, there are too many cameras here.

490
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,121
No wonder it's tricky for you.

491
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:28,000
But I believe
you and I can understand each other

492
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:31,671
without having to talk out loud.

493
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:37,135
Gosh, why does my body feel
so stiff these days?

494
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,472
Is it over there?

495
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,768
Or maybe this way?

496
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,105
Just nod your head.

497
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,819
This way? That way? Where?

498
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,029
I can't tell you.

499
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,116
That's pretty cold of you,
given how close we are.

500
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,076
Can you really not tell me?

501
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,830
No, I absolutely cannot.

502
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,874
That's so harsh…

503
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,335
What? These are my thoughts.

504
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,422
I thought we could understand
each other without talking.

505
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,257
Did you hear that?

506
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,218
Yes, I did.

507
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,804
In full 5.1 Dolby surround sound.

508
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,100
I was being shortsighted.

509
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,810
I should get going.

510
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,854
Thank you for the food.

511
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:38,696
You can just leave the empty cup here.

512
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,323
Okay.

513
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,087
Just put it down. No pressure.

514
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,434
Have another cup.

515
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,812
We should get going now.

516
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,772
Hold on.

517
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,857
-I'm sorry. We'll leave now.
-Wait.

518
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,238
Pastor, how could you butt in
like that back there?

519
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:28,329
I had everything planned out.
You shouldn't have interfered.

520
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,875
I would've understood had you done this
after searching to no avail.

521
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,212
But you're resorting to cheating
without even trying.

522
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,548
Cheating? I told you,
it's just a bit of life wisdom.

523
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,551
What kind of life have you lived?

524
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,679
You can't do this again.

525
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,847
-Why not?
-Are you seriously asking?

526
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,476
My one and only churchgoer
is behaving like Satan.

527
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,061
Do you expect me to just sit still?

528
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,814
Is that how I looked to you?

529
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:55,982
Yes.

530
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,776
Calling you "Satan" was a bit much.

531
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,571
I'm sorry.
I guess it could've looked that way.

532
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,200
Then what about praying?

533
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,868
Praying is not cheating, is it?

534
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,123
Of course not.
Prayer is exactly what's needed right now.

535
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,668
Then let me go somewhere quiet to pray.

536
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,177
Just getting through each day
was overwhelming.

537
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:29,473
I was harsh toward others just to survive.

538
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,643
Thinking back now, I regret it so much.

539
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,897
I wanted Young-ae to live a better life.

540
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,233
If only I had the key…

541
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:45,197
Not just any key but the one
that opens those pretty white boxes.

542
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,949
If only I had one…

543
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,535
Then you could send me to Hell--

544
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,871
No, scratch that.

545
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:57,168
I don't mind suffering a little,
just not in Hell.

546
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,544
The key.

547
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,880
If you can just give me that key,

548
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,299
I'll consider the handsome,

549
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,802
amazing, and wonderful president

550
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:11,015
my lifelong savior.

551
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:15,895
I promise to repay
and serve him faithfully.

552
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,648
I understand that
no one can probably hear my prayer.

553
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,485
But I truly believe

554
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,570
that someone will listen

555
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:28,366
and answer my prayer.

556
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,744
If not, I'm going to act up.

557
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,038
I'm going to live recklessly.

558
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,625
I understand completely.

559
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,668
Oh my goodness!

560
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,045
How long have you been there?

561
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,757
Since a while ago.
Continuously. For a long time.

562
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,384
Nonstop.

563
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,928
I'll escort her out.

564
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:52,139
-No, I need to talk to him--
-Get up, please.

565
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,241
If you come closer, I'll scream.

566
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,041
I need to ask you something.

567
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:25,256
I regained another piece of memory
that you must be curious about.

568
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,008
What is it?

569
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,720
What memory?

570
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,473
Thinking back,

571
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,435
you were always helpful

572
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,563
in helping me recover my memories.

573
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:46,235
Back then, I just thought
you were a good person.

574
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,575
But you just wanted to check.

575
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,577
Isn't that right?

576
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,663
I don't know who I am.

577
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,043
But you do, don't you?

578
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:05,796
So tell me.

579
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,805
Who you are isn't important.

580
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,225
So don't bother Hae-sook
with this nonsense.

581
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,443
Why did you save me on the subway
if you were going to be like this?

582
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,864
I was happy back then.

583
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,825
When I didn't remember anything…

584
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,244
When I was sitting here next to you…

585
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,626
If I could,

586
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,004
I'd like to be oblivious once again.

587
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,154
I guess someone found a key.

588
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:13,906
Everyone!

589
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:18,661
Finally, the first key finder
has appeared!

590
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:23,707
Could this really be the winning key?

591
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,667
Let's open it.

592
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,759
Congratulations!

593
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:38,931
Our first finalist for the final contest
has been selected.

594
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:42,101
But there's no need to be disappointed.

595
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:46,647
Because there are still
five keys remaining!

596
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,569
How did you manage to find the key?

597
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,530
Could you share your secret
with our other contestants?

598
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,700
Well, I just…

599
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,328
I let go of my greed,
and that's when I spotted the key.

600
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,705
I see.

601
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,748
Did you hear that?
Let go of your greed and…

602
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,670
I've already let go of my greed.

603
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,926
I don't feel any desire anymore,
not even for the lottery.

604
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,053
Really?

605
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,389
Then should we head back to the church?

606
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,182
Sure.

607
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,866
Oh dear, my house key fell in.

608
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,660
It's the only key I have.

609
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,663
How am I supposed
to get into my house now?

610
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,541
Mountain Spirit.

611
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,752
I don't need a golden key

612
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,504
-or a silver one--
-There are no mountain spirits in Heaven.

613
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,549
Shouldn't you get your key?

614
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,718
Why would there be house keys in Heaven?

615
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,559
Well, I just…

616
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,520
-I searched earnestly…
-And then I saw it.

617
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,772
With an earnest heart…

618
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,690
I wished for it, and it appeared.

619
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,445
Gosh, there's only one left now.

620
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,270
It's so cold!

621
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,021
It's suddenly pouring!

622
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,398
-You're drenched.
-You're soaked.

623
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,441
No, I'm okay.

624
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,154
-It's a rainbow.
-You're right.

625
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,949
Get under here.

626
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,367
-What?
-You're getting wet.

627
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,162
A bit lower.

628
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,831
-Like this?
-No.

629
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,666
Like this?

630
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,003
More. Come down.

631
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:57,963
Eye level. Okay.

632
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:40,547
I know that whoever I meet
reflects who I am.

633
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:45,093
Everything that made me angry
or stirred my desires

634
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,388
was Your gift to awaken me.

635
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,224
-Mom.
-I…

636
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,352
-Now, I've let go…
-…don't have any children.

637
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,979
…of everything I ever wanted.

638
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:01,527
I know that tolerance is the way
to perceive others' perfection

639
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,655
even if my own may go unrecognized.

640
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,449
So, in this holy moment,

641
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,535
I earnestly pray for her.

642
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,829
Temptation is not Your will.

643
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,165
So lead us not into temptation.

644
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,543
Let us receive

645
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,128
only what You've given us.

646
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,297
Amen.

647
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,472
LOTTERY FESTIVAL
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

648
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,475
What was that?

649
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,855
Goodness, a key.

650
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,566
Pastor, it's a key.

651
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,483
Seriously?

652
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,194
You are truly incredible!

653
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,239
How did you do it?

654
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,575
Well, I just…

655
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,159
I just prayed sincerely…

656
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,088
This is the invitation, you see.

657
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:06,091
So six people gather for a contest,

658
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,760
and Heaven-dwellers
come and give their votes.

659
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,471
Ultimately, the final winner
appears in a dream

660
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,141
and reveals the lottery numbers.

661
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,020
I guess you have to tell
your personal story at the contest.

662
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,356
They say the more tragic your story,
the more votes you get.

663
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,358
And who am I?

664
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,402
I'm the queen of tragedies.

665
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,988
You can't bring up tragedy
and leave me out.

666
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,327
What is it? Is something going on?

667
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:34,953
What?

668
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:36,913
No.

669
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:38,957
I was just thinking…

670
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,004
I played a part
in giving you a tragic life.

671
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:45,922
That's all.

672
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,634
Not at all.

673
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,846
But I…

674
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,640
I'm so nervous!

675
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,308
What should I do?

676
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,145
Do you think I can do well?

677
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,147
It'll be broadcast on TV too.

678
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,157
Oh my. What happened to you?

679
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,579
Where in the world have you been?

680
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,207
Were you looking for your memories again?

681
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,253
Looking for memories
will be the death of you.

682
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:26,713
Did you eat?

683
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,049
Go wash up.

684
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,801
Have a bite before you sleep.

685
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,637
You can't sleep on an empty stomach.

686
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,733
You can't hurt me

687
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,444
while Ms. Lee is around.

688
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,701
Because she shouldn't know what I know.

689
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:57,994
Right?

690
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,677
I'm heading out.

691
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,679
Honey.

692
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:16,638
Honey.

693
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,058
-Are you sure I don't need to tag along?
-Yes.

694
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,728
Seeing you there
will make me even more nervous.

695
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,313
It's game over if I mess up.

696
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,691
I prepared a lot, so don't worry.

697
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,861
Just watch me from home and root for me.

698
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,405
All right. Break a leg.

699
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:34,322
-Okay?
-Okay.

700
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,240
You can do it.

701
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,491
I can do it.

702
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,133
LOTTERY FESTIVAL
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

703
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,136
LOTTERY FESTIVAL

704
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,138
Okay.

705
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,905
Be ready and stand by.

706
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,616
-Camera one, ready.
-Audio's on standby.

707
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,703
What? Oh, no.

708
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,371
Please sit down.

709
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,956
Continue what you were doing.

710
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,546
The president is here.

711
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,631
Everyone, get ready.

712
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,424
Going live in ten seconds.

713
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,092
Is the host ready?

714
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:40,514
Let's start
with the audience clapping. Go!

715
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:48,855
The 319th Lottery Festival!

716
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:52,609
LOTTERY FESTIVAL IS FINALLY BACK

717
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:56,780
I'm Sim Mok-min,
your host for the final contest.

718
00:51:56,863 --> 00:52:00,492
The final contest
will be in a storytelling format.

719
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:04,746
Each candidate
will present their personal story.

720
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:09,167
If you empathize with their story
or want to send them to the dream,

721
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,461
just press the OK button

722
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,756
on your remote control.

723
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,174
As for our viewers,

724
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,261
you can also press the OK button
on your TV remote.

725
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:22,180
Your votes will also be counted.

726
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:25,767
Who will be the lucky winner?

727
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,603

00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:33,608
LOTTERY FESTIVAL STARTS RIGHT NOW!

729
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,069
Here is our first key holder.

730
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,738
Let's listen to his story.

731
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,449
My life…

732
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:43,910
was full of misfortune.

733
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,579
THE FIRST KEY HOLDER
KIM DO-HYEON

734
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,415
It was during the '70s
during the Middle East construction boom.

735
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:51,501
My father was working in the Middle East,

736
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,086
and he got seriously injured.

737
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,923
Then my mother had an affair and left us.

738
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:01,928
Devastated by the shock,
my dad started drinking every day.

739
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,264
My younger sibling and I

740
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,141
lived in a rundown house

741
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,977
while enduring his drunken rages

742
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,104
and violence.

743
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,355
But eventually…

744
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,985
I ran away from home too.

745
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,573
My younger sibling stayed behind
and endured it all alone.

746
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,993
I'd like to give this lottery ticket

747
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,455
to my sibling
whom I failed to protect until the end.

748
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,752
HEARTFELT TEARS FROM THE FIRST KEY HOLDER
AND THE SCORE SHOOTS UP

749
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,921
Sir, I'm so sorry to hear that.

750
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,797
But may I ask you one question?

751
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,759
Did your family own that house?

752
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:42,427
Sorry?

753
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,889
Yes, we did.

754
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,057
And the location?

755
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,475
Pangyo.

756
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,726
Before the development?

757
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,606
Yes.

758
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,192
That is all.

759
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,987
Okay, the voting will close
in three seconds.

760
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,990
Three, two, one!

761
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,241
Closed!

762
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:10,038
The first contestant's final score
is 65 points.

763
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:13,375
Now, let's move on to the next contestant
and hear her story.

764
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,001
I've always lived

765
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,129
a lonely life.

766
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,718
So I always

767
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,221
opened the window like this

768
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:30,100
and waited for my parents,
not knowing when they would come.

769
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:33,311
I was just getting through each day.

770
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,396
One second.

771
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:38,274
How did you open the window just now?

772
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,695
Did you slide it open like this?

773
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,989
Or was it like this?

774
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,157
Like this.

775
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,661
That's the kind of window
very rich people own.

776
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,498
Well…

777
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,291
I really miss my dog

778
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,294
that I parted ways with back then.

779
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,047
What sound did your dog make
when it barked?

780
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,132
Well…

781
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,384
Like this.

782
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,804
Judging by the sound, was it a Doberman?

783
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,889
Yes.

784
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:14,644
Then did your doorbell sound like this?

785
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:15,979
That's right.

786
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,231
It sounds like a rich person's doorbell.

787
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,233
That is all.

788
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:24,029
SCORE REVEAL OF THE THIRD KEY HOLDER!

789
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,242
WHAT'S THE STORY OF THE FOURTH KEY HOLDER?

790
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,579
As for me…

791
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,334
I'll withdraw.

792
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,253
Why?

793
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:41,254
As for me,

794
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,841
I don't care if I win the lottery or not.

795
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,634
Sorry?

796
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,304
Then why did you come on the show?

797
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,348
I came here thinking
that if I spoke on TV,

798
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:54,809
my husband

799
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,271
might be able to hear me.

800
00:55:58,354 --> 00:55:59,355
I see.

801
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,650
Does that mean
your husband is still alive--

802
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,278
He's probably in Hell.

803
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,867
Park Cheol-jin.

804
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,702
That's his name.

805
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,623
Once I know for sure
that my wife made it to Heaven,

806
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,000
I'll go back to Hell.

807
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,587
I can't believe this.

808
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,507
It seemed like this was the only way

809
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,136
to tell my beloved husband
how I truly feel.

810
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:34,724
That's why
I searched earnestly for the key.

811
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,437
Where should I look when I talk?

812
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,774
Anywhere is fine.

813
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:51,699
Well…

814
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:53,701
Honey.

815
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,204
It's me, Young-sun.

816
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,083
You must be in so much pain.

817
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,088
I know you came here to see me,

818
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,757
but we couldn't even meet.

819
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,176
I was so sad and sorry.

820
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,138
You see…

821
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,558
I don't resent you for your decision.

822
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,228
I know you did it all for me.

823
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,481
Even though I became like a child

824
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:29,446
and even forgot you,
you treated me like a princess every day.

825
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,740
If there was a place with a nice view,

826
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,454
you'd take me there
no matter where it was.

827
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,874
If you'll have me,

828
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,169
I'd like to be your wife again.

829
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,714
Let's…

830
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:49,757
meet again.

831
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,135
And…

832
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,304
I'll treat you like my prince

833
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,514
and take care of you.

834
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,688
All right.

835
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,608
Let's begin the voting.

836
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:12,113
SCORE RISING FAST

837
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,294
Ninety-nine points!

838
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,795
That's the highest score!

839
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,007
I really don't need the lottery money.

840
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:32,884
I really mean it.

841
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,385
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

842
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:38,181
She doesn't need the lottery,
so shouldn't we just leave her out?

843
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:42,977
However, our viewers already voted
for the fifth contestant.

844
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:46,272
So shouldn't we keep her in the game
to make it fair?

845
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,482
Yes.

846
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:51,819
Okay, here's the last contestant
who'll challenge the 99 points!

847
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:53,905
I challenge her.

848
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,490
Great.

849
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,292
What's that?

850
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,421
I reflected on my life all night.

851
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,757
And then,

852
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,884
I expressed it through these drawings.

853
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:18,304
Let's unfold

854
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,099
my tragic life together.

855
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:34,904
I lost my parents when I was young
and was raised by my grandmother.

856
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:40,368
My grandmother told me
that my mother drowned in a reservoir.

857
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:46,833
But still,
I waited by the reservoir every night.

858
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:50,128
Because that little girl
wanted to see her mom one more time

859
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,297
even if she was a ghost.

860
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,844
However,

861
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,014
it turned out my mother wasn't dead.

862
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,600
She had abandoned me.

863
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,936
My goodness, how tragic is that?
Don't you agree?

864
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,442
If that was all,
I wouldn't have even started.

865
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:16,988
That mother who abandoned me
was actually my foster mother.

866
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:19,616
My birth mother
was actually none other than

867
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,535
the mistress my father had brought home.

868
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,663
My foster mother had raised me

869
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:29,334
after my father died
while on a trip with my birth mother.

870
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,419
Isn't that just unbelievable?

871
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,797
Are you finished?

872
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,049
No.

873
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,676
There's one more thing I prepared.

874
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,472
I'd like to send a video message
to my husband

875
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:46,059
who kept me strong
throughout my tragic life.

876
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,102
Sorry? Out of the blue?

877
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,228
Yes.

878
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,189
I'll read my letter out of the blue.

879
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:55,443
"Honey."

880
01:00:56,277 --> 01:01:00,156
"I thought we'd be happy forever
after we got married."

881
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,743
"But after the accident,

882
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:07,330
you were suddenly bedridden
for the rest of your life."

883
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:11,167
"I, a delicate flower, had to find a job."

884
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,294
"So I took up a dangerous one.
A loan shark."

885
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,213
"You know what they are, don't you?"

886
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,466
"They lend money
and collect interest every day."

887
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:23,805
"Anyone who's lent money probably knows
how hard it is to get that money back."

888
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:28,017
"Having kimchi juice or fish heads

889
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,061
dumped on me was just routine."

890
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:35,191
"I even got hit with raw kelp,
and they're 3 meters long."

891
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,404
"I'll end the letter here.
From your wife in Heaven."

892
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:42,657
Okay, it looks like she's done.
Shall we count down?

893
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,159
Three, two,

894
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,703
-one--
-One moment.

895
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:01,426
You're an incredible artist, Eun-ho.

896
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,636
Who's this?

897
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,679
Dad.

898
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:05,847
What's his name?

899
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,473
Ko Nak-joon.

900
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,058
Well done!

901
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:11,811
Who's this?

902
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,354
Ko Eun-ho.

903
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:18,025
Who do you take after to be so smart?

904
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,445
Then…

905
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,363
who's this?

906
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,073
Mom.

907
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:35,042
I finally understand everything.

908
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,461
You and I

909
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:38,629
were lovers

910
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,466
although no one acknowledged us.

911
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:45,928
I felt wronged and wondered
what I'd done to deserve Hell.

912
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,056
But I finally get it now.

913
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,560
You were probably bored of me.

914
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,522
So you probably wanted
to go back to your family.

915
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,900
Did you want to get rid of me
because I got in the way?

916
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,743
Did you try to kill me
because I was too clingy?

917
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:14,081
Say something, please!

918
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,761
Okay.

919
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:30,181
I'm afraid
we can't give you a lot of time.

920
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:33,100
Let's hear a quick final word from you.

921
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:38,648
-I'm sleepy.
-I'm falling asleep.

922
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,068
Then…

923
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:43,736
Five years old.

924
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,824
What were you doing when you were five?

925
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:49,784
Well…

926
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:54,121
We probably ate, slept, and played.

927
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,457
Because five-year-olds are still young.

928
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,875
You will now hear

929
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,336
something utterly unimaginable

930
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:04,257
about the life of a five-year-old child.

931
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,676
Pastor.

932
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,761
Please stand up.

933
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:16,686
Do they know each other?

934
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:17,854
Stand up.

935
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:23,943
-It's not her story?
-It's someone else's.

936
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,196
Let's go back to the winter

937
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,117
when you were five.

938
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,705
You should've been in a warm room,

939
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:40,042
eating your mom's steamed sweet potatoes.

940
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,336
Instead, what were you doing?

941
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:50,303
I was shivering in the cold.

942
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,931
I was alone and abandoned.

943
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,896
My last memory as a five-year-old

944
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,023
wasn't my mother's arms.

945
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,192
It was the cold street.

946
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:10,990
That's the very last memory I have.

947
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,244
What caused that child the most pain?

948
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,164
Was it the cold?

949
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:20,458
Was it the fear?

950
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:22,001
No.

951
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:24,503
It was my faith.

952
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:27,965
I truly believed

953
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:32,470
that my mom would find me
even if it took a while.

954
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:37,016
That boy was cold, alone, and dying.

955
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,937
To keep his promise to his mother,
who told him to wait in front of a church,

956
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:44,231
he has become a pastor in Heaven

957
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,401
and still waits for her.

958
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,366
That is

959
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,327
a truly heartbreaking story.

960
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,495
But…

961
01:05:57,578 --> 01:06:01,123
what does this story have to do with you?

962
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,292
I am here today

963
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,880
to condemn that woman, his mother.

964
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,806
That child still waited for his mother

965
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,141
even as he lost consciousness
on that cold street.

966
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:23,354
That coldhearted woman cruelly betrayed

967
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,564
that boy's faith.

968
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:30,027
She was a callous mother
who erased her son from her memory

969
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,824
before his photo even had time to fade.

970
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:39,453
Lee Hae-sook.

971
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:41,914
Guilty.

972
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:10,026
I'm sorry.

973
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,111
My son.

974
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:18,826
Mom…

975
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:20,536
Mom…

976
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:23,122
Mom…

977
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,505
The highest score!

978
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,467
She got a perfect score of 100 points!

979
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,386
Ms. Lee Hae-sook is the winner!

980
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,764
Mom…

981
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,183
What's your mom's name?

982
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:45,478
My mom is Lee Hae-sook.

983
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,147
What?

984
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,941
My mom is Lee Hae-sook.

985
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,528
What did you just say?

986
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:57,114
Lee Hae-sook. That's my mom.

987
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,116
It's Hae-sook.

988
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:04,580
Eun-ho…

989
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,251
is Hae-sook's and my son.

990
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,478
Isn't that a lie?

991
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,854
Totally.

992
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,981
We got her winking on camera.

993
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:32,775
So what now?

994
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:36,487
She lied, so she should be disqualified.

995
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:37,988
Mr. Sim.

996
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,574
Ms. Lee Young-sun, the fifth contestant,
is the winner.

997
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:42,118
Just proceed.

998
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:45,246
Sorry?

999
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,915
But she lied. Should we still continue?

1000
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:49,250
Lied?

1001
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:51,502
Is lying permitted in Heaven?

1002
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:53,921
Right.

1003
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,507
Are you saying that wasn't a lie?

1004
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:57,675
Of course not.

1005
01:08:58,592 --> 01:08:59,844
Those two

1006
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:02,263
are telling the truth.

1007
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,150
Are you okay?

1008
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,611
I was terrified we'd get caught.

1009
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:19,655
Exactly.

1010
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,658
Why did you lie
if you don't have the guts for it?

1011
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:28,414
Does that mean those tears were fake too?

1012
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:30,875
No.

1013
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,668
My eyes filled with tears

1014
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:35,588
because your story
was just so heartbreaking.

1015
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:39,466
Should I take you home?

1016
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,552
No, I should go to church.

1017
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:43,262
Why the church?

1018
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:46,682
I lied, so I need to repent.

1019
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:48,142
I see.

1020
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:51,478
I don't know if praying
will grant you the forgiveness you want.

1021
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:54,899
You should also pray
and ask for forgiveness.

1022
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:57,193
You're an accomplice.

1023
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:58,861
Why am I an accomplice?

1024
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:01,197
You stayed silent.

1025
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,907
That implies consent.

1026
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,119
Let's pray hard.

1027
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:18,422
Pastor.

1028
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:19,924
My legs are shaking.

1029
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:22,635
Could you hold my hand?

1030
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:23,552
Sure.

1031
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:29,058
By the way, how are you such a good liar?

1032
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:30,768
You almost had me fooled.

1033
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:35,606
I've got a knack for it, don't I?
I finally found my talent at 80.

1034
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,193
Good grief. Congratulations.

1035
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:11,892
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

1036
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:15,104
But why can't she remember her own son?

1037
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:19,400
Just the thought of him makes me tear up
and my heart aches.

1038
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:21,026
Did you even love me?

1039
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,320
And if I do? Will you leave?

1040
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:24,405
Reincarnation?

1041
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:27,825
I kind of want to live a normal life
like everyone else.

1042
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:29,368
You made the right decision.

1043
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:32,371
I'm going to walk you home.
For the last time.

1044
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,832
Sounds good. For the last time.

1045
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:37,418
I just want to be by your side
forever, Nak-joon.

1046
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:40,546
Three of us won't work.
It has to be only two.

1047
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,589
I caused this.

1048
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:43,799
Let me take care of it.

1049
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:46,343
-There is nothing you can do.
-No.

1050
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:49,722
No! Hae-sook!

1051
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:51,932
Hae-sook!

1052
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:58,230
