1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,966
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

2
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,432
Is it true

3
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,143
that any sin

4
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,940
can be forgiven if I pray?

5
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,152
Well…

6
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,363
Yes. If you pray sincerely,

7
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,700
you'll be given a chance at forgiveness.

8
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:17,952
Pastor.

9
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,664
I think

10
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,335
I might have sinned.

11
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,881
Ms. Lee, I moved the flower pots outside

12
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,591
and watered them.

13
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,179
This is cucumber salad, Mr. Ko's favorite.

14
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,680
Did you two finally make up?

15
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,933
I like cucumber salad too. It's for me.

16
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,850
I see.

17
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,522
Mr. Ko, come eat.
There's cucumber salad too.

18
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,651
No thanks.

19
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,452
You and your mother can live together
if that's what you want.

20
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,080
-I can't live with her.
-Have a good day.

21
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,916
Go get your rice. Let's have breakfast.

22
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:05,834
Okay.

23
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,335
By the way,

24
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,879
-your mother-in-law--
-Don't ever mention her.

25
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,674
I swear I'll choke on anything I eat.

26
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:13,716
Okay.

27
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,094
It's not even about his mother anymore.

28
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,930
Look at the way he's acting.
He's behaving like a child.

29
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,684
Do you remember how he'd refuse to eat
whenever he got even slightly upset?

30
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,603
He was sick back then,

31
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,273
so I coaxed him
into eating at least a spoonful.

32
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,191
But I'm done now.

33
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,110
Forget it if he's not hungry.

34
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,239
Shouldn't you leave some for Som-i?

35
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,657
She said she's not hungry.

36
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,301
Som-i.

37
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:57,927
Som-i!

38
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,155
What's going on with me?

39
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,216
You startled me.

40
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,886
Hello.

41
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,847
Remember that white puppy?

42
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,517
His name was Mandu.
He's been reincarnated. Isn't that great?

43
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,938
You never know
what you have until it's gone.

44
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,357
Aren't you sad that he's gone?

45
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,818
No. We barely knew each other.

46
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,948
You seem to get easily attached
even if it hasn't been a while.

47
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,325
You got it all wrong--

48
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,494
No, I didn't.
You were like that with me too.

49
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,037
I…

50
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:07,956
Never mind.

51
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,667
What's the point of winning
an argument with you?

52
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,961
You know it's a losing battle.

53
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:17,298
I'm not the competitive type,
unlike someone I know.

54
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,133
Is that so?

55
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:23,346
Whoever walks in front is a genius

56
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,766
Whoever walks behind is a fool

57
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,018
What are you doing? You're so childish.

58
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,770
Okay, I'm the genius.

59
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,359
Okay. There's one word
you always hear in the Bible.

60
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,319
That word is "love."

61
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,488
Sister Hae-sook.

62
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,449
You should always strive to love others.

63
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,120
Start with those closest to you
like your family or your husband--

64
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,706
I can't do it by myself.
He needs to reciprocate.

65
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,001
Are you upset about something?

66
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,003
No, continue.

67
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,130
Okay.

68
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,717
Specifically, Ephesians, Chapter 5 says,

69
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,970
"As the church submits to Christ,

70
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,514
so also should wives submit

71
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,765
-to their husbands--"
-Geez.

72
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,270
-Did you two have a fight?
-No, we didn't.

73
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,691
If you don't like this sermon,
I can just move up the next sermon topic.

74
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,527
No, it's fine. Don't mind me.

75
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,363
But you're making me mind.

76
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,199
All right. I'll keep quiet from now on.

77
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,118
You can just continue.

78
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,578
Really? Should I continue?

79
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,121
Yes, please do.

80
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,293
-"So also should wives submit--"
-"Husbands,

81
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,587
listen carefully to your wives

82
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,048
and don't make them repeat themselves."

83
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,507
Does the Bible say that?

84
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,052
Why did you two fight?

85
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,429
I told you we didn't fight.

86
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,557
I won't ask again.
Did you really not fight?

87
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,646
You're really testing a churchgoer,
aren't you?

88
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:02,361
A grown man should graciously give in

89
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,489
if his wife hands over an olive branch.

90
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,282
Instead, he's sulking.

91
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:10,453
-I guess he must've been pretty upset.
-Do you think I'm not upset?

92
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,583
Geez. It's not like
we're going to split up now.

93
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,585
Why not try to smooth things over?

94
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,962
There's a scripture that says,

95
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,756
"If anyone slaps you on the right cheek--"

96
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,424
"Strike them back on their left."

97
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,384
Don't be so ridiculous.

98
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,178
"Turn to them the other cheek as well."

99
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:32,642
It means that
retaliating won't solve anything.

100
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,352
It's the same with marital fights.

101
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,814
How do you know that
when you're a bachelor?

102
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,484
Then why did you bring it up
in the first place?

103
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,694
Then why did you ask about it
in the first place?

104
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,114
Me? I'm the one who asked?

105
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,406
Oh, dear.

106
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,951
All this talking by myself
is drying up my throat.

107
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,746
You could've at least offered me
something to drink while listening.

108
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:55,998
Geez.

109
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,875
Goodness.

110
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,466
This fridge is still just as empty.

111
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,468
Sweet rice drink.

112
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,435
Did you just leave this
sitting here since that day?

113
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,478
Sorry?

114
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,273
What? Did it go bad?

115
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,279
Not just bad. It's turned into alcohol.

116
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,448
It's made from fermented rice.

117
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,950
Ferment it longer,
and you'll get rice wine.

118
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,871
Do you have an empty bottle somewhere?

119
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,997
An empty bottle?

120
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,914
Yes.

121
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,332
Here.

122
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,585
-Will this do?
-Perfect.

123
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,672
My husband loves rice wine,
so I want to take some home.

124
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,048
I thought you two fought.

125
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,218
You're right.

126
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,929
I forgot and almost brought some home.

127
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,018
How about you bring some home
and try to reconcile?

128
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,269
Why should I?

129
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,688
I've done all I can.

130
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,028
Let's just drink it ourselves.

131
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:07,987
Us?

132
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,365
Are you telling a pastor to drink?

133
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,160
You're still a child. You shouldn't drink.

134
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,621
I'm not a child. I'm all grown up.

135
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,122
You're still a child.

136
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,125
All men are big kids.

137
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,339
I see. No wonder they fought.

138
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,218
PHONE BOOTH

139
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,308
Som-i.

140
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,886
I went back there today
and waited for a bit.

141
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,264
But he never came.

142
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,102
I should've at least asked
for his name that day

143
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,436
had I known this would happen.

144
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,648
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,775
I'm sure I startled you quite a bit.

146
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,780
Is he the guy

147
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,784
you were angry at before?

148
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,583
Do you remember anything else?

149
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:45,960
No.

150
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,673
That's why it's even more frustrating.

151
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,178
Would you consider it evil?

152
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,975
Who knows?
You can't tell what kind of person he is

153
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,728
just by his appearance.

154
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,939
No. I was talking about myself.

155
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,528
Do you think I was evil in the past?

156
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,121
That's exactly why
you need to regain your memory.

157
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,750
I know it'll be hard and painful.

158
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,004
If there's anything I can do to help…

159
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,257
I'll do it.

160
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,178
I should've said this sooner.

161
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,056
Thank you

162
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,808
for rescuing me from going to Hell.

163
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,899
Also…

164
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,110
If someday I suddenly disappear,

165
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,739
please don't look for me.

166
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,451
What?

167
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:05,289
Maybe I chose to go there
after regaining my memory.

168
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,377
So if that happens,
I'd rather you not try to rescue me again.

169
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,755
Please.

170
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,301
Sure.

171
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,977
Yes, he wanted to live
with me again in Heaven.

172
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,854
I should be the bigger person.

173
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:33,734
At least I can vent
to Young-ae and the pastor.

174
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,862
He has no one to confide in…

175
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,908
He talks. He talks plenty.

176
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,536
I'm the only one he's not talking to.

177
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,162
You're right.

178
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,041
You're coming home together.

179
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,919
We ran into each other at the park.

180
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,505
I see. You must be hungry.
Did you have dinner?

181
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,007
-I ate already.
-With your mother?

182
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:03,139
No, I just thought it'd be nice
if you spent time with your mother.

183
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,224
I know that's not what you meant.

184
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,811
Are you still angry?

185
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,944
How long will you keep this up?

186
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,906
Fine, I'll prepare some food
and invite your mother over--

187
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,158
You don't have to.

188
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,410
What's the problem?

189
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,245
I won't ask you to treat her well

190
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,039
or invite you over to her place,
so please…

191
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,834
Let's just drop it.

192
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,879
Why? Did she tell you to say that?

193
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,339
Isn't this what you wanted?

194
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,800
Fine. Thanks.

195
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,970
I just commented once
that she made me uncomfortable.

196
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,472
And now, you've decided

197
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,017
to let me never see her again.
I'm so grateful.

198
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,394
Then what exactly was I supposed to do?

199
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,521
No, you did very well.

200
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,900
Like you said, let's drop it.
This is enough.

201
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,743
When I was young,

202
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,620
I swore I'd never get married.

203
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,040
I didn't want to fight all the time
like my parents did.

204
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,585
But I started reconsidering
after meeting Ms. Lee and Mr. Ko.

205
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,880
I thought I could have
a loving relationship like them.

206
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,259
Darn it. But now, I don't know anymore.

207
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,607
You turned me
into the worst daughter-in-law.

208
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,568
Fine, do as you please.

209
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,696
I'm done.

210
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:44,949
Geez.

211
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,379
Gosh, it's freezing.
Why is it so cold in here?

212
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,905
You left your watch in the bathroom.

213
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,283
Right. Thank you.

214
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,369
Are you going to tag along today?

215
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,829
Yes, I will.

216
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,330
Okay.

217
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,666
Have a good day.

218
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,752
See you later.

219
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,565
Honestly, if he loves his mom that much,

220
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,443
he might as well
ask her to do his laundry.

221
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,903
I'm not doing it.

222
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,123
He thinks his clothes
magically stay fresh and clean.

223
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,918
He has no idea
how much effort I put into it.

224
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,256
Just see. I bet he forgot

225
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,551
his watch or handkerchief
since I didn't pick up after him.

226
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,720
Actually, I saw Som-i
giving it to him earlier.

227
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,722
Must be nice to be Nak-joon.

228
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,266
He's surrounded by people
who take care of him.

229
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,604
Come to think of it,
those two seem a lot closer than before.

230
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,440
Who cares? Let them do whatever they want.

231
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,859
Darn it.

232
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,070
He and I used to be closer.

233
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,382
It's okay.

234
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,969
They're my colleagues.

235
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,804
They're good people.

236
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,474
I see.

237
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,522
I have a question.

238
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,651
Since I don't have a watch like you,

239
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,778
I couldn't touch clovers

240
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,572
or anything else like that
in the human world.

241
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,408
That's right.

242
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,161
Then how was I able

243
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,539
to choke that man?

244
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,673
Maybe your emotion was just that powerful.

245
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,720
Maybe it was too intense to control.

246
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,763
Maybe that was why.

247
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,678
What?

248
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,472
I…

249
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,224
I grabbed this.

250
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:01,955
Som-i.

251
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:04,792
Som-i?

252
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,712
You see,

253
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,173
the watch affects anyone
I come in contact with…

254
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,487
Did you know?

255
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,782
In the old days, people would
even perform rituals when brewing alcohol.

256
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,992
They believed impurities
would ruin the batch.

257
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,497
But since this was brewed
inside a sacred church,

258
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,748
it turned out perfectly.

259
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,795
Well, that's strange logic,
but I'm glad it turned out well.

260
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,507
Be honest.
Did you try it while I was gone?

261
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,509
What are you insinuating?

262
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,386
I'm a pastor, you know?

263
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,471
Even back in the day,

264
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,808
the kids
who secretly ate the leftover mash

265
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,894
were always the quiet ones like you.

266
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,605
If you didn't taste it, then that's good.

267
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,982
-I'll be honest.
-Yes?

268
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,569
I was really curious about the taste.

269
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,987
But I held myself back.

270
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,322
Would you like to try some?

271
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,449
I told you I can't.

272
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,285
I told you it's okay.

273
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,380
That's a lot of rice wine.
Are you sure you won't get drunk?

274
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,175
Both kids and adults can have
this yeast bread.

275
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,137
All the alcohol
evaporates during steaming.

276
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,139
Let me see how strong the alcohol is.

277
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,725
-Pour me a cup.
-Okay.

278
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,394
Here.

279
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,280
I can't tell. Pour me a bit more.

280
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,948
-A bit more?
-Yes.

281
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,033
Okay.

282
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,415
A little more.

283
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,125
-More?
-Yes.

284
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,710
But…

285
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,338
More.

286
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,215
-Why are you--
-More.

287
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,799
Why are you tasting so much?

288
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,183
-This feels nice.
-What?

289
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,227
Just a little bit more.

290
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,394
-Are you drunk?
-Gosh.

291
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,399
Usually, you'd leave it in a warm spot

292
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,860
for about six hours.

293
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:41,365
But placing it in warm water like that

294
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,368
makes me want to climb in there myself.

295
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,869
It looks so cozy.

296
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,957
You're drunk.
You tasted it one too many times.

297
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,043
Who's drunk? Not me.

298
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,838
-Goodness.
-Are you going to sleep?

299
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:02,135
Who said I'm sleeping?
I'm just resting until it rises properly.

300
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,137
Sister Hae-sook.

301
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,015
Hold on.
What should I do with this if you sleep?

302
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:07,933
I…

303
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,688
How am I supposed to know
if it's risen enough…

304
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,575
That startled me.

305
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,460
When I suddenly touched that baby,

306
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,214
I felt something hard to describe.

307
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,342
It was a kind of sadness.

308
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,723
It felt like my heart was being shattered.

309
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,310
I know it's hard,

310
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,063
but all we can do for now is explore

311
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,025
your memories and emotions.

312
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,571
I'm sorry for all this trouble.

313
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,828
I've seen countless souls
getting off at Hell Station

314
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,623
during my many work trips.

315
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,962
But you're the first person
I actually grabbed onto.

316
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,966
I wonder why I did that.

317
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,179
I'm still not entirely sure.

318
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,808
But maybe I had my own reasons
just like those feelings of yours

319
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,895
that you've yet to comprehend.

320
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,272
That's how I feel.

321
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,281
Let's go.

322
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,754
My heart really feels like Hell right now.

323
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,631
It's in Hell.

324
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:20,732
The class has been canceled,
and you can't just enter--

325
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,318
What are you doing…

326
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,045
No, wait…

327
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,343
What are you doing--

328
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,913
What in the world are you doing?

329
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,665
Flirting.

330
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:22,335
They say men get hooked on women
who are really good at a certain thing.

331
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,171
I'm trying to get you hooked on me.

332
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,007
I could just hang you on a hook.

333
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,971
Do you think you don't hurt my pride?

334
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:40,228
I never felt this way on Earth.

335
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,981
I have never

336
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,610
truly liked someone with all my heart.

337
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,945
Because whenever I liked someone,

338
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,199
they'd always leave me behind.

339
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,870
My dad, Mr. Ko, and even Ms. Lee.

340
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,497
But,

341
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,499
with you,

342
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,502
I want to let my guard down
and fall for you.

343
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,463
Because I know

344
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,382
that you're not going anywhere.

345
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:15,513
Young-ae doesn't want to be alone anymore.

346
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,891
I'll just erase you.

347
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,851
Damn it.

348
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,815
-Ma'am--
-Please. Just address me casually.

349
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,442
Why bother with formalities?

350
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,904
I'll call you, "Sweetie." Sweetie.

351
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,073
What was that?

352
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,491
That just rolled off my tongue.

353
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,408
Sweetie?

354
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:36,868
-Sweetie.
-No.

355
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,787
I'll just keep it awkward between us.

356
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,372
-Sweetie.
-Let's keep things awkward!

357
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,539
I like us better awkward!

358
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,166
-Stop it!
-Sweetie.

359
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,502
-Please stop!
-Sweetie.

360
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,510
Are you doing an experiment?

361
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,096
Why do you keep poking it?

362
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,849
I can't tell just by looking.

363
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,982
Did she spike the drink or something?

364
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,025
How could she fall asleep so fast?

365
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,403
Hold on.

366
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,584
What's going on?

367
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,881
Oh, no, is the bread all burnt? Oh, dear.

368
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,218
It's hot.

369
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,060
Another second,
and it would've turned into charcoal.

370
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,190
Pastor?

371
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,193
Where did he go? I told him to keep watch.

372
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,615
What? What's that sound?

373
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,127
Gosh, I knew this would happen.

374
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,670
Good grief.

375
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:14,591
Just how much rice wine did you drink?

376
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,508
Sister Hae-sook.

377
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:20,597
It feels like I'm floating.

378
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,433
I'm in such a great mood.

379
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,062
It feels like I'm in Heaven.

380
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,564
What do you mean? You are in Heaven.

381
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,193
Go back inside
before you become the talk of the town.

382
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,903
Why?

383
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,447
I've never felt this good before.

384
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,908
Let go of me!

385
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:46,456
Gosh, how am I supposed to catch him?

386
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,333
Pastor!

387
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,378
Everyone is going to see you!

388
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,009
A bicycle!

389
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,221
I've always wanted to ride one.

390
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,222
Bicycle!

391
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,937
Yes, a bicycle!

392
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,442
Yes, I'm riding a bicycle!

393
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,613
That's not a bicycle.

394
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,198
That's enough.

395
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,575
Keep at it, and you'll really regret it.

396
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,494
Sister Hae-sook, do you see me?

397
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,081
Do you see me riding this bicycle?

398
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,332
Sister Hae-sook?

399
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,167
Yes, I see you.

400
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,294
What am I going to do with you?

401
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,839
Aren't I pretty good?

402
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,340
It's my first time riding.

403
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,801
But I'm really good, aren't I?

404
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,097
No one ever taught me.

405
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,727
I never had anyone who could teach me.

406
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,730
But aren't I really good?

407
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,857
Aren't I good, Sister Hae-sook?

408
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,608
Yes, you are.

409
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,194
You're great at riding it.

410
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,114
Aren't I really fast?

411
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,576
You're a pro.

412
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,994
You really are.

413
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,871
Come here.

414
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,289
Sit behind me. I'll--

415
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,291
No thanks. Good grief.

416
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,168
Why not?

417
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,627
Get on this bicycle,

418
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,588
and let's go have some temple food.

419
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,300
I heard temple food is really delicious.

420
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,261
I'm the only one who hasn't tried it!

421
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,179
It's so unfair!

422
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,973
What if someone sees you like this?

423
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,683
Sister Hae-sook, hurry.

424
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:33,354
Hop on it,
and let's go have some temple food.

425
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,481
Come on.

426
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,066
Fine then.

427
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,237
All right.

428
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,614
I'm on it.

429
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,407
Give me your hand.

430
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,618
Hold on tight to my waist.

431
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:50,497
-Okay.
-I'm going to go at the speed of light.

432
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:53,958
All right!

433
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,044
Slow down.

434
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,504
You'll crash if you go too fast.

435
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:02,425
Ring, ring, coming through

436
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,593
Sister Hae-sook.

437
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,678
Sing with me.

438
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,597
-We have to sing together.
-Okay.

439
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,225
Ready? Begin.

440
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:15,021
-Ring, ring, coming through
-Ring, ring, coming through

441
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,440
-The bicycle is passing
-The bicycle is passing

442
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,737
He didn't exactly drink alcohol.

443
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,948
You see… You know yeast bread, don't you?

444
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,199
The one baked with rice wine.

445
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,201
-It's a type of bread.
-Right.

446
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,162
That's why he had some rice wine at home.

447
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,748
Pastor, please try to sober up.

448
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,920
You see, he never drank alcohol before.
He's a good-hearted person.

449
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,964
You know that, don't you?

450
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,843
He hasn't caused much trouble
besides singing loudly.

451
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,719
Just fill out this simple report…

452
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,388
-A report?
-…and we'll let you go.

453
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,390
-A report…
-Here you go.

454
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,933
I don't know how to fill this out.

455
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,435
Where do I even start?

456
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,896
The sweet rice drink.

457
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,439
No, hold on.

458
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,525
-I'll be going now. Goodbye.
-First…

459
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,442
Goodbye.

460
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,611
-What?
-Honey! Perfect timing!

461
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,612
Come here quickly.

462
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,364
What on earth are you doing here

463
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,657
-at this hour?
-Gosh.

464
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,076
After our fight,
I met up with the pastor and…

465
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,870
Right. We fought, didn't we?

466
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,497
Right, we weren't speaking to each other.

467
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,667
Temple food is delicious. I'm telling you.

468
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,628
Hey.

469
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,173
You two fought.

470
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,803
I forgive you for your sins.

471
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,394
We'll keep him here safe and sound.

472
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,063
Once he sobers up, we'll send him home.

473
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,233
Nak-joon, why don't you
escort your wife home?

474
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,401
What?

475
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,862
It seems like they both drank.

476
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,739
I see.

477
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,740
Thank you.

478
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,536
I forgive you for your sin as well.

479
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,418
I didn't notice
in all the chaos back there.

480
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,629
But the alcohol is hitting me now.

481
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,135
I can't believe this is Heaven.

482
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,970
The path is slanted.

483
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,056
I'm walking straight, but… Look at this.

484
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,974
-It's slanted.
-Oh, dear.

485
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,727
How much did you drink? Good grief.

486
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,197
Drink this.

487
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,158
I didn't know you could drink.

488
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,743
I couldn't.

489
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,119
But?

490
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,663
I would have if I'd had any.

491
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,206
Really?

492
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,710
Then how come
I've never seen you drink before?

493
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,590
How could I have managed
to get through all those years sober?

494
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,635
On some days,

495
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,804
I'd go out to collect debts.

496
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:57,642
Then I'd end up all covered
in fish guts and scales from the market.

497
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,895
Some of those days,

498
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,190
the smell wouldn't leave
no matter how much I washed.

499
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:08,528
It was as if that woman's curses
had seeped into my skin.

500
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,739
I'd lie down, and I'd reek of fish so bad

501
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,033
that I couldn't even sleep.

502
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,581
Remember how I'd go to the rooftop
to get pickles for every meal?

503
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:26,963
Did you know that I had a plum wine jar
next to the pickles?

504
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,217
I'd drink some while getting
some pickles if I was upset.

505
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,471
I'd drink some more while getting
chili paste if I was still upset.

506
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,142
Of course you never noticed.

507
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,270
You should've asked me
to at least accompany you

508
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,688
instead of drinking alone.

509
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,982
Guess when I first got that plum wine jar.

510
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,819
When we lived with my mom?

511
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,738
Correct.

512
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,909
She'd always give me
the fish heads at every meal.

513
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:01,706
You'd give me yours,
and she'd give them back to you.

514
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,542
So one day,

515
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,171
I snatched up
and ate the torso during a meal.

516
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:10,965
And then?

517
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,969
She asked if
that was how my parents raised me.

518
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,599
She knew perfectly well
that I didn't have any parents.

519
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,643
If it were now,

520
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,105
I'd have snapped back and said,

521
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,441
"My parents never gave me fish heads."

522
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,819
But at that time,

523
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,530
her words hurt me so much.

524
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,952
I felt like an outsider.

525
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,052
My poor wife.

526
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,930
I'm such a jerk.

527
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,766
I'm the worst.

528
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,319
Wait.

529
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,320
That…

530
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,988
Stop tasting it before it's done.

531
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,323
Hold on.

532
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,659
Geez, you got your spit all in there.

533
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,578
By the way, shouldn't hangover soup
have alcohol in it?

534
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:26,165
-You trying to get her even more drunk?
-Should I ask her about it?

535
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,001
You might as well
have her cook it herself.

536
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:32,713
Ms. Lee, you're up.

537
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,424
You should sleep a bit more.
We're not done yet.

538
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,176
Honey, how are you feeling?

539
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,344
What are you cooking?

540
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,139
Mr. Ko wanted to make
some hangover soup for you.

541
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,684
But none of us ever made it before.

542
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,524
Two rounds of hangover soup,
and this whole kitchen will be wiped out.

543
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,194
What is this? A swimming pool?

544
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,197
-You could drown in here.
-I told you we added too much water!

545
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,283
Then we can just add more ingredients.

546
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,242
Move aside.

547
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,624
Good grief.

548
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,799
I've been thinking.

549
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:20,928
Gosh, barely sober
and already thinking. You're the best.

550
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,680
It's about your mother.

551
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,723
Honey.

552
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,850
Don't worry about her anymore.

553
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,935
-Can you just let me finish?
-All right.

554
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:33,024
I can't promise
I'll take care of her forever.

555
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,483
But I want to give it a try.

556
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,403
We've lived together once before,

557
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,781
so I'm sure
I'll handle it better this time around.

558
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,327
You know what? My mom said
she wouldn't be coming here anymore.

559
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,620
-So don't worry.
-Why not?

560
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,330
What did you say to her?

561
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,706
I didn't say anything.

562
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,292
She told me so the last time she visited.

563
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,087
She said she just wanted us to be happy
and told me not to worry about her.

564
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,882
That day?
The day I came home late from church?

565
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,592
Yes, that must've been the day.

566
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,844
So did you just let her leave?

567
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,597
She told me to just go home,
so what else could I do?

568
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,598
Unbelievable!

569
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,227
Yes, this is it.

570
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,145
My wife's signature slap.

571
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,439
What dishes does your mother like?

572
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,192
It's been so long I can't remember.

573
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,070
I shouldn't go empty-handed.
What should I do?

574
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,696
You're going to visit her?

575
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,866
I owe her a proper apology.
It's the right thing to do.

576
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,702
Do you know what your mother likes?

577
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,165
My mom… What does she like again?

578
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,333
I think

579
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,919
she likes all kinds of dishes.

580
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,839
Geez, what kind of son doesn't even know
his mother's favorite dishes?

581
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,222
Her house must be somewhere around here.

582
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,232
I'll use it well. Thank you.

583
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,149
Sure thing.

584
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,907
FOR FREE

585
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,367
Mother.

586
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,332
What's all this?

587
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,793
So you can talk.

588
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,379
I guess I'm not seeing things.

589
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,810
Why are you giving away
all your belongings?

590
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,729
Are you replacing everything?

591
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,564
Are you worried?

592
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,815
What?

593
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:41,068
Are you worried I'm packing up
to move into your place?

594
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,988
Gosh, that's not why. I just--

595
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,614
You must be so relieved.

596
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,826
I signed up for reincarnation.

597
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,786
Reincarnation?

598
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,371
As in you're being reborn?

599
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,167
But why so suddenly?

600
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:00,129
They asked if I wanted to do it,
so I said yes.

601
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,213
So now I'm doing it.

602
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:06,635
You could've at least told us beforehand.

603
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,556
What about Nak-joon?

604
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,266
Does he know about this?

605
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,644
All he cares about is his wife anyway.

606
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,065
I don't want to trouble him.
I'll leave quietly.

607
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,859
I'm sorry, Mother.

608
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,986
I had no idea.

609
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,246
Could you please wait here?

610
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,956
The president will see you shortly.

611
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,792
Okay. By the way,

612
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:42,421
do you know why
he suddenly wants to see me?

613
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:46,717
I was just told he wanted to talk to you
once you woke up.

614
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,843
I see.

615
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,512
Could it be

616
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,973
because of the mistake I made yesterday?

617
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,642
I'm afraid I have no idea.

618
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,894
Okay. Please wait a minute.

619
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:01,857
Excuse me, ma'am.

620
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,610
Did you book an appointment
with the president?

621
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,697
I'm not someone who needs
to book an appointment to see him.

622
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,449
What does that mean?

623
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:15,454
Let's just say there's quite a lot
between us for me to open up to you.

624
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,165
Yes, there seems to be quite a lot indeed.

625
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,875
Why is the door locked?

626
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,378
If the president finds out--

627
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,504
He had ordered it.

628
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,881
He was the one who locked it.

629
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,592
He wouldn't do that.

630
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,263
Please check again.
This must be a mistake.

631
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,014
You should keep the door open.

632
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,933
All right, I'll ask.

633
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:36,851
Good.

634
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,565
It's about Ms. Lee Young-ae.
Is she allowed to enter?

635
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,860
Is that so?

636
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,698
I see. I'll do that right away.

637
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,742
Oh, my.

638
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,161
Ms. Lee.

639
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,454
I'm terribly sorry.

640
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,664
There was indeed a mistake.

641
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,374
I told you.

642
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,334
I told you we're close.

643
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,045
Could you please follow me?

644
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,131
Where to?

645
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,091
One minute.

646
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,428
Right here.

647
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,930
The president asked you to stand here.

648
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,265
-Here?
-Yes.

649
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,519
What is this?

650
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,021
Did he prepare a surprise?

651
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,614
What is this?

652
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,908
Let me out of here.

653
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,284
Ms. Lee.

654
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,287
You weren't supposed
to get past the entrance,

655
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,580
but we missed it.

656
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,748
Gosh, look…

657
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:41,707
Let me out!

658
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,792
-I'm not a bird!
-This way, please.

659
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,253
Let me out!

660
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,297
Let me out now!

661
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,924
Mr. President!

662
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,300
I'm Young-ae--

663
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,641
Heaven seems a lot more interesting
than before, don't you think?

664
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,602
Yes, I guess so.

665
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,230
As far as I know,

666
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:08,192
many of these changes happened
thanks to Ms. Lee Hae-sook.

667
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,112
You see, I personally think
change is a good thing.

668
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,615
Anything stagnant eventually rots.

669
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:20,496
It seems like you're experiencing
quite a few changes yourself.

670
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,830
Am I right?

671
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,000
Well…

672
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,168
Yes, well…

673
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,045
I suppose you're right.

674
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,506
Are you happy?

675
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:32,716
Pardon?

676
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,762
I'm curious if you're happy
spending time with her.

677
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,059
Well, I'm…

678
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,020
I'm not sure if "happy" is the right word.

679
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,566
But it's definitely fun.

680
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,696
We do things I've never done before

681
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,740
and eat dishes I've never eaten before.

682
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,038
The things we do are things
I wouldn't have done by myself.

683
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:09,295
My world revolved entirely
around the church, but it's now expanding.

684
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,800
And do those things scare or bother you?

685
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,052
No.

686
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,388
Actually, I look forward to them.

687
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,309
I anticipate what we'll do together
the next time she comes.

688
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,311
So you're happy then.

689
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,313
Right…

690
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,441
If that's what happiness is…

691
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,277
Then yes. I guess I'm happy.

692
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:39,033
As I recall,
you said you didn't want to be happy

693
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,286
back when you first arrived here.

694
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,246
Do you remember?

695
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,124
Right…

696
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:52,838
You said once you've tasted happiness,
everything afterward becomes harder.

697
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:56,717
Right.

698
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:25,663
Jjujju.

699
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,166
Is that your name?

700
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:31,794
Oh, my.

701
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,633
Have you been waiting here all this time
for your owner who went to the hospital?

702
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,135
Your owner

703
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,847
is waiting for you up there right now.

704
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:47,810
She thinks it'd be better
if you joined her up there.

705
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:48,727
What do you say?

706
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,522
Would you like to meet her?

707
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:56,735
You would?

708
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:58,987
Okay, then hold on.

709
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,158
This won't hurt a bit.

710
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,285
Don't be scared.

711
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,496
One moment.

712
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,789
Done.

713
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:09,957
Jjujju.

714
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,252
Go say hi to your owner.

715
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:14,962
Okay?

716
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,132
Gosh, you've been through a lot.

717
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,071
I hope you find
what you're looking for as well

718
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,866
and become happy.

719
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:45,909
I'll help you.

720
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,290
First, we need to get your memory back.

721
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,210
I can even touch things
like this now, thanks to you.

722
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,380
Who knows? Maybe I'll be helpful.

723
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,645
I'm sorry. I thought I saw something.
Are you okay?

724
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:15,522
Yes.

725
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,550
What's that? A ring?

726
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,427
Yes.

727
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,970
It's a ring.

728
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,972
Did you remember something?

729
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,433
No.

730
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,852
I don't think so.

731
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,564
But I seem to have muscle memory.

732
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,084
What is this?

733
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,586
A gift.

734
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:48,615
How are you feeling?

735
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,243
I'm fine.

736
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,746
I didn't know you had that side to you.

737
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,582
What side?

738
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,250
You were a total pro.

739
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,294
I had no idea
you were such a good cyclist.

740
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,588
Oh, right.

741
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,885
I'm really sorry. It's my fault.

742
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,139
That's okay.

743
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,312
Are you upset with me about something?

744
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,023
No, I'm not.

745
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,858
If you are, please tell me.

746
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,612
No, really. I'm not.

747
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,406
You are upset.

748
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,867
Well, I'd be upset if I were you too.

749
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,370
I shouldn't have meddled,
making rice wine and all that.

750
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,290
All I did was embarrass you.

751
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:40,834
I'm sorry.

752
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,337
Okay.

753
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,924
Well, I'll be leaving now.

754
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:51,178
I just stopped by
to pick up the leftover rice wine.

755
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,346
Get some rest.

756
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,014
Okay.

757
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,673
I steamed it again,
so eat it while it's still warm.

758
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,841
Don't worry. This won't get you drunk.

759
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,684
I still remember
that winter night in front of the church.

760
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,104
I remember
the coldness of feeling abandoned.

761
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,069
Her warmth is overwhelming.

762
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,864
And that scares me even more.

763
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:02,791
We're home.

764
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:03,875
Welcome back.

765
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,669
Why are you out here?

766
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,546
I have something to tell you.

767
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,172
Som-i, go inside first.

768
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,507
Okay.

769
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,638
Did I

770
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,516
mess up again?

771
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,644
You haven't heard, have you?

772
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,362
What's wrong?

773
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,655
Are they arguing again?

774
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:35,991
No.

775
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,993
Then what are you staring at?

776
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,057
How could she make
such an important decision

777
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,226
without discussing it with me?

778
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,936
It makes no sense.

779
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:09,649
She passed away quite young, remember?

780
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:14,029
So of course,
she'd want to reincarnate even more.

781
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,701
Think about it from her perspective.

782
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,144
Will water do?

783
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,952
Here. Fresh rice wine, your favorite.

784
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,331
Where did you get this?

785
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,792
Where else? I made it.

786
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,419
I had actually wanted
to give it to you a few days ago.

787
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,589
It looks like
it found its rightful owner after all.

788
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,983
Have a drink first.
I'll whip up something to eat.

789
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:38,905
Here.

790
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,369
Let her go with a good heart.

791
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:48,707
I know I should.

792
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,003
We may feel sad,

793
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,589
but she might find
greater happiness there.

794
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:57,716
Gosh.

795
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:01,219
She's about to have a new life,
so why does it feel like she's dying?

796
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,930
They say real love

797
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,142
isn't about what you do for someone.

798
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:11,771
It's about doing something
that they want together.

799
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:13,857
I know.

800
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,906
I'm really glad you're here with me.

801
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,159
Cheers.

802
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,708
Marriage is a lot like this wine.

803
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:36,087
It doesn't spoil or change with time.

804
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,257
It matures.

805
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:40,967
Just like this wine.

806
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,599
Gosh, even I feel troubled.

807
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,727
I can't imagine how you must be feeling.

808
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,583
Sweetie.

809
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,253
Just call me by my first name.

810
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,582
Is it true…

811
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,378
that any sin

812
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,424
can be forgiven if I pray?

813
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,260
Well…

814
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,470
Yes.

815
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,556
If you pray sincerely,

816
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:13,268
you'll be given a chance at forgiveness.

817
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,398
If I may ask,

818
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,735
what kind of sin is it?

819
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,237
Pastor.

820
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,490
I think

821
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,327
I might have sinned.

822
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,040
What kind of…

823
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,836
I've developed feelings…

824
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,884
for someone I shouldn't.

825
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,435
Where did you go at this early hour?

826
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,397
Oh, nowhere.

827
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,492
It looks like a ring.

828
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,203
What a waste of a pretty thing.

829
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,210
Are you ready?

830
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,131
Let's go then.

831
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,408
Gosh, you look gorgeous.

832
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,662
I sure gave birth to a handsome boy.

833
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,332
You're still handsome
even with ash on your face.

834
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,380
You look beautiful.

835
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,133
You look more beautiful today than ever.

836
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,844
Reincarnation sure is nice.

837
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,971
My daughter-in-law
is saying things she'd never say.

838
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:16,141
Just take it nicely.
Do you have to be sarcastic?

839
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,976
That's just how I've always lived.

840
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,063
I'm sorry.

841
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,943
I'm afraid I'll start bawling
if I don't act this way.

842
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,737
I'll want to live with you two.

843
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:31,739
Scary, right?

844
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,241
Not at all.

845
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:46,629
Let's go.

846
00:57:56,681 --> 00:58:00,143
Do you all remember
your first time arriving here?

847
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,686
GUIDE TO THE REBIRTH SYSTEM

848
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:05,732
I said Heaven was just
a stepping stone to what's next.

849
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:09,694
Now that you're qualified
for reincarnation,

850
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:13,364
you're finally ready
to move on to the next step.

851
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,993
Once we complete the procedures,

852
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:20,914
you'll exit through the door
and head to the Gate of Rebirth.

853
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:25,168
If you change your mind along the way or…

854
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,421
if you miss me,
you're welcome to come back.

855
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,508
I'm just kidding.

856
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,427
All right. Has everyone chosen
their next life

857
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,138
from the pamphlet you've received?

858
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,015
-Yes.
-Yes.

859
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:41,893
Yes?

860
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:46,981
Why are the available choices
different for each person?

861
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,567
Yes, excellent question.

862
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,737
Life on Earth

863
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,950
is governed entirely by the law of fate.

864
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,744
This law goes beyond our previous life.

865
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:05,333
It affects all the previous lives
we've lived until now.

866
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,337
Through countless lifetimes,

867
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,422
the law of fate guides you

868
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:15,218
to confront your accumulated karma.

869
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,347
Whether that karma be good or bad.

870
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,058
Ultimately,

871
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,477
in order to erase your karma…

872
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,104
No, let me rephrase that.

873
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,898
In order to purify your soul,

874
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,901
you must continue being reborn.

875
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,989
So how could your choices be identical

876
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,700
when the law of fate differs for everyone?

877
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,869
Each of you must experience your own share

878
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,290
for purification to be complete.

879
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:57,468
Excuse me, sir.

880
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,137
We already explained this.

881
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:03,474
You can only select from the lives
listed in your pamphlet.

882
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:04,392
Right.

883
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,104
But your first choice
is "Elon Musk's son,"

884
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:11,482
and the second, "Trump's son-in-law."
Those options aren't listed here.

885
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,694
You see, I just thought I'd give it a try.

886
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,698
-Can't you just make an exception?
-Well…

887
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,036
Also, this notes section
is a very crucial part for us

888
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,455
to verify details about you.

889
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:29,000
You wrote, "164 cm, 49 kg,
cat-like features, fair skin."

890
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,501
Why did you write this?

891
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,462
You see…

892
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,214
I never once dated in my life
and died single.

893
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:39,510
I really want to meet
my ideal type in the next life.

894
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,638
Please do this for me.

895
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:45,433
We can't cater
to everyone's personal requests.

896
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:47,268
I'm sorry, but please rewrite this.

897
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:51,314
You must choose from one of the lives
written in the pamphlet.

898
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:53,483
Otherwise, you can't reincarnate.

899
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,443
Okay.

900
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:56,527
Okay.

901
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,700
Next, Ms. Park Jong-gwi.

902
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,369
It's your turn.

903
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,414
-Stay here.
-Why? Let's go together.

904
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,083
Just stay put. I'll be quick.

905
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,544
Hello.

906
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,349
Is this correct?

907
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,434
Yes.

908
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,061
Well…

909
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,855
One moment, please.

910
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,157
What's going on?

911
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:45,493
I'm not sure. Hold on.

912
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,163
What's the issue?

913
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,873
-Never mind.
-What?

914
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,583
-Just wait over there.
-What's going on?

915
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,293
-Did you miswrite something?
-No.

916
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,045
-No--
-Hold on.

917
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,799
What are you doing?
You're driving me crazy.

918
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,136
Mom, I won't get upset.
Just reconsider this.

919
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,556
-There's nothing to reconsider.
-Please. You can't do this.

920
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,891
If you were me,

921
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,769
would you let me choose a life
this unhappy and miserable?

922
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,896
I told you. I have my reasons.

923
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,690
What reasons?

924
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:16,607
Excuse me.

925
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,985
Is there anything I can help with?

926
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,528
-Sir.
-Yes?

927
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:21,946
Please help me out here.

928
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:25,199
She keeps insisting on this absurd choice.

929
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,126
It would've been terrible

930
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,711
if I didn't know about this.

931
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:39,130
Right? You heard him.

932
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:44,594
You've made a truly brave
and noble decision, ma'am.

933
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,137
What?

934
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:47,972
But, sir…

935
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:51,726
But she chose such a difficult life.

936
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,563
If life were just a single round,

937
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,066
everyone would choose a comfortable life.

938
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,152
If not, it would feel unfair.

939
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:05,031
But life repeats itself again and again.

940
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:06,783
Do you know why?

941
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:11,704
To make sure everything balances out
and no one feels wronged?

942
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:13,873
Yes, you're right.

943
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,752
If you accumulate bad karma in one life,

944
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:21,464
you'll have to bear
the consequences in your next life.

945
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:26,052
And if you accumulate good karma,
you'll be rewarded with a life

946
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,930
that matches your good deeds.

947
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:34,393
You cleanse yourself of past wrongdoings

948
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,687
and build good karma
through countless lives.

949
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:40,316
That's the journey of reincarnation.

950
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,110
Then my mother…

951
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:48,324
Sometimes, certain karma requires
multiple lifetimes to resolve.

952
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:53,621
I'm just too impatient.

953
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,874
I want to settle everything in one go.

954
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:01,671
You must make
your own reincarnation choices.

955
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:06,217
Because the life you choose
is yours alone to bear.

956
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:08,970
Neither family nor loved ones

957
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,055
can share this burden.

958
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,476
Stop worrying, will you?

959
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,062
I know what I'm doing.

960
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:36,163
This damn thing tastes good,
but picking out the bones is such a pain.

961
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,041
You should eat them all.

962
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,376
You have it.

963
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,506
You couldn't enjoy your favorite fish
since you had to take care of him.

964
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,259
You're right. It is my favorite.

965
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,888
I should've cooked what you liked
instead of what he liked

966
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,347
whenever you visited.

967
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:58,519
You never cooked what you liked
since you were busy feeding him.

968
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:03,357
I should've treated you like this then.

969
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,111
Hae-sook.

970
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,406
I'm sorry.

971
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,329
I failed to understand you many times.

972
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:30,593
You went through so much.

973
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,263
Dealing with a pain in the ass like me.

974
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,516
I wasn't exactly
an easy daughter-in-law either.

975
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:42,521
We should've gotten along like this
on Earth too. Right?

976
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:48,569
Once you reincarnate, your past memories--

977
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,071
They'll disappear.

978
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:53,824
Isn't that a relief?

979
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,170
-I'll get going then.
-Bye!

980
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:18,891
Please stand
in front of this monitor if you're ready.

981
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:27,233
Ms. Park, please check the individuals
who were connected to your past lives.

982
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,277
Afterward, you can exit
through the door over there.

983
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:41,664
This is quite fascinating.

984
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:45,167
Compared to you and Nak-joon
who only met once

985
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:48,129
as teacher and student,

986
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:53,509
you and Hae-sook have met many more times.

987
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,012
Look.

988
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,889
You were close friends once.

989
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:02,601
You were also enemies on the battlefield.

990
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:06,355
Oh, and there's that too.

991
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:42,308
That mother-in-law
was you in your past life, Hae-sook.

992
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:46,353
Then was she my daughter-in-law?

993
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:51,942
If you want to know your past life,
just look at the world like a mirror.

994
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:55,613
Whoever torments you now

995
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:58,741
was actually yourself in a past life.

996
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,577
I like how simple it is.

997
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:03,287
Right?

998
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:10,461
Why are you crying?

999
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,963
I'm going to live well.

1000
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:14,840
Mom.

1001
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,512
You won't meet Dad again, will you?

1002
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:21,180
Who? Your dad?

1003
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,389
Yes.

1004
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,393
Don't meet someone like him again.

1005
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:29,355
Meet someone who's much better.

1006
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:33,109
I'll make sure that bastard
never gets near me again.

1007
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,114
Go on now.

1008
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,074
I won't be able
to reincarnate at this rate.

1009
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:42,576
Mom.

1010
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:44,662
Let me hug you.

1011
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,839
It doesn't matter what you'll look like.

1012
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,384
I'll always recognize you.

1013
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,096
So,

1014
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,765
focus on treating her well here.

1015
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,148
Gosh. Come here.

1016
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:20,698
They say daughters-in-law
and daughters are just the same.

1017
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,658
But that's just nonsense.

1018
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,244
But today,

1019
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,663
that's exactly how I feel.

1020
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:32,626
We must be kind to everyone.

1021
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:36,672
We must love everyone equally.

1022
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:39,925
Because,

1023
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:44,388
in our countless lifetimes,

1024
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:48,350
they could've been precious to us.

1025
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:53,022
Maybe once, they showed us kindness.

1026
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,107
Or maybe once,

1027
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,611
they were someone we once hurt.

1028
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,032
It's a relief

1029
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:08,621
that you can visit Earth
and check on how she's doing.

1030
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:10,789
But…

1031
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,629
I think I'd feel sad

1032
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,256
if I can recognize her,

1033
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:22,384
but she can't recognize me.

1034
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:24,220
What should I do?

1035
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,770
She said she'd recognize you.

1036
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:36,398
Come here.

1037
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:38,400
Why?

1038
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:41,528
You said you had to go
straight back to work.

1039
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,365
Are you going to cry down there?

1040
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:47,326
Just cry your heart out before you go.

1041
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:13,519
Look at this.

1042
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:17,773
There's always a mess if I don't
keep an eye on things for even a day.

1043
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:32,830
What's this?

1044
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:37,960
This is also a ring.

1045
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:40,045
I've seen this somewhere…

1046
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:56,895
Why does he have one too?

1047
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:13,620
Hey.

1048
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:18,250
-Aren't you that gentleman from last time?
-Yes, I am.

1049
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,127
Are you doing better now?

1050
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,212
Of course I am, thanks to you.

1051
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:27,009
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be here right now. Thank you.

1052
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:27,926
Not at all.

1053
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:29,470
By the way--

1054
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:32,890
You see, I've always been healthy.
I don't even have high blood pressure.

1055
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:36,477
But that day,
it felt like someone was choking me.

1056
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,062
Back in my heyday,

1057
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:39,605
I had excellent stamina

1058
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:43,359
and could chase down thieves for hours.

1059
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,194
Do you know what my nickname was?

1060
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:49,073
I was the Yeongdeungpo Great White Shark!

1061
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:50,824
Thieves?

1062
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:53,994
What was your occupation?

1063
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:57,539
I was a police officer.
In the Violent Crimes Unit, no less.

1064
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:02,086
Everyone in Yeongdeungpo knew
who I was 50 years ago.

1065
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:04,755
There wasn't a single person
who didn't know me.

1066
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,007
Som-i did that

1067
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:09,510
to a police officer?

1068
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:14,056
Excuse me,
but could you tell me your name?

1069
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:15,933
-Me?
-Yes.

1070
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:18,560
I'm the Yeongdeungpo Great White Shark,
Kang Jeong-gu!

1071
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:27,403
Are you Detective Kang Jeong-gu?

1072
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:29,988
Kang Jeong-gu.

1073
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,365
Kang Jeong-gu!

1074
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:45,003
The Hawaiian shirt.

1075
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:18,704
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

1076
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:21,415
What's the story
between you and that old man?

1077
01:14:21,498 --> 01:14:25,419
All I wanted to do was protect you
even if something happened to me.

1078
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:28,630
Something happened between
you and Mr. Ko, right?

1079
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,757
I'm warning you just in case.

1080
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:34,803
-He's off-limits.
-These silly little flower rings.

1081
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,890
It's not like they exchanged
wedding rings or anything.

1082
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,892
What's this? Why is my heart pounding?

1083
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,393
Please let me meet Young-ae.

1084
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,352
Young-ae!

1085
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:43,479
-Stop!
-It's Dad!

1086
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,647
How are you here?

1087
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:46,607
We can't…

1088
01:14:47,357 --> 01:14:50,777
stay like this forever, can we?

1089
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:53,113
I have something to tell you.

1090
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:02,414
