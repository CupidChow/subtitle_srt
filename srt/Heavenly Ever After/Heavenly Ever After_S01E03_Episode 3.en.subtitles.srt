1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,966
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

2
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,857
Welcome.

3
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:10,653
This is the final step
of your orientation.

4
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,864
Shall we?

5
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:19,537
SELF-REFLECTION ROOM

6
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,474
Honey, look at me.

7
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:41,893
Honey.

8
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,354
Honey.

9
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,774
Honey, I'm right here.

10
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,071
So what am I supposed to do here?

11
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,698
Nothing in particular, really.

12
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,369
This place is called
the Self-Reflection Room.

13
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,497
Everyone who comes to Heaven
must come here once.

14
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,751
I personally like to call it
the Room of Insight.

15
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,505
You'll reflect
on how you lived in the past

16
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,216
before you came here.

17
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,469
It's a chance to look back on your life.

18
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,722
You'll see whether you achieved
what you wanted,

19
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,391
if you were satisfied,

20
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,809
or if you had any regrets.

21
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:28,064
You'll also see
all your moments of joy and pain.

22
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,073
Okay. Are you ready?

23
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,741
Yes.

24
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,543
Hae-sook, did you hear?

25
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,003
Hear what?

26
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,508
They say a woman cries by the reservoir
on moonless nights.

27
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,429
It's true. My father saw her
when he was fishing the other night.

28
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,817
Mom.

29
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,820
-Hae-sook!
-Hae-sook!

30
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,155
Hae-sook!

31
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,240
Geez, Hae-sook!

32
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,118
What are you doing here?

33
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,913
I miss Mom.

34
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,707
What? Why would you look for her here?

35
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,792
You told me

36
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,254
that she went crazy
and drowned herself in the reservoir.

37
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,466
-You told me to stop looking for her.
-And?

38
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,593
Hee-ok told me

39
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,347
there's a ghost of a woman
who drowned here.

40
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,975
I think it might be Mom.

41
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,977
Mom.

42
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,022
Hey, come on out and try these on.

43
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,861
Gosh, Mr. Kang's daughter
has smaller feet than you.

44
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,114
You only need to wear them for a while,
so bear with it.

45
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,993
Besides, it's not a shame for a man
to have been married before.

46
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:09,123
I'm setting you up with a wealthy family
so you don't have to struggle. So do well.

47
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:16,839
Excuse me.

48
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,593
Excuse me!

49
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,639
Goodness.

50
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,351
I've been calling out to you.

51
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,979
Didn't you hear me shouting "excuse me"?

52
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,731
But that's not my name.

53
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,609
Then tell me your name
so I can call you properly.

54
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,116
You were born in the Year of the Dragon?
Dragons tend to be impatient.

55
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,867
I wasn't born in the Year of the Dragon.

56
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,953
I have plans, so I need to hurry.

57
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,413
Is that so?

58
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,541
Don't you have time for a cup of tea?

59
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,003
Why would I have tea with you?

60
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,170
Well…

61
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,299
Because I've fallen for you.

62
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,512
I'm on my way to a blind date.

63
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,472
I see.

64
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,143
You should definitely go. You must.

65
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,229
But let's make a bet
to make it interesting.

66
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,731
You don't have to do anything.

67
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,742
You take the bus, and I'll run.

68
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,578
If I get there first,
you have to spare me some time.

69
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,087
Right! Hold on!

70
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,964
Where is it taking place?

71
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,299
Namsan Cafe.

72
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,508
Namsan Cafe.

73
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,677
Namsan Cafe? Okay.

74
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,304
All aboard!

75
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:47,889
See you later!

76
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,239
NAMSAN CAFE

77
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,331
Let's skip the formalities.

78
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,542
I'd like to get married
as soon as possible.

79
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,419
Marriage isn't something grand anyway.

80
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,547
You just set an extra place at the table,
have kids, and that's marriage.

81
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,973
I'm so sorry.

82
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,644
The shopkeeper up there
gave me the wrong directions.

83
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,275
-Right.
-Who are you?

84
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,360
Hello, Father.

85
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,445
By the way,

86
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,614
I guess your blind date is running late.

87
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,491
Are you crazy?

88
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,617
I see.

89
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,035
Is this old man--

90
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,745
Wait, is he your date?

91
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,373
Sir.

92
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,876
I know we just met,
but can I ask you for a favor?

93
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,045
There's something
a man can never give up on.

94
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,463
No.

95
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,676
Men have a moment they'd regret forever

96
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,177
if they walked away from it.

97
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,097
For me, that moment is now.

98
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,269
Take my hand.

99
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,478
What are you doing?

100
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,689
Hold my hand.

101
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,609
Close your eyes just once,
and I'll take you to another world.

102
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,737
Trust me just this once.

103
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,790
Hey, you're home.

104
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,375
Geez, come over here.

105
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,210
Did you do the dishes?

106
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,421
Geez, your hands are freezing cold.

107
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,300
I told you to leave it
until I finish drawing.

108
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,302
This won't do. Come here.

109
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,347
Is this warm? Do you feel better now?

110
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,859
No!

111
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,157
This is a joke, right?

112
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,662
You're just messing with me now,
aren't you?

113
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,714
I'll just take your daughter.

114
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,716
-We'll be living together…
-I'm off to school.

115
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,384
I'm heading out!

116
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,637
-Give me back my money!
-You'll go to Heaven too.

117
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,305
But you're nice to me.

118
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,723
What a nasty old hag.

119
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,183
I don't need your money!

120
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,143
Everyone dies when they get old.

121
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:44,857
The 60 years of your life
are saddening and beautiful.

122
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,039
Okay. How was it?

123
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,085
I never realized that was how I lived.

124
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,297
It was my life, but I didn't even know.

125
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,842
I really worked hard.

126
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,427
Didn't I?

127
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,890
I lived so stubbornly hard.

128
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,768
That's why it hurts.

129
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,356
Everyone else says the same thing.

130
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,067
Within every happy memory,

131
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,405
we all hide the sad and painful ones.

132
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,367
If you don't heal properly,

133
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,954
those memories will continue to hurt you.

134
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,667
Okay, shall we move on to the next room?

135
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,923
This is the Healing Room.

136
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,469
We heal the wounds acquired
during your lifetime.

137
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,347
Over there, we offer massages

138
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,767
to release the blockages
that were created in your lifetime.

139
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:08,691
He seems to have
many unresolved issues in his heart.

140
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,281
She must've needed
more praise and comfort during her life.

141
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,119
This place provides

142
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,538
personalized healing for everyone.

143
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,083
For any wounds that haven't fully healed,

144
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,670
living here
and improving your lifestyle habits

145
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,255
will eventually heal them.

146
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,633
Improving my lifestyle habits?

147
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,926
But I dislike exercising.

148
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,012
Right.

149
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,724
You'll come to understand everything
while you're here.

150
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,686
I hope your body and mind
become healthy soon.

151
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,105
Yes, I hope so too.

152
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,483
Thank you, sir.

153
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,613
This concludes our orientation for Heaven.

154
00:10:56,113 --> 00:11:00,368
Those who have completed the orientation
can collect their souvenir before leaving.

155
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,999
They could've given something useful
like detergent or tissue instead of…

156
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,417
Ms. Lee Hae-sook.

157
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,676
Hold my hand.

158
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,681
Close your eyes just once,
and I'll take you to another world.

159
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,434
Trust me just this once.

160
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,649
Let's go.

161
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,532
So tell me.
How was your healing session, ma'am?

162
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,785
It was good. Really good.

163
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,869
I see.

164
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,018
They're arriving now.

165
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,271
Please begin
the cross-check registration process.

166
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:15,526
Please wait until your names are called,
then go out to greet your pets.

167
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,625
-Choco, Max, Coco, Byeoli.
-Coco, Choco.

168
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,545
-Dali, Byeoli…
-Ddoli.

169
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,047
-Kongi.
-Mungchi.

170
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,259
-Max.
-Santa, Cookie.

171
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,512
Please take extra care
with those that don't have names.

172
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,640
Maru is here.

173
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,436
Please go out to welcome Maru.

174
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,397
Bappuli is coming. Mongi too.

175
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,982
Their owners can head out now.

176
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,873
-Haha!
-Coco!

177
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,999
Ppomi, run to me!

178
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,250
Welcome!

179
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,336
Coco!

180
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,171
Coco!

181
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,591
Ppomi, I missed you so much.

182
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,009
Why did you come here so soon?

183
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,471
-I'm sorry I left you.
-Is your leg okay?

184
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,431
Are you here already
because you missed me?

185
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,688
They'll all be healthy and happy here.

186
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,774
Won't they?

187
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,858
Of course.

188
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,154
When the owners arrive first,
they wait for their pets.

189
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,200
If the pets arrive first,
they happily wait for their owners.

190
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,117
Right.

191
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,953
They all reunite eventually.

192
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,663
Just like us.

193
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,583
-Honey.
-Yes?

194
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,378
Everyone in Heaven

195
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,047
has the obligation to be happy.

196
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:04,009
I want you to be happy.

197
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,221
Not because you're with me.

198
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,391
I'd like you to find true happiness.

199
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,185
Okay?

200
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,646
-Let's go.
-Okay.

201
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,326
-Honey.
-Yes?

202
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,452
-There's something…
-Yes?

203
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,329
I've prepared for you.

204
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,582
Ta-da!

205
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,585
HAPPINESS BEGINS NOW!
TRUST ME! I LOVE YOU!

206
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,301
Are you Mr. Ko Nak-joon?

207
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,886
Yes, that's me.

208
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,138
Nak-joon!

209
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,015
What? Who…

210
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,101
-Is this what you prepared for me?
-No, hold on.

211
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,979
I came all this way thinking only of you.

212
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,355
-Excuse me. Hold on.
-Snap!

213
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,149
What was that sound?

214
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,359
That's the sound
of my last thread of sanity breaking!

215
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,485
Honey! Wait!

216
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,030
Honey! Wait!

217
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,323
-Honey!
-Ko Nak-joon!

218
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,782
Whose side are you on right now?

219
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,618
I'm not trying to take anyone's side--

220
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,703
Tell me! Are you on my side or hers?

221
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,746
What?

222
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,999
He wasn't on my side.

223
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,085
Is this what you meant about
finding true happiness without you?

224
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,796
Honey!

225
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,632
You little bastard!

226
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:28,636
Cut all that bullshit!

227
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,559
Let me explain.

228
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,521
My job entails riding the subway
between here and Earth.

229
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,106
You've been on it too.

230
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,693
The subway that decides
if you go to Hell or Heaven.

231
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,823
When I first started this job,

232
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,867
the seniors told me

233
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:57,790
to pretend not to see or hear anything
when I'm on the subway.

234
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,918
They told me
to never get involved in others' business.

235
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,419
But I couldn't help it.

236
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:07,216
I couldn't stop looking at her
and feeling concerned.

237
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,764
Our train has now arrived at Hell Station.

238
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,784
No!

239
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,120
No!

240
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:50,884
Do you get it now?

241
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,220
-Is the misunderstanding cleared up now?
-I see.

242
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,056
So that's how I got here.

243
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,975
No wonder.

244
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,979
Why is it

245
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,565
still so tense here?

246
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,401
This guy still doesn't know
what he did wrong.

247
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,740
No, I really get it now.

248
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,451
I was being nosy.

249
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,245
That's not even bad enough
to count as a mistake.

250
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,204
No?

251
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:25,836
If not that, then what did I do
to annoy you so much?

252
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,547
Nak-joon clearly said it himself.

253
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,675
"I couldn't stop looking at her
and feeling concerned."

254
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,510
Emphasis on "couldn't stop looking."

255
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,137
Emphasis on "feeling concerned."

256
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:39,725
Why? Was it because
she was young and pretty, unlike me?

257
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,895
Of course not. That's not why.

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,440
He's right. You're still beautiful
even as an old lady.

259
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,902
Look. Honey.

260
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,447
Focus on the word "beautiful."
Just focus on that word.

261
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,741
And why do you keep calling her
an old lady?

262
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,910
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,497
Madam.

264
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,674
I think I've come to the wrong place.

265
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,636
I should go now.

266
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,643
By the way, where should I go?

267
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:26,688
Go find your mother or your husband.

268
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,524
Go wherever you want. Just get lost.

269
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,360
I don't know their names.

270
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,695
I can't even remember my own name.

271
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,284
My mind went completely blank

272
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,287
from the moment I got off the subway.

273
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,674
It's as if nothing was ever there.

274
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,552
I don't remember anything.

275
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,847
The only thing I remember…

276
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,767
is the name you told me.

277
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:09,022
"Ko Nak-joon." That's all.

278
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:13,944
What kind of impression did you make
that she only remembers your name?

279
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,445
Come on, honey.

280
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,407
It's not my fault that she chose
to only remember my name.

281
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,409
Goodness.

282
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,582
-Geez.
-Yes?

283
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,880
Gosh, it's getting late.

284
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,674
And this seems like a long conversation.

285
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,011
How about we get some sleep
and continue this in the morning?

286
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,181
Not only has she lost her memory,
but she's completely clueless.

287
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,273
This house was built
for just my wife and me,

288
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,649
so we don't have much.

289
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,776
I'll bring you some bedding.

290
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,196
Thank you.

291
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,114
I'm sorry.

292
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,409
You got scolded because of me.

293
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,495
Scolded? Me?

294
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,041
I see.

295
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,293
I suppose it might look that way.

296
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,586
You see,

297
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,131
domestic peace is often built
on someone's sacrifice.

298
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,801
Can't you see that?

299
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,429
That's exactly how it seems.

300
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,099
Wait. You don't believe me, do you?

301
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,435
I'm not the type who's scared of my wife.

302
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,603
I work out, you know?

303
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,814
Look at the thickness of my neck.
Check out my chest.

304
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:37,402
I bet my wife is really worried right now
that I might get upset with her.

305
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,657
Rest up.

306
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,575
Thank you.

307
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,245
Gosh.

308
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,588
You know what I'm about to say, don't you?

309
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,799
Of course.

310
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,260
Should we go talk over there?

311
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,470
I can't help but think
that you're too kind.

312
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,728
What was I about to say?

313
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,525
What? Can you not even guess?

314
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:21,113
Well… Whatever it is,
you're going to get angry.

315
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,532
Well, at least you know that much.

316
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,700
But, honey,

317
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,327
is this really something
to get so upset about?

318
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,539
Are you picking a fight with me now?

319
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,707
-Is that it?
-No.

320
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,792
Not at all. I was just--

321
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,835
You don't understand--

322
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:38,714
Exactly which part of what I said
made you think I was picking a fight?

323
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,048
That's not what I meant at all.

324
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,634
I just asked because I didn't know
what I was doing wrong.

325
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,971
It was a question. "Is it really
something to get so upset about?"

326
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,472
I raised my tone at the end.

327
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,683
Stop playing and make her leave.

328
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,101
I won't repeat myself.

329
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,104
Sure. Just wait one minute.

330
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,981
Let me get your bed ready.

331
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,069
Hae-sook needs the Healing Room.

332
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,946
-Shut it!
-Okay.

333
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,663
Even Hae-sook didn't know

334
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,542
if she was angry because her husband
cared for another woman

335
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,129
or because that woman
was young and pretty, unlike her.

336
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,297
Be quiet.

337
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,007
Before coming here,

338
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,551
Hae-sook had thought
she could be happy even in Hell

339
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,346
as long as she was with her husband.

340
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,473
But because of some mysterious woman,

341
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,058
everything fell apart…

342
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:57,167
We've prepared some comforting ASMR
for your deep sleep.

343
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,960
Today's ASMR

344
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,005
starts with the real-time sound
of boiling brimstone fire

345
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,550
and includes the fluttering sounds
of grade 4 angel wings.

346
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,761
We've also included something brand-new.

347
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,847
It's the sound of grape berries
swaying in the breeze.

348
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,307
We hope you enjoy it.

349
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,311
Now, we'll play the sound
of grade 4 angel wings

350
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,979
-fluttering.
-Gosh.

351
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,066
-Did the TV wake you up?
-For the restless, sweet dreams…

352
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,611
Have you seen this before?

353
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,490
I couldn't fall asleep,
so I was flipping channels and found this.

354
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,908
Watching it for a while

355
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,410
actually made me sleepy.

356
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:38,041
By the way, why can't you sleep?

357
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,128
-Do you suffer from insomnia?
-Sure.

358
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,214
Would you like to sleep soundly
instead of me?

359
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,590
-Forever?
-Well…

360
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,926
Sleep well, madam.

361
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,601
Hae-sook was never
jealous or envious in her life.

362
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,230
She finds this unfamiliar side of herself
completely strange.

363
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,859
THE SOUND YOU HEAR
IS BOILING BRIMSTONE FIRE

364
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,240
This is the 319th Lottery Festival!

365
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,951
Who will appear
in their descendant's dream

366
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:17,247
and reveal
the six winning lottery numbers?

367
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,540
They have lotteries here too?

368
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,126
We encourage everyone to participate.

369
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,095
KO NAK-JOON
LEE HAE-SOOK

370
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,322
Gosh, honey.

371
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,283
Why don't we do it together later?

372
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,022
Hae-sook… What?

373
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,774
I'm screwed.

374
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,276
What? Why is there a video on this?

375
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,412
Honey! Wait!

376
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,416
Honey!

377
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,128
Cut all that bullshit!

378
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,338
This is me.

379
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,468
Honey.

380
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,763
This is a hard task.
I'll do it when I come back.

381
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,810
You know what these are, don't you?

382
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:02,727
Hey.

383
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,688
Those are grape berries.

384
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,982
I've never seen them in real life.
They look so pretty.

385
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,110
They fall from the sky
when you do something bad in Heaven.

386
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,737
Hold on. This means
there's a grape board somewhere.

387
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,698
There it is! There's the collection board!

388
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,492
You stick these on
like those coupons at the supermarket.

389
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,202
Once there's a full cluster, you…

390
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,914
go to Hell.

391
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,293
Guess whose these are.

392
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,713
They're mine.

393
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,922
And I already have four.

394
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,926
Thanks to someone, I'll be getting
a tour of Hell soon enough.

395
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,804
Sure, everyone thinks
they have a good husband.

396
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:41,349
But at best, they get a trip
to Switzerland or a Japanese hot spring.

397
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,476
Who gets to visit Hell? Don't you agree?

398
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,274
Why do they only have
six berries instead of ten?

399
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,902
Six actually looks better aesthetically.

400
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,489
You're right.

401
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,451
Just two more, and I'm off to Hell.

402
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,245
How great is that?

403
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,542
I've been thinking about it.
I should have a name.

404
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,961
I've already thought of one.

405
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,171
What is it?

406
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,797
Grape.

407
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,923
Grape?

408
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,677
That's so pretty. Thank you.

409
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,722
Cheerful and crazy.

410
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,639
That little…

411
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,099
Honey! Don't!

412
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,434
The grape berries!

413
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,269
Get more, and you'll go to Hell.

414
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:30,273
Then please get rid of her for my sake.

415
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,441
All right.

416
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,818
Just trust me.

417
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,332
Why did you bring the umbrella?

418
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,834
It's going to rain soon.

419
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,087
What?

420
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,218
Don't worry. You can use my umbrella too.

421
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,979
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

422
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:16,361
SCANNING

423
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,823
PREPARING

424
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:20,949
YOUR ORDER IS READY

425
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,035
ENJOY YOUR MEAL!

426
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,249
Don't go anywhere and stay right here.

427
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,000
I'll go inside and check.

428
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,502
Okay.

429
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,466
Oh dear.

430
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,385
He left you behind.

431
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,644
You've been abandoned too.

432
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,440
Your owner just dumped you here.

433
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,816
He's right.

434
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,903
Humans never tell you
when they're abandoning you.

435
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,530
Never ever.

436
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,657
They even give you food
you've never had before.

437
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,575
Right.

438
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,868
And then they never come back.

439
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,287
That's why humans are evil.

440
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,873
Wait a second.

441
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,920
Hey, this one smells different.

442
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,714
I don't think she's one of us.

443
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,925
She doesn't have that Heaven smell
that humans here have.

444
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,343
Hey, do you have a stuffy nose?

445
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,845
What breed are you?

446
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,264
Can't you tell just by looking at her?

447
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,183
She's a Chihuahua.

448
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,728
Are you short-haired or long-haired?

449
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,188
What's that?

450
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,647
Hey.

451
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,566
If you don't know,
then you're short-haired.

452
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,692
A short-haired Chihuahua.

453
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,278
I've seen plenty like you.

454
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,739
Am I a Chihuahua, not a human?

455
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,408
Come on.

456
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,994
Getting abandoned
must've traumatized you big time.

457
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,499
Do you want to take a whiff
of this savory smell?

458
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,209
Go ahead, here.

459
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,503
Humans completely lose their minds
when they smell this

460
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,962
because it's so good.

461
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,964
-Geez.
-They go crazy.

462
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,759
-She's not a human.
-Oh, is she not?

463
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,637
Do you want to come with us?

464
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,223
He told me to wait here.

465
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,850
Hey, he's not coming.

466
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,644
He's not coming back. Okay?

467
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,439
They also said they'd come back for me,
so I waited for years.

468
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,398
But they never came.

469
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,027
So what will you do?
Are you coming with us?

470
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,824
You should take a break.

471
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,826
I should've bought you coffee instead

472
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,286
especially after you went down
to Earth for my sake.

473
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,121
Come on. We're not strangers.

474
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,333
By the way,

475
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,963
you must have a well-organized database
of the residents.

476
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,632
Of course. Why do you ask?

477
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,385
There's someone I'm curious about.

478
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,719
-Really?
-Yes.

479
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,637
What's their name?

480
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,055
Her name is…

481
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,390
Her name…

482
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:51,933
What was it again?

483
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,102
-Do you not know?
-No.

484
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,395
Then I can't look her up.

485
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,981
The thing is,

486
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,401
she doesn't remember
because she lost her memory.

487
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,777
What do you mean?

488
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,531
Everyone who comes here
has their memories intact.

489
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,868
Where is she right now?

490
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,831
I only heard about it from someone else.

491
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,875
Or maybe I misheard it.

492
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,001
I thought

493
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,837
maybe you met them.

494
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,673
Met who?

495
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,887
We're actually in a state of emergency.

496
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,723
I guess the postal service
doesn't know yet.

497
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,520
I think we have a runaway.

498
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,732
But where are we going?

499
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,483
To meet the runaway.

500
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,152
A runaway?

501
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,405
Sometimes… This is an extremely rare case.

502
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,241
There are people who escape
on their way to Hell.

503
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,244
Once they set foot in Heaven,

504
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,247
their memories become

505
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,334
all jumbled up.

506
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,421
What happens to them?

507
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,505
Once they're caught,

508
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:08,843
they receive enhanced punishment
that's worse than Hell.

509
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,931
They could even be
completely erased from existence.

510
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,851
Why do you want to meet a runaway?

511
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,480
-Gosh, you're one stupid Chihuahua.
-Calm down.

512
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,107
Is there any way for us to go to Hell?

513
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,193
No, there isn't.

514
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,862
So we need to meet the runaway,
learn about Hell,

515
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,406
and figure out how to get there.

516
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,701
Hell? What would you do there?

517
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,332
What's this?

518
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,962
We've been severely abused by humans
to this day.

519
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,674
Once we go to Hell,
those who abused us… No.

520
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:53,513
All those evil people who abused animals
will face terrible punishment.

521
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:58,810
It'll be a difficult journey for sure,
but we'll definitely succeed.

522
00:32:58,893 --> 00:32:59,727
Yes.

523
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,979
So, Chihuahua…

524
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,232
become our comrade.

525
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,733
-Be our comrade.
-Be our comrade.

526
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,405
You guys

527
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:12,573
are really cute.

528
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,741
-What?
-Hey, come on.

529
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,784
-Do you not get--
-Paw.

530
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,538
-Hey.
-Geez.

531
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,580
That hurt my pride.

532
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,116
We're back.

533
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,082
I see. This is how it works.

534
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,255
So it works like this.

535
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,968
Right! Madam, I have a name.

536
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:14,886
Som-i.

537
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,971
My name is Som-i.

538
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,973
Nak-joon gave me that name.

539
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,608
Look up.

540
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:30,777
What?

541
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,946
Did you even go out of your way
to give her a name?

542
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,491
No, it's not like that.

543
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,660
I just thought she should have a name.

544
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:44,332
He said I look white and pure like cotton,

545
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,625
thus the name "Som-i."

546
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,796
You just had to give it meaning,
didn't you?

547
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,592
From now on, call me Bark.

548
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,803
-Bark?
-Yes.

549
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,432
Yes, that's a nice name.
It's quite pretty.

550
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,727
I look all rough and coarse
like a tree bark.

551
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,146
That's why I want to be called Bark.

552
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,527
You took her with you.

553
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,238
What? So you could have
a cozy little date?

554
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,740
Look, I went
to the Heaven Support Center to check.

555
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,866
And?

556
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,952
It doesn't happen often,

557
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:26,207
but sometimes those who are supposed
to go to Hell sneak into Heaven.

558
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,668
And I've basically helped Som-i
escape Hell.

559
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,503
Good grief.

560
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,589
I deeply regret what I did now.

561
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:37,802
Are you saying
you could be in danger as well?

562
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,098
Yes. I'm not completely sure though.

563
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,892
Let me assess the situation first

564
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,937
and find the safest way to handle this.

565
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,606
It's not just about me.
What will you do without me?

566
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,400
Right?

567
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,363
Look, your hands are cold again. Geez.
Give me your hands.

568
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,782
See? It's warm, isn't it?

569
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,994
Doing this reminds me of the old days.

570
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,745
Back then, you were--

571
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,375
What was that?

572
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,967
Ms. Lee Hae-sook, I…

573
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,510
You've received four grape stickers.

574
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,846
You're required to attend
reformation classes.

575
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,639
-Reformation classes?
-You see…

576
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,685
Why are you staring?

577
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,604
It's just that…

578
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,607
I've never seen anyone get
this many berries in centuries.

579
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,444
Where is the class being held?

580
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,946
There's a map of the Reformation Center
at the back.

581
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,199
That's where you need to go. Goodbye then.

582
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,624
That woman better not be here

583
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,959
by the time I return
from the Reformation Center.

584
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,769
TO THE PRESIDENT

585
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,689
EVERYONE IS AFRAID OF MS. LEE HAE-SOOK

586
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:23,115
Normally, the reformation classes
take place at the training facility.

587
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,537
But considering your age and all,
we'd like to take an alternative approach.

588
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,622
Is that okay?

589
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,333
I'll abide by your orders.

590
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,711
Do you have a religion?

591
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,130
No, I don't.

592
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,092
But I've been to church a few times.

593
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,596
Then you could participate
in religious activities instead.

594
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,514
Is that okay?

595
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,808
Sure. I'm sorry.

596
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,103
I'm sure you didn't mean any harm.

597
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,939
I know very well that you're not evil.

598
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,984
That's why you're here, after all.

599
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,528
Heaven isn't a place
that just anyone can enter.

600
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:04,532
Thank you for saying that.

601
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,576
Make sure you don't get any more berries.

602
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,712
I want to regain my memories.

603
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:26,262
If I don't and continue living like this,
I might never know why I ended up in Hell.

604
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,723
But I want to know.

605
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,727
Just like how
you and your wife are soulmates,

606
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,396
I wonder if I have someone too.

607
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,941
I might have someone special out there,

608
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:42,236
so not remembering them
would be too heartbreaking.

609
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:49,660
I checked with the Heaven Support Center,
and there's no record of you.

610
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,873
I'm afraid we don't have any options.

611
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,801
I think

612
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,679
I might be able to find my memories.

613
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,267
What if I lost my memory
due to some kind of shock?

614
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,769
What's your plan?

615
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,612
Som-i!

616
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,866
Coming.

617
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,243
Not coming.

618
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:32,953
Coming.

619
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,705
Not…

620
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,305
Coming.

621
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,936
Someone's here.

622
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,441
Lord.

623
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:07,071
At last, you've blessed
your desperate servant with a follower.

624
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,239
Thank you.

625
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,256
Our sister is walking very slowly.

626
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,717
Welcome.

627
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,846
God loves you.

628
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,972
Always…

629
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,181
REFORMATION CANDIDATE

630
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,349
I see.

631
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,269
Okay. Come on in.

632
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,480
Please have a seat anywhere.

633
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,033
Will you be able to hear me?

634
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,203
This church is tiny, so why would I not?

635
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:57,913
Okay.

636
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,373
Let's begin the service.

637
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,918
Today's passage
is from Matthew, Chapter 11.

638
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:04,879
-"Come--"
-Right away?

639
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,964
Shouldn't we do introductions?

640
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,718
Hello. Happy now?

641
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,139
-"Come to me, all you who--"
-What about the Lord's Prayer?

642
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,725
They usually start with that.

643
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,732
Our Father in Heaven,
hallowed be your name--

644
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,816
Why aren't you doing it?

645
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,985
I don't know it.

646
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:28,903
You--

647
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,947
Then why did you say we should do it?

648
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,116
I thought maybe you just forgot.

649
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,913
Please stay quiet
for the rest of the service.

650
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,457
Should I not say "amen" either?

651
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,251
You should. You should say "amen."

652
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,794
What about "hallelujah"?

653
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,213
Say it.

654
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,256
Say "hallelujah."

655
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,384
Excuse me.

656
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,262
Does God really watch us during service?

657
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,097
Of course.

658
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,183
He's everywhere.

659
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,185
Have you actually seen Him?

660
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,436
No, I haven't.

661
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,939
Why not?
Shouldn't you be able to here in Heaven?

662
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,566
Humans on Earth
are committing so many sins

663
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,527
that He doesn't have time to come here.

664
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,195
I see.

665
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,530
What about Buddha then?

666
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,822
Why--

667
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,950
Why would Buddha come to church?

668
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,745
I mean, I thought he could.
Does he only stay at temples?

669
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:21,872
Ma'am.

670
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,708
Why did you choose to come here?

671
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:29,213
There are hundreds of religious options
instead of reformation classes.

672
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,340
So why did you choose this place?

673
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,593
Because I heard God forgives all sins--

674
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,970
What sins did you commit?

675
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,974
We're not close enough
to discuss such things yet, are we?

676
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,309
Feel free to go to the temple then.

677
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,271
But the president said
I had to attend this.

678
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,358
Then please be quiet, will you?

679
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,609
-Okay?
-Okay.

680
00:42:56,407 --> 00:43:00,160
"Come to me,
all you who are weary and burdened,

681
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,246
and I will give you rest."

682
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,729
Are you testing me right now?

683
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:33,110
Yes, Jesus loves me

684
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:36,196
Yes, Jesus loves me

685
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:39,950
What?

686
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,327
What is it this time?

687
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:45,164
I dreamed I was falling from a high place.

688
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:51,170
That means you'll grow a lot.
You'll be as tall as Seo Jang-hoon.

689
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,468
Why only half a stamp?

690
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:02,348
You slept through the entire service.
Don't you have any conscience?

691
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,893
I see.
No wonder you got those grape berries.

692
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,394
What kind of pastor are you?

693
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,314
What about it?
How's a pastor supposed to behave?

694
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:13,317
You said all sinners should come to God.

695
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,653
You heard something at least.

696
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,530
It's "those who are burdened,"
not "sinners."

697
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,908
I'm not coming back here.

698
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,621
That's wonderful news.

699
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:26,789
Amen.

700
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,839
Honey, I'm home.

701
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,675
Madam.

702
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,636
I've missed you.

703
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,774
I can't take this anymore.
Kick her out this instant.

704
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,192
Where would she go?

705
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,903
Anywhere! Why is that your concern?

706
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,157
It's already uncomfortable enough
that a complete stranger showed up

707
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,243
claiming she only remembers my husband.

708
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,080
Are you in a dilemma?

709
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,418
Since when did you become
such a compassionate person?

710
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,294
Kick her out.

711
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:19,049
Whether it's Hell or wherever,
it's not our problem.

712
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,761
Why are you hesitating?

713
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,681
Do you really not understand
why I'm angry?

714
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,475
You're upset with her.

715
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,686
No, it's you.

716
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,729
You. I'm talking about you.

717
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,023
Your attitude is the problem.

718
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,358
What did I do…

719
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,819
Ever since you got here,

720
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,447
I've been constantly
walking on eggshells around you.

721
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,992
And since we're on the subject--

722
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,661
Normally, what they're about to say next
is the real point.

723
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,580
There it is.

724
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:52,249
Go ahead. Let me hear everything.

725
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,922
Do you realize you've been angry with me
your entire time here?

726
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,799
Do you think it's just for fun?

727
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,760
You keep giving me reasons to be angry.

728
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,095
What did I do? I just--

729
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,765
Name one thing I've actually done
to cause all your anger.

730
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,100
First, there's Som-i and…

731
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,936
Then there's you
coming here looking like that.

732
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,108
Fine. I'm the idiot.

733
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,029
I'm an idiot
for choosing to live with you again

734
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,239
after all those decades together.

735
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:30,120
I never received anything in my life,
so why should I expect anything?

736
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,332
Forget it. Live however you want.

737
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,167
Don't mind me.

738
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,720
I'm sorry.

739
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,805
This is all my fault.

740
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,725
I have nothing to say to you.

741
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:53,810
Do whatever you want.

742
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:31,765
Honey.

743
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:32,766
Honey.

744
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,185
Where are you going?

745
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,770
Don't mind me.

746
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,482
Do you think I have nowhere else to go
if I'm not with you?

747
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,942
Where are you going?

748
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,360
Just stop.

749
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,405
We spent enough time together
when we were alive.

750
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,656
What more--

751
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:48,782
Hae-sook.

752
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:53,036
I worked so hard while I was alive
and cooked all those meals for you.

753
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,956
Since I loved you that much,

754
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,251
I must've had expectations deep down

755
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,336
that you'd have to love me back

756
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,506
and be grateful to me.

757
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,008
I do love you.

758
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,010
And I'm grateful.

759
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,596
Yes, you were back then.

760
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,807
But now,
you can live perfectly fine without me.

761
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,143
You chose this body

762
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:20,147
because you wanted to try living
like everyone else, didn't you?

763
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,612
Expecting you to live
in the same old body as mine

764
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,448
is selfishness on my part.

765
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,409
I'm going to find
the life that's right for me--

766
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,911
What do you mean-- What are you saying?

767
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,831
Are you planning to find some old man
and live with him?

768
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:39,625
That's fine by me.

769
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:58,810
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

770
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,188
Ms. Lee, who are you looking for again?

771
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,981
Han Gyeong-ja.

772
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:03,899
Your relationship?

773
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,484
She's my mother.

774
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,569
Are you sure about this?

775
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,405
Sometimes, family members
don't make it to Heaven.

776
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,199
I want to find her.

777
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:17,204
Fortunately, she is in Heaven.

778
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,665
Could you let me know where she lives?

779
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:23,251
Well, I can tell you, but…

780
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,338
Am I not allowed to meet her?

781
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,549
Well, you see…

782
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,134
According to our policy,

783
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,429
we can only share contact information
if the other person agrees.

784
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:38,266
I told you she's my mother.
A daughter is looking for her mother--

785
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,395
There's a procedure for this
that takes some time.

786
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:44,523
For now, please go home.

787
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,192
We'll ask your mother
within the next few days and--

788
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,778
I told you I left home.

789
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,782
Haven't you heard the news yet?

790
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:57,953
It's been centuries since berries fell,
let alone four.

791
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,081
And who do you think caused that?

792
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,127
I heard people here
can also get hurt and feel pain too.

793
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,256
When was the last time you felt pain?

794
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,943
We seem to meet quite often.

795
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:33,238
It's nice that we meet often.
We'll grow on each other.

796
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,033
I heard you wanted to see your mother.

797
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,577
Yes, but…

798
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,412
The staff earlier said

799
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:44,291
I could only get her information
if the other party consented.

800
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,209
Yes, that's the standard policy.

801
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,045
But even if that's the case,

802
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:52,132
you'll find a way to get it
even if it's not exactly legal, won't you?

803
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,508
Well…

804
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,010
About those berries…

805
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,137
I can explain--

806
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,513
Right.

807
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,098
I'm not here to judge.

808
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:05,020
Everyone knows their own mistakes
better than anyone else. Isn't that right?

809
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,104
Yes.

810
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:12,319
Oh my, your mother lives quite far away.

811
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,989
You'll need to ride a car.
Don't you get motion sickness?

812
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,617
Goodness, how did you know that about me?

813
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,329
Are you going alone?
What about your husband?

814
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,581
No, I'm planning to go by myself.

815
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:25,916
Okay. I see.

816
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,293
It's quite a journey,

817
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,379
so let me write down
the directions for you.

818
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,549
Thank you.

819
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,136
Do you know what my favorite saying is?

820
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,390
"Everyone has their reasons."

821
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,560
Even in the most frustrating situations,

822
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,145
this phrase

823
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,314
helps calm your own anger

824
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,984
and gives you the chance
to hear the other person out.

825
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:58,615
"Everyone has their reasons."

826
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,576
You must also have a good reason

827
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:06,289
for wanting to find your mother
so desperately.

828
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,586
Thank you.

829
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,131
Am I taking the bus?

830
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,132
Yes.

831
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,511
Exit the building, go right,

832
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,847
and you'll find a small bus stop.

833
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:25,809
But traveling in-between heavens
will be challenging.

834
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,562
Especially since
you're traveling to the past.

835
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,315
"Take the bus that goes to the past."

836
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,235
"To the 1950s."

837
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,946
What on earth does this mean?

838
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:48,248
HEAVEN BUS STOP
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

839
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,333
BUS TO THE PAST

840
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:55,338
HEAVEN EXPRESS

841
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,179
We're headed to 1950s Heaven.

842
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,015
All aboard!

843
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,861
Hello, valued passengers.

844
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:21,698
Thank you for riding Heaven Transit Bus.

845
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,410
We're currently en route to 1950s Heaven

846
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:29,414
and will arrive at our destination
in approximately 15 minutes.

847
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:32,792
We will soon be increasing our speed
as we pass through the toll gate.

848
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,252
If you experience motion sickness,

849
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:38,465
please use the anti-nausea gum
provided by our attendant.

850
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,052
Thank you.

851
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,349
Lastly, for a more pleasant journey,

852
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,517
we'll be playing the 1950s megahit

853
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,520
"Spring Days Pass"

854
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,940
by Baek Seol-hee.

855
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:58,109
We wish you a comfortable journey
to your destination.

856
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,235
Thank you very much.

857
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:07,285
BUS TO THE PAST

858
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,583
Forget it.

859
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,586
Live however you want, Ko Nak-joon.

860
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,048
I'm going to live with my mom.

861
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:37,065
HEAVEN

862
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,284
A BRIGHTER SOCIETY THROUGH READING

863
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,966
1950S

864
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:43,006
Her mom is waiting just beyond that hill.

865
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,388
Things wouldn't have turned out this way

866
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,849
had she insisted
on living with her from the start.

867
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:56,352
The more Hae-sook thought about it,
the more regretful she became.

868
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,230
Aging eyes make it hard to see at night.

869
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,484
It's hard to leave home at an old age.

870
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,653
I'm too old for this.

871
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,322
Goodness.

872
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,720
What's that? A full moon?

873
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,181
Why is it so close?

874
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,907
Hae-sook was worried

875
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,828
that her mom wouldn't recognize
her current appearance.

876
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:58,164
She probably only remembers my face
from when I was little.

877
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:03,086
It would've been better to visit her
during daytime instead of nighttime.

878
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:12,554
Oh my.

879
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,098
Is someone listening?

880
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:18,893
I better keep moving.

881
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:07,233
Who is it?

882
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,575
Mom…

883
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,287
Is that you, Hae-sook?

884
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:21,789
Oh my.

885
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,709
-Oh my…
-Mom!

886
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,669
Look at you, Hae-sook.

887
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,338
Mom.

888
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,096
My baby is all grown up.

889
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,348
Mom…

890
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,814
By the way, how did you recognize me?

891
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,108
How could I not recognize my own daughter?

892
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,570
You haven't changed

893
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,864
one bit.

894
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,535
What do you mean? I'm all wrinkly now.

895
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,452
Oh, please.

896
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:03,039
Wrinkly or not, you're still the same.

897
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,667
You're the one who hasn't changed.

898
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:10,296
You could be my daughter,
and I could be your mom.

899
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,717
I'm so happy

900
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,680
that you're here.

901
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:20,932
Goodness.

902
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,101
My daughter.

903
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,896
You lived a long, good life.

904
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,070
By the way,

905
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:36,239
why is this your Heaven?

906
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,616
This is the house I lived in.

907
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,246
I used to live here with my mom.

908
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,290
I suppose so.

909
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:48,418
But why are you alone?
Where's your husband?

910
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,753
Listen to me, Mom.

911
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,630
Nak-joon--

912
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,843
How do you know him?

913
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,598
When I was young, you--

914
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,766
Grandmother told you
I was dead, didn't she?

915
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,770
Yes, she said you drowned in a reservoir.

916
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,859
Then…

917
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,914
GROOM: KO NAK-JOON
BRIDE: LEE HAE-SOOK

918
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,541
Were you at my wedding?

919
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,709
Of course.

920
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,089
I was at your graduation ceremony
and your wedding.

921
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,591
Then why…

922
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,303
You must be hungry after your journey.

923
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,055
Do you remember?

924
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:43,973
You used to throw tantrums

925
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,310
to get all the crispy rice
whenever I made sweet potato rice.

926
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,700
I can't believe I'm eating your food.

927
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,453
I'm glad that I'm dead.

928
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:06,954
Stop talking such nonsense.

929
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,208
Your eyes will sting.
Why don't you go inside?

930
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,209
No.

931
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,961
I just want to be near you.

932
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,591
You're still a child, aren't you?

933
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,594
Have you ever seen such an old child?

934
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,346
You'll always be a child to me.

935
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,440
This is what doenjang stew
should taste like!

936
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:38,277
I've tried my whole life,
but I could never get this flavor.

937
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:43,032
I'll pack some doenjang for you.
Take it and have it with your husband.

938
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:48,371
What's wrong? Did you two fight?

939
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:51,290
No.

940
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,835
"Did you two fight?"

941
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:58,965
For Hae-sook, just those few words
from her mom meant the world.

942
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,968
Wives would go to their parents
after fighting with their husbands.

943
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:06,264
But I had nowhere to go,
so I just put up with it.

944
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,019
I'm sorry.

945
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,313
It's all my fault.

946
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,651
Eat up, okay?

947
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,154
Here, eat this too.

948
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,281
Please let my grandmother
visit me in my dreams.

949
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:13,039
Honey. Are you happy up there?

950
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,667
I had my second son, Mother.

951
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,838
-My dear doggie, Hodu…
-I miss you, sis.

952
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,256
Don't worry about Mom and Dad.

953
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,134
-Goodbye, Grandpa.
-My precious daughter,

954
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,470
I didn't even get to say goodbye.
I love you so much.

955
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:34,811
PHONE BOOTH

956
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:52,954
Can you…

957
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,872
see me?

958
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:03,005
In that case,

959
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,467
don't tell anyone that you saw me.

960
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,678
This is our little secret, okay?

961
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,471
Not even your mom.

962
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,765
I don't have one.

963
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,768
She went to Heaven because she was sick.

964
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,104
I see.

965
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,815
I miss her.

966
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,747
I promise to pass this on to her.

967
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:39,166
I promise.

968
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:58,811
Hello, sir.

969
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,023
You're working hard.

970
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,484
There have been
many unfortunate incidents lately,

971
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,695
so you must be quite busy.

972
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:09,697
Not at all.

973
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:18,456
It's good that you care
about others' feelings.

974
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:23,794
But shouldn't you also look into the heart
of someone dearest to you?

975
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:25,713
Pardon?

976
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,673
Right.

977
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:30,718
Yes, sir.

978
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:34,722
Wasn't the reason
you wanted this job when you came here

979
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:39,644
because you were worried about your wife
who was still down there?

980
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,147
That's true.

981
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,171
You went through so much, my love.

982
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,557
Remember that earnest feeling you had then

983
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,268
and stay true to it.

984
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:43,124
Should I live here with you?

985
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,461
I should've chosen you
when I first arrived.

986
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:52,508
Being old like this doesn't matter
if I'm with you.

987
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,137
Because I'm still just a child to you.

988
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,558
Husbands aren't like that.

989
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,894
We're not related by blood anyway.

990
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:07,231
Husbands don't mean anything.

991
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,983
They even say

992
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:11,610
it's normal for your husband
to not side with you.

993
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:16,157
Would you…

994
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:20,161
like to hear my story?

995
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:22,538
Yes.

996
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:26,834
This happened

997
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,545
not long after I got married.

998
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,257
Your father…

999
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:37,928
suddenly brought home a young woman

1000
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:40,598
who had white powder all over her face.

1001
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:50,858
-Eat up.
-Okay.

1002
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,786
Then, one day,

1003
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:03,954
she had a baby.

1004
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,458
Actually…

1005
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,003
you could say I was the one who had it.

1006
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,327
The baby slept on my back

1007
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,621
and drank my breast milk.

1008
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,126
Isn't it fascinating?

1009
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:55,381
I didn't even give birth,
but I began to produce breast milk.

1010
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,425
I would breastfeed the baby,

1011
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:00,177
and it would fall asleep.

1012
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:04,056
I loved the softness
of its baby hair so much,

1013
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,267
so I'd nuzzle my face against it.

1014
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,310
And then I cried.

1015
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,823
By that time,
I started feeling sorry for the woman.

1016
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,201
She never held
such a beautiful thing even once.

1017
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,038
-Then suddenly…
-We'll go now.

1018
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,790
they went to the hot springs together.

1019
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:32,418
He said she deserved it after childbirth.

1020
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,672
But he never once noticed

1021
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:38,883
my swollen, chapped hands.

1022
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,218
Goodness.

1023
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:42,887
But on their way home,

1024
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,099
the train that your father
and that woman were on

1025
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:49,226
derailed.

1026
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:55,399
They must've really loved each other,
seeing how they died at the same time.

1027
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,361
That's how I ended up

1028
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,199
taking in a child who'd lost both parents.

1029
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:06,660
Did you raise the child all along?

1030
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,288
Where is she now?

1031
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:13,667
I never remember having a sibling.

1032
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:21,300
Was that child…

1033
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:23,010
me?

1034
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:33,395
How could I blame such an innocent child?

1035
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:38,901
It was fate that brought you to me.

1036
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:41,612
Even so,

1037
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,115
I hated it so much when you called me Mom

1038
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,077
and followed me around.

1039
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:53,540
Ironically…

1040
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,045
I was the one
who couldn't sleep without you

1041
01:10:58,545 --> 01:10:59,755
every night.

1042
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:03,884
But it still terrified me
that someone else's child…

1043
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:08,264
would become so attached to me.

1044
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:14,436
When I realized that I couldn't leave

1045
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,023
that miserable house because of you…

1046
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:22,945
I knew I had to go.

1047
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,448
I was afraid I'd grow to resent you.

1048
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,410
I was afraid I'd despise you.

1049
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,623
So I left you behind.

1050
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,793
On a moonless night.

1051
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:43,007
I thought I'd be fine once I left…

1052
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:46,302
but I missed you.

1053
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:50,931
I could endure hunger

1054
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,934
and working like a dog for someone else.

1055
01:11:57,062 --> 01:12:00,024
But I just couldn't stand not seeing you.

1056
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:07,281
That's why I went to see you in secret.

1057
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,748
And that's when I realized

1058
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,668
that fate was stronger

1059
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:21,837
and more powerful

1060
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,131
than blood.

1061
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,594
Mom.

1062
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,264
I don't deserve to be called Mom.

1063
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:36,477
But thank you so much

1064
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,938
for coming here, Hae-sook.

1065
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:43,525
Mom.

1066
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,323
Mom…

1067
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:54,078
Mom…

1068
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,261
Even though her feet were cold,

1069
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:13,680
Hae-sook slept soundly.

1070
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:20,604
You went through so much, Mom.

1071
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:44,002
Mother.

1072
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:47,256
I'm pleased to finally meet you.

1073
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:49,383
I'm your son-in-law.

1074
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:52,302
Let me bow to you first.

1075
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:12,072
GROOM: KO NAK-JOON
BRIDE: LEE HAE-SOOK

1076
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,251
How did you know where to find me?

1077
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:26,336
Of course, I--

1078
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,005
The president told you, didn't he?

1079
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:30,966
Yes.

1080
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,094
Did you see
how precious of a daughter I am?

1081
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,846
You better treat me well from now on.

1082
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:38,140
You're right.

1083
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:41,268
I'll be on my best behavior
for the sake of my mother-in-law.

1084
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:44,813
This fate of ours

1085
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:48,108
must also be stronger than blood.

1086
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:58,118
What now?

1087
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:03,248
Will you tell me to close my eyes
and just trust you again?

1088
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,000
Yes.

1089
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,896
Where could they be?

1090
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:43,747
Did you just arrive?

1091
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,841
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

1092
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:15,070
Weirdly, I see Young-ae

1093
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:17,656
when I look at Som-i.

1094
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:20,534
-You mean Young-ae's dead?
-What?

1095
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:22,661
Can you not remember?

1096
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:27,958
In that case,

1097
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:29,626
I think I am her.

1098
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,878
Runaway located.
Deploy the arrest team immediately.

1099
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,840
We have to find her first!

1100
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,384
It's that way! I smell her!

1101
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:38,969
We found them! Requesting backup now!

1102
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:42,431
You don't belong here.

1103
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:46,643
If you continue doing this, you'll be
completely erased from existence.

1104
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:49,813
Just a moment, please! Hae-sook! My wife…

1105
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:52,190
My wife is in there.

1106
01:16:56,528 --> 01:16:58,530
