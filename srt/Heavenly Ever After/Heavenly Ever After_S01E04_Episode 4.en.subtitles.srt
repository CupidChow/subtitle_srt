1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,966
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

2
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,181
Ma'am. Let's put down the chopsticks.

3
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,600
No, that's fine.

4
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,226
You can take the photo.

5
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,062
Okay.

6
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,521
I'll take it now.

7
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,815
One, two.

8
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,633
Did you just arrive?

9
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,189
Go in first. Wait.

10
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,691
Hold on.

11
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,278
-Here you go.
-You're overreacting again.

12
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:56,366
I promised your mother
I'd take good care of you.

13
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,835
Hello, madam.

14
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,631
I was very worried.

15
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,112
I'm sure you have your reasons too.

16
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:21,910
Whatever our fate may be,
I can't tell you to make yourself at home.

17
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:27,832
But don't be intimidated by me.

18
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,163
What's wrong?

19
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,548
Did you do something wrong?

20
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,843
No.

21
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,345
Then what's wrong?

22
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,933
It's because of the way
you're looking at me.

23
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,644
I won't get mad, so just be honest.

24
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,104
Am I wrong?

25
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,981
What are you talking about?

26
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,565
That woman outside.

27
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,110
Before you met me… No.

28
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,945
She's not someone

29
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,030
you were secretly seeing

30
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,283
after you met me, was she?

31
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,119
Woman? What woman?

32
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,870
"What woman?"

33
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,497
As in there were many?

34
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,417
No. That's not what I meant.

35
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,170
You're asking me about some other woman
when you're the only woman in my life.

36
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,797
Did you really not have anyone?

37
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:02,844
I know many women fell
for your twinkling eyes back in the day.

38
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,721
Come on.

39
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,558
It was my lips, not my eyes.

40
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,934
He's right.

41
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,811
In his youth,

42
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,815
Nak-joon was once almost cast
by a famous film director.

43
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,525
Cheers!

44
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,779
That guy is so handsome.

45
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,865
Hey, he's mine. Don't even think about it.

46
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,371
Isn't his side profile
absolutely incredible?

47
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,214
Great! Drink again!

48
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,299
Sorry?

49
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,051
Yes! Drink up!

50
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,977
Alcohol is bitter, just like life!

51
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,321
You have the face I've been looking for.

52
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:04,781
Hey.

53
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,742
Could you read this line?

54
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,577
Sure.

55
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,579
"It's been a while since we lay together."

56
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,497
What?

57
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:19,170
"It's been a while since we lay together."

58
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,923
Yes! That's it!

59
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,634
Especially those lips.

60
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,135
Your lips are a work of art.

61
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,685
I'm sorry, but…

62
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,271
Who are you?

63
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,314
Me?

64
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,317
I'm a movie director.

65
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:46,114
Would you like to make a film with me?

66
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,533
A film?

67
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:54,580
Nak-joon was already imagining
his face on the theater billboards.

68
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,382
Oh my.

69
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,425
Thank you.

70
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,971
Who are you?

71
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,807
You offered to cast me
in your film yesterday.

72
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,308
But after sobering up,

73
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,813
he said,
"Sorry, you're not that good-looking."

74
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,982
Nak-joon was a future rising star.

75
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,569
No, he was close to being one.

76
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,032
It's not true, is it?

77
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:30,950
No, it's not.

78
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,369
Honey, you can trust me.

79
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,164
Fine.

80
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,585
If she bothers you that much,
I'll go there right now and kick her out.

81
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,587
Don't be so dramatic.

82
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,965
I've already accepted her
as a guest in our home,

83
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,261
and I'll treat her well until she leaves.

84
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:55,641
I think it's more important
that you sort out your position.

85
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,644
My position has always been the same.

86
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,897
I have absolutely no idea who she is.

87
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,982
Fine then. Get some rest.

88
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,735
Hae-sook.

89
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,576
It's been a while
since we lay down together.

90
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,911
Don't do that.

91
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,163
Good night, honey.

92
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:50,947
Do you…

93
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,366
know me?

94
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,331
You do know me, don't you?

95
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,501
I think we know each other. Don't we?

96
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,418
What?

97
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,255
Can you not remember?

98
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,090
No.

99
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,676
I can't remember anything.

100
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,262
We know each other, don't we?

101
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,107
You're acting just like a cat.

102
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,360
I am a cat.

103
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,029
Then…

104
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,157
was I a cat too?

105
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,661
Of course not.

106
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,581
Cats are smart.

107
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,999
Like me.

108
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,168
Then how do we know each other?

109
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,680
Have a good day.

110
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,015
-See you later.
-Okay.

111
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,685
There's Sonya.

112
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,108
Look at them
playing like a couple of kittens.

113
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,943
That's interesting.

114
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,945
Doesn't Sonya usually dislike strangers?

115
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,241
You're right. She's such a homebody.
She only follows Young-ae and me.

116
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:18,993
Sonya.

117
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,127
Sonya, eat before you leave!

118
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,839
She was playing well with Som-i,
so why did she leave when you called her?

119
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:32,840
How hurtful.

120
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,924
I know.

121
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,510
We are all dogs

122
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,764
who have been abandoned by humans.

123
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,767
Should we let our abusers

124
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,685
get away with what they did?

125
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,354
No, we can't.

126
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,441
Samsik, raise your hand.

127
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,902
Our good friend, Samsik,

128
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,238
got hit by a car
that suddenly came at him.

129
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,409
Then some drunk guy
came over and kicked him for fun.

130
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,994
That's how he died.

131
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,498
Does anyone know
what punishment that human received?

132
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,541
He killed a dog,
so isn't that a death penalty?

133
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,459
Life imprisonment.

134
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,003
The correct answer is "property damage."

135
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,506
What? "Property damage"?

136
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,091
Where's Hongsi?

137
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,175
Here.

138
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,636
She got hit with a shovel
just for wandering in the garden

139
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,929
and lost her eye.

140
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,722
Basset.

141
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,767
-How long did you live down there?
-Six months.

142
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,102
How did you die?

143
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,022
My owners fought, and the wife
threw me from the fifth floor.

144
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,274
Then she came down,
poured lighter fluid on my body--

145
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,776
Stop!

146
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,695
Even that is just considered
property damage.

147
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,991
Fine. Let's say humans rule the world.

148
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,160
But what about the afterlife?

149
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,370
I had high hopes, you see.

150
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,747
I thought the afterlife
would be fair. However…

151
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,750
I found out there's no Hell for humans

152
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:54,171
who abuse, cause pain to,
and kill animals like us!

153
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,051
I believe

154
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:03,514
there should be a Hell that can avenge us.

155
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,392
So let's make one!

156
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,770
Let's make those humans

157
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,730
pay for what they've done!

158
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,240
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

159
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,915
It's okay.

160
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,502
I prepared this for you, so eat up.

161
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,005
You…

162
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,091
It's yummy.

163
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,137
Why aren't you eating, Mandu?

164
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,056
He won't eat
if you just give it like that.

165
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,016
Wait.

166
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,403
Good boy. Eat.

167
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,867
This alone proves

168
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,536
how terrible humans really are.

169
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,747
It's just one measly snack.

170
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,627
Jjajang, you're filled
with so much anger inside.

171
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,544
Aren't I right?

172
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,505
Well…

173
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,758
I can't really disagree with that.

174
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:25,012
The painful memories from your life
are truly heartbreaking.

175
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,347
But is it right

176
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,975
to keep holding onto all that anger
in Heaven?

177
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,269
I don't want to live like this either.

178
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,479
But…

179
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,106
those humans who hurt us

180
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,443
are not getting properly punished.

181
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,571
Who said they're not being
properly punished?

182
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,281
Then tell me.

183
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,659
How are they suffering in Hell?

184
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,203
"Hell"?

185
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,792
Some say Hell is a state of mind.

186
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,255
With all that anger bottled up inside,

187
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,383
maybe you're already living in one.

188
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,594
Hey, calm down!

189
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,013
You can't bite the president, okay?

190
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:09,932
Calm down.

191
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,018
Don't worry about them.

192
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:18,649
Contrary to your concerns,
Hell operates with perfect precision.

193
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:22,361
Everyone pays for their sins
exactly as they should

194
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,946
without the slightest error.

195
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,614
So…

196
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,076
don't torment yourself with anger.

197
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,370
Do many good deeds

198
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,914
so you can be reincarnated as a human.

199
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,003
All right. Let's meet again tomorrow.

200
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,671
I have something to show you.

201
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,391
If you're going to sleep,
do it now instead of during the sermon.

202
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,686
I got plenty of sleep already.
Don't worry.

203
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,522
-By the way…
-Yes?

204
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,357
I know what you're going to say.

205
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,985
"Pastors shouldn't take the day off
on Buddha's birthday."

206
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,696
I did want to say that too.

207
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,617
Do pastors take days off too?

208
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,660
Isn't that a bit inappropriate?

209
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,874
Pastors can rest on Buddha's birthday,
and monks can receive Christmas gifts too.

210
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,042
Satisfied?

211
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,377
You're more laid-back than I expected.

212
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,923
Then what were you
originally curious about?

213
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,842
About someone who irritates you
when you let them be

214
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,219
but troubles your heart
when you push them away.

215
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,138
I know the answer. It's you, isn't it?

216
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,099
Santa won't be bringing you any gifts.

217
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:38,437
The greatest gift would be
for people like you to stop coming here.

218
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,565
No wonder this church has no congregation.

219
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,901
There's absolutely no one here.

220
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,110
Don't you know why?

221
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,947
Our church has a certain troublemaker

222
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,574
who causes problems
and commits sins even in Heaven.

223
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,035
So who'd be brave enough to come here?

224
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,203
Do you mean me?

225
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,165
Then were there many churchgoers
before I came?

226
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,795
-Let's begin the service.
-Don't change the subject. Were there?

227
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,755
I don't like crowds.

228
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,632
I bet others just don't like you.

229
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,968
No one likes an ill-tempered man.

230
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,345
I guess you didn't know
I only acted this way with you.

231
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,555
I'm incredibly lovely to everyone else.

232
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,892
I guess I'll never see that side of you
since there is no one else here.

233
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,561
You are extremely relentless.

234
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,896
Of course.

235
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,400
My job was to collect interest on time.

236
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,403
Are you bragging about being a loan shark?

237
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,280
It's not something to brag about,
but it's not a shame either.

238
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,825
All right, I understand.

239
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,785
Let's begin the service.

240
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,041
I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
Creator of Heaven and Earth.

241
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,001
I--

242
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:47,715
I believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord.

243
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,135
Suffered--

244
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,679
Suffered under Pontius Pilate…

245
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:01,020
THOSE WHO CROSSED FROM HELL
IS THERE ETERNAL GOOD AND EVIL?

246
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,358
I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
Creator of--

247
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,414
I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
Creator of--

248
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,055
Mommy!

249
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,435
Even you call for your mom instead of God
when you're startled.

250
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,437
What do you want?

251
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,813
Are you having ramyeon?

252
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,356
Can't you tell?

253
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,441
Go ahead.

254
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,450
Would you like some?

255
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,243
I'm not hungry.

256
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,128
You say you're not sleepy, but you sleep.

257
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,006
You say you're not hungry,
but your stomach growls.

258
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,842
Do you always have to lie when you talk?

259
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,011
What will it be?
Are you going to eat this or not?

260
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,222
Just one bite.

261
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,224
Okay.

262
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,942
Don't twirl it like that.

263
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,568
Okay?

264
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,029
I just don't have much strength
in my wrist.

265
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,489
One second.

266
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,659
There.

267
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,703
You're so petty.

268
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,293
This is terrible.

269
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,879
What is this? A flood of water?

270
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,217
If you know so well,
why don't you make some yourself?

271
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,053
Fine, I'll make some myself.

272
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,462
You're actually crying
while having ramyeon.

273
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,965
You must be moved by my cooking skills.

274
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,844
It's spicy. I'm crying because it's spicy.

275
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,014
If you're moved, just say that you are.

276
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,057
I'm not.

277
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,559
Never mind then.

278
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,403
What's wrong with me?

279
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,747
PHONE BOOTH

280
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,667
Please tell my father

281
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,838
that I respected and loved him.

282
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,716
Honey, are you doing well?

283
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,802
I'll raise Geon-yeong well.

284
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,137
Yeon-ju.

285
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,264
I miss you.

286
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,808
I wish you could appear in my dreams.

287
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:33,148
I promise to deliver
every single letter here.

288
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:34,983
At all costs.

289
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,573
You didn't bring an umbrella, did you?

290
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,575
I think it's going to pour soon.

291
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,622
It's about to come down hard, isn't it?

292
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,124
You must be starving.

293
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,042
Come on. I'll cook you some food.

294
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,448
Where did you learn to shield yourself
with an umbrella like that?

295
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:05,991
This?

296
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,660
I never learned it.

297
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,370
I just did it.

298
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,882
My shoulders are so stiff
from delivering so many letters today.

299
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,178
You've worked hard today.

300
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,349
About your job…

301
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,479
Can't we send letters
to people down there?

302
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,190
Why? Is there something you want to send?

303
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,484
It's Young-ae.

304
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,612
I've been thinking about her a lot lately.

305
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,696
Young-ae?

306
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,240
I'm sure she's doing fine. She's tough.

307
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,535
No. She may be big,
but she's still a baby at heart.

308
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:55,165
She's soft and gets easily scared.
She bawls while watching dramas.

309
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,709
She even cries
over other people's problems.

310
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,963
Weirdly, I see her when I look at Som-i.

311
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,176
How does that make any sense? How so?

312
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,723
And if Young-ae is here,
that would mean she's dead.

313
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,682
Right.

314
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,643
-That can't be, can it?
-No.

315
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,687
Right, that poor girl
shouldn't be dead already.

316
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,889
Geez, not again. Let me get some sleep.

317
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,488
Goodness.

318
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,539
I'm scared to sleep alone.

319
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,208
Gosh, all right.

320
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,754
-I had a nightmare about a ghost.
-Geez!

321
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,507
Aren't you too big to be scared of ghosts?
Go back to sleep.

322
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,219
The ghost was bigger than me.

323
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,138
Goodness.

324
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,396
Don't leave me all alone.

325
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,116
Hey. Wake up.

326
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,452
Oh my.

327
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,246
Why am I here?

328
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,666
That's not the issue. Do you see this?

329
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,588
I'm sorry.

330
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,341
I had a terrible nightmare.

331
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,009
Don't do this again.

332
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,680
If you do, I'm really going to get mad.

333
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,266
Okay.

334
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,318
Jjajang.

335
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,987
What is this place?

336
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,948
This is where dreams happen.

337
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,741
Specifically speaking,

338
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,785
this is where deceased pets

339
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:22,038
can enter the dreams
of their owners they left behind.

340
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,874
What? Why would they enter
their owners' dreams?

341
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,335
It's called pet loss syndrome.

342
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:32,590
It's the grief that owners experience
when their pets pass away before them.

343
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,718
That doesn't last long.

344
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,885
That's right.

345
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,514
We're here to make sure
their grief doesn't last long.

346
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,642
Quiet, everyone!

347
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,227
Let's begin.

348
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,854
-Mungchi.
-Here.

349
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:46,771
Okay.

350
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,440
-Cream.
-Here.

351
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,357
Okay.

352
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,942
Please follow me.

353
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,863
Bijou?

354
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,864
Yes?

355
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,533
You too. Please follow me.

356
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,534
This way.

357
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,247
-Okay. Let's go.
-Okay.

358
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,708
Let's go.

359
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,884
TO MY FRIEND
WHO CROSSED THE RAINBOW BRIDGE

360
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,647
Now I'm used to

361
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,692
The space you left behind

362
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:37,364
Busy days keep me from

363
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,992
Bringing you to mind

364
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:45,038
It's been so long

365
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,999
Since I erased your trace

366
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:54,005
But nights like this bring back your face

367
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,965
BEWARE OF DOG
NO ENTRY

368
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:01,888
Even the way

369
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,849
You'd bug me every day

370
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:12,482
All those moments I let slip away

371
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:16,152
Are you okay? Are you at peace?

372
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,823
Do you ever think of me?

373
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,327
Are you smiling where you are?

374
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:28,123
I've got so many things to ask

375
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:32,836
If someday you ever come

376
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:33,920
Cream.

377
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:37,132
To visit in my dream

378
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,633
I was such a fool.

379
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,051
Just once

380
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,637
I never thought you'd leave me so soon.

381
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,805
Please say

382
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,515
I should've treated you better.

383
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:50,228
That you were happy

384
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:59,154
A SONG FROM ACROSS THE RAINBOW BRIDGE

385
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,739
Mungchi, are you no longer in pain?

386
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,367
I'm sorry I couldn't play with you more.

387
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,287
Please be my son again in the next life.

388
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,122
I promise to treat you better.

389
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,166
I want to see you too

390
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:18,423
But I know
Some things just can't be changed

391
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,762
Still, from afar

392
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:28,099
When I quietly watch over you

393
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,018
Bijou?

394
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:34,147
I catch myself smiling at the memories

395
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,064
Is it really you?

396
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,775
Bijou, is that you?

397
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,067
I'm truly sorry

398
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,611
I've missed you so much--

399
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,820
Bijou.

400
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,989
Bijou. Where are you going?

401
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,699
I was too small

402
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,202
To see how much

403
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,119
Bijou!

404
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,245
Bijou.

405
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:53,541
Pain you were in

406
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:59,714
I am sorry

407
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,928
Will you forgive me?

408
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,640
In those brief moments we had

409
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,187
Just having you there made me so happy

410
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:20,652
Even if it's only in a dream
It would be enough

411
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,700
Hi, little puppy.

412
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,661
Why are you here all alone?

413
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,083
No.

414
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,876
Bijou's only been gone…

415
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,923
Do you know Bijou?

416
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,051
Wherever you are

417
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:49,180
Did she send you so you could comfort me?

418
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,557
Whatever you're feeling

419
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,058
For remembering me

420
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,059
Bijou…

421
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,021
In the time we shared

422
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,108
Thank you, Bijou…

423
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,192
Thank you

424
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,695
Oh, come on.

425
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,074
Hey, wait!

426
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,618
You.

427
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,080
-How could you let her meet another puppy?
-Why not?

428
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,832
Is that not allowed?

429
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,294
She'll forget about you
while raising that puppy.

430
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,380
I want her to forget me.

431
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,301
My mom and I were truly happy
during our time together,

432
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,929
so I want her to move on
and be happy again.

433
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:30,847
What?

434
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,600
How is that possible?

435
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,021
Jjajang.

436
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,900
Maybe humans aren't so bad after all.

437
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,444
That's exactly the problem
with dogs that have owners.

438
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,737
They're so weak!

439
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,906
Think about it.

440
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,283
They have no drive or motivation

441
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,995
since they were always fed on time.

442
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,081
-You know what gaslighting is, right?
-I do.

443
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,168
That's what humans do to us.

444
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,213
They treat us badly most of the time
and act nicely every now and then.

445
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,382
It makes us think
that they're actually nice.

446
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,595
Even the president
keeps showing us just that.

447
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:14,474
He wants us to think
that humans aren't evil. Okay?

448
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,780
Goodness, what is she doing?

449
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,785
Are you going to church?

450
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,746
Goodbye.

451
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,001
Don't you feel bored
staying at home all day?

452
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,461
Me?

453
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,755
It's okay.

454
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,175
Come with me if you want.

455
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,093
Really?

456
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,345
Yes! I want to tag along.

457
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,640
-You can't go inside the church though.
-I know.

458
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,600
It's only for those
who have done bad things.

459
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,441
You really remind me of someone.

460
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,404
Do you still not remember anything
about your past life?

461
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,156
No. Why do you ask?

462
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,117
It's nothing.

463
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,118
Let's go.

464
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,048
Go home now and--

465
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:29,966
I'll wait.

466
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,885
I'll wait for you here until you're done.

467
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,263
What for? You don't have to wait for me.

468
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,557
I have nothing to do anyway.

469
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,059
I'll just look around.

470
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,561
All right then.

471
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,449
My, it's warm.

472
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,950
Why is it so warm in here?

473
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,368
Is the heating on?

474
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,956
I guess my gentle nature
has warmed up the church.

475
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,459
I get sleepy when it's warm.

476
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,544
Sleep if you want. Do as you please.

477
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:10,089
I can preach to our new member over there.

478
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,425
What member? There's no one here but me.

479
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:14,635
Oh my.

480
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,304
Hello.

481
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,930
There really is someone.

482
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:24,353
Why did you choose to look so old?

483
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,857
What did they lure you here with?

484
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,108
A set of pots?

485
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,319
Laundry detergent?

486
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,779
Ma'am.

487
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,033
Brother, could you…

488
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,412
Could you repeat what you said earlier?

489
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,914
Right. Sure.

490
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:47,460
I was just passing by when I saw him.

491
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,421
He had such a warm and friendly look,

492
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,590
and he seemed so full of love

493
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,343
that I was drawn here before I knew it.

494
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,761
Did I really?

495
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,430
I see. I understand.

496
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,391
Why are you acting like
you're hearing it for the first time?

497
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,601
You should get some sleep.

498
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,771
Should I begin the service right away
to help you with that?

499
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,190
Look how excited you are.

500
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,819
You're so excited about one church member.
Imagine what you'd do for a thousand.

501
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,613
That's no way to talk to a pastor.

502
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,156
There's your true personality.

503
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,242
That's how he really is.

504
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,413
Gosh, you've chosen to be quite old too.

505
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,331
That's cold.

506
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,458
Why are you so drenched?

507
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,584
Aren't you cold?

508
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,170
Excuse me, Sister Hae-sook.

509
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,172
Could you please
not influence him in a bad way?

510
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,134
Also, you should focus
on your grape berries.

511
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,594
Just a few more,
and you're headed straight to Hell.

512
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,518
If you have any questions,

513
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,020
please don't ask her.

514
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,814
You can talk to me directly.

515
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,566
Okay, let's begin the service.

516
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,494
The Support Center
must be searching for the runaway,

517
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,621
so why is it so quiet?

518
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,874
Jjajang, maybe they haven't found
any clues.

519
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:13,045
They say people from Hell smell different,
but humans can't smell that well.

520
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:13,963
Hold on.

521
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,925
I smell something different.

522
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,177
This smell…

523
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,469
It's the Chihuahua.

524
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,222
There she is!

525
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,268
Hey, Chihuahua!

526
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,855
What are you doing here?
Why are you wandering around like a stray?

527
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,773
I'm not a stray.

528
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,109
I'm waiting for my madam.

529
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,239
Hey, don't you mean your "owner"?

530
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,034
Your owner just went in without you.

531
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,620
They're having fun and eating good food

532
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,080
while you're here all alone.

533
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,457
That's good.

534
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,708
What do you mean?

535
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:54,128
I'm happy that the madam
is having fun and eating good food.

536
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:56,797
That's true love!

537
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,050
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

538
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,136
Humans don't love animals. Got that?

539
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,724
They're just in love
with the idea of loving animals.

540
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:07,808
Darn it.

541
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:12,063
If you keep getting angry like that,
you'll get berries and go to Hell.

542
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,941
Yes, that's my plan exactly. Okay?

543
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,944
I'm dying to go to Hell.

544
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,779
This one's a lost cause. Let's go.

545
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,248
I pray for our dear brother Cheol-jin.

546
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:34,043
May he be showered with blessings.

547
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,087
Pastor, could you stamp this?

548
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,675
May Your grace always be with him
and may You watch over him.

549
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,093
Pastor.

550
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,761
One moment, Lord.

551
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,763
What is it?

552
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,932
Could you please stamp this for me?

553
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,185
You're awfully sweet
when you need a stamp.

554
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,562
That's the only way
to get you to stamp it.

555
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,531
It's not like he's some loan shark
stamping a ledger.

556
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,079
You were really waiting for me.
You should've just gone home.

557
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,789
I knew you'd be out soon.

558
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,008
-Let's go.
-Okay.

HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

560
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,764
Darn it.

561
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,810
-What's that?
-What is that?

562
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,770
Gosh!

563
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,022
They startled me!

564
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,900
Anyone with information
on the whereabouts of the runaway

565
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,527
is encouraged to report immediately…

566
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,946
Can't they at least
turn up the heat in here?

567
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,115
They're turning this place into an icebox.

568
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,200
Excuse me.
They're those things, aren't they?

569
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,118
Hell's messengers.

570
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,703
Exactly.

571
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:54,040
They've been everywhere
ever since the runaway incident.

572
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,418
When are they going to catch the runaway?
I heard they're dangerous.

573
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,586
Dangerous?

574
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:03,132
The runaway even put out
the brimstone fire before escaping.

575
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,009
Gosh, that's incredible.

576
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,261
Geez, we really need to catch them.

577
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,348
We'd like to help.

578
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,769
Do runaways have
any distinct characteristics?

579
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,063
There are none.

580
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,147
Sorry?

581
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,775
They look like us,
so you can't tell them apart.

582
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,068
Darn it.

583
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:22,985
Hold on.

584
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,654
You guys might be able to tell.

585
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,073
Us?

586
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,534
I heard they smell different.

587
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,704
They have a different scent than we do.

588
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:38,417
You guys have a keen sense of smell,
so maybe you can tell.

589
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,794
-That's true.
-Right.

590
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,088
Smell…

591
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,424
Chihuahua?

594
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,994
We confirmed it. Thank you.

595
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:14,995
Thank you.

596
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,593
Could you find someone for me?

597
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,806
I already told you last time

598
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,267
that we couldn't provide
any personal information.

599
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,478
I just want to know
if they're alive, okay?

600
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,313
Okay.

601
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:45,693
If they're still alive,
they won't show up in our database.

602
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,571
-Their name?
-Lee Young-ae.

603
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:50,948
And her age?

604
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,200
She was born in 1979,
in the Year of the Goat.

605
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,121
I'm sure Young-ae is alive and well.

606
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,708
I must be insane.

607
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,917
Oh, she's here.

608
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,588
But she doesn't seem to live here.

609
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,715
Are you saying she's dead?

610
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,925
Then why isn't she living here?

611
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,594
Maybe…

612
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,304
she's in Hell.

613
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,806
You've been on it too.

614
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,559
The subway that decides
if you go to Hell or Heaven.

615
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:30,279
So are you saying that
my name is Young-ae?

616
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,739
Lee Young-ae?

617
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,951
I don't know how you managed to forget
your own name.

618
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,245
But, yes, you're Young-ae.

619
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,790
That's why I felt a connection
when you opened the umbrella

620
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:46,086
and put your hands in my pockets
because you were scared.

621
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,923
But I grabbed you by the hair
the first time we met.

622
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:57,598
In that case, I think I am her.

623
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,646
What's going on?

624
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,941
Honey, I'm home.

625
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,401
You did that, Young-ae.

626
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,196
-Me?
-Hae-sook, your husband is here.

627
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,114
Really?

628
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,368
Hey.

629
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:19,787
What…

630
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,123
Why were you guys in there?

631
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,417
I've recovered my memories.

632
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,796
She's Young-ae.

633
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,297
Young-ae?

634
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:33,884
Where?

635
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,764
How is she Young-ae?

636
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,975
This is Heaven, you see.

637
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,185
You can change your age as you please.

638
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,939
If Sonya could transform into a human,
Young-ae could also change her looks.

639
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,483
But her personality and everything
are completely different.

640
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,319
That's just because she lost her memory.

641
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,364
Even the Service Center
couldn't locate her.

642
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,868
Why? Because she was dragged here
when she was meant for Hell.

643
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,664
Still, I doubt it.

644
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,165
You know very well

645
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,752
that Young-ae is perfectly capable
of ending up in Hell.

646
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,255
Didn't you say she was soft and kind?

647
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:15,175
She'd always break something
whenever we went to collect money.

648
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,136
-Honey--
-She's definitely Young-ae.

649
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,596
Young-ae, let's eat.

650
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,722
Yes, madam--

651
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,724
Ms. Lee.

652
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,229
As the whereabouts
of the runaway remain unknown,

653
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,940
the Support Center
has launched a public investigation.

654
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,943
They're awaiting tips from anyone
who might have spotted the runaway.

655
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,988
If you notice anyone suspicious,

656
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,365
please report them
to the Support Center immediately.

657
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,037
Som-i.

658
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,580
My name is Young-ae.

659
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,582
Did you regain your memory?

660
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,001
Honestly…

661
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,503
I don't remember everything.

662
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,465
But I have this feeling, you know?
It feels like I am her.

663
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:58,677
And considering how
I specifically sought you out,

664
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,929
don't you think
we knew each other in the past?

665
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,350
So my wife seems to be

666
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,436
absolutely convinced that you're Young-ae.

667
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,814
I'm worried she'll be hurt
when she realizes that you're not her.

668
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:15,235
But she looks happier now
than when she was angry with me.

669
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,612
Don't you agree?

670
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,197
Yes, that's true, but…

671
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,742
Young-ae, let's eat.

672
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,452
Okay, Ms. Lee.

673
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,916
You like rolled omelets.

674
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:29,833
Right.

675
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,545
What's wrong? No appetite?

676
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,923
-What?
-Then stop eating.

677
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,883
No, I'm going to eat.

678
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,388
By the way, didn't Young-ae
always use a big bowl when eating?

679
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,642
Right…

680
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,521
I can do that.
I'm going to have four bowls.

681
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,942
Right, you could do that too.

682
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,238
By the way,
how did you almost end up in Hell?

683
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,406
I'm curious too.

684
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,576
Did you go around beating people up
after I died?

685
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,539
I don't quite remember…

686
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,126
Well, that's not important anyway. Eat up.

687
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,920
This is really delicious.

688
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,555
Honey.

689
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,640
Have a good day.

690
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:32,855
Come on. Your husband is leaving for work.
You could at least look at me.

691
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,857
And Som-i…

692
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,278
It's too dangerous for Young-ae
to go outside now.

693
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,072
That runaway escaped from Hell.

694
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,659
She never even went to Hell,
so why are you worried?

695
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,744
It's not Young-ae.

696
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,290
Even if it's not her,
there's a dangerous criminal out there.

697
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:54,209
All the more reason I should go with her.

698
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:59,047
If any bad guy shows up,
I can take them down with one kick.

699
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,050
That's true. I have nothing to worry about
if she's by my side.

700
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,886
-Let's go.
-Okay, Ms. Lee.

701
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,478
How long do you have to attend church?

702
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,397
The minimum is 60 hours.

703
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,316
All because of those darn berries.

704
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,817
This is all your fault.

705
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,738
None of this would've happened
had you not changed your looks.

706
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:27,493
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.
How's the church working out for you?

707
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,620
It's absolute torture.

708
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,371
I don't think I click with pastors.

709
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,499
No, I think this pastor is the issue.

710
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,752
He's so picky and has such an attitude.

711
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,462
That's not all.

712
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:42,799
Everything he says sounds so obnoxious.
And you should see what he looks like.

713
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,093
Oh my!

714
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,014
Damn it.

715
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:55,729
No matter how I look at it,
I don't think it's that Chihuahua.

716
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:58,232
She looks too innocent.

717
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,943
Pure evil is approaching.

718
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:16,750
See? What did I tell you?
I knew something was off from the get-go.

719
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,919
-Ms. Lee.
-Goodness.

720
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,879
-What's wrong?
-I have allergies.

721
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,090
Why is there so much dog fur
flying around?

722
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,677
These damn dogs.

723
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,473
Damn it.

724
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,065
Geez, my tail keeps curling in.

725
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,149
What do we do now?

726
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,486
What do you think? We kidnap her.

727
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,655
But she looks so strong.

728
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:49,783
I doubt we can subdue her,
so how will we kidnap her?

729
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,159
Let's make them adopt me.

730
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,912
We'll take her when she's asleep.

731
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:54,997
Will that work?

732
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,499
We'll have to take drastic measures.

733
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,675
Excuse me.

734
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,724
Is something wrong?

735
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:39,833
Adopt me! Do it!

736
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,462
Aren't I cute? I know I am!

737
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,173
-Aren't I just adorable?
-So cute!

738
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,303
Adopt me! Do it!

739
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,430
No.

740
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,390
Hae-sook is allergic to dog fur. I can't.

741
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:59,019
Geez, but she's fine with cats.

742
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,438
That's why we adopted one. Sorry.

743
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:10,405
Okay. It's fine
as long as there's no fur, right?

744
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,784
Do it.

745
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,635
-It happens all the time.
-You're right.

746
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,014
Oh my, Sister Hae-sook is here.

747
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:40,018
How did you know
we just finished our sacred labor?

748
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,730
Yes, you should've cleaned up.
A pastor shouldn't be so untidy.

749
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,441
What's all this?

750
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,069
What's with this sack of beans?

751
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,654
Well, those are…

752
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,031
To work on while I slept?

753
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:53,949
That's right.

754
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,202
You must've slept all the time
for me to have prepared--

755
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:01,873
Why would you prepare this and wait for me
when all I do is sleep?

756
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,209
Wait? Who said anything about waiting?

757
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:08,088
The person I've been waiting for
is our devoted brother, Cheol-jin,

758
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,757
not some fake believer like you.

759
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,177
I can make some mean soy milk, you see.

760
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,639
All the kids in the neighborhood
who didn't get enough milk

761
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,933
grew up drinking my soy milk.

762
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:23,895
Gosh, I really love soy milk.

763
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,815
Really? Then should I soak
some beans right now?

764
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,402
By the way,
your clothes are wet today too.

765
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,320
Do you sweat a lot?

766
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,406
-Excuse me, sister.
-Yes?

767
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,241
If you're at church,

768
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,618
you should at least pretend
to listen to the sermon.

769
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,661
You always eat--

770
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,289
Are you saying
you won't drink this savory milk?

771
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,753
Did you know

772
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,589
I learned to count by sorting beans
when I was little?

773
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,550
Back then,

774
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:57,471
we were taught how to shake off
sesame seeds and patch quilts

775
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,765
even before we knew how to read.

776
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,602
It's all in the past now,
so I try not to dwell on it.

777
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,022
But I really did have a tough life.

778
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:12,277
I lost my parents
before I even turned one.

779
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:17,699
And the person who raised me
turned out to be my father's devoted wife.

780
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,701
I was the child of his mistress.

781
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,206
Somehow, I managed to survive.

782
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,083
Finally, I met a man who cared for me.

783
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,170
We got married, and I thought
I could finally live in peace.

784
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:32,881
But then, he had an accident.

785
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,383
He couldn't walk anymore.

786
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,846
So I had to become the breadwinner
and work like a dog.

787
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,557
We had a good marriage.

788
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:48,271
After he passed,
I followed him to this place.

789
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,191
And I just had to pick this age.

790
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:55,529
Can you believe that he mistreats
a woman as unfortunate as me?

791
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:56,446
Come on.

792
00:51:57,322 --> 00:52:00,659
Look, you haven't heard my story yet.

793
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,327
I had quite an unfortunate life too.

794
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,329
Would it be okay
if I shared my story as well?

795
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,623
Why ask when you're already talking?

796
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:12,796
At least you know who your parents are.

797
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:15,924
As for me,
I don't even know who my parents are.

798
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:21,346
I lost them when I was five,
so I have absolutely no memory of them.

799
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,431
Good grief.

800
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,268
Right? Doesn't it already sound
utterly tragic?

801
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,937
But you became a pastor, so--

802
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,647
Why do you think I became one?

803
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,899
Before I got lost,

804
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,569
my mother had told me
to wait in front of a church.

805
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,028
That's why.

806
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:41,157
I thought maybe
she'd come looking for me someday.

807
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,078
We're not competing for who had it worse.

808
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,707
Fine. You've had it harder.

809
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:49,624
Are you happy now?

810
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:54,170
Let's also hear Brother Cheol-jin's story
before making a decision.

811
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,965
Well, I…

812
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,842
It's nothing, really.

813
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,680
All right! I'm here!

814
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,891
Take a look!

815
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,727
Factory direct prices! Lowest sale prices!

816
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,812
They're very cheap!

817
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,272
-No, I can't do that.
-Come on.

818
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,690
-Just 10,000 won!
-That's a loss.

819
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,317
-No--
-Thank you, sir! Come again!

820
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,485
-Ma'am! I said no!
-Bye!

821
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,446
Seriously.

822
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,700
Oh my.

823
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,620
You must've been bored.

824
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,538
Oh my.

825
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,792
You must be starving.

826
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,268
Here. Open up.

827
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,480
Oh dear.

828
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,243
This is delicious.

829
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,372
Maybe it's tastier
because you're eating with me. Right?

830
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,044
Could you put them down when eating?

831
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,424
Do you remember

832
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:26,137
how I visited your mother's store
every day because of your soy broth?

833
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,307
But that was just an excuse.

834
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,854
I actually came by
to see my beautiful wife's face.

835
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,670
Mr. Park Cheol-jin,
you have stage four colon cancer.

836
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,008
Even with financial support,

837
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,969
you'll need over a million won
for your wife's care monthly.

838
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,388
Is there anyone else
who could look after her?

839
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,869
There. How is it?

840
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,248
Are you not cold?

841
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,424
Honey.

842
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,303
Today was really fun.

843
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:31,805
Wasn't it?

844
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,517
It's crazy to think

845
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:39,145
we never did that all these years.

846
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:50,615
Even if you go to the afterlife,
just stay put and don't wander off.

847
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,078
We shouldn't miss each other.

848
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,644
Goodness.

849
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:22,647
So that's why
your clothes were always wet.

850
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:29,195
How is that nothing?

851
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,658
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

852
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,327
Runaway located.
Deploy the arrest team immediately.

853
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:46,212
Jjajang, I think they located the runaway.

854
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,338
What do we do?

855
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,632
We can't let her get caught.
We have to find her first!

856
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,057
-It's that way! I smell her!
-Where?

857
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,101
We found them! Requesting backup now!

858
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,334
There. She's inside there.

859
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:31,633
Darn it!

860
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,013
We've confirmed
the runaway is inside the church.

861
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,098
But there are hostages inside.

862
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,643
Oh dear.

863
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:43,811
Once I know for sure

864
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:47,440
that my wife made it to Heaven,

865
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,653
I'll go back to Hell.

866
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:54,697
I'll return

867
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,825
and accept punishment

868
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,245
for all my sins.

869
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:02,497
"Go back"?

870
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,874
You're going back to Hell?

871
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,876
Runaway Park Cheol-jin!

872
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,670
Drop your weapon and surrender now!

873
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,718
Goodness!

874
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,429
Goodness. Brother Cheol-jin.

875
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,307
I need to see my wife.

876
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,561
I begged them in Hell
just to tell me if my wife was okay,

877
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,771
but they wouldn't even tell me that!

878
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:29,857
I understand. Put down the knife first,
and we can talk--

879
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:30,775
At this point,

880
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,610
I've got nothing to lose.

881
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,362
-No, wait!
-No!

882
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:35,697
Cheol-jin!

883
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,533
Stay back.

884
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,535
Come any closer, and I'll kill you all!

885
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,703
Cheol-jin!

886
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,249
CRYSTAL CLEAR CALLS WORLDWIDE

887
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,586
Hello, this is Angel TV.

888
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,422
I'm reporting live from outside the church

889
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:56,467
where the runaway from Hell
is currently holding hostages.

890
00:59:57,176 --> 01:00:00,138
The president has just arrived as I speak.

891
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,067
Mr. Park Cheol-jin.

892
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:16,946
You don't belong here.

893
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,450
Please don't create
another situation you'll regret.

894
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:21,868
I don't regret anything!

895
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,079
I'd do the same thing all over again
even if I went back in time.

896
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,915
Did you ask your wife for her opinion

897
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,627
before making that final decision?

898
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,130
Did she consent to it?

899
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:37,842
Answer me.

900
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:40,970
Once I died…

901
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,266
Then who would've taken care
of my sick wife once I died?

902
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,186
She would've died miserably

903
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:51,189
after jumping from one facility to another
once I died!

904
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,277
I truly believed
it was better for us to go together.

905
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,737
No one,

906
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,114
not even your parents,

907
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,284
has the right to take your life.

908
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:05,953
Then…

909
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,874
Then what should I have done?

910
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,837
Tell me what I should have done.

911
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,924
Death is also part of life.

912
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:22,011
Everyone has the right
to make decisions about their own life.

913
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,974
It's not a sin that you killed yourself.

914
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,144
But you have sinned
by taking your wife's life.

915
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:32,063
So,

916
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,691
if you truly feel sorry for her,

917
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:39,028
come out right now
and face the consequences.

918
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:42,240
I want to know

919
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,368
if she made it to Heaven.

920
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,120
I cannot grant you that privilege.

921
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:50,790
What's the big deal
about telling me that one thing?

922
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,375
Cheol-jin!

923
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,086
Why are you pushing me over the edge?

924
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:01,175
Hell is like a scale.

925
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,428
Sins are repaid
with punishment of equal weight.

926
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:07,932
Once you've paid for your sins,

927
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,059
you'll get another chance.

928
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:11,853
Don't lie.

929
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,688
If you continue doing this,

930
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,899
you'll be completely erased
from existence.

931
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,277
If that happens,

932
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,029
you may never get another chance.

933
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:25,283
Do you think your wife would want that?

934
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,294
A scarf?

935
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,020
There's still time.

936
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,935
Goodness. Here you go, sir.

937
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,731
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

938
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:39,941
You must live around here.

939
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:43,277
Of course. I'm a local around here.

940
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,822
The area has changed a lot, hasn't it?

941
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:46,739
Sir.

942
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:50,493
I was wondering if you knew
a man named Kang Jeong-gu

943
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,371
who used to live around here.

944
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,083
-Kang Jeong-gu?
-Yes.

945
01:03:59,085 --> 01:03:59,919
Yes.

946
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:03,464
-The former police officer?
-Yes, that's him.

947
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,883
-Do you know him?
-You bet I do.

948
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:09,679
We drank a lot together
and had good times.

949
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,430
-I know him well.
-Excuse me.

950
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:15,935
Stay back.
Come any closer, and I'll kill you all!

951
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:28,364
I believe we've given you
enough time to think.

952
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,246
Wait! Hae-sook!

953
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:36,539
Just a moment, please!

954
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,499
Wait! Hae-sook!

955
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:43,337
My wife

956
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:45,631
is in there.

957
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,135
And…

958
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,311
There's also a package here
for Mr. Park Cheol-jin.

959
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,442
I'll deliver this package to him myself.

960
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:09,030
Isn't that my job as the postman?

961
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,385
Cheol-jin.

962
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,598
Mr. Park Cheol-jin, correct?

963
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,225
This is…

964
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:40,353
for you.

965
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,245
WHOLESALE GLOVES

966
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:19,183
Those darn chopsticks.

967
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:23,104
Do you love food that much?
More than your own husband?

968
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,408
Even as her memories faded,

969
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,662
her desire to knit a scarf
for you remained.

970
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:45,459
It's okay.

971
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,631
It's okay, Cheol-jin.

972
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:57,054
It's all right, Cheol-jin.

973
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,223
It's okay.

974
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,189
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

975
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,941
-No, I'm okay.
-What? Let me see.

976
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,569
I'm okay.

977
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:14,447
I was so worried.

978
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:25,916
Cheol-jin.

979
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:30,713
Let's go.

980
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:35,092
We need to go.

981
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,727
You have to go to Hell
if you want another chance.

982
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:50,775
Don't you want to see your wife

983
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,737
who's in Heaven one day?

984
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:12,546
Here he comes.

985
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,423
He's coming out.

986
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:45,371
I should've made him some soy broth
before he left.

987
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:49,041
You went through a lot.

988
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,685
Young-ae, we're home.

989
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:30,791
I was wondering where you were.
What are you doing in there?

990
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:33,544
I was so scared, Ms. Lee.

991
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:35,254
Gosh, Young-ae.

992
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:39,675
How have you become even more childlike?

993
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:42,094
Goodness, Young-ae.

994
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,138
Young-ae.

995
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:35,522
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

996
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,608
Why do you have five grape berries?

997
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:38,776
Even Hae-sook herself

998
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,445
wasn't sure

999
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:45,366
whether or not she truly deserved
to be in Heaven.

1000
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,286
Hae-sook has gone to Hell, sir.

1001
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,580
Please save her. I'm begging you.

1002
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,706
Nak-joon.

1003
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:55,668
You have yet to know
what Hell is really like.

1004
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,422
There's nothing more we can do.

1005
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,549
I'll take her with me once I find her.

1006
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:06,679
Everything that happens from now on
is your responsibility, Mr. Ko.

1007
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,430
I know what I'm getting into.

1008
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:10,599
Hae-sook!

1009
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,476
Lee Hae-sook!

1010
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,110
