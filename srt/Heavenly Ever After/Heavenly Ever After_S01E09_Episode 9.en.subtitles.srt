1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,966
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

2
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,763
Som-i did that

3
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,098
to a police officer?

4
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,977
Excuse me,
but could you tell me your name?

5
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,062
-Me?
-Yes.

6
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,273
I'm the Yeongdeungpo Great White Shark,
Kang Jeong-gu!

7
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,404
Are you Detective Kang Jeong-gu?

8
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,115
Kang Jeong-gu.

9
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,450
Kang Jeong-gu!

10
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,791
Are you Detective Kang Jeong-gu?

11
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,835
Why are you staring at me?

12
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,253
Do you know me?

13
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,631
You know me, don't you?

14
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,800
Who are you?

15
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,676
Don't you recognize me?

16
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,430
Ko Nak-joon.

17
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,349
"Nak-joon"?

18
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,435
Who's that?

19
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:44,729
"Ko Nak-joon"?

20
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,231
Hold on.

21
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,108
The Ko Nak-joon I know

22
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,530
can't be standing
in front of me like this.

23
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:54,948
What did you do?

24
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,075
-What?
-Who did you sell him off to?

25
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,660
Who did you sell him off to?

26
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,453
-Help me!
-Answer me!

27
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,455
-Someone, help me!
-Answer me!

28
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,873
Help me!

29
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,166
Who did you sell him off to?

30
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,209
Let go of me!

31
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,460
Let me go! Help me!

32
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,212
The Hawaiian shirt.

33
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,220
Get off me!

34
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,805
Hey!

35
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,475
-Wait.
-Kang Jeong-gu! Get back here!

36
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,434
Kang Jeong-gu!

37
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,353
-Come on.
-Hey! Where are you going?!

38
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,815
I wasn't the only one doing it back then.

39
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,400
Anyone who didn't do it was an idiot.

40
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,694
Calm down. Geez!

41
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,490
Yes, I remember now.

42
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,542
Somebody!

43
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,210
Call for help!

44
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,839
-Someone is dying!
-Over here!

45
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,340
Call for help!

46
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,186
Is this 911?

47
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,648
Yes, there was an accident here.

48
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,944
An elderly man was struck by a truck.
He's bleeding badly.

49
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,072
What's going on?

50
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,367
Am I dead?

51
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,622
No.

52
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,124
No way. Out of the blue?

53
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,001
What?

54
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,502
The Grim Reaper will be here soon.

55
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,963
Answer me. Who did you sell him off to?

56
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,715
Did I die for nothing

57
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,344
because of you?

58
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,724
It's all your fault! If it wasn't for you…

59
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,561
It's all your fault!

60
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,856
-Let go…
-I'll kill you too, you bastard.

61
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,942
You bastard!

62
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,748
Kang Jeong-gu.

63
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,541
Kang Jeong-gu.

64
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,834
Kang Jeong-gu.

65
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,212
Som-i.

66
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,259
Som-i!

67
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,073
Som-i.

68
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,242
You have to let go.

69
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,328
Som-i, let go. Okay?

70
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,622
He could erase you, Som-i.

71
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,724
Som-i.

72
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,395
Mr. Ko Nak-joon.

73
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,440
Since you were unable to return,

74
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,607
you'll be erased.

75
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,693
Even if you manage to return,

76
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,654
you won't get off easy this time.

77
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:33,958
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE

78
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,633
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

79
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,723
Even the president
has to go home at some point.

80
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:56,522
I doubt he set up traps
all the way out here.

81
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,573
Who are they? Are they on a tour?

82
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,577
Are they here from Hell?

83
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,787
Correct.

84
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,290
The president is supposed to
handle the orientation.

85
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,793
You see, something came up on Earth.

86
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,046
What's this? Why is my heart pounding?

87
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,298
Could it be…

88
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,425
Hello, sir!

89
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,806
What was that?

90
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,599
Did he not see me?

91
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,560
The president's orientation
scheduled for today

92
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,312
will be replaced with a video.

93
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,730
Let's move for now.

94
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,440
Follow me, please.

95
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,602
These silly little flower rings.

96
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,524
It's not like they exchanged
wedding rings or anything.

97
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,612
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

98
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,219
Does this mean
you can't work on Earth anymore?

99
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,430
Yes.

100
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,476
I'm lucky I wasn't erased from existence.

101
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,108
This was all my decision,

102
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,319
so don't feel guilty about anything.

103
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,196
How can I not?

104
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,406
If only I hadn't done that…

105
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,909
By the way,

106
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,538
what's between you and that old man
that you reacted like that earlier?

107
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,292
Honestly, I didn't act that way

108
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,255
because of my memories or emotions.

109
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,885
I was charging at him
before I even knew it.

110
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,555
The moment I saw him choking you,

111
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,890
I completely lost it.

112
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,185
This might sound strange,

113
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,021
but I really didn't even think.

114
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,564
At that moment,

115
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:47,610
all I wanted to do was protect you
even if something happened to me.

116
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,408
I see.

117
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,641
You're late.

118
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,602
Yes. Something came up.

119
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,647
What happened?

120
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,115
What's going on?

121
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,450
Did they fight or something?

122
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,121
Young-ae, go sleep in your room.

123
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,414
Sweetie.

124
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,499
Gosh.

125
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,510
What happened on Earth?

126
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,429
Is it about Som-i?

127
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,767
I'm sorry, but can we talk tomorrow?

128
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,019
I'm a bit tired.

129
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,522
Okay. What about dinner?

130
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,986
I guess you don't have an appetite.

131
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,155
All right. Get some rest.

132
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,906
Okay. I'm sorry.

133
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,925
It's wrong to grill someone
who just came home exhausted.

134
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,262
But it'd feel a bit late
to talk about it tomorrow.

135
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,097
Whatever.

136
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,016
Geez.

137
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,861
I'm always ready to listen,

138
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:54,945
so you can tell me.

139
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,325
Tell you what?

140
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,912
Something's up with you.

141
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,041
Ever since your trip to Earth
a few days ago,

142
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,460
you haven't been eating right.

143
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,755
You've been tossing in your sleep.

144
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,551
No, I'm okay.

145
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,762
What is it?

146
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,223
Do you regret

147
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,558
regaining your memory?

148
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,896
No, I couldn't find it.

149
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,233
Then what have you been doing
with Mr. Ko on Earth?

150
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,403
Did you guys go on dates or something?

151
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,196
Of course not.

152
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,539
About love…

153
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,460
Yes?

154
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,798
I don't think
it's something you can just force.

155
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,805
They say no tree stands
after being struck ten times.

156
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,809
But today,

157
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,521
I feel like it's time we asked the tree

158
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,399
how it feels.

159
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,360
That's what I think.

160
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,115
I see.

161
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,553
When did she prepare all these?

162
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,516
They look so delicious.

163
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,242
Don't just stand there. Come sit.

164
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,288
Is it someone's birthday today?

165
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,874
This is a grand breakfast. I love it.

166
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,043
-You're right.
-I couldn't sleep,

167
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,129
so I decided to cook a bit.
I'll bring some over to the pastor too.

168
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,800
Eat up.

169
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,434
Yesterday must've been
really tough for you.

170
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,478
It was okay.

171
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,105
By the way, what does Som-i do on Earth?

172
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,816
Can she even help with your work?

173
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,403
He must have his reasons for taking her.

174
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,406
Are you not hungry?

175
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,287
Here. I grilled this
with sesame oil this morning.

176
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,956
It's not old.

177
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,874
Try some.

178
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,752
Okay. Thank you.

179
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,798
This is delicious.

180
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,347
I'll do it.

181
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,265
It's okay.

182
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,183
I'm just doing it because I'm bored.

183
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,524
That's just how we are.

184
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,362
When you're told not to do something,
you want to do it even more.

185
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,491
When you're told to stay away,
you want to cling even tighter.

186
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,204
She's not an ingrate.

187
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,623
She'll sort out her feelings and back off.

188
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,502
Geez.

189
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,634
The only person in Heaven
who'd hang a clothesline

190
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,303
would be you.

191
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,389
Just shake them out and hang them.

192
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,432
Okay, got it.

193
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,356
Heading out now?

194
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,152
Have a good day. You can do it!

195
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,154
Thanks.

196
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,615
Goodbye.

197
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,743
Is this really a blanket?

198
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,870
This is basically a rag.

199
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,831
At least it'll dry quickly.

200
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,810
What's going on?

201
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,438
Why is my heart pounding so much?

202
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,608
Is the president nearby or something?

203
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,902
No, you can't.

204
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,404
Please!

205
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,074
Lee Young-ae is my daughter!

206
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,743
We cannot disclose that information.
Please leave.

207
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,509
Young-ae…

208
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,023
Do you think he's among these people?

209
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,693
That old man who died.

210
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,614
He might've come in a form
we wouldn't recognize.

211
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,951
No, I don't think he's here.

212
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,413
He probably can't come.

213
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,292
How did you guys know each other?

214
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,343
Something unpleasant happened in the past.

215
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,096
That's when I got to know him.

216
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,600
Does that mean he's too evil to be here?

217
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,229
That was something

218
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,481
I wanted to find out.

219
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,988
If it became certain
that he really was an evil person,

220
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,200
the truth I would have to accept…

221
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,746
frightened me.

222
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,959
But now…

223
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,377
Gosh.

224
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,671
There's no way to find out.

225
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,926
I'm not trying to blame you.

226
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,261
I'm just…

227
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,805
I'm just frustrated.

228
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,225
Pretending to go to work
like this every day

229
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,061
is frustrating.

230
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,857
Why don't we just tell her
that I caused some trouble?

231
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,776
I don't want to make Hae-sook worry.

232
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,988
She's already suffered too much
because of me.

233
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,495
I envy her.

234
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,708
We should get going.

235
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,251
I have something to tell you.

236
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:08,921
What is it?

237
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:44,039
Mark, Chapter 11, Verse 23.

238
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,042
"Truly I tell you,

239
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,796
if anyone says to this mountain,
'Go, throw yourself into the sea--'"

240
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,422
Is he upset?

241
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,633
He never looked at me once.

242
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,262
"Therefore I tell you,

243
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:02,266
whatever you ask for in prayer,
believe that you have received it,

244
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:06,228
and it will be yours."

245
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,148
Amen.

246
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,233
Gosh, you startled me!

247
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,985
What are you doing?

248
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,319
You finally looked at me.

249
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,824
You're suddenly keeping your distance.

250
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,661
Are you still upset
about the rice wine incident?

251
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,539
No, I'm not.

252
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,125
I just think

253
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,587
we should return to a more standard

254
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,255
pastor-churchgoer relationship.

255
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,175
Don't you think
we've come too far for that?

256
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,052
What?

257
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,391
I thought about bringing sweet rice,

258
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,020
but I wanted you to have this
while it was still fresh.

259
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,565
See how well I take care of you?

260
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,401
Be honest.
Have you ever met a churchgoer like me?

261
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,448
This is called sweet scorched rice.

262
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,284
It's made with glutinous rice,
so it's chewy.

263
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:06,246
It's caramelized with brown sugar,
chestnuts, and dates.

264
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,375
-Here, try some.
-What?

265
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,340
-It's good, right?
-This is delicious.

266
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,551
This is a delicacy.

267
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,805
No wonder people say, "My child is
as precious as sweet scorched rice."

268
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,433
I didn't know there was such a saying.

269
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,937
There isn't.
I just made that up to tease you.

270
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:38,028
It seems like teasing me
is your greatest joy in life.

271
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,156
I guess so. I know I shouldn't,

272
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,576
but bantering with you like this is fun.

273
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,913
I also enjoy eating together.

274
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,290
But I guess you don't feel the same way.

275
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,795
No, you're wrong.

276
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,755
Then talk to me.

277
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,217
I've told you every little thing about me.

278
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,344
It goes both ways, you know?

279
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,306
Who will you talk to if not me? No one.

280
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,569
When I have something I want to say,

281
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,572
I pray.

282
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,350
Are you having a staring contest?

283
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:54,813
No.

284
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,026
I just want to understand
the meaning of this silence.

285
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,780
This silence has always been
the response to my lifelong prayers.

286
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,283
I want to know what it means.

287
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,371
A prayer

288
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:15,125
is not a tool to get what you want.

289
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,085
A prayer is

290
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,340
giving thanks for the answer
you've already received.

291
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,928
What answer?

292
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,516
What answer have I received?

293
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:36,188
I haven't received any answer
I should be thankful for.

294
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,737
"Whatever you ask for in prayer,
believe that you have received it,

295
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,783
and it will be yours."

296
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,537
It's a famous verse.

297
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,878
Prayer has its own language.

298
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,926
It's a feeling. A state of mind.

299
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,971
This language of silence

300
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,890
is the only language of prayer

301
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,767
that the universe can understand.

302
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,561
When you ask for something,

303
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,522
believe you have already received it.

304
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,941
When you desire something,

305
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,569
know by feeling
that it's already fulfilled.

306
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,240
And then,
fully savor the joy of fulfillment

307
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,660
and give thanks.

308
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,095
Faith?

309
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,972
As in saying, "Amen"?

310
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:53,849
Yes.

311
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,270
Because the very meaning of "amen"
is "So be it."

312
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,773
"So be it."

313
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,069
Should we clean that up?

314
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,954
What are you doing?

315
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,707
The dishes are already gone,
so I am happy.

316
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,084
I am happy.

317
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,336
What have you heard this whole time?

318
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,717
They're still there.

319
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,012
I was so relaxed
as if I had finished the dishes

320
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,346
and was lying down.

321
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,682
Is this right?

322
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,143
Go home.

323
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,103
I'll clean up, so go home.

324
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,023
Really? Can I?

325
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,985
It has been answered!
My prayer has been answered!

326
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,862
It really works!

327
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,371
We can finally live
without having to try our best.

328
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,457
What? How?

329
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,459
"So be it."

330
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,711
-They say you just have to pray.
-Really?

331
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,546
Back when you were a stray,

332
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,840
what did you do
when people were holding food?

333
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,510
"Excuse me, could I have just one bite?"

334
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,428
"Pretty please?"

335
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,764
"Just one bite, please. Tail wag."

336
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,767
"Just one bite. Bang!"

337
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,353
"Just one bite, please. I beg you."
This is what I did.

338
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,521
You put your all into begging.

339
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,690
You bet. I would've starved otherwise.

340
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,608
Hey.

341
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,985
Just wishing for things like that

342
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,946
-is not praying.
-Then?

343
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,280
-In times like that…
-Yes?

344
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,242
"That food you're holding

345
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,203
shall be mine."

346
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:39,955
-Amen!
-Amen…

347
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,749
That came out naturally, didn't it?

348
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,084
That's it.

349
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,586
Okay.

350
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,672
Let's try this, okay?

351
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:50,757
There will be

352
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:52,926
food

353
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,887
in front of me.

354
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,472
Come forward!

355
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,141
There will be food in front of me.

356
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,768
Amen. Come forward.

357
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,523
You're home early.

358
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,692
Where's Mr. Ko?

359
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,653
He needed some time alone

360
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,364
to think about something,
so I came home first.

361
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,367
Did something happen between you two?

362
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,080
What do you mean?

363
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,590
Do you really have nothing to tell me?

364
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,511
No, I don't.

365
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,680
Really? Nothing?

366
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,267
Because I do.

367
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,269
Hear me out.

368
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,273
I found someone recently

369
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,359
who makes my heart flutter.

370
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,320
But here's the thing.

371
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:57,699
We were fated to meet, but I don't think
we're destined to be together.

372
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,080
You know you should let him go deep down,

373
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,374
but it's not easy to do.

374
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:07,792
Goodness.

375
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,918
Are you in my head?

376
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,796
How do you understand my feelings so well?

377
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,762
I should believe
that it has already happened?

378
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,847
Should I give it another try?

379
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,772
My husband and I have no problems.

380
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,231
I am at peace.

381
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,193
It's all just my misunderstanding.

382
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,029
We have no problems at all.

383
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,908
I enjoy seeing my husband.

384
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,789
Oh, my! Hallelujah.

385
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,957
Why are you so surprised?

386
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,627
Because I didn't expect to see you.

387
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,170
Are you getting back from work?

388
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,297
Well, you see…

389
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,676
I was meaning to talk to you anyway.

390
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,429
About what?

391
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:03,932
The truth is

392
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,476
I won't be able to work for a while.

393
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,438
There was a bit of a problem
the last time I went to Earth.

394
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:14,025
Good. Now you won't be
hanging out with Som-i…

395
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,569
Oh, dear.

396
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,904
What are you going to do?

397
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,906
This is terrible news.

398
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,367
Why do you look so happy?

399
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,953
I'm not happy one bit.

400
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,080
Let's go home
and have a celebratory drink--

401
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,666
I mean, let's have a drink
to cheer you up.

402
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,420
This really works.

403
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,881
It's so obvious that he likes me too,

404
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,675
but he's pretending like he's not.

405
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,219
I bet he's an introvert.

406
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,889
But who am I? I love introverts.

407
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,727
You guys came home together.

408
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,353
Did you go pick her up?

409
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,730
No, we just met on the way.

410
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:55,233
So you went on a date.
It must've been nice.

411
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,402
We just met on the way.

412
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,112
Let's go inside.

413
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,326
How can someone spend

414
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,788
their whole life loving just one person?

415
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,416
Isn't it fascinating?

416
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,003
I'm talking about Ms. Lee and Mr. Ko.

417
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,716
When you fall in love…

418
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,010
Exactly.

419
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,763
They're the only one you see.

420
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,225
You don't even know when it started

421
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,812
or remember why.

422
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,357
But one day,

423
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,527
that person is just living in your head.

424
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,072
Hey, you sound just like me.

425
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,826
Look at you.

426
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,870
You like someone.

427
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:49,788
Don't you?

428
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,667
No, I was just agreeing with you.

429
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,128
You're not fooling me. Tell me the truth.

430
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,755
Who is it?

431
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,343
Fine. So you won't tell me.

432
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,514
Your world is pretty small anyway.

433
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,183
The only men you've met are…

434
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,727
What?

435
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,728
Don't tell me…

436
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,022
Is it the president?

437
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,025
No. It's not him.

438
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:19,984
Then?

439
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,319
Who else is there?

440
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,403
There's no one.

441
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,907
It's not like
you have feelings for Mr. Ko.

442
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,620
I doubt it would ever happen,

443
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,414
but I'm warning you just in case.

444
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,499
He's off-limits.

445
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,877
Why? Because he's Ms. Lee's husband.

446
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,879
I know that.

447
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,091
I hate anyone who hurts Ms. Lee.

448
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,176
Even if it's him.

449
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,011
Give me my money!

450
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,263
Give it to me!

451
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,249
Are you mad?

452
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,960
I'm not mad at you.

453
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,046
I'm mad at myself.

454
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,926
I'm mad at myself

455
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,014
for only teaching you things like that.

456
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,434
I'm sorry.

457
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,269
I won't do it again.

458
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,272
I'm sorry.

459
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,901
Don't ever do that again.

460
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:43,902
Okay.

461
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,947
But I didn't listen.

462
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,033
I acted out even more.

463
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,786
Because if I acted out more,
people would curse me.

464
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,039
And if they cursed me,

465
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,291
they wouldn't curse Ms. Lee.

466
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,630
She must've been glad to have you.

467
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,466
No.

468
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,260
It was the other way around.

469
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,264
I'm not an orphan,

470
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,391
but I don't have parents.

471
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,478
I don't have parents, but I have a family.

472
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,023
Ms. Lee is my family, my everything.

473
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,068
So I won't ever forgive anyone

474
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,153
who hurts her.

475
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,365
Even if it's you, my sworn sister.

476
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:33,743
Okay.

477
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,331
But that won't happen.

478
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,960
I want to be in love.

479
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,609
Are you having trouble sleeping?

480
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,363
Why are you still up?

481
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,658
I can't sleep either.

482
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,289
Try to sleep.

483
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,168
I'll head back in.

484
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,798
Good night.

485
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,681
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

486
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,600
There will be food in front of me…

487
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,020
-Amen…
-Gosh.

488
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,355
When is the food coming?

489
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:46,899
You.

490
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,193
Did you quietly pray,

491
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,656
"Please give me food"?

492
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,325
What? What are you saying? Of course not.

493
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,785
It's all your fault.

494
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,246
That's not how you pray.

495
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,164
Whatever.

496
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,250
I'm starving to death right now!
What choice do I have other than to beg?

497
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,668
You're hopeless.

498
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,588
I…

499
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,132
shall bite

500
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,509
your side.

501
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,471
Are you crazy?
Have you really lost your mind?

502
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,680
How could you bite me?

503
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,767
I…

504
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,187
shall bite your tail!

505
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,441
I…

506
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,943
shall bite your hind leg

507
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,196
with my fangs!

508
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,866
I…

509
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,744
I shall bite your ear

510
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,663
and hit you!

511
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,127
What are you two doing?

512
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,337
Well…

513
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,465
We were praying.

514
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,552
We were thinking that
what we desired was already fulfilled.

515
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,473
You got the gist right.

516
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,769
But how about praying for something
a bit more meaningful?

517
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,354
Meaningful?

518
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,442
Picture a better version
of yourself than you are now

519
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:15,863
and fully savor the feeling
of when it's been achieved.

520
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,408
Keep praying hard.

521
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,163
I need to fully savor

522
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,374
the feeling of fulfillment?

523
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:34,215
I'm doing something exciting.

524
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,135
The bad people before me

525
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,887
are trembling in fear.

526
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,475
I am satisfied with my work.

527
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:48,896
A full-time job.

528
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:51,899
How rewarding.

529
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,278
How rewarding.

530
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,450
What's going on?

531
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,622
Gosh, you startled me!

532
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,332
Your prayer has been answered.

533
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,667
-What?
-What?

534
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,962
Exciting, bad people, a full-time job.

535
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:14,922
Right.

536
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,175
-Let's go.
-Go where?

537
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,677
You will be working in Hell.

538
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,512
Wait, but I didn't pray.

539
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,514
You were in Jjajang's prayer.

540
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,724
What?

541
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,475
Hey, your prayers are incredible.

542
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,811
Wait! I didn't pray!

543
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,980
Don't take me!

544
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,565
I don't want to go!

545
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,402
My daughter…

546
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,487
Please find my daughter…

547
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,657
My daughter…

548
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,035
Please find my daughter.

549
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,286
Please.

550
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,001
Please find her.

551
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,087
Young-ae… My daughter…

552
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,381
Your daughter?

553
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,383
Right.

554
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,428
Do you mean the daughter
you abandoned when you were alive?

555
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,977
I'd rather go back to Hell!

556
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,146
I can't…

557
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,732
I can't bear it anymore!

558
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,860
Your life on Earth

559
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,488
may have been your choice.

560
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,573
But your life here

561
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,908
is your responsibility.

562
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,245
No matter how hard it gets,
you must endure it.

563
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,457
Your true suffering

564
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,460
begins now.

565
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,305
Come on!

566
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,935
The president
is really not here right now.

567
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,729
After I talk to him today,

568
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,731
I won't ever be coming back here.

569
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,858
-So please let me enter.
-No!

570
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,235
Please!

571
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,822
-I mean it. He's really not here! Please!
-Geez.

572
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,159
-What's wrong?
-Judging by how my heart is pounding,

573
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,161
he must be nearby.

574
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,329
What?

575
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:11,789
What?

576
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,999
What's wrong?

577
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,793
Looks like he's over there.

578
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,379
He's coming.

579
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,089
What? He's coming.

580
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,799
He's getting closer.

581
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,098
See? Sweetie!

582
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,201
Young-ae?

583
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,746
Young-ae, is it really you?

584
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,768
Hey, Young-ae.

585
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:15,936
Young-ae.

586
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,689
What's wrong? Got a stomachache?

587
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,069
What's wrong with her?

588
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,032
What's wrong?

589
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,872
Young-ae, what's wrong?

590
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,874
What's wrong?

591
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,459
Tell me. Young-ae.

592
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,628
What's going on?

593
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,254
Goodness, what's wrong?

594
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,174
Goodness, what's wrong? Stop it.

595
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:48,302
What startled you so much? Tell us--

596
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,763
-What's wrong?
-Why is she acting like this?

597
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,308
Yes? Coming. I'll go.

598
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,768
It's okay.

599
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,273
Who are you?

600
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:02,858
Is Young-ae here?

601
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,568
-What? Hold on.
-Young-ae!

602
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,154
What about Young-ae?
Who are you and what do you want with her?

603
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,948
Please let me meet her.

604
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,324
Hold on. Please wait here.

605
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,242
Young-ae!

606
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,160
-Stop!
-It's Dad! Can you hear me?!

607
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,912
Young-ae!

608
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,247
"Dad"?

609
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,832
How are you here?

610
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,751
How dare you call yourself her dad?

611
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,044
Leave this instant!

612
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,629
Ma'am, you know me.

613
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,923
I know you, all right!

614
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,884
Don't hurt Young-ae anymore and just go.

615
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,430
I really need to talk to her.

616
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,681
Leave!

617
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,434
Young-ae!

618
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,271
Are you okay?

619
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,525
Young-ae! Your father is here!

620
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,572
Where the hell are you?!

621
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,133
He's gone.

622
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,968
He's gone. Mr. Ko sent him away.

623
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,011
Don't worry.

624
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,554
It's okay. He's gone.

625
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,264
You poor thing.

626
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,558
He's gone. You're okay.

627
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,059
You're all right.

628
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,695
I screamed so much

629
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,780
that I'm completely drained.

630
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,741
I hate it.

631
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:35,701
So much.

632
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,328
I know how you feel.

633
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,622
Hate your father all you want.

634
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,832
No one will blame you.

635
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,083
It's okay.

636
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,919
-It's okay.
-Not him.

637
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,589
I hate myself

638
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,967
for just taking the beating

639
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,470
without saying anything

640
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,347
back then.

641
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,391
I hate myself.

642
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,559
Don't you know
doing this hurts her even more?

643
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,896
I don't care what punishment I receive.

644
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:50,526
But I can't let Young-ae get hurt
because of me, even after death.

645
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,070
She says she can't forgive you.

646
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,447
You're selfish to the very end.

647
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,118
What? Did you
turn over a new leaf after dying?

648
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,911
Why apologize now?

649
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:04,832
Yes.

650
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,460
I should take this up with the person
who sent you here.

651
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,712
That's the right thing to do.

652
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,505
-Young-ae--
-Get up.

653
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,549
-Follow me.
-Hey.

654
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,759
Young-ae.

655
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,478
I guess I have to cause
this much of a scene to see you,

656
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,606
Mr. Great President.

657
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,775
I have a lot on my plate.

658
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,112
Well, you're gonna get busier now.

659
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,366
How could such a sinful man like him

660
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,036
brazenly be
walking around Heaven like this?

661
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,414
He should still be burning
in the flames of Hell.

662
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,625
He was already burned.

663
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,251
Roasted, even.

664
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:55,507
Does he look happy to you right now?

665
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,217
He shouldn't be happy!

666
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,428
You're right.

667
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,305
If he's still unhappy,

668
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,183
then even this place
is no different from Hell

669
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,101
to him.

670
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,732
We gave him
the most painful punishment possible.

671
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,109
Paternal love.

672
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,864
He never knew that feeling in life,

673
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:22,618
yet he received it here as punishment.

674
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,829
He'll be thoroughly condemned by you

675
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:30,417
and feel all your sadness and pain.

676
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,255
I'm sorry.

677
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,299
Forgive me.

678
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,426
Damn it.

679
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,471
You're no father.

680
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:44,890
How have you been?

681
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,352
"Did he finally return with the money
to take me home?"

682
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,230
"I guess he does care about me after all."

683
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,148
But you know what?

684
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,901
He had actually come by for more money.

685
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:00,322
He told her he would pay up
since his daughter was in her care.

686
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,118
That's when I knew

687
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,912
I should've never been born.

688
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:09,748
I shouldn't have.

689
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,924
So why must I

690
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:20,884
forgive him?

691
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,346
The right to forgive

692
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,141
and the right not to forgive

693
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,935
both belong entirely to you.

694
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:32,771
However,

695
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,191
regardless of your decision,

696
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,276
your father…

697
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,361
will be reincarnated.

698
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:42,322
Reincarnated?

699
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,243
You're giving this man another chance?

700
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,578
He doesn't deserve it.

701
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,122
What do you think
is the purpose of reincarnation?

702
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:54,084
He'll deal with the remaining sins

703
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,378
that even the fires of Hell

704
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,505
couldn't completely burn away.

705
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,590
In other words,

706
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,842
it's about being reborn

707
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,677
to correct and resolve

708
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,972
the mistakes made in the past.

709
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,309
That is the very purpose of reincarnation.

710
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,021
Then what difference

711
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:18,150
does it make whether I forgive him or not?

712
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:24,490
You too will carry on living
with all those memories

713
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,325
buried deep in your subconscious.

714
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,869
If you haven't forgiven him,

715
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,956
you'll keep carrying that wounded memory

716
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,751
as you repeat your life.

717
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:40,964
It's not fair.

718
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,133
I'm sure it's upsetting.

719
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:47,763
That's why reincarnation must happen.

720
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:50,140
Because it can't be finished
in just one lifetime.

721
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,354
Are you saying this connection
I desperately want to sever

722
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,939
will continue on?

723
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:57,940
Yes.

724
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,776
It has continued

725
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,903
and will continue in the future.

726
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,073
For your information,

727
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,909
you and your father…

728
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,537
were husband and wife

729
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,872
in the past.

730
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:17,834
What did you just say?

731
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,421
It wasn't a very happy ending.

732
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,592
But perhaps you two met again
as parent and child to resolve

733
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,387
the unfinished business
of that connection.

734
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,976
Though that ending
wasn't beautiful either.

735
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,853
If that's my fate,

736
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,023
I'd rather not be reborn at all.

737
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,278
Surely, you don't think
the victim of this fate…

738
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,865
is only you.

739
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,451
Do you?

740
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:54,955
Who else

741
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:56,873
is involved?

742
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:07,944
Young-ae.

743
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,365
That's enough.

744
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,284
Carry the burden of your own sins.

745
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,745
I'll carry mine.

746
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,415
Atone for your sins all your life.

747
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,463
Do you know who's the most pitiful?

748
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,426
We're not worthy
of begging that child for forgiveness.

749
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,055
Does this mean

750
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,391
you've forgiven me?

751
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,771
That's right.

752
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:45,440
You really have to be
this shameless to be abandoned

753
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,026
by both of your daughters in a row.

754
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,001
You

755
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,170
were my greed.

756
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,467
I was sick and tired

757
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,554
of smiling at men

758
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,681
and selling them drinks.

759
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,352
That's why I coveted someone else's place.

760
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,702
Everyone used to call me
a whore with no roots.

761
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,080
But when I gave birth to you,
their own flesh and blood,

762
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,582
they gave me the guest room.

763
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,929
They might've given me the master room
had you been a son.

764
00:50:58,847 --> 00:50:59,931
But everything was okay.

765
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,936
Except for your constant crying.

766
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:15,906
I never held you or breastfed you.

767
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,908
That was my greed too.

768
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,827
I was afraid I'd let myself go
while raising you

769
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:24,623
and would be abandoned by him
because he didn't want me anymore.

770
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,625
Come on.

771
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,592
You were nursed in the arms of a woman

772
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,220
who wasn't even related to you.

773
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,680
But you amazingly grew so much every day

774
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,433
like grass after the rain.

775
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,063
Telegram.

776
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,106
Coming!

777
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,966
I nestled you in my arms,

778
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,511
and I smelled the sweet scent
of persimmon blossoms.

779
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,434
Oh, dear.

780
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,483
For the first time, I felt a desire.

781
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,195
A desire to become a mother.

782
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:40,824
We'll go now.

783
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:44,661
-Okay, be careful. You too.
-Okay.

784
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,081
Have a safe trip.

785
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,964
PARIS WESTERN GOODS SHOP

786
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,343
"I'll put these on you

787
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,554
when I go home."

788
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:07,142
"We'll hold hands and walk
to the edge of the village together."

789
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,728
"When I go home…"

790
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,696
No, my son!

791
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:27,162
How could you leave me?!

792
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,080
"When I go home…"

793
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,668
"When I go back home…"

794
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:22,968
My daughter.

795
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,470
Hae-sook.

796
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:38,858
My sweet girl.

797
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:44,739
I need to hold you while you sleep too.

798
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,669
That was our connection.

799
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:00,839
You still

800
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,508
took me in

801
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:05,969
and fed me.

802
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:10,974
We can't…

803
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,144
stay like this

804
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,480
forever, can we?

805
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,781
I wish

806
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,076
to sleep beside you like this forever.

807
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,162
Yes.

808
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:34,581
I'm just being selfish.

809
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,959
Don't forgive me.

810
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,921
Don't you dare forgive your mom.

811
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,824
Are you up?

812
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,201
Oh, this?

813
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,786
You and I are going out today.

814
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,456
I packed some gimbap, your favorite.
Sounds good, right?

815
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:00,917
Yes.

816
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,510
It feels surreal.

817
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:15,223
I can't even tell if I'm alive or dead.

818
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:21,312
I wish I had thought of coming
to nice places with you earlier.

819
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,982
We should've done this sooner.

820
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,361
I'm just glad we're here now.

821
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:34,784
I always felt sorry
that I made you do harsh things only.

822
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,120
Don't be like that.

823
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,621
I did it because I wanted to.

824
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,459
I liked being with you.

825
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,173
I was never comfortable

826
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:52,218
with physical contact
with anyone but my husband.

827
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:56,848
But strangely, with you,
I didn't mind it right from the start.

828
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,726
I don't know if you remember.

829
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,395
But you snuggled up
right next to me at night

830
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,314
from the very day I brought you home.

831
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,733
Did I?

832
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:10,195
I was startled when you reached out
your hand while I was sleeping.

833
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:16,743
But what surprised me more was
how rough your small hands were.

834
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,831
They were so chapped and rougher
than a construction worker's hands.

835
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,502
But despite being young,
you were still loyal.

836
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,378
-Loyal?
-Yes.

837
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:31,174
You knew where your father was.

838
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,676
But you played dumb

839
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,597
and refused to tell me where he was
since he was still your father.

840
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,351
You're wrong.

841
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,019
It was the opposite.

842
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,024
I was afraid that you might find him

843
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,027
and tell him to take me back.

844
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,115
It wasn't that I was scared
of going back to that house.

845
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,994
I just didn't want
to be separated from you.

846
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,499
But I didn't even treat you that well.

847
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,168
You're wrong.

848
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:11,589
You took in a complete stranger.

849
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,050
You raised me

850
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:18,763
and treated me
as if I was your own daughter.

851
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,352
So of course you treated me well.

852
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:26,980
If anything, it's me.

853
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,858
I have sinned so much.

854
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:34,070
There's nothing I ever did for you.

855
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,575
Nothing… I couldn't do anything for you.

856
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:41,995
Don't be silly.

857
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,833
You must try to live happily from now on.

858
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,421
Find someone
who's absolutely head over heels for you.

859
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:54,716
You should fight and make up.

860
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,469
Have kids
and have your heart broken at times.

861
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:03,391
Live your life naturally
like flowing water.

862
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,857
Go back down

863
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,151
and live that kind of life.

864
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,195
Later,

865
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,201
when you've lived so long that
you're tired of waking up every morning…

866
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,454
Then,

867
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,081
let's meet again. Promise.

868
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,007
And

869
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,301
next time,

870
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,055
shower me with your love, Mom.

871
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,240
Mom…

872
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:08,081
Mom…

873
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:26,432
LEE HAE-SOOK'S LIST

874
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:50,915
Ms. Lee?

875
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,295
Ms. Lee, are you awake?

876
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,554
You've been unconscious for three months.

877
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,201
Did I do well?

878
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:31,539
You couldn't have done better.

879
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,835
Did you come because you were worried?

880
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,426
Are you saying Young-ae is my birth mother

881
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:48,139
and her father who abandoned her
is my birth father?

882
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,058
This is just ridiculous.

883
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:53,019
Do you expect me to believe that?

884
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:57,231
Do you have
some kind of grudge against me?

885
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,984
It was like this
with my mother-in-law too.

886
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,236
If what you're saying is true,

887
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:06,115
who can I possibly blame
even if I suffer unfair treatment?

888
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:12,538
Because you're saying that person
will always be connected to me somehow.

889
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,708
Yes, that's correct.

890
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:19,462
Whether you're seeking the reason
for present happiness

891
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,464
or past misfortune,

892
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:26,010
the law of fate can provide the answer.

893
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,472
Do you feel like it's unfair?

894
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:31,307
Yes, I do.

895
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:35,353
Your birth mother basically abandoned you,

896
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:37,271
and you ended up taking care of her.

897
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:40,399
-That's what you feel is unfair, isn't it?
-Of course.

898
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:43,528
I wouldn't have taken her in
if I knew that.

899
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:45,988
So tell me.

900
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:49,575
How was the time
you spent with Young-ae in ignorance?

901
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,244
Were you miserable?

902
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,412
Was it only full of pain?

903
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:01,295
I thought about what you said.

904
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:05,424
I realized that
I actually received more than I gave.

905
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,846
She was my friend on ordinary days.

906
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,430
Do you have a death wish?

907
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,350
She was like an older sister
when a fight broke out.

908
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,271
And when I was sick,

909
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,273
she was like a mom.

910
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:29,240
I started thinking,
"I think I can understand."

911
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:34,787
It's normal for a child
to expect things from their parents.

912
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,834
After all, they're older
and gave birth to us.

913
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,838
But when I think about it,

914
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,341
that life was a first for her too.

915
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:52,555
It was her first time being a mom.

916
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,349
So she must've been inexperienced

917
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,685
and afraid.

918
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:03,107
I prayed…

919
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,821
that I could bless my mother
and feel no resentment.

920
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,241
That I could even be grateful.

921
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:17,914
I know Young-ae will be happy.

922
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:23,669
"Whatever you ask for in prayer,

923
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:26,839
believe that you have received it."

924
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:34,555
I felt in my heart
that Young-ae was living happily.

925
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:38,517
I rejoiced as if it had already happened.

926
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,312
And I gave thanks.

927
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:44,649
I pray.

928
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,282
Mom.

929
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:57,119
That at the end of suffering lies
enlightenment that's equal to its weight.

930
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,251
For the preciousness
of the smallest things.

931
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:06,504
-Ring, ring, coming through
-Ring, ring, coming through

932
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:15,262
That what I earnestly desired
has already been possessed.

933
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:48,587
And…

934
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:52,633
I thank you that my prayers

935
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,344
have already been answered.

936
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:15,990
Mom.

937
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,625
Eun-ho…

938
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,295
My baby, Eun-ho…

939
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:59,033
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

940
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:01,827
Honey, I've found something
I really want to do.

941
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,287
It's that Heaven's Lottery thing.

942
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:08,459
Where might the key
to unlocking my heart be hidden?

943
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:10,252
Maybe this way?

944
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,296
I don't know who I am.

945
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:14,924
But you do, don't you?

946
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:16,592
Who you are isn't important.

947
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:18,928
So don't bother Hae-sook
with this nonsense.

948
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:23,849
It's a key. You are truly incredible!

949
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,434
That child, Eun-ho…

950
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,394
-I think…
-Mom!

951
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:28,854
…he was my son…

952
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,232
What do you mean?

953
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:32,233
Is your memory back?

954
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,027
Open the door!

955
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,571
Eun-ho. Why my son?

956
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:45,037
