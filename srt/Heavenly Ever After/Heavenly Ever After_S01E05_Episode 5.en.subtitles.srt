1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,966
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,927
He's coming out!

3
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,971
Lee, infamously known
as a millennial mobster,

4
00:00:55,054 --> 00:01:00,060
had claimed mental instability in court
and received a suspended sentence.

5
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:04,022
Lee was under the influence
when he hit Kim

6
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,982
-who was on her way home…
-It'll never happen again.

7
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,234
-I'm sorry.
-…and left her there without any help.

8
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,862
Unfortunately, Kim did not survive.

9
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:15,200
Traces of psychoactive drugs
were found in Lee's system.

10
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,746
He hired a former prosecutor-turned-lawyer
for this trial and once again…

11
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,419
This is fucking bullshit.

12
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,881
CRIMINAL RECORD
NAME: LEE JU-YEONG

13
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:51,945
Hey.

14
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,492
You little bastard.

15
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,815
I'm not filming you, so go ahead.

16
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:29,732
Sorry?

17
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,449
Not busy, are you?

18
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,243
Of course.

19
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,287
I bet Heaven is having a blast.

20
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,791
Meanwhile,
we're drowning in souls in Hell.

21
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,546
Many new cars have come out,
so we have much to learn.

22
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,508
You haven't seen many of us, have you?

23
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,593
No.

24
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,596
I just started this job not too long ago.

25
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,184
You'll be seeing us often.

26
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,479
If you're not going to throw that…

27
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,482
Right.

28
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:12,942
Here.

29
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,128
REST IN PEACE

30
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,757
MEMORIAL ALTAR

31
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,574
THE LATE PARK CHEOL-YONG

32
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,248
I lived apart from my kids
ever since they were in kindergarten.

33
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,876
Traveling to visit them cost money.

34
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,089
Since then,
I hardly got to meet them as they grew up.

35
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,299
So there was no occasion to take pictures.

36
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,137
And they didn't really
ask me for one either.

37
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,685
I'm not the type to take photos by myself.

38
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,814
They probably don't even have
a funeral photo.

39
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,610
I understand. All right.

40
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,320
Just a little to the right.

41
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,947
Good.

42
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,740
Now, give me a smile.

43
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,784
That's great.

44
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,910
One more.

45
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,204
All done.

46
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,164
By the way, sir,

47
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:54,294
isn't the funeral already over
if he's in Heaven?

48
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,046
You see, they found me a bit late.

49
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,690
If I don't do this,

50
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,861
my kids might never remember me.

51
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,846
I can't go today.

52
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,476
Choi Jin-ho, Yoo Seon-yeong, Choi Ga-yeon.

53
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,857
Let's go.

54
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,526
Shall we go on a picnic? One, two, three.

55
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,907
I'm so glad we're going together.

56
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,868
Yes, it feels like
we're going on a picnic.

57
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,829
-Ga-yeon, aren't you happy too?
-Aren't you?

58
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,216
Oh, hello there!

59
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,595
-Star.
-Yes.

60
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,888
-Yes.
-Star?

61
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,767
Goodness, that's right.

62
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,479
Our train has arrived at Hell Station.

63
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,071
What?

64
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,204
Ga-yeon!

65
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,917
-Mommy!
-Ga-yeon!

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,128
-Mommy!
-Not me!

67
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:04,006
Mommy! Daddy!

68
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,092
Mommy!

69
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,184
LEE HAE-SOOK'S GRAPE REPORT

70
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,853
TOTAL GRAPE BERRIES: 5

71
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,814
What is this?

72
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,233
Why do you have five grape berries?

73
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,320
I gossiped a bit.

74
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,156
Gossiped? About who?

75
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,201
Me?

76
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,995
What did you say?

77
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,372
It was nothing harsh.

78
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,709
Just that you were a bit fussy

79
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:44,505
and annoying once in a while.

80
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,718
And that you looked very slick

81
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,928
like a wooden fish.

82
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,388
A wooden fish?

83
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,183
Of all things to say…

84
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,434
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,856
You need to be
extremely cautious, understand?

86
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,066
You know you'll be sent straight to Hell

87
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,943
if you get one more grape berry,
don't you?

88
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,237
Hell is a scary place.

89
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,823
Let's move on. I'll begin the service.

90
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,408
This is good timing.

91
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,870
Today, I'll talk about Hell.

92
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,872
"If your hand…"

93
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,462
What's gotten into you?
You're not dozing off.

94
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:29,342
I'm not going to sleep during the service
from today on.

95
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,219
That's good then.

96
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,557
"If your hand causes you to sin,

97
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,683
cut it off."

98
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,943
"It is better for you to enter life maimed
than with two hands…"

99
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,741
Amen.

100
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,042
Look at that.

101
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,045
Aren't there so many people?
Why are there so many?

102
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,257
This way, please.

103
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,471
Let's go.

104
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,563
Pure souls get the fast track.

105
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,773
They can bypass security
and head straight in.

106
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,442
Shall we?

107
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,821
What a good girl. Okay.

108
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,739
Okay, let's go.

109
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,463
HEAVEN CHURCH

110
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,801
I didn't fall asleep, did I?

111
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,721
Right, but don't you feel
strangely refreshed?

112
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,973
You're right. Why do I feel so refreshed?

113
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,517
What matters is that you feel that way.

114
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,105
By the way,
what time are you coming tomorrow?

115
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,940
Tomorrow? I'm not sure.

116
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,026
Maybe at 2 p.m., after lunch?

117
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:15,281
I think that's a weird time to come.
Come at 11:30 a.m.

118
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,783
Isn't 11:30 a.m. even weirder?

119
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,036
No, it's perfect.

120
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:24,206
It's hard to decide whether to have lunch
before coming here or not.

121
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,462
I guess that means
you'll have to eat mid-service.

122
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,713
Isn't the timing perfect?

123
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,758
Can you say that it's perfect?

124
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:49,774
"My husband looks so handsome,"
Hae-sook thought.

125
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,569
He better not hear you.
You'll stroke his ego.

126
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,990
He always posed like that
even when they were dating.

127
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,703
Nak-joon knows all too well
that he looks best in that pose.

128
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,872
You're home, Hae-sook.

129
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,543
Why are you laughing?

130
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,713
No reason. What are you doing here?

131
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,008
It was about time you showed up,
so I thought I'd wait. Let's go.

132
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,266
What…

133
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,686
Didn't I tell you to be more careful?

134
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,897
I promise to be careful from now on.

135
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:31,732
Let's go.

136
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,692
But…

137
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,696
Hello.

138
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,824
You haven't eaten, have you?

139
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,078
I made some food for you.

140
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,914
Goodness, Young-ae. You didn't have to.

141
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,999
I hope it tastes okay.

142
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,720
It's delicious.

143
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,805
Really?

144
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,061
Why is it tasty?

145
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,399
Why don't you look happy if it's tasty?

146
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,444
You were never a good cook.

147
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,071
The rice was half-cooked,
and the soup was too bland or salty.

148
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,949
You never seasoned your food perfectly.

149
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,285
I'm sorry.

150
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,871
I really want to be Young-ae too,
you know?

151
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,707
It's okay.
You just lost your memory, that's all.

152
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,126
Your cooking will be terrible again
once you regain it.

153
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,087
Will the day really come
when I'm terrible again?

154
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,423
Of course. You're Young-ae, after all.

155
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,682
KO NAK-JOON
LEE HAE-SOOK

156
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,812
Honey, can't you just stay home
from today on?

157
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:52,771
Why?

158
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,067
I'm worried that some guy will notice
how pretty you are and snatch you away.

159
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,862
Who'd want to snatch an old lady?

160
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,363
See?

161
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,532
You don't know how pretty you are.

162
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,619
I'm always so worried that I want
to keep you in my pocket all the time.

163
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,829
Get in here right now.
Put your hands in first.

164
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,997
-And your feet.
-Forget it.

165
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,790
You've flattered me enough, so go now.

166
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,792
I'm genuinely worried.

167
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,587
You saw how scary Hell's messengers were.

168
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,506
It's okay. I'm not afraid of Hell.

169
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,548
Why?

170
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,009
Because I survived
living with my mother-in-law,

171
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,385
which was scarier.

172
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,514
Hae-sook's life with her mother-in-law
was pure hell.

173
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,434
By the way, is your mother in Heaven?

174
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,394
Yes.

175
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,521
Forget about me.

176
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,191
I can't believe she's in Heaven.

177
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,735
She said she really wanted to meet you.

178
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,529
Would you like that?

179
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,658
Tell her I'm still alive.

180
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,742
That's it.

181
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,790
You really shouldn't wander around alone.

182
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,333
Okay?

183
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,751
Of course.

184
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,546
I'll come right back home
after diligently listening to the service.

185
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,130
I promise.

186
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,432
You woke up just in time. Great.

187
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,351
Is the service over?

188
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,478
No, it's not over yet.

189
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,147
But it's noon, so we should eat first.

190
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,025
Eat? I'm sorry,
but I don't have much of an appetite.

191
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,406
What would you like then? Ramyeon again?

192
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,659
No. I vaguely remember the name.

193
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,910
What was it again? There's…

194
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,912
It's like dough made from flour.

195
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:36,458
Then you'd boil potatoes
or sweet potatoes and add the dough…

196
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,127
I see. Do you mean sujebi?

197
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,962
Is that what it's called?

198
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,298
Making sujebi is a lot of work.

199
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,884
I see. So that's what it's called.

200
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,470
I only have memories up until I was five,
so I never knew the name.

201
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,140
But that dish must've made
a deep impression on me.

202
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,352
I only lived up until I was five,
yet I still remember it.

203
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,897
By the way, what did you say?
Sujebi is a lot of what?

204
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,607
I'll make some for you.

205
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,630
Gosh.

206
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,506
Why am I like this again?

207
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,179
Can I touch your hair just once?

208
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,933
Why? Is there something in my hair?

209
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,609
What are you doing?

210
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,861
I'm just proud of you.

211
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,031
You're not proud of me. You're pitying me.

212
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,574
Is that wrong?

213
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,409
I don't like being pitied.

214
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:58,499
You'd remember your parents
if you were five.

215
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,086
Thankfully, I don't remember a thing.

216
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,713
Why are you thankful?

217
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,841
Because I don't want to remember them.

218
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,928
Why not? Do you resent them?

219
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,184
There's a saying.

220
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,437
"When your parents die,
you bury them in the ground."

221
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,691
"When your children die,
you bury them in your heart."

222
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,567
But…

223
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,570
they say a lost child
can't be buried at all.

224
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,573
Parents have to carry them
in their hearts forever.

225
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,034
That's how parents are.

226
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,416
How would you know
if I got lost or was abandoned?

227
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,835
Don't say things you'll regret.

228
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,547
Your parents will be heartbroken
if they find out what you said.

229
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,550
We won't meet anyway.

230
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,802
They still haven't come looking for me.

231
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,096
That means they must not be in Heaven.

232
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,598
They're probably in Hell then.

233
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,143
It's only fitting since they abandoned me.

234
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,605
They'll eventually find you
no matter where they are.

235
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,235
That's just how the bond
between parents and their children works.

236
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,153
Is that so?

237
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,198
You're headed to Hell soon, aren't you?

238
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,494
Find my parents when you get there.

239
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:22,166
And please tell them
to never ever come looking for me.

240
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,798
Gosh.

241
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,638
The food will get soggy.

242
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,562
Let's go somewhere else. Go.

243
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,407
She's 75% herself.

244
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,034
Young-ae.

245
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:58,952
Ms. Lee.

246
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,375
-You're becoming more like yourself.
-Really?

247
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,962
Could you buy me a drink?

248
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,799
I'm dying of thirst.

249
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,011
You're spitting unnecessarily,
so no wonder you're thirsty.

250
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,060
SCANNING

251
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,478
Shouldn't you put money in?

252
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,438
The money is in here.

253
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,900
All the good deeds you did on Earth
are stored in here.

254
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,569
What goes around really comes around.

255
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,071
It's not just a saying.

256
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,532
INSUFFICIENT BALANCE

257
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,910
That can't be right.

258
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,995
I even took you in…

259
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,208
SCANNING

260
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,709
INSUFFICIENT BALANCE

261
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,547
I'll just drink some water
when we get home.

262
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,965
Hold on a second.

263
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,967
This machine just took my money.

264
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,176
INSUFFICIENT BALANCE

265
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,685
-Gosh.
-That hurts.

266
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,902
What? Ms. Lee!

267
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,115
Darn it.

268
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,827
-It fell!
-Didn't it?

269
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,328
Another grape berry!

270
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,748
Darn it.

271
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:49,062
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

272
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,987
What's going on?

273
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,764
That startled me!

274
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,611
Hae-sook!

275
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,207
Hae-sook! You can't be in there!

276
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,292
You have to come out! Hae-sook!

277
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,340
Ms. Lee!

278
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,843
Something has gone terribly wrong.

279
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,762
Why?

280
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,931
She's not meant for Hell.

281
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,659
Hae-sook has gone to Hell, sir.

282
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,245
Please save her. I'm begging you.

283
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,665
Even Hae-sook herself wasn't sure

284
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,794
whether or not she truly deserved
to be in Heaven.

285
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:41,174
She knew she was on the borderline
between Heaven and Hell.

286
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:47,681
Nonetheless, she was given
another chance by being sent here.

287
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,518
But she even let that slip away
and ended up going to Hell.

288
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,103
Well…

289
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,939
Those meant for Hell should go to Hell,

290
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,317
but my wife definitely isn't someone
who belongs there.

291
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,902
That's for those in Hell to decide.

292
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,989
There's nothing more we can do.

293
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,993
Are you telling me
to just sit on my hands?

294
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,996
Hae-sook is my wife, you know?

295
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,706
It's unfortunate.

296
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:18,712
But even though you're married,
you each have your own burdens to bear.

297
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,882
-But--
-Nak-joon.

298
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,135
You have yet to know
what Hell is really like.

299
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,309
There are no words to truly describe Hell.

300
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,936
Ruthless.

301
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:02,255
You're in a personal prison
without the door of forgiveness

302
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,967
due to all your irreversible mistakes.

303
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,560
You haven't forgotten what happened
to Mr. Park Cheol-jin, have you?

304
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,738
What? Are you not going?

305
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,037
You need to save your wife!

306
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,540
Are you really not going to Hell?

307
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:44,756
No matter what happens,
don't ever turn back into a human, got it?

308
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,717
Weren't we supposed to be
going to Hell together?

309
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,720
I told you. I'm going alone.

310
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,391
I'm just going to find the way
and come back.

311
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,144
I understand,
but why do we need to be dogs?

312
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,232
The pastor here is a really good person,
and he lives alone.

313
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:06,111
He even has a yard.
It's a great place to run around.

314
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,072
And, Jjampong…

315
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,201
you look cuter now
than when you're a human.

316
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,871
This way,
the pastor will feel more comfortable.

317
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,123
Why are you talking
as if you won't return?

318
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,291
I'm…

319
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,168
I'm coming back.

320
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,752
I will, but…

321
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,846
I'm coming…

322
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:34,973
That's enough.

323
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,143
Make sure to do your business outside.

324
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,186
Got it?

325
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,897
Also, you shouldn't mark your territory

326
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,858
inside the church.

327
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,067
Okay?

328
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,112
And you should tone it down
when it comes to sniffing butts.

329
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,118
-Jjajang.
-Gosh.

330
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,454
I prefer walking on two legs.
I'm more used to this now.

331
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,706
But it's still weird for others.

332
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,583
Really? We do look cuter on all fours.

333
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,043
-Sit.
-Okay, I got it.

334
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:04,836
Wait.

335
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,172
Wait.

336
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,221
Welcome…

337
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,765
What?

338
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,893
What are you guys doing here?

339
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,103
Go on now. Go home.

340
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,608
You can do it.

341
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,235
"Take me in."

342
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,617
Next. "Please."

343
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,167
No, I shouldn't fall for them.

344
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,169
"You'll be happy with me."

345
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,837
"Pet me just once."

346
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,467
Gosh.

347
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,556
I really shouldn't.

348
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,393
"Try resisting this."

349
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,650
I don't care anymore.

350
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,859
Oh dear.

351
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,361
Geez, you're so cute.

352
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,445
Nose!

353
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,948
Nose?

354
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,791
Why are such smart and pretty dogs…

355
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,919
Guys, would you like to live here with me?

356
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,255
Would you? Would you like that?

357
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,757
Okay. Let's go inside. Come on in.

358
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,592
There you go.

359
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,927
What good dogs.

360
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,096
This is strange.

361
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,598
What is this familiar smell?

362
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,534
Who are you?

363
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,536
What do you think you're doing?

364
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,315
King Yeomra is coming.

365
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,317
King Yeomra is coming.

366
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,403
King Yeomra is here.

367
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:46,808
What?

368
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,893
You were able to live large

369
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,688
and not get punished
for your sins on Earth,

370
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:55,024
so you must be wondering why you're here.

371
00:28:56,234 --> 00:29:00,238
The way things worked on Earth
seemed so sloppy and easy, didn't it?

372
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,284
Just like how you can't hide
a cough or poverty,

373
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:08,455
you can't hide your sins here in Hell.

374
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,667
There are no cold cases,

375
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,127
insanity pleas,

376
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,837
special treatment,

377
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:19,174
or suspended execution here in Hell.

378
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:24,804
When it comes to punishing evil,
everything is on point.

379
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,473
Fuck this!

380
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,184
I went through trials and served time.

381
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,644
I paid my dues, didn't I?

382
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,606
So why the hell do I have to get
fucking punished even after I'm dead?

383
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,025
Someone shut that guy up!

384
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,324
Vertical or horizontal?

385
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,576
What the fuck are you saying?

386
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,287
Let's just do both.

387
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,165
Hold on. You're too tall for me.

388
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,559
Finally, some peace and quiet.

389
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,394
What's wrong?

390
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,522
Anyone else want to speak up?

391
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,234
So…

392
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,194
I…

393
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,616
That bastard made me forget everything!

394
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,117
That bastard…

395
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,454
All right.

396
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,705
Anyway…

397
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,750
You all lived comfortably
on Earth, didn't you?

398
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,877
So you should now face the consequences.

399
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,087
Right?

400
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,296
It's simple.

401
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,049
Just own up to what you've done.

402
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,217
But…

403
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,136
it's going to be a bit terrifying.

404
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,432
The pain will be intense and long-lasting.

405
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,187
You won't be disappointed.

406
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:58,898
All right!

407
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:03,862
Begin.

408
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,289
What?

409
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,290
Did…

410
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,876
Did Hae-sook really go to Hell?

411
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,423
You're headed to Hell soon, aren't you?

412
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:26,843
Find my parents when you get there.

413
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:31,723
And please tell them
to never ever come looking for me.

414
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,727
Pastor.

415
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,439
Our friend left us here
and went to Hell too.

416
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,900
Pastor, what's Hell like?

417
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,735
He can come back, can't he?

418
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:49,908
Hell…

419
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,079
Please follow the directions.

420
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,498
If you act up,

421
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,001
you'll be erased from existence
without proper punishment.

422
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,172
Do you see the counters up front?

423
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,591
Line up in front of them,

424
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,427
and you'll find out
which version of Hell you're headed to.

425
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,596
Get in line quickly.

426
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,109
The Boiling Cauldron Hell

427
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,279
is where you suffer in molten metal.

428
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,449
The place used to be for thieves,

429
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,993
but now murderers are sent there too.

430
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:39,374
The Tongue-Pulling Hell is for those
who have sinned with their tongues,

431
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,001
such as by cheating or lying.

432
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,004
The graver the sin,
the more their tongue is pulled out.

433
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,218
The Hell of Blisters is for killers,
robbers, rapists, and their kind.

434
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,637
It's reserved for violent offenders.

435
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,848
They freeze you solid
for 200 million years.

436
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,812
The Crushing Hell is for adulterers.

437
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,189
They're placed between two mountains

438
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,900
and are crushed to death
when the mountains close in.

439
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,862
The Screaming Hell
is for sins related to drinking

440
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,365
and for those
who caused physical pain to others.

441
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,909
They must cross searing-hot lines.

442
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,829
If they fall,
they'll plunge into seething molten lava.

443
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,331
The Scorching Hell.

444
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,542
Those who deceived others
with their words,

445
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,087
such as corrupt politicians
or misguided religious leaders,

446
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,255
end up here.

447
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,466
A horrific place
where eternal death is denied

448
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,177
and life is nothing but torment.

449
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,178
Boiling Cauldron Hell.

450
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:40,768
Hell is the one place
no soul would want to end up.

451
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,563
The Boiling Cauldron Hell!

452
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,442
Cho Sam-gu, murder.
Let's start with the Tongue-Pulling Hell.

453
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,528
But I never killed anyone.

454
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:54,073
You didn't, but your tongue did.
And dozens of lives at that.

455
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,658
Tongue-Pulling Hell.

456
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,454
Keep it moving.

457
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,581
School violence.

458
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,416
School violence.

459
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,084
School violence.

460
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,546
-No, we were just messing around.
-All three to the Screaming Hell.

461
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,426
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

462
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,974
The Boiling Cauldron Hell.

463
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,185
-But--
-Boiling Cauldron Hell.

464
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,394
There's been a mistake.

465
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,771
Go argue your case there.

466
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,233
I did a lot of good while I was alive.

467
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,069
You'll see if you dig through my records.

468
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,738
I was a well-known politician
in the community, so--

469
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,032
The Tongue-Pulling Hell.

470
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,413
Put your faith in me.

471
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,166
Cult member. The Scorching Hell.

472
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,877
No. The Tongue-Pulling Hell first.

473
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:55,927
The Crushing Hell.

474
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:57,929
The Crushing Hell.

475
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,597
Falling in love isn't a crime, is it?

476
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,768
Love isn't a crime.
But committing adultery is.

477
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,187
The Crushing Hell.

478
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,654
The Boiling Cauldron Hell.

479
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,078
Serial murder.

480
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,580
You got the full Hell package. Go.

481
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,675
HEAVEN-DWELLER

482
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,552
Heaven-dweller.

483
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,220
Wait.

484
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,265
Why are you here instead of in Heaven?

485
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:45,351
I just saw everyone getting off,
so I followed them.

486
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,353
That shouldn't be possible.

487
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,689
Anyway, over there.

488
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:52,692
Do you see that door? It leads to Heaven.

489
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,777
You can head that way.

490
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,241
-Where are you going?
-Heaven?

491
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,285
-Where are you going?
-Are you going to Heaven?

492
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,036
Where are you headed?

493
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,788
Are you going to Heaven?

494
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,854
That's Heaven!

495
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,355
Heaven!

496
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,498
Keep it moving! Next!

497
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,002
Hurry and line up.

498
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,133
Child sexual assault.

499
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,176
The Hell of Blisters.

500
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,806
Sir. Please help us find our child.

501
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,100
She was with us, but then…

502
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,979
The Boiling Cauldron Hell.

503
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,607
Boiling Cauldron Hell.

504
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,818
The New Hell.

505
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,121
Young…

506
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,125
Young-ae…

507
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,086
Next.

508
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,213
The New Hell.

509
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,721
UNCLASSIFIED

510
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,306
Unclassified.

511
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,642
What does that mean?

512
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,978
Here. We have an unclassified.

513
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,483
Let's go.

514
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,038
Is there really no way?

515
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,708
We have to save her.

516
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:21,215
I'll go. Can you teach me
how to take the subway--

517
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,594
Wait…

518
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:52,830
Young-ae.

519
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,584
It's you, isn't it?

520
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,501
Huh?

521
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,754
Why did you follow me here?

522
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:05,009
And how did you change back?

523
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,137
What's wrong?

524
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,973
Why are you trembling so much?

525
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,142
Come to your senses, Young-ae.

526
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,561
Pull yourself together, Young-ae.

527
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,356
Ms. Lee.

528
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,857
-Ms. Lee!
-Yes.

529
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,567
Yes.

530
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,945
Have you finally come to your senses?

531
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,782
When did you follow me?

532
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,117
I was sure I got on by myself.

533
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,911
I don't know.

534
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,539
Ms. Lee, I'm scared to death.

535
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,833
It's okay. You're okay now.

536
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,126
It's all right.

537
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,963
Are you unclassified too?

538
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,841
Yes. That's what they said.

539
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,096
Are you both unclassified too?

540
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,722
-Yes.
-Yes.

541
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,016
What happens to the unclassified?

542
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,768
We don't know either.

543
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,987
There are four unclassified individuals.

544
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,034
The president of Heaven is glaring.

545
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,412
I'm not the president of Heaven.

546
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,997
The president of Heaven
claims that he's not who he is.

547
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,420
The president of Heaven
looks livid and approaches…

548
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:28,092
-Do you want me to tear your mouth open?
-I didn't say a word.

549
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,678
It was her. She did all the talking…

550
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,567
The unclassified individuals
only come in two types.

551
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:51,157
You're not officially dead yet,
but you're having a near-death experience.

552
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,074
Or…

553
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:56,162
you're not exactly qualified for Hell,
so your fate is still undecided.

554
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,876
The former gets a tour of Hell
then goes back.

555
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,296
As for the latter,
we weigh the gravity of their sins.

556
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,755
Then we decide

557
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,758
whether to leave them here
or send them to Heaven.

558
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,302
Got that?

559
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,304
Yes, sir.

560
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,724
If any of you are having
a near-death experience,

561
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,058
go back and relay this message.

562
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,395
"Hell is no place for anyone."

563
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,106
"You need to live righteously."

564
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,276
"Parents should educate
their kids properly."

565
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,944
"Because if not,

566
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,072
parents and their children

567
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,949
can end up here together."

568
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,250
We will now go to the Weighing Room.

569
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,586
We will measure the weight of your sins.

570
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,380
You should explain
in case of a near-death experience.

571
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,509
This is the Monitoring Room.

572
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,595
Everything you do is recorded.

573
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,556
Some are happy

574
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,849
thinking that they got away
with committing a crime.

575
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,727
But perfect crimes don't exist in Hell.

576
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:53,070
CRIMINAL RECORD
STOLE FROM A SUPERMARKET NEAR HOME

577
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,992
CRIMINAL RECORD
KANG JIN-SANG

578
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,829
STOLE 25,000 WON
PUNCHED AND KICKED THE VICTIM'S STOMACH

CRIMINAL RECORD
LEE SANG-JUN

580
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,918
PUT A SPY CAM IN THE BATHROOM
AND RECORDED FOOTAGE

581
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,684
There's growing public outrage
over the court ruling for Lee

582
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,977
who recently took a life

583
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,689
while under the influence
of alcohol and psychotropic drugs.

584
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:33,861
It has been revealed that
he took potent narcotic substances.

585
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:37,323
Meanwhile, criticisms keep growing as Lee
has been showing no signs of remorse

586
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,491
and has been posting
photos of himself traveling

587
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,410
on his social media.

588
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,454
This case challenges
the principles of law and justice…

589
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,622
Fucking bullshit.

590
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,166
…where the poor are punished
and the rich walk free.

591
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,642
I'm bored. Let's hit the club!

592
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,603
CRIMINAL RECORD
NAME: LEE JU-YEONG

593
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,993
Call them in now.

594
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,372
-Pardon? Out of the blue?
-Do you see the remarks section?

595
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,417
A family is going to get hit
by that car in five minutes.

596
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,752
What should I do then?

597
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,046
Just let it explode.

598
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,267
You got a long rap sheet.

599
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,811
Let's start with the Screaming Hell.

600
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,156
In a moment,
our train will arrive at Hell Station.

601
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,951
Please stay seated.

602
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,625
What's going on?

603
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,655
What is this?

604
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,449
I thought you had chickened out.

605
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,200
Who? Me?

606
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,328
You heard what happened to that runaway
from the president.

607
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,914
That actually made me more determined.

608
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,208
After that man heard

609
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,254
that his wife was in Heaven,

610
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,548
he was smiling
as he was being dragged away.

611
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,303
A married couple should be together.

612
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,473
Even if it's in Hell.

613
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,103
Wait for me!

614
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,658
What happened?

615
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,055
Darn it, this is dog shit.

616
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,729
There seems to be an issue
in the Waiting Area.

617
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:56,647
I'm going to check.

618
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,780
Come on, just let me go!
Why can't you let me in?

619
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,532
Why can't I go in?

620
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,451
I'll leave once I find my wife! Okay?

621
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,328
What's going on here?

622
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,914
He's a Heaven-dweller.

623
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,667
Then you can send him to Heaven.

624
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:18,752
You see…

625
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:21,463
He's looking for his wife in Hell.

626
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,299
I want to find my wife.

627
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,718
If you must, then so be it.

628
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,225
But we can't offer any help.

629
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,565
I'll take her with me once I find her.

630
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,816
Suit yourself.

631
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,901
If you can find her, that is.

632
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,069
Thank you.

633
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,112
Just know this.

634
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:48,991
Everything that happens from now on
is your responsibility, Mr. Ko.

635
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,202
I know what I'm getting into.

636
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:23,900
You asshole!

637
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:40,250
THE BOILING CAULDRON HELL

638
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,835
The Boiling Cauldron Hell

639
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:45,130
was originally meant for those
who refused to help others.

640
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,841
How romantic is that?

641
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:51,261
Hard to believe
that behavior used to be a sin.

642
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,222
But nowadays,

643
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,725
that doesn't even count as a sin.

644
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,145
So it's reserved for the worst criminals.

645
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,790
This must be a mistake.

646
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:31,510
Sir.

647
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,597
We've already paid for our sins.

648
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,140
-We even went to church.
-He's right.

649
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,642
-We've been forgiven.
-It's true.

650
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,768
Is that so?

651
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:40,936
Yes, sir.

652
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,563
Then let's see if there was a mistake.

653
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,487
Didn't you adopt a daughter
when you were young?

654
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,240
Yes, that's correct.

655
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:58,578
These are the last X-rays
and CT scans taken of her.

656
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:04,126
Her small and large intestines
were injured and her pancreas severed.

657
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,919
Internal bleeding in the abdominal cavity.

658
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:08,880
Fractures in her head, left clavicle,
right rib, and shoulder blades.

659
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,383
Every bone was broken.

660
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,387
Now it's time to pay for your sins.

661
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,850
Make them look just like these photos
before tossing them into the furnace.

662
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:20,767
Yes, sir.

663
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,109
What is it this time?

664
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,360
This is Yoo Yeong-chan.

665
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:31,987
Right.

666
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,572
Start with the Boiling Cauldron Hell.

667
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:37,200
Once he comes out and gets new skin,
send him straight to the Hell of Blisters.

668
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,717
It's so hot!

669
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,512
Help me!

670
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,724
Can you please not?

671
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,184
Please find our daughter!

672
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,478
Sir! Please find our child!

673
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,354
We lost her on the subway.

674
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,607
She's doing fine.

675
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,694
Please let us be together as a family.

676
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,447
We never committed murder.

677
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,741
We didn't do anything wrong.

678
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,576
Life was just so hard and difficult.

679
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:23,497
We tried our best to survive,
but there was no other way.

680
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,290
You never committed murder?

681
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,044
Do you want to know
what your child's last words were?

682
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:34,716
Let's go

683
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,885
to Heaven

684
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,597
and live happily together as a family.

685
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,015
Okay, honey.

686
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,059
Sweetie.

687
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,895
Let's meet in Heaven.

688
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,402
You can't understand, can you?

689
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,154
I'll translate it for you.

690
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,950
And live happily together as a family.

691
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,701
Sweetie.

692
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,246
Let's meet in Heaven.

693
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,832
Mommy. Daddy.

694
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,918
I want to live.

695
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:14,548
There are still so many things
I want to do.

696
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,305
Humans often think

697
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,309
they own their children just because
they brought them into this world.

698
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:29,729
A child is not their parents' property.

699
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:34,234
They simply passed through them.
They're an independent individual.

700
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,654
They're their own person!

701
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:48,248
THE TONGUE-PULLING HELL

702
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:52,794
My, my.
You've really run your mouth quite a bit.

703
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,672
You scammed a total of 5 trillion won
from 70,000 victims.

704
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,716
You faked your death
while hiding overseas,

705
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,677
and many people ended their lives
because of that.

706
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,597
I'll cut 1 cm for each life you took.

707
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,017
That makes it 48 cm in total. Open up.

708
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,477
Listen to me while I'm being nice.

709
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,855
All right.

710
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,276
I told you to stick your tongue out.

711
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,706
"Voice phishing"?

712
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,000
What's the standard for voice phishing?

713
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,169
It's 1 cm per 1 won.

714
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,171
But it's hundreds of millions.

715
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,131
His tongue isn't long enough.

716
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:40,175
Pull it out as far as you can.

717
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,427
You'll have to do it again
once his tongue grows back.

718
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:46,014
Relax your shoulders.
If not, it'll hurt more.

719
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:49,851
I said, relax!

720
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:51,728
Good. Lower it.

721
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,063
I'll cut it now.

722
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:57,651
You're a lawyer.

723
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:02,030
Is it a sin to defend someone?

724
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:05,617
Even the worst criminals
have a right to a defense.

725
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,535
Sure. You did well.

726
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,080
But you tampered with evidence
when you were a prosecutor

727
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,874
and gave out bribes
to sway your trials as a lawyer.

728
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,460
You're being punished
because you're immoral,

729
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,045
not because you're a lawyer.

730
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,005
Got that? Open up.

731
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,257
Oh, please.

732
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,344
Look--

733
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,054
We are told not to let politicians

734
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:29,391
-speak a word.
-Just hear me out.

735
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,694
Ms. Lee, are you okay?

736
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:42,737
Gosh, that's hot.

737
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,617
A little hot, isn't it?

738
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:51,121
This is the Scorching Hell
where hot winds blow.

739
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,708
It's a place for those
who deceived others with words.

740
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:06,219
THE SCORCHING HELL

741
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,943
Don't trust anyone.
Not even family or friends!

742
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,737
Pay me my commission and I'll make sure

743
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,031
-you're proven innocent.
-Do the ritual!

744
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,323
Bring me your possessions.

745
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:30,368
-Trust me!
-Tenfold, hundredfold…

746
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,537
You're definitely going to be rich!

747
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,476
This way.

748
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:06,571
THE HELL OF BLISTERS

749
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,211
This is the Hell of Blisters.

750
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,047
This is where
extremely violent criminals end up.

751
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,512
We purposely let them live long lives

752
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:33,014
and only bring them here
when they're the most vulnerable.

753
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,184
They'll experience much worse pain.

754
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:50,031
THE CRUSHING HELL

755
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,788
This is the Crushing Hell.

756
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,874
It's mainly for adulterers.

757
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:24,023
Are they letting us stay together?

758
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:25,817
I think so.

759
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,903
What a relief. At least we're still--

760
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:40,915
Help me!

761
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,375
Help me!

762
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,418
You go first!

763
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,336
You bastard!

764
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,687
Where on earth is King Yeomra?

765
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,027
What? This smell…

766
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,538
You can't even go outside
to relieve yourself.

767
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,123
Why won't you listen?

768
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,458
You stupid mutt!

769
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,168
Die, you lousy dog!

770
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,731
Yes. This is only right.

771
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:49,025
A human like you belongs in Hell.

772
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,611
I'll watch you suffering in Hell

773
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,989
without batting an eye.

774
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,784
The Screaming Hell.

775
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,215
Murder, assault, rape.

776
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:16,302
All sins committed under the influence
are punished in the Screaming Hell.

777
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:21,224
Doing something while drunk
is like walking on a tightrope.

778
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:24,602
Do you see this line?

779
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,148
Cross it, and you'll be saved.

780
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:34,529
No!

781
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,910
This bastard made me do it!

782
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,120
I'm just his minion.

783
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,206
He told me to beat up that loser.

784
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,249
Yes, that's right.

785
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,042
He's the evilest one.

786
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,378
He's the one who cracked
that kid's home security system.

787
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,588
You fuckers.

788
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,339
Don't act like you guys are innocent.

789
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,633
I only said to scare him,
but you idiots killed him!

790
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,136
Hey! If not, I would've been next.

791
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,054
It's the truth!

792
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,472
He encouraged the bullying!

793
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,640
You talk too much.

794
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,662
I'm sorry! Please spare me!

795
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,792
I'm sorry! Please spare me!

796
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:30,793
Please spare me…

797
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,713
I'm sorry!

798
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,215
I'm sorry! Please spare me!

799
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,718
I'm sorry…

800
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,476
Gaeddong?

801
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,438
Is that you, Gaeddong?

802
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,651
You're Gaeddong, aren't you?

803
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:07,515
Were you on a field trip or something?

804
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:09,058
What took you so long?

805
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,435
Come in.

806
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,312
Hurry up and step on this.

807
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,774
The weight of your sins
will tell us where you'll go.

808
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,860
If you're innocent, the scale won't tip.

809
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,446
If you're guilty, it will.

810
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,240
Up to 49.9, you're safe.

811
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:25,950
Fifty and above, you're staying.

812
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,164
Hurry up.

813
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,168
Move it.

814
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,429
A near-death experience. Okay, get down.

815
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,765
Next. Hurry up.

816
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,767
All right.

817
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,060
I didn't think it'd be you two.

818
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,520
Okay. Get down.

819
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:56,606
Next.

820
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:58,858
Get up here.

821
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,279
I'll carry her sins too.

822
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,744
Hey. You think you have a choice?

823
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,455
Is Hell your playground?

824
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:13,414
Don't make me laugh.

825
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,916
Get up here!

826
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:17,919
You first. Hurry.

827
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,525
Hang in there, Hae-sook!

828
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,401
I'll be right there!

829
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,536
Hae-sook!

830
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,332
THE NEW HELL

831
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,500
Okay, Group 1.

832
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,962
Park Chan-yeong, Kim Chil-su, Seo Yu-rim,
Lee Nam-jun, Byeon A-suk, Jeong Suk-yeong,

833
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:03,089
Yoon Jang-yeong, Nam Sang-jin,
Jeong I-jun, Lee Seong-gyun,

834
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,674
Kang Su-bin, Lee Mi-yeong, Ji Su-hwan,

835
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:07,134
Woo Si-yoon, Kim Beom-yong,
Eom Yong-ju, Choi Seung-jin,

836
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,178
Seo Yeon-ho, Park Ji-yeon,
Shin Dong-yeon, Kim Eun-mi,

837
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:12,265
Kwon Su-cheol, Park Sun-rye, Han Ji-su,
Jang Ji-hwan, An Dae-gon. Done.

838
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:13,933
We're innocent!

839
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,852
I've never cursed in my life!

840
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,937
I've lived such a good life!

841
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:26,404
Victim.

842
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:29,323
Kim In-suk.

843
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:49,594
Is she still alive?

844
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:53,264
That whore pretended
to be innocent to get famous.

845
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:54,724
-Poor babies.
-The face never lies.

846
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:57,059
-Isn't this basically murder?
-Four abortions.

847
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,896
I can't believe she's on TV.
What wrong with this world?

848
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:03,065
"Kim In-suk's Pregnancy Scandal."

849
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:07,194
KIM IN-SUK SCANDAL
FOUR ABORTIONS

850
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:37,934
She took her own life,
thanks to your words.

851
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,477
Do you still claim innocence?

852
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,480
I'm different from them!

853
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:46,567
These people bullied her to death
with hate comments.

854
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:48,903
But I'm a journalist.

855
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:50,988
It was the public's right to know!

856
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,323
Who wanted to know about her?

857
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:54,450
It was just you who wanted to!

858
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,538
You crossed the line.

859
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,457
Get started.

860
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:05,419
Round up all the haters and clickbaiters.

861
01:06:57,221 --> 01:07:01,934
This special Hell was crafted for you
who made a business out of sin.

862
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:05,312
It's more hopeless
than the Tongue-Pulling Hell

863
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,690
and more excruciating
than the Scorching Hell.

864
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:11,694
This is the New Hell!

865
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:17,992
Hae-sook!

866
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:21,370
Lee Hae-sook!

867
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,540
Hae-sook!

868
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:28,335
Hae-sook, say something if you hear me!
I'm here!

869
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,463
Answer me, Hae-sook!

870
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,256
It's me!

871
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:34,050
I'm here!

872
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:35,968
Lee Hae-sook!

873
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:39,180
Hae-sook…

874
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,979
He's the person I told you about.

875
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,149
I see.

876
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:52,276
A Heaven-dweller?

877
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,904
Even if you're from Heaven,

878
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,656
you still broke the laws of Hell.

879
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:01,118
-You must be erased from existence.
-I beg you.

880
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:05,414
I have to find Hae-sook at all costs.

881
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:07,875
Please return my wife!

882
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:11,420
All right.

883
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:13,714
I'll help you find her.

884
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,218
However, there's one condition.

885
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:22,640
You must now understand what Hell is like.

886
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:26,685
Go through every part of Hell,

887
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:28,354
and…

888
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,356
I'll return your wife to you.

889
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:32,566
What do you say?

890
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,151
It's hard to decide, isn't it?

891
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:36,112
Do you need some time?

892
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,571
That's a promise.

893
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:28,664
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

894
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,792
Witness the weight of your sins.

895
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:34,545
No! No, Ms. Lee!

896
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:37,381
Please bring our kind-hearted Ms. Lee
back right now.

897
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:39,884
Why must she go to Hell?

898
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,177
She's really here.

899
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,513
I'm the one who came back from Hell,
so why does it seem like

900
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,015
you did all the soul-searching?

901
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,225
Since I can't remember anything,

902
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:51,645
I don't even know
if I'm a good or bad person.

903
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:53,731
It terrifies me.

904
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:58,527
I'd like to ask you for a personal favor.

905
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,118
