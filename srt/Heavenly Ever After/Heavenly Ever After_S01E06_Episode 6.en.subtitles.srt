1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,966
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

2
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:56,014
You must now understand what Hell is like.

3
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,101
Go through every part of Hell,

4
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,730
and I'll return your wife to you.

5
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,358
What do you say?
It's hard to decide, isn't it?

6
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,444
Do you need some time?

7
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,904
That's a promise.

8
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,397
What's going on?

9
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,650
Is this Heaven?

10
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,736
Have I been sent back?

11
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,949
What about Hae-sook?

12
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,995
Hae-sook!

13
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,748
Hae-sook!

14
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,416
Ms. Lee?

15
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,418
We're home now. You're okay.

16
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,212
You're okay.

17
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,632
Did we finally get out of there alive?

18
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,385
Hold on… Are we dead?

19
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,554
We're alive.

20
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,807
You silly girl.

21
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,268
Why did you follow me
to such a dangerous place?

22
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,729
How could I live without you?

23
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,565
You must.

24
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,610
I really thought I was going to Hell.

25
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,373
Witness the weight of your sins.

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,169
No! No, Ms. Lee!

27
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,629
Isn't there any other way…

28
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,717
No…

29
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,032
Hey.

30
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,050
Darn it.

31
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,052
Lee Hae-sook.

32
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,055
Listen carefully.

33
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:46,059
The difference in the weight of your sins
and that of those burning out there

34
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,644
is extremely minuscule.

35
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,146
Live properly.

36
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,066
I will. I'll live righteously.

37
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,201
Next. Step up.

38
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,293
We're not measuring your body weight,
so just step up.

39
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,211
Right.

40
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,966
Young-ae, if you've done anything good,
now is the time to mention them.

41
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,510
Good deeds?

42
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,679
Good deeds…

43
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,931
Right.

44
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:29,185
One time, I caught a guy
who ran off with our money.

45
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,604
He said the money was for his sick mother.

46
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,399
I was originally supposed to break
all his fingers,

47
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,525
but I only broke one.

48
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,110
Darn it.

49
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,779
And…

50
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,365
I was supposed to search him,

51
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,535
but I turned a blind eye
to the money he hid in his underwear.

52
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,370
Just hurry up and step up already!

53
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,382
What? What happened?

54
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,979
Come on.

55
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,150
Just this once.

56
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,486
Even if it's only once,

57
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,115
please allow her to experience love.

58
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,620
This poor child
was even abused by her own father.

59
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,668
If she has committed any sins,
it's because I made her do them.

60
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,881
If you could give me another chance,

61
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:44,260
I promise to grow
into a pure and kind spirit.

62
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,512
I'll work hard to slash my sins--

63
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,472
No.

64
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:53,186
I'll completely atone for my sins.

65
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,694
If it weren't for you,
I might've actually ended up in Hell.

66
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:05,281
We didn't go because we didn't deserve it.

67
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,415
They didn't offer any water
at that sizzling hot place.

68
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,584
It was truly Hell.

69
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,297
By the way, is this your house?

70
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,257
What's gotten into you?

71
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,344
Did you lose your memory again
after visiting Hell?

72
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,597
What? Did I lose my memory? When?

73
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,599
Why is this happening to you again?

74
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,394
You've lost your memory before.

75
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,231
-You'll probably regain it again.
-Right.

76
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,943
By the way, do you live alone?

77
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,738
No. I live with my husband, Ko Nak-joon.

78
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,867
What? Did you finally reunite with him?

79
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,913
By the way, where in the world is he
when his wife went to Hell?

80
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:54,831
Hae-sook!

81
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,749
Hae-sook!

82
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,254
Hae-sook…

83
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,925
Hae-sook…

84
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,635
Look at me.

85
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,053
Are you…

86
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,264
It's me.
Do you recognize me? Are you hurt?

87
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,808
What's with all the fuss?
Where have you been?

88
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,436
Where do you think?
I went to Hell looking for you.

89
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,728
I've been through so much…

90
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,691
-You went to Hell?
-Yes.

91
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,152
When? How?

92
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,737
Why on earth would you go there?

93
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,197
What are you saying?

94
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,950
How could I sit still when you're in Hell?

95
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,289
Young-ae?

96
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,584
-Mr. Ko?
-Why are you here again?

97
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,628
Why are you back to your young self?

98
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,130
What about you?

99
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,009
I'm exhausted. I want to rest.

100
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,429
Let me take a look at you. Are you hurt?

101
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,599
Ms. Lee was totally into pretty boys,
wasn't she?

102
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,437
Honey, are you really okay?

103
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,272
Let me see.

104
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,482
I was scared.

105
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,196
Really.

106
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,406
We were finally reunited,

107
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,951
so I was afraid
you and I would get separated again.

108
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,828
Gosh, honey.

109
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,623
Oh dear, you must've been so terrified.

110
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,458
You're okay now. Okay?

111
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,460
I'm right here. It's okay.

112
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,214
But did you really come looking for me?

113
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,632
Come on.

114
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,092
That hurt my feelings.

115
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:31,886
Honey.

116
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,513
Don't you know me?

117
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,433
Did you really think I'd do nothing
while you were in Hell?

118
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,519
As soon as I heard the news,

119
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,938
I ran from the subway
all the way to Hell's gate

120
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,774
with nothing but the determination
to save you.

121
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:49,904
"Hae-sook! Just give me back my wife!"
I was yelling, but no one seemed to care.

122
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,031
It was my first time in Hell,
and it was terrifying.

123
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,742
I was calling for you,
and they told me to go find you myself.

124
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,746
So I did. I ran everywhere to find you.
I can't even remember how much I ran.

125
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,331
I was running until my legs gave out.

126
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,625
There were flames. It stank.
I was going crazy.

127
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,711
I was shouting until I was hoarse,
"Hae-sook! Where is my wife?"

128
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,463
But no one would respond.

129
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,549
"Find her! I'm bringing my wife back!"

130
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,050
And just like that…

131
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,344
The seething flames

132
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,930
were boiling in front of me.

133
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,309
At a glance, I knew it was 18,000°C.

134
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,437
The flames were just bubbling away.

135
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,856
I was told that
you'd be saved if I jumped in.

136
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,442
Without a second thought,
I rushed into that 18,000°C inferno.

137
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,361
I didn't hesitate. I just dove right in.

138
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,447
I plunged in boldly and then--

139
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,533
Are you hurt?

140
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,826
So I dove.

141
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,994
-I dove in, but…
-Yes?

142
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,290
What happened to Young-ae?
When did she get here?

143
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,834
What do you mean? She followed me to Hell.

144
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,752
We barely made it out alive.

145
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,589
-She went to Hell?
-I'm telling you.

146
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,758
I had no idea she'd follow me there.

147
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,595
Young-ae followed you? That can't be.

148
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,973
I'm telling you.
That's how we came back together.

149
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,143
No, I'm telling you.
Look. She's eating already.

150
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,729
Som-i was here, okay?

151
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,606
Look at her.

152
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,567
Sure, maybe her face melted
in the fires of Hell.

153
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,777
But what about her body?
Did the flames swell her up?

154
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,529
Mr. Ko.

155
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,073
I don't get what you're saying,
but I'm offended.

156
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,285
No, I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about someone called Som-i.

157
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,454
See? I told you from the start.

158
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,247
She's Young-ae, not Som-i.

159
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,666
She has a cold face that screams trouble.

160
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,959
Come on now.

161
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,919
No, it is her.

162
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,130
Tell me. You're Som-i, aren't you?

163
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,799
-Who's that?
-I told you.

164
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,426
My name has always been Young-ae.

165
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:40,598
I missed you every single day
after you died, then…

166
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,891
I got into an accident…

167
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,811
Why can't you… Who's Som-i?

168
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,355
What does this mean then?

169
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,275
So she's the real Young-ae,
and Som-i was just lying?

170
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,861
I told you. Do you finally get it?

171
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,199
I told you to listen to me.
You ended up in Hell because you didn't.

172
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:02,578
I dove into the 18,000°C boiling flames,
thanks to you.

173
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,579
But it wasn't hot.

174
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,955
Do you know why?

175
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,792
Because my desire to save you
burned even hotter.

176
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:12,546
King Yeomra was moved by my actions
and even shed tears.

177
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,884
Do you know what he said?
"You're the best husband ever."

178
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,928
"Go. Live and love." That's what…

179
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,139
Honey, I wasn't done yet.

180
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,810
She must've caught a whiff and bolted.

181
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,396
-Young-ae.
-Yes, Ms. Lee?

182
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,272
Grab the tools.

183
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,440
What for?

184
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,944
She dodged the payment
for three months and hid.

185
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,279
She's probably as far away
as Pocheon by now.

186
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,865
She's dead meat.

187
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,047
Why? Are you going somewhere?

188
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:56,799
Well…

189
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,803
I have to go to the Support Center.

190
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:02,930
Let's go.

191
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,062
What? She came back from Hell?

192
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:13,649
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

193
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,902
Don't Heaven-dwellers
have the right to be happy?

194
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,114
I'd be happy to go to Hell
instead of Ms. Lee.

195
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,991
Have you yet to identify
this troublemaker?

196
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,617
They can't identify me. Why?

197
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,578
Because I was actually Hell-bound.

198
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,496
So let me go instead.

199
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,291
Please bring our kind-hearted Ms. Lee
back right now.

200
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,419
Why must she go to Hell?

201
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,670
Let me go.

202
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,630
You clearly don't know
how dangerous I can be.

203
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,966
-Som-i.
-I-- What?

204
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,761
Ms. Lee?

205
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,806
Is it really you?

206
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,601
Did you come back from Hell?

207
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,189
Ms. Lee!

208
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,525
Stop crying.

209
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,527
People are watching.

210
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,112
That's enough.

211
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,156
-Stop.
-Okay.

212
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,908
Stop.

213
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,244
Som-i.

214
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,747
"Som-i"?

215
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,375
Ms. Lee, it's me. Young-ae.

216
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,175
I'm Young-ae.

217
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,471
Guess where I've been.

218
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,349
I came from Hell!

219
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,142
Oh, hello.

220
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,854
Does that mean…

221
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,315
I'm not Young-ae?

222
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,860
There are people here,
so let's just go home quietly.

223
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,780
But-- Okay.

224
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,699
This? Okay.

225
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,376
I, the 18,000°C man,
will sort everything out here and go home.

226
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,211
Go home and rest, okay?

227
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,880
Are you listening, honey? All right.

228
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,049
I see that you're nodding. Okay.

229
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,934
Why did you lie?

230
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,186
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:18,315
I didn't mean anything ill by it.

232
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,403
It's the truth.
Why would I lie now when I'm caught?

233
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,072
Then why did you pretend to be her?

234
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,950
Because I wanted…

235
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,204
to be her.

236
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,124
Although I didn't even know her name.

237
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,209
Right, I told you her name.

238
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:42,089
But your actions were so much like hers.
How do you explain that?

239
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,467
I'm afraid I can't explain that.

240
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,513
I was just acting on my instincts,
but you thought it was similar to her…

241
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,932
Are you saying it was a coincidence?

242
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,686
And since I had no memory at all,

243
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,272
I thought, "Wow, maybe I am really--"

244
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,150
"Young-ae"?

245
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,696
"I wish I were." That's what I thought.

246
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,868
I thought maybe you'd like me
if I was really her.

247
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,705
You'd talk about her at times.

248
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,625
I could tell she really cared about you.

249
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:24,757
I just wished
someone could love me like that too.

250
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,137
I'm truly sorry.

251
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,849
I'm so sorry.

252
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:42,024
Thank you for taking care of me.

253
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,860
Are you leaving?
Do you have anywhere to go?

254
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,363
I'll have to figure that out.

255
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,033
I might've been to Hell,

256
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,827
but I'm not heartless enough

257
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,622
to kick out someone
who has no memory or nowhere to go.

258
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,209
Ms. Lee…

259
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:05,130
But I'm not soft enough
to live with you forever either.

260
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,634
What? That's it?

261
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,222
You've come to Heaven and lost your bite.

262
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,369
You can stay here until you find a place…

263
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,335
But don't just sit around doing nothing.

264
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,088
Try to find a way to regain your memory--

265
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,802
What? What is it?

266
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,555
Mr. 18,000°C?

267
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,976
What's wrong?

268
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,023
Tell me what's wrong.

269
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,234
Were you not able to sort things out?

270
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,781
If you're not talking, I'm leaving.

271
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,909
So I dove into the flames

272
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,537
to save you…

273
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,372
Yes. You did very well.

274
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,000
You're amazing. You're the best.

275
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,626
But what about it?

276
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,005
I got suspended for going there.

277
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,340
By who? The Support Center?

278
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,428
I see.

279
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,807
You got suspended
for jumping into 18,000°C flames

280
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,642
just to save me.

281
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,521
For how long?

282
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,068
I'm not sure.

283
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,534
Just consider it as a break
and relax for a few days.

284
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,661
They're not going to keep you off forever.

285
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,664
You see…

286
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,131
I really loved my job.

287
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,718
You know very well

288
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,138
that I could never get out of bed
ever since I got injured.

289
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:23,310
So it gave me a sense of purpose
to wander around as I pleased

290
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,313
and deliver letters to people.

291
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,569
But I can't even bring home
a paycheck now.

292
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,113
What nonsense.

293
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,114
Who am I?

294
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,242
-Lee Hae-sook.
-That's right.

295
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:42,788
You're the man who jumped
into 18,000°C flames to save his wife,

296
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,206
and I'm that woman.

297
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,000
Even if I ended up on a deserted island,

298
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,378
I'd figure out a way
to make monkeys pay up.

299
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,130
But still…

300
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,589
Don't worry.

301
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,885
Seeing you lying here
reminds me of the past.

302
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,888
I always started with your legs back then.

303
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,851
I don't like it when you do that.

304
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,187
Okay. I won't bring up old stories.

305
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,619
Hey.

306
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,955
So you pretended to be me.

307
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,791
-Let me see.
-Sorry?

308
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,418
Let me see it.

309
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,420
Okay.

310
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,182
Damn it.

311
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,643
-Hey, am I a joke to you?
-No, not at all.

312
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,521
Ms. Lee taught me this.

313
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,024
I swear I wasn't making fun of you, ma'am.

314
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,651
Ma'am? Why am I a "ma'am" to you?

315
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,486
Then…

316
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,614
Address me as "sir."

317
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,616
Yes, sir.

318
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,659
What did you do on Earth?

319
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,414
I'm not really sure, sir.
I lost my memory when I got here.

320
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,208
How could you lose your memory in Heaven?

321
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,627
Actually, I'm not originally from here.

322
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,255
I kind of ended up here
on my way to Hell, sir.

323
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,507
Hell? Why Hell?

324
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,885
I'm not sure about that either.

325
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:24,181
If I was meant for Hell,
maybe I committed murder.

326
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,850
Or hid a body.

327
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,688
Is something bothering you, sir?

328
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,191
No, I'm fine. Drop the "sir," okay?

329
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,318
-Why, sir?
-Just don't.

330
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,403
Please.

331
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,279
Is this a nightmare?

332
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,772
Mr. Ko doesn't have an appetite.

333
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,360
You guys can eat first.

334
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,795
Hae-sook was reminded of an old memory.

335
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:23,300
It was a side of her husband
she never wanted to see again.

336
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,894
I'm taking Young-ae to the Support Center.

337
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,732
Eat up, and when the time comes,
return to work.

338
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,028
I'll take care of you until then,
so don't you worry.

339
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:51,244
Are you unable to find her?
Lee Young-ae, born in 1979.

340
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,039
No, there's no record of her here.

341
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:57,501
Maybe her paperwork
hasn't been transferred from Hell yet.

342
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,461
Can that happen?

343
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,546
Ms. Lee, I don't need that orientation.

344
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,839
Just stay put.

345
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:08,095
You need to if you want to get benefits
and even get your own place.

346
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,055
Is she really not on it?

347
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,182
No, she's not.

348
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,189
You know the president here, don't you?

349
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:26,363
He and I are quite close.
We even have tea together.

350
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,574
So could you help me out?

351
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,996
In that case,
I'll ask someone from another department.

352
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,123
Don't bother.

353
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,708
I don't need a house
since I'm going to live with her anyway.

354
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,418
Still.

355
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,800
Looks like someone dozed off
during language class at school.

356
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,594
You seem to lack reading comprehension.

357
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,557
Ms. Lee.

358
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,435
Why is he the only one glowing?

359
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,106
Wait here. I need to speak with him.
Don't wander off. Just stay put.

360
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,195
Did he swallow a highlighter or something?

361
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:14,327
I feel comfortable in this room
since I came here so often.

362
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,872
I'm glad you feel that way.

363
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,040
Come by often. We can chat like friends.

364
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,627
Speaking of friends…

365
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,006
This might seem sudden,

366
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:31,178
but can I ask
for a direct yet simple favor

367
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,097
that's typical among friends?

368
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:38,059
Something is telling me
that it's about your husband's suspension.

369
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,606
He's a kind-hearted soul.

370
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,192
It's just that he's not very shrewd.

371
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,570
Honestly, I'm better at making money.

372
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,864
That was true even when we were on Earth.

373
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,992
Yes, you look like you would be.

374
00:24:55,702 --> 00:25:00,832
To tell you the truth,
he came to me after you went to Hell.

375
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,168
He asked me to save you.

376
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,713
If I couldn't,
he asked to be sent to Hell.

377
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,798
I see.

378
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,968
I understand your circumstances.

379
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:17,224
But there needs to be consequences
for violating the rules.

380
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,143
But what are friends for, right?

381
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,563
Don't you think that's why
I stopped at just a suspension?

382
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,067
The truth is,

383
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,861
I wanted to save Nak-joon,

384
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:34,241
who went looking for you
in the fiery Hell, so much

385
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,661
that I even asked that Yeomra--

386
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,914
I even asked him for a favor.

387
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,583
Then what about the 18,000°C?

388
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,168
What 18,000°C?

389
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,504
Never mind.

390
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,799
Thank you for helping.

391
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:55,845
Honestly, I learned a lot
from this experience.

392
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,640
Even if you did things on Earth
just to survive,

393
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,392
a sin is still a sin.

394
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,854
I heard the good deeds you do on Earth
turn into money here.

395
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,564
Yes, that's correct.

396
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,149
Interestingly enough,

397
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:12,862
I was never ashamed of the fact that
I didn't have much money on Earth.

398
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,284
But I am utterly mortified up here.

399
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,578
I guess that's because
I can never take back my actions.

400
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,998
There is a way to make money.

401
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:28,211
Sometimes, you forget about
the small good deeds that you've done.

402
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,798
Or you might've done some good deeds
without realizing it.

403
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,425
And they're all piled up.

404
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,594
Like a dormant bank account?

405
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,887
Yes, that's right.

406
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,141
Sometimes, you forget
about some of your accounts

407
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,184
that still have money in them.

408
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,854
Right, like a few dimes or pennies.

409
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,063
Exactly.

410
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:51,860
I think reinstating my husband
would be the simplest solution.

411
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,578
How do you even find dormant good deeds?

412
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:05,540
Do you remember the pad we handed out
after the orientation?

413
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,294
They could've given something useful
like detergent or tissue.

414
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,338
That square tablet?

415
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,339
Correct.

416
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,551
You'll find the answer inside.

417
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,991
It wasn't this place.

418
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,621
Where could that be?

419
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,669
I'll give you one piece of advice.

420
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,714
Don't ever go there. Ever.

421
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,304
It sounds terrifying,
but I still want to see it.

422
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,681
So tell us.

423
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,433
Did you meet your owner in Hell?

424
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,352
Hey.

425
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,021
You know I have a sharp sense of smell.

426
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,525
The acrid smell of burning sulfur
was hitting my nose.

427
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,819
Then I got a waft from far away.

428
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:19,823
It was his fishy smell that I always
wanted to forget but couldn't.

429
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,742
I looked over, and there he was.

430
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,329
He was writhing in agony in the flames.

431
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,081
You must've been thrilled.

432
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,040
Right?

433
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,167
What?

434
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,591
Did you get your sweet revenge?

435
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,472
Gaeddong?

436
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,599
Is that you, Gaeddong?

437
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,982
I guess you could say that.

438
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:55,942
You guess?

439
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:56,860
Jjajang.

440
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,113
Look at that scar on your side.
It looks so cool.

441
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,074
It makes you look so intimidating!

442
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,368
-Doesn't he look like a wolf?
-Hey.

443
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,163
What were you guys up to?

444
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,206
I know it wasn't as fun
as hanging out with me,

445
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,125
but at least you got fed on time.

446
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,334
Right.

447
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,838
I can see that you guys are glowing.

448
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,716
Did you get groomed or something?

449
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,552
Right, did you know?

450
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:26,681
If you shave the fur between your toes,
you don't slip as much.

451
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,391
You didn't know that, did you?

452
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,643
-Really?
-Yes.

453
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,103
-You could shave this fur?
-Yes.

454
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,106
By the way, aren't you tired
of the canned food mixed with the kibbles?

455
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,691
Totally.

456
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,861
Are you talking about that green can?

457
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,530
-The one that tastes like turkey.
-Yes.

458
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,032
I'm getting sick of it now.

459
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,992
-Turkey?
-Yes.

460
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,285
We had it too often.

461
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,244
He mixes them?

462
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,162
-Yes.
-Yes.

463
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,585
That sounds good.

464
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:57,962
Jjajang.

465
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:03,051
I still dream about that time
we slept out in the open fields.

466
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,846
So why don't we--

467
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,932
Hey, that's a no. Okay?

468
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,600
Don't even think about it.

469
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,895
You two shouldn't live the life I lived.

470
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,482
Don't bother coming back
if that's what you're here for.

471
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,317
But we thought we'd come together and--

472
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,235
Go.

473
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,903
Go and live your life.

474
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,948
Have such a happy life
that you'll forget about me.

475
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,449
-Jjajang.
-Jjajang.

476
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,284
-Let's just live together--
-Leave!

477
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,202
I said, leave!

478
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,287
Just consider living together once more--

479
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,415
Mandu, let's go!

480
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,542
Let's go!

481
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,521
What's that sound?

482
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,149
Let's hurry.

483
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:08,157
Why didn't they explain it from the get-go
if it was so important?

484
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,119
I remember tossing it somewhere,
but I don't know where.

485
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,413
What's wrong? What does it look like?

486
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:17,083
It's about the size of my hand.
It's a white board.

487
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,711
Could it be that thing?

488
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,255
-I had ramyeon and used it--
-As a trivet.

489
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,010
So the way to make money is in here?

490
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,346
Is that what the glowing man said?

491
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,932
Geez, he made it sound so vague.

492
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,935
He said the answer was in here,
but I have no clue.

493
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,772
Should I take this

494
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,109
and meet the glowing man tomorrow?

495
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,612
-Yes, we should do that.
-Okay.

496
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,572
Get that out of here. It's distracting.

497
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,118
There's something on it.

498
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,412
A screen showed up.

499
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,330
What is this?

500
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,374
It looks like a supermarket flyer.

501
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,920
What's up with 50,000 won for waxy corn?

502
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,589
This one is two million won.

503
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,549
How could a hairpin cost that much?

504
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,511
Maybe that president
runs his own supermarket.

505
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,058
No wonder he acted so friendly
and even gave me tea.

506
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,976
I don't think
our friendship is going to work.

507
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,438
Who could that be?

508
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,487
Who…

509
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,073
You made it back safely.

510
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,491
I was really worried.

511
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,035
Thank you for your concern.

512
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,912
But do you know me?

513
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,040
Right, I must look very different now.

514
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,249
I am, well…

515
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,377
I'm the old man
who used to live behind Dongwon Mart

516
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,504
and collect cardboard boxes.

517
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,888
I see. I didn't recognize you.

518
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,432
Have you been well…

519
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,685
Right, you passed away.

520
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,480
I can't believe we met like this again.

521
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,898
Do you think you'll live forever?

522
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,235
Won't you be ashamed to see him
when you die?

523
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,070
About what happened at your funeral--

524
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,030
I really wanted to apologize.

525
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,575
My daughter was very rude.

526
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:16,953
I'm really sorry.

527
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,538
No, don't be.

528
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,834
I can totally understand
from her perspective.

529
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,548
That day, I saw her
for the first time in 20 years.

530
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,094
I guess you weren't in touch.

531
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,471
I'll be honest.

532
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,809
I only lived because of you.

533
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,111
Hey.

534
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,333
Look.

535
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,627
You gave me extra.

536
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,504
Here. Take it.

537
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,222
I'm a collector, not a thief.

538
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,642
Hold on.

539
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,231
This is waxy corn.

540
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,609
Eat one today,
and have the other one tomorrow.

541
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,031
You'll feel sick if you have both today.

542
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:00,825
All right?

543
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,953
Make sure to have one tomorrow.

544
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,497
I'm leaving.

545
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:19,635
That corn was so warm.

546
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,221
That's why.

547
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:27,602
Of course, steamed corn is warm.

548
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,811
I know everything.

549
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:34,442
After that day,
you always brought two of everything

550
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,487
and told me to save one for the next day.

551
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,116
I couldn't throw away what you gave me.

552
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,870
I'd think, "I'll have this tomorrow."

553
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:48,998
"Just until tomorrow."

554
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:56,047
That's how I lived every day,
and I managed to live a long life.

555
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,132
Well done.

556
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,345
We may not have much compared to others.

557
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:07,975
But we should use up what we had on Earth
so we won't regret it later.

558
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,644
Exactly.

559
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,482
My children and family were all alive.

560
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:20,321
But I never once spoke to any of them.

561
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,661
Thank you so much
for stopping by every day.

562
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,582
I wanted to see you again
and repay your kindness.

563
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,418
Thank you so much.

564
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,754
Don't mention it.

565
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,183
So…

566
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,602
-This waxy corn belonged to the old man.
-Right.

567
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,396
-And now it's gone.
-Yes.

568
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:57,900
Maybe all these items
are connected to you.

569
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,071
Looking at them doesn't ring any bells.

570
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:06,242
"Kang Young-suk, a white ribbon hairpin."
This one is worth a lot.

571
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,577
Do you remember
what happened between you two?

572
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:12,373
I can't even remember
what I had for dinner last night.

573
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,333
Does it have an address on it too?

574
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:18,045
-Why? Are you planning to visit?
-Of course. She's worth a lot.

575
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,382
I'm back.

576
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,592
Why does it sound like she's dying?

577
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,888
They say anyone could grow on you. Gosh.

578
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,684
Where have you been?

579
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:40,860
I wandered quite far today
to try to regain my memory.

580
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,528
But it didn't really help.

581
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:47,867
You don't have to rush
just because of what I said.

582
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,535
That's not why.

583
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,955
I just want to find out anything
about myself.

584
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,375
Since I can't remember anything,

585
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:00,838
I don't even know
if I'm a good or bad person.

586
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,049
It terrifies me.

587
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,384
You probably weren't a bad person.

588
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:11,807
I dealt with all sorts of people
all my life,

589
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,309
so I can tell right away.

590
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,646
A bad person always acts a certain way.

591
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,359
They pretend to be good.
They pretend to be considerate.

592
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,278
But you're not like that.

593
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,574
You can't become a bad person
if you're clueless.

594
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,825
I see.

595
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,372
Am I really clueless?

596
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,456
See?

597
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,459
You're not cut out to commit bad deeds.

598
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,758
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

599
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:07,405
I couldn't say goodbye when my mom
passed away three weeks ago.

600
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,158
I hope she's resting in peace.

601
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:15,871
What would she tell her
beloved granddaughter in her dreams?

602
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,718
PLEASE TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY DAUGHTER

603
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:43,649
My sweet daughter
who went to heaven ahead of me…

604
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:50,531
What would my daughter say about me
who's staying strong?

605
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,749
DON'T CRY

606
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,228
Yeong-cheol,
let's celebrate your birthday.

607
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,856
Let's have jjagyechi
at the internet cafe instead of cake!

608
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,024
Yeong-cheol.

609
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,485
Today is my birthday.

610
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,821
It's the first one
since my mom passed away.

611
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,574
I wish my birthday never came.

612
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:40,414
I wonder what my mom is thinking up there.

613
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,506
Celebrate your birthday, Yeong-cheol.

614
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,178
Today was the happiest day of my life.

615
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:13,239
I try to spend more time with my dad
ever since my mom passed away.

616
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:17,243
But the more I do, the more I remember
all the wrong things I did to her.

617
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,164
I wonder what my mom thinks

618
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,042
as she watches my dad and me
going on trips together.

619
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,513
I'M BUSY

620
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,434
Dad!

621
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,771
I just had a dream, and Mom was in it!

622
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,732
She's been watching over us.
Even on all our trips.

623
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:53,028
What's really fascinating is that
it never once rained when we camped out.

624
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,407
Maybe it was all thanks to her.

625
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,325
She made sure the weather was good.

626
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:19,722
I had no money, so I had to send
my children to an orphanage.

627
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,433
I worked like a dog and saved every penny

628
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,393
so I could get my children back.

629
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,311
Please…

630
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,772
Please give this to my children.

631
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,172
What do you think

632
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:58,052
Heaven-dwellers wish for the most
from those they left behind?

633
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,182
Not being forgotten?

634
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,059
No.

635
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,770
It's actually the opposite.

636
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,982
They don't want those left behind

637
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,569
to remember them
and live in sadness, regret, and guilt.

638
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:19,281
But the ones left behind don't know this.

639
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,661
They feel guilty
for returning to their lives,

640
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,497
for smiling and carrying on like normal.

641
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,290
Right.

642
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,127
That's why
we have to do this job for them.

643
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,630
To make sure
that these unfulfilled sentiments

644
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,634
aren't just left as longing and regret.

645
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,306
My wife was involved, so…

646
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:50,354
I apologize that I wasn't in a state
to think clearly and prioritize.

647
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:54,483
Do you remember
when you first applied for this job?

648
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,401
Of course.

649
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,405
I wanted to become someone

650
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,367
who could be of help to others as well.

651
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,457
If that sentiment of yours hasn't changed,

652
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,337
then I'd like to give you another chance.

653
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,590
Thank you.

654
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,261
I, a romantic man,

655
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:26,390
who didn't hesitate
to jump into the flames to save his wife,

656
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,059
will return to work now.

657
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,610
Ms. Kang Young-suk.

658
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,571
Ms. Kang Young-suk!

659
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,698
Ms. Kang Young-suk!

660
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,950
Hey! Kang Young-suk!

661
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,785
-Darn it.
-Hey!

662
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:48,704
You're doing it again!

663
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:54,168
I don't think she's home.
The address seems correct though.

664
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,378
Kang Young-suk… I wonder who she is.

665
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,296
That's me.

666
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,681
Do you remember me?

667
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,896
Yes, I remember you. Kang Young-suk.

668
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,400
I heard she works here.

669
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,445
Jang-mi?

670
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,571
Why are you asking?

671
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,741
She ran off last month
after borrowing money from Ms. Lee.

672
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,826
Geez, unbelievable.

673
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,538
Well, she died.

674
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,875
She had rented a room
at the inn behind this place.

675
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,335
I don't know why she did it.

676
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,669
I believe it's tomorrow.

677
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,463
That's when her funeral will take place.

678
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,840
Her family will show up.

679
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,343
We'll show them the IOU
and get what's due.

680
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,388
Why is no one here?

681
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:53,310
This is the most awkward memorial room
I've visited to collect money.

682
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,605
Be patient. Someone's bound to show up.

683
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,024
Excuse me.

684
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,150
Are you her family?

685
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,111
No. We just knew each other a bit.

686
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,029
I see.

687
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,493
Hello, sir.

688
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:14,456
There seems to be a mix-up
with Kang Young-suk's unclaimed funeral.

689
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,792
I see.

690
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,627
Okay.

691
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,047
Then we'll skip the memorial room
and head to the crematorium.

692
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:22,965
Goodbye.

693
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,216
Hold on.

694
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,845
How does an unclaimed funeral work?

695
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:34,518
Due to cost issues,
we'll keep it simple at the crematorium.

696
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,436
Please hold the service here.

697
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,479
But, Ms. Lee.

698
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,523
I'll cover the costs.

699
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,191
Are you an acquaintance?

700
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,151
Well, you could say that.

701
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,571
Since she's already here,
let's just do it.

702
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,281
All right then.

703
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,574
One moment.

704
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,369
Excuse me.

705
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,037
What about the catering service?

706
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,249
We don't need it.
She has no family, and no one will come.

707
00:47:57,332 --> 00:48:00,043
Ordering food is mandatory.

708
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,878
We'll go with the basic option.

709
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,213
Yes, ma'am.

710
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,718
You're not even her family,
so why are you--

711
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:28,655
Excuse me.

712
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,283
We're ready
for the cleansing and dressing.

713
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,910
Let's go.

714
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,622
It's not like we're strangers,
and it'll be a long journey.

715
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,332
We should say our final goodbyes.

716
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,537
I came, so that's a week's worth
off my debt, right?

717
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,498
Damn it.

718
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,751
Ms. Lee has ended up spending money
instead of collecting it.

719
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,347
I've had my share of bad luck,

720
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,184
but I truly pitied you.

721
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:45,315
I took my own life
before I could even pay up.

722
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:49,736
Thank you so much
for sending me off so well.

723
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,990
I had originally gone there
to collect money though.

724
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,159
I hope you live a beautiful life.

725
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:05,085
I thought we had the worst luck that day.
I can't believe it panned out like this.

726
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:10,215
Do this a few more times,
and we're going to get rich.

727
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,008
I'm actually rather worried.

728
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,513
What if I owe someone big-time as well

729
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,558
but can't remember?

730
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:22,519
I'm sure those people
all have this tablet.

731
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,980
I'm sure they'll also come looking for us.

732
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,606
Do you think so?

733
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,984
I hope so.

734
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,613
Now, are we headed to the "old lunchbox"?

735
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,890
You look excited.

736
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,350
Well, you know.

737
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,728
Working gives life meaning.

738
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,439
What about your memory? Still nothing?

739
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,191
No.

740
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,445
There's this image
that popped into my head,

741
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,031
but I just can't figure out where it is.

742
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,034
Speaking of which,

743
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:23,663
do you think
I could tag along with you to work?

744
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,835
Well…

745
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,547
You, Ms. Lee, and Young-ae are all busy.

746
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,091
I'm the only one who's not.

747
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,803
I just feel so useless.

748
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:45,519
I also think going there
might help me remember something.

749
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:51,107
Right. That's true. But…

750
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,619
Coming.

751
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:03,954
Not coming.

752
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,456
Coming. Not coming.

753
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,876
Coming.

754
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,131
She's really here.

755
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,097
And taking her sweet time as always.

756
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,019
All right.

757
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,398
Luke, Chapter 15.

758
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,442
Verses 11 to 32.

759
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:39,364
Today's sermon will be about
The Parable of the Prodigal Son.

760
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,783
"Jesus continued."

761
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,744
"There was a man who had two sons."

762
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,877
"The younger one said to his father…"

763
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,259
Why aren't you falling asleep?

764
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,554
Is it a problem
that I'm not sleeping during your sermon?

765
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:06,725
Like the prodigal son,
I thought I might do some repenting.

766
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:10,562
You just normally dozed off
right from the start.

767
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,981
I understand. I'll carry on then.

768
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:18,778
"So he divided his property between them…"

769
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,261
You were prepared.

770
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,889
You were waiting for me.

771
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,474
Oh, please.

772
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,477
I wasn't waiting for you.

773
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,103
Then why did you buy that?

774
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,814
This is…

775
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,567
It's good for preventing dementia.

776
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,571
So I was right.

777
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,324
I'm the one who came back from Hell,

778
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:07,202
so why does it seem like
you did all the soul-searching?

779
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,412
Well…

780
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:13,500
I made some mistakes too
and even got angry at the end.

781
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,421
I was worried you might never return.

782
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,968
Why? Because you wouldn't have a cook?

783
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:26,221
Do I look like I'm obsessed with food?

784
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,933
So are you skipping lunch today?
Are you not hungry?

785
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,770
Am I hungry?

786
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,021
Maybe a little.

787
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,731
Maybe not so much.

788
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,068
Today's weather is really something.

789
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,614
On days like this,
we should pick some pumpkin leaves.

790
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:48,201
Then, in a small pot,
we should add some soybean paste.

791
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,037
Not just any paste

792
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,956
but one filled
with lots of freshwater snails.

793
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,459
Would you like
some rice and freshwater snail wraps?

794
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,004
Rice and freshwater snail wraps?

795
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:03,508
Farmed snails won't do.
They need to be from the rice paddies.

796
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:07,595
You wrap them in pumpkin leaves--
But not just any pumpkin leaves.

797
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,558
We need ones that climb
over the fence like snakes…

798
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,476
My mouth is watering.

799
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,939
But do you think
there are snails in Heaven?

800
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,825
Aren't you joining me?

801
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,370
Or can you pray
for snails to fall from the sky?

802
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,497
Right.

803
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,966
Don't pull them up like that.

804
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,760
They'll fall down easily.

805
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,762
Do it a bit like…

806
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:52,348
Look. You need to roll them up bit by bit.

807
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,226
Like this?

808
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,190
Your feet look like a baby's feet.

809
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:02,776
I can see that
you didn't have a hard life.

810
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:10,158
I didn't mean that literally.

811
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,911
It's just an expression
for saying that they're white and pretty.

812
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:20,376
Your heels look just like dinner rolls.
You know them, don't you?

813
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,921
The ones they give you
when you order pork cutlet.

814
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:25,173
You have it with the meat.

815
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,639
You haven't had a variety of food,
so I'm excited to feed you.

816
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,104
By the way,
do you know how freshwater snails look?

817
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,357
Come on. Do you think I'm a fool?

818
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,526
Take a close look,

819
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,695
and you'll find paths
similar to mole tunnels.

820
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,864
They're made by freshwater snails.

821
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:53,660
If you follow them,
they'll stop somewhere.

822
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:59,124
Feel around with your feet,

823
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,209
and you'll come across something round.

824
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,877
That's the freshwater snail.

825
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:04,921
Got it?

826
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,132
-Okay.
-Good.

827
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,974
My feet are stuck.

828
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:19,310
They're stuck.
This shouldn't be happening.

829
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,228
Really?

830
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,521
Wait there. Let me…

831
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,022
No!

832
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,946
You should've pulled me out
from outside instead of joining me.

833
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,783
I was just trying to help you.

834
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,743
Geez. I was trying to save you,
but you're--

835
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,537
Losing my shit?

836
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:40,748
Come on.

837
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:43,877
What kind of pastor
would say such a thing?

838
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,753
It seems to fit the context perfectly.

839
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,422
No, it doesn't.

840
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,175
But how do we get out of here?

841
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,053
Try wiggling your toes.

842
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:57,098
Then gradually make some space that way.

843
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,730
What? Do you think you can get out?

844
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,024
It's a snail.

845
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:07,859
Hold on.

846
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,199
This is a freshwater snail, right?
I'm right, aren't I?

847
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:19,954
Now that I've taught you everything,
let's see who can catch the most.

848
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,289
-What?
-Ready…

849
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:23,583
But this is my first time.

850
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,212
I got one!

851
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,505
I got it.

852
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,216
Look!

853
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:04,999
I heard they're orphans.

854
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:08,878
I heard they were abandoned as kids
and grew up in an orphanage.

855
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,714
Her brother will be holding her hand
as they walk down.

856
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,759
I pity those poor kids.

857
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,182
You look gorgeous!

858
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,141
Look over here.

859
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,435
One, two.

860
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,312
Okay. One more.

861
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,939
One, two.

862
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,440
Okay, you're done.

863
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,900
-Congratulations!
-You're pretty!

864
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,527
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

865
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,903
You're the first to get married.

866
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,322
-I'll see you later.
-Bye.

867
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,490
Bye!

868
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:42,912
Jung Bo-ram.

869
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:05,351
I'd like to ask you for a personal favor.

870
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:43,264
What are you doing?

871
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:46,517
Stop it.

872
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:49,312
-Are you going to go in looking like that?
-Looking like what?

873
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,981
You look so ugly right now.

874
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:54,484
Get lost.

875
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,444
Do you really mean that?

876
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,655
Mom isn't here. I'm all you have.

877
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,166
Are you bawling because of her?

878
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:15,171
Why are you doing this of all people?

879
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,392
Jung Bo-ram.

880
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,480
What was the hardest thing for us?

881
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,943
It was not having a family.

882
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,905
Having just each other.

883
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,702
But today is the day

884
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:51,916
when you get to have
something I could never give you.

885
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,585
A family.

886
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,840
So, from this moment on,

887
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:04,345
you have to be
a thousand times happier than others.

888
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:14,522
If you keep crying,
I'm going to send these photos to others.

889
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,232
You better not.

890
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,110
You're really… You look…

891
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:20,820
Okay. One moment, please.

892
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:29,996
Who are you?

893
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:37,253
Someone insisted
that I give this to you two.

894
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:39,964
Who did?

895
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,007
I'm not sure.

896
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,301
They said you'll probably know
once you take a look.

897
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:46,387
Who could it be?

898
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,565
JUNG CHAN-WOO

899
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:27,136
TO MY BELOVED SON,
YOUR MOTHER HAS NEVER ONCE FORGOTTEN YOU

900
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:33,100
My beloved daughter, Bo-ram.

901
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:37,772
Just saying your name makes me tear up.

902
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:39,190
My baby.

903
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,777
On days when I miss you terribly,

904
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:47,198
I secretly call out your name.

905
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:51,536
I wish I could run to you both right now.

906
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:56,582
I wish I could hold you tight.

907
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:58,793
But I can't.

908
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,838
And that makes me cry.

909
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,175
Also…

910
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,761
She asked me to do this.

911
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,688
"Thank you both for growing up so well."

912
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,357
"And I'm sorry."

913
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,208
Mom…

914
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:37,350
Gosh, you're really a pro at this.

915
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:40,519
I don't think I even caught ten.

916
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,104
You know it.

917
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,149
When I wanted to cry alone
back in the day,

918
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:49,320
I'd often say I was going out
to pick some mugwort or catch some snails.

919
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,784
I think
I was about to end my life that day.

920
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:57,203
I was wading into the river
with my shoes off.

921
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:59,580
Then I felt something under my feet.

922
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,541
I picked it up, and it was a snail.

923
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,586
I found one, then another.

924
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:09,340
My skirt was full of them.

925
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:11,759
And suddenly, I wanted to live.

926
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:16,681
I thought of making sauce
and having it with steamed pumpkin leaves.

927
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:19,141
It sounded so delicious.

928
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,730
Were you really
thinking of ending your life?

929
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,315
Why?

930
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:31,821
Beats me.

931
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,573
I barely remember now.

932
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:38,619
Anyway, life and death
aren't really up to me.

933
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:43,249
I'd just eat tasty food, sleep,

934
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:46,043
and nothing seemed like a big deal
the next day.

935
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,224
These freshwater snails

936
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,226
must've done something good
to end up in Heaven.

937
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:03,853
Are you sure we can eat them?

938
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:06,856
Well…

939
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:09,108
Shouldn't it be okay? Is it not?

940
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,193
Don't you think it's okay?

941
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,362
Is it? I feel uneasy about it.

942
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,491
I feel bad for the freshwater snails.

943
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:20,578
Could you please pray
so that they'll go to a better place?

944
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,538
Pray? Me?

945
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:25,791
You're closer to God than I am.

946
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:31,088
Okay.

947
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,848
Dear Lord, we thank You.

948
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:45,144
Please forgive the sins of our snails

949
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:50,316
and guide them to a better place.

950
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,046
It's delicious.

951
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:27,019
That's how I've been wandering around
for the past few days.

952
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:30,523
I realized
some people remembered me fondly

953
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:33,818
while others would probably
rather forget me.

954
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:38,280
And all those connections
piled up together

955
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,324
are what make up my life.

956
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:46,539
I think my life
is only full of bad connections.

957
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,708
It doesn't feel that nice to hear that.

958
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:51,752
What?

959
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,589
I wasn't talking about you.

960
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:57,299
Then who?

961
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:01,220
I'd rather not mention it.

962
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:05,766
I'd rather not.

963
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:07,935
What did I say?

964
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:09,728
No thanks.

965
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:10,646
Geez.

966
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:14,692
Do you have the hearing of a bat?

967
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,737
You look so kind,
but you don't listen at all.

968
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:22,449
I only learned from the best.

969
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:23,659
Please.

970
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:25,953
Oh, please.

971
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:30,416
Seeing how we're starting to bicker,
I think it's time to go.

972
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:31,333
Shall we?

973
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,211
Sure, let's go.

974
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:41,093
I've been sitting for too long
that my knees… Hold on.

975
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:42,720
I just need to get up slowly.

976
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:44,555
Wait. Hold on.

977
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:45,931
Wait.

978
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,099
Get on my back.

979
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,642
No, it's okay.

980
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,227
You're the only churchgoer I have.

981
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:53,731
If you hurt yourself,
I'll have to close the church.

982
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,107
Okay? Go on.

983
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,572
-All right.
-Goodness.

984
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,783
Geez, you're as light as a feather.

985
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,423
Aren't I heavy? I must be.

986
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:22,009
Not one bit. It doesn't feel like
I'm carrying anything.

987
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,596
This is heavier.
Why did you bring a clay pot?

988
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,610
PHONE BOOTH

989
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:41,654
Thank you.

990
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,366
I wasn't trying to pressure you.

991
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:47,451
It's just this once.

992
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:49,495
I mean it.

993
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:53,249
And I didn't bring you here
to help me with work,

994
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:55,417
so look for anything
that might help you remember,

995
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,794
whether it's people or things.

996
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:02,424
Everything around here
still feels unfamiliar.

997
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,850
-Som-i, let's get going.
-Okay.

998
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:26,073
I have to stop by somewhere.
Can you wait here?

999
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:28,158
-Should I tag along?
-No, I'll go alone.

1000
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:36,625
Hello.

1001
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:38,460
Excuse me.

1002
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:43,757
Do you happen to know the senior
who occasionally stands out front?

1003
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:46,385
He uses a four-legged walker.

1004
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,595
I see. You mean Mr. Hwang?

1005
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,266
I haven't seen him around lately.

1006
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,685
-I heard he was hospitalized.
-Hospitalized?

1007
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,312
He fell not too long ago.

1008
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,022
I see.

1009
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:11,368
Som-i.

1010
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:13,787
Som-i!

1011
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:17,875
I have to rush off somewhere,
so please wait here!

1012
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:15,182
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

1013
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:17,518
I just feel anxious for some reason.

1014
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:19,144
My heart's racing.

1015
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:22,064
Sweetheart, is that you?

1016
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:23,232
Mother?

1017
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:25,609
But she comes and goes
like it's her own place.

1018
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:27,569
She even judges the way I keep the place.

1019
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:30,239
-It makes me uncomfortable.
-Mom.

1020
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:33,325
Can't you just try to like my mother
if you care about me?

1021
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,869
She needs to cooperate too.

1022
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:39,665
Am I right?
Did you make eye contact with me?

1023
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:41,875
I'm starting to feel scared.

1024
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,045
I don't know what's waiting for me
at the end of my memory.

1025
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:50,259
I must have done something terribly wrong.

1026
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:57,349
