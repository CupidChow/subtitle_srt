HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,516
PROFESSOR CHOI DU-GANG BOOK SIGNING

00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,852
CELEBRATING THE PUBLICATION
OF THE WEIGHT OF MEMORY

5
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,483
THE WEIGHT OF MEMORY

00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,446
PROFESSOR CHOI DU-GANG BOOK SIGNING

7
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,781
-Hello, Professor Choi.
-Hello.

8
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,158
-I'm a really big fan.
-Thank you.

9
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,160
-Could you sign this?
-Sure.

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,161
What are your names?

11
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,579
-Kim Go-eun.
-Ms. Kim Go-eun.

12
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,081
I'm Lee Ji-su.

13
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,167
-Could we take a picture with you?
-Of course.

14
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,293
I can't believe this!

15
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,003
One, two, three.

16
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:31,174
THE 7TH BOOK BY PROFESSOR CHOI DU-GANG,
KOREA'S INDIANA JONES

17
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,511
You must be tired.

18
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,346
-I'll go get some coffee.
-Okay.

19
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,651
Excuse me.

20
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,736
Are you Professor Choi Du-gang?

21
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,071
Yes.

22
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,697
No way!

23
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,534
You're the rising star of archaeology!

24
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,372
Excuse me. It's just that
I'm a well-known history nerd.

25
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,416
And I've never met
someone like you before.

26
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,334
It's such an honor.

27
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,586
I see. Thank you.

28
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,754
Sir.

29
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,133
Can we shake hands?

30
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,425
Sure.

31
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,344
Come forward. Here.

32
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:17,929
Okay.

33
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,390
There's something I've been dying to know.

34
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,851
How were you able to pinpoint

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,603
the exact locations
of pro-Japanese activities

36
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:29,774
and where those atrocities took place
during the Japanese colonial period?

37
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,027
It's as if
you lived through that era yourself.

38
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,113
Well…

39
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,366
I'll take that as a compliment.

40
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,034
Indeed.

41
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,203
You're Choi Du-gang.

42
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,372
No.

43
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,419
Hashimoto Junpei.

44
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,839
Member of the Imperial Youth Corps.

45
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,634
Thank you, Du-gang.

46
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,344
I won't forget this.

47
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,263
It's nothing.

48
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,224
Even those patrolmen
won't know you're here.

49
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,268
Cover yourselves with this.

50
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,437
Here.

51
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,647
One more thing.

52
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,358
Don't come out until I give the signal.
Understand?

53
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,443
Okay.

54
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,663
Du-gang! Hey!

55
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,000
-Du-gang! Choi Du-gang!
-What's wrong?

56
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,501
-What?
-What the hell?

57
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,879
-Du-gang!
-Why is this locked?

58
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,422
Why can't I open it?

59
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,506
Choi Du-gang!

60
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,052
-Du-gang!
-What's that? Fire?

61
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,386
What's going on?

62
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,180
-Du-gang!
-Step back right now!

63
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,097
Du-gang!

64
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,558
-Isn't that fire?
-Choi Du-gang, you bastard!

65
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,517
What's going on? Hey.

66
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,937
-Choi Du-gang!
-Open the door!

67
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,360
Open the door, you asshole!

68
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,950
You bastard!

69
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:02,867
Open the door!

70
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,246
What makes you truly evil is that

71
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,290
you profited from doing evil things
in the past.

72
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,126
And you're still doing those evil deeds
in this life.

73
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,504
You don't plan on reflecting at all,
do you?

74
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,131
Please… Please spare me. Please.

75
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,426
Don't worry. I won't kill you.

76
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,721
You'll just finally be
starting your life from scratch

77
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,099
like everyone else.

78
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,517
Simple, right?

79
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:42,156
Sure, you might've experienced Hell
in your past life.

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,410
But the upcoming Hell
might be slightly warmer.

81
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,578
You can look forward to it.

82
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,716
Sir, are you not feeling well?

83
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,346
Sir!

84
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,161
Ma'am.

85
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,414
Come on out. I know everything.

86
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,755
All right!

87
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,007
Daddy will buy you ice cream.

88
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,009
Okay? What a good girl.

89
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,552
Come on out now.

90
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,349
I guess I have no choice.

91
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,144
It's a bit far,
but I'll just do it from here.

92
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,146
I'll delete your past life memories.

93
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,481
Wait.

94
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,902
I only just found her.

95
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,197
Please…

96
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,533
Let me just see my daughter.

97
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,828
Can't you erase them afterward?

98
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,616
Hi.

99
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,498
What is it?
Do I have something on my face?

100
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,006
It's a daughter.

101
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,759
What?

102
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,678
You're having a daughter.

103
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,514
And she's beautiful

104
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,850
just like her mom.

105
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,896
The baby's well-being is important,

106
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,482
but you need to be healthy too.

107
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,320
Don't skip meals.

108
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,448
And watch out for cars.

109
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,601
Thank you.

110
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,811
It's all done now.

111
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,673
I can totally empathize with her.

112
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,594
If it were me,
I'd go see my child first too.

113
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,012
I know.

114
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,639
That's why I feel bad about it.

115
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,016
Maybe I shouldn't have done it.

116
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,686
You were just doing your job.

117
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,814
I made some
hot kimchi and bean sprout soup.

118
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,399
Have some and feel better.

119
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,817
Gosh, that sounds perfect.

120
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,778
-Right.
-Yes?

121
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,656
Aren't you entering
Young-ae's dream tomorrow?

122
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,865
Yes.

123
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,369
But why would they broadcast it?
It makes me uncomfortable.

124
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,412
This won't do.

125
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,914
We need to prepare for it.

126
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,376
What's up your sleeve this time?

127
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,752
Come on out. Just trust me.

128
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,004
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

129
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,091
DOOR TO DREAMS

130
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,387
Ms. Oh, is Ms. Lee Hae-sook ready?

131
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,014
I'll go to the waiting room.

132
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,651
Ms. Lee, are you all ready?

133
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,444
Well…

134
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,363
Is this your outfit?

135
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:36,492
My husband said fairies need wings, so…

136
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,785
It's a bit much, isn't it?

137
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,457
No, it looks great on you.

138
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,794
-We're going to begin soon.
-Okay.

139
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,087
There are a few precautions

140
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,047
-before you enter the dream.
-Okay.

141
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,175
Dreams have many unexpected variables,
so you need to proceed quickly.

142
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,885
If she wakes up midway, it's over.

143
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,096
Some people do continue the dream
after waking,

144
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,389
but that's very unlikely.

145
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,225
Does Ms. Lee Young-ae have
anything like sleep apnea?

146
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,935
People with that tend to wake up easily.

147
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,313
She sleeps like a log.

148
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,273
-That's fortunate.
-Yes.

149
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,691
We'll begin soon.

150
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,192
Please have Ms. Lee on standby.

151
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,319
Okay.

152
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,486
-Let's go.
-Okay.

153
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,451
When you get the cue, go through the door.

154
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,858
All right, Ms. Lee.

155
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,361
You will now enter
Ms. Lee Young-ae's dream.

156
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,278
Cue!

157
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,996
Nothing has changed.

158
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,886
I told her to only make enough to eat.

159
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,014
What side dishes did she make?

160
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,268
Ms. Lee, you don't have much time.

161
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,231
Young-ae.

162
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,150
Young-ae.

163
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,569
Young-ae!

164
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,530
-Lee Young-ae!
-What? Damn it.

165
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,533
I told you not to call me by my full name.
Who are you anyway?

166
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,453
Ms. Lee!

167
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,621
Hi.

168
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,208
How did you get here?
Is this a dream or real life?

169
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,503
It's a dream. Sit down.

170
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,923
Young-ae, there's no time,
so listen carefully.

171
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,008
These are the lottery numbers.

172
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:03,931
3, 7, 8, 9, 24, 44.

173
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:08,018
I prayed every night before sleeping
that you'd visit me in my dreams.

174
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,395
That's why I'm here.

175
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,689
Memorize the numbers.

176
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:16,610
3, 7, 8, 9, 24, 44.

177
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,528
Oh, right.

178
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,697
Grandma Bok-sun owes 480,000 won, right?

179
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,116
She keeps trying to trick me,
saying it's 410,000 won.

180
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,659
It's 480,000 won.

181
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,036
But that's not important right now. Okay?

182
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,329
Memorize them right now.

183
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:33,377
3, 7, 8, 9, 24, 44.

184
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,546
-Did you get that?
-What comes after three and seven?

185
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,547
Hey!

186
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,049
You know I've always been bad
with numbers.

187
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,926
-Geez.
-Ms. Lee Young-ae is about to wake up.

188
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,303
Get ready to come back.

189
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,181
Come back through the same door
you used earlier.

190
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,350
-Memorize them. Just memorize them.
-Okay.

191
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,437
3, 7, 8, 9, 24, 44.

192
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,605
Slow down a bit.

193
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,273
What was after seven again? Three…

194
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,275
-What do I do?
-Eight…

195
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,526
-Eight.
-Eight?

196
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,444
Ms. Lee.

197
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,196
Wrap it up quickly and come out.

198
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,614
Come on.

199
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,115
Excuse me.

200
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,034
Honey, it's me.

201
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,869
-Can you hear me clearly?
-Yes.

202
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:07,953
Okay, listen carefully.

203
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,207
Repeat exactly what I say to her.
Okay, first…

204
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,834
7, 9, 3, 8, 24.

205
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,795
Mr. Seven is reciting
the nine times table.

206
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,173
Mr. Seven is reciting
the nine times table.

207
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,425
3, 8, 24.

208
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,093
Three times eight is twenty-four.

209
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,305
Yes, that's it. Next is…

210
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,891
-This is your favorite song.
-Okay.

211
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,393
I won the lottery, four, four, four

212
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,520
Forty-four!

213
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,981
I won the lottery, four, four, four

214
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,358
That's it! Great job.

215
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,567
Tell her just that.

216
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,070
-Listen carefully.
-Okay.

217
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,198
Mr. Seven is reciting
the nine times table.

218
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,784
Three times eight is twenty-four.

219
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,204
I won the lottery, four, four, four

220
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,581
Forty-four. Repeat it.

221
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,626
Mr. Seven is reciting
the nine times table.

222
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,294
-Three times eight is twenty-four.
-Yes.

223
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,172
I won the lottery, four, four, four

224
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,132
-Right? 44.
-You did it.

225
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,717
You need to come back now.

226
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,635
Good job.

227
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,679
Young-ae.

228
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,138
-Yes?
-I'm leaving now.

229
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,892
Don't meet a terrible guy
and give him everything you have.

230
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,519
Bye.

231
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,230
Ms. Lee!

232
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,826
Mr. Seven is reciting
the nine times table.

233
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,328
Three times eight is twenty-four.

234
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,498
I won the lottery, four, four, four

235
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,959
Forty-four.

236
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,799
That girl isn't bad with numbers.

237
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,510
She's just not bright enough.

238
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,055
-I wonder if she got the ticket.
-Honey.

239
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,182
This came for you.

240
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,476
Who's it from?

241
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,730
"Lee Young-ae." It's from Young-ae. Great.

242
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,648
-From Young-ae?
-Yes.

243
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,319
They can send packages here too?

244
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,236
Of course.

245
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:05,821
Gosh.

246
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,115
Looks like Young-ae was thinking of you.

247
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,201
Let's see. What's this?

248
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,329
Oh my.

249
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,123
-Seasoned radish.
-Seasoned radish.

250
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,124
This is…

251
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,127
-Mallow soup.
-Okay.

252
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:25,299
This is grilled deodeok root.
They're all your favorites. Right?

253
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,886
Good heavens. Is this seasoned radish
or seasoned batons?

254
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,475
She tried her best
even though she can't cook.

255
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,769
But how did this get here?

256
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,896
You see…

257
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,191
Anything people on Earth want to share
with those who passed away

258
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,275
gets delivered here.

259
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,193
We get a lot

260
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,363
especially on holidays, Parents' Day,
or other special occasions.

261
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,616
I don't think I can eat this.

262
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:55,162
Why not? She'd want you to enjoy it.
Come on, let's eat.

263
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,832
She should worry about herself.

264
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,795
I noticed that she wasn't eating properly.

265
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,714
And she even slept on the sofa.

266
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,509
She'll be fine. She's a good kid.

267
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,345
She'll put that lottery money
to good use too. Let's try it.

268
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,813
This is definitely Young-ae's work.

269
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,648
It's undercooked.

270
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,900
Really? Let me try.

271
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,323
You're right.

272
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,665
Damn it. What was it again?

273
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,709
What was it again?

274
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,502
Mr. Three…

275
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,588
No, it's Mr. Seven. Yes, Mr. Seven.

276
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,591
Mr. Seven is reciting
the nine times table.

277
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,510
Three times eight is twenty-four.

278
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,679
I won the lottery, four, four, four

279
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,888
That's it!

280
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,140
Mr. Seven…

281
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,309
is reciting the nine times table.

282
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,730
Delivery!

283
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,481
Please put it down there.

284
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,111
You bastard.

285
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,112
Damn it!

286
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,989
You…

287
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:12,906
I…

288
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,867
Damn it!

289
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,250
Get over here!

290
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,627
I said, stop!

291
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,176
Stop right there!

292
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,035
Damn it.

293
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,037
Hey!

294
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,715
Geez. I got you, you bastard.

295
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,925
-Get up.
-Who are you?

296
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:13,842
Let's go.

297
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,346
This week's winning lottery numbers are…

298
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,267
Seven.

299
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,478
Mr. Seven is…

300
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,147
The next number is nine.

301
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,399
Reciting the nine times table.

302
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,276
Three and eight.

303
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,403
Three times eight is twenty-four.

304
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,530
Twenty-four.

305
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,991
What is the last number?

306
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,494
I won the lottery, four, four, four.

307
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,954
Forty-four. Congratulations!

308
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,377
Please spare me! Please!

309
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,348
I'm telling you.
I'm a completely changed man.

310
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,017
You saw me working hard earlier,
delivering packages.

311
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,186
I've been working nonstop
for the past 20 days.

312
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,606
I'm diligently attending my gamblers
anonymous meetings called "Die or Stop."

313
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,400
And…

314
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,694
I'll get my first paycheck in ten days.

315
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,780
I'll pay you back everything then,
including the interest. Okay?

316
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,700
How much do I owe you?
Will 1.2 million won with interest do?

317
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,702
It's 1.98 billion won.

318
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,162
What?

319
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,831
That's how much the lottery prize was.

320
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,583
So what?

321
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,042
I lost it because of you!

322
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,255
You'd have to actually buy
a lottery ticket to win.

323
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,176
-I'd win every time with that logic.
-Damn it.

324
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,677
What I'm saying is…

325
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,387
Stop chasing pipe dreams.

326
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,056
-Be diligent like me and--
-Yes, diligent.

327
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:47,519
I'll be really diligent
about making your life miserable.

328
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,149
First, pay up 1,109,000 won.

329
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,942
I said I'll pay you when I get my--

330
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,695
-You little--
-What can I do when I have no money?

331
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,572
That's not my problem.

332
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,283
I don't care if you pay
with your body or whatever.

333
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,618
Just give it to me right now.

334
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,119
Geez.

335
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,330
You're all the same.

336
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,375
That's what you wanted all along.

337
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,589
Come on!
How much money do you have right now?

338
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,843
Five thousand won.

339
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,762
That's my dinner money.

340
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,514
Buy yourself a triangle gimbap.

341
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:29,144
Don't you dare eat until you pay me back.

342
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,104
Don't even smoke or drink.

343
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,857
I'm going to follow you around
until you pay me. Got that?

344
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,778
You're stepping over the line here.
I said I'd pay you back!

345
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,113
-Don't you trust me?
-Have you ever given me a reason to?

346
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,907
-Do you want to die?
-Oh, dear.

347
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,534
-Cut him some slack.
-Sorry?

348
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,621
Men need their egos stroked.

349
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,873
Right? So you understand.

350
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,168
Then when will he pay off his debt
if he spends everything?

351
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,381
Married couples live
for the fun of paying off debt.

352
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:01,468
He doesn't look like
the type who'd make you starve.

353
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,386
Geez.

354
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,888
How unbelievable.

355
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,473
Seriously…

356
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,267
Who are you calling a married couple?

357
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,102
-Calm down.
-Let me go!

358
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,687
I said, let go!

359
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,771
-Come on!
-Calm down.

360
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,731
-Let me go!
-Goodness.

361
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,733
-There are kids around here.
-Sorry?

362
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,235
Show your affection at home.

363
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,320
What?

364
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,240
You must love each other dearly.

365
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,576
-Lady…
-No.

366
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,744
Be the bigger person.

367
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,246
-Calm down!
-She keeps provoking me!

368
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,462
Damn it.

369
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,591
Who is it?

370
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,720
Why are you here at this hour?

371
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,264
I started a night delivery job
to pay you back quickly.

372
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,807
But I didn't order anything.

373
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,517
Open it.

374
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,354
TO: LEE YOUNG-AE
FROM: JANG GI-HWAN

375
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,566
Open it.

376
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,408
Ta-da!

377
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,703
I'm going to work really hard
and pay back every cent I owe you.

378
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,331
You said
you were going to follow me around.

379
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,499
Then wear comfortable shoes.

380
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,338
-Forget it if you don't want them.
-It's okay.

381
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,716
-I'll throw them out after I wear them.
-Just make sure you follow me well.

382
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,510
Don't you worry.
I'll follow you to the ends of the Earth.

383
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,638
But in all seriousness,
you better not lose them.

384
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,476
It's the first gift
I've ever given to a woman.

385
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,479
I never asked.

386
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,730
You never know.

387
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,400
I might be
your 1.98 billion won lottery ticket.

388
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,611
Are you insane?

389
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,133
HEAVEN TOUR

390
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,187
Honey.

391
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:18,855
Yes?

392
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,358
What if…

393
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,152
we reincarnated as well?

394
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,117
Why would you ask such a serious question

395
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,411
as casually as
"How about some sujebi for dinner?"

396
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,625
Actually, I've been thinking about it
ever since you came here.

397
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,379
You don't want to keep living here
with your old wife?

398
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,049
No, that's not why.

399
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:51,012
It's just that the fact that
you're stuck in that body because of me

400
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,723
has been bothering me all along,

401
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,225
even though I never said anything.

402
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,729
I'm happy. Really.

403
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,568
I love you and think you're wonderful
no matter what you look like.

404
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,570
But I don't know if it's right

405
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,156
to make you stay like this
forever in Heaven.

406
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,162
Come on. I'd still only want you
even if we were reincarnated.

407
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,746
Not me.

408
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,957
You don't have to choose me again.

409
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,585
But I'd want to marry you,

410
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,795
start a family with you,

411
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,214
and grow old together with you again.

412
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:27,716
That's what I want.

413
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,094
Fine.

414
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:34,723
What?

415
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,433
Let's do it.

416
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,353
Okay.

417
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,072
WELCOME TO HEAVEN, EVERYONE!

418
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,619
Hello.

419
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,887
That little punk.

420
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,422
You always have to make
such a noisy entrance.

421
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,841
Heaven is too boring, you see.

422
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,344
So I thought I'd liven things up a bit.

423
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:59,015
And you always speak so casually to me
when I'm your older brother.

424
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,726
We're like day and night, earth and sky,

425
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,979
sin and punishment, Heaven and Hell.

426
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,146
That's what we are.

427
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,691
-There's none of that between us.
-You little…

428
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,320
In the beginning,

429
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,323
day was created before night.

430
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,241
So--

431
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,076
In the beginning, there was darkness.

432
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,661
So night came first.

433
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,247
Don't you know that? Are you that dense?

434
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,625
Hold on, I need to talk to you.

435
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,294
What is it?

436
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,797
Are you going to keep
arguing with me, you punk?

437
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,715
Hey, let go of me!

438
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,258
If you don't, I'm going back!

439
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,135
Then you won't get your vacation either.

440
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,928
All right.

441
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:40,098
I was just messing around
since we haven't met in a while.

442
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:45,520
Try not to scare the Heaven-dwellers,
and watch over them for a few days, okay?

443
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,230
Geez.

444
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,066
Why do you want to go down there?
There's nothing to see.

445
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,695
Well, something new happens down there
every day.

446
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:57,449
So there are new things
I need to know every day too.

447
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,784
Is that why
they commit new sins every day?

448
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,870
Damn it.

449
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,163
Have a safe trip.

450
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,125
Heaven.

451
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,960
I'm here.

452
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,858
Look at this.

453
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,153
Heaven is still boring.

454
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,783
Being bored is a sin too, you idiots.

455
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,951
Take this, you sinners!

456
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,807
Do you believe in the existence of God?

457
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,150
Look at that.

458
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,904
Yes! I love it!

459
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,117
Whether you believe…

460
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,706
Yeomra, you little…

461
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,592
Whether you believe or not,

462
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:44,597
you can meet God
at various moments and in various places

463
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,599
as you go through life.

464
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,793
Ladies…

465
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,171
Not the ladies' room. Not the ladies'.

466
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,467
Excuse me.

467
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,022
God, please help me.

468
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:34,939
Please help.

469
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,692
If you just get me through this, I…

470
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,237
I'll do lots of good deeds
and help lots of poor people.

471
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,823
Please help!

472
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,909
Please…

473
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,207
END OF 2ND FLOOR
BATHROOM OPEN!

474
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,458
Thank you, God!

475
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,043
Thank you, God!

476
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,634
-Mom's surgery…
-The tuition is due tomorrow.

477
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,260
I don't want my kid to struggle…

478
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,178
Don't worry.

479
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,138
-Please protect…
-I'll take care of it.

480
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,056
-Dating?
-…my husband.

481
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,849
-Tomorrow…
-That's a luxury I can't afford.

482
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,060
-Mom.
-I hope they won't bully me anymore.

483
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,479
I don't have any hope left.

484
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,651
I wanted to hold on somehow,
but I don't think I can.

485
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,445
Life is too hard.

486
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,075
You've suffered so much
because of this worthless daughter.

487
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,036
I'm sorry, Mom.

488
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,121
I'm leaving first.

489
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,915
FAIL

490
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,291
I'm sorry, Mom.

491
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,710
I'm really sorry.

492
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,659
Jjajang, I'm counting on you.

493
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,989
CHARCOAL BRIQUETTES

494
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,156
This is the last piece.

495
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,575
I have no more.

496
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,234
PART-TIME JOB AVAILABLE
20S TO 40S

497
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,826
Hello.

498
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,620
Are you looking for a part-timer?

499
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,133
Sausage! I want sausage!

500
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,259
I'm sorry.

501
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,469
I couldn't buy you more sausages.

502
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,889
But I got a part-time job today.

503
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,809
I'll buy you canned meat once I get paid.

504
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,853
Oh, no.

505
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,938
I thought of a name for you.

506
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,273
How about Beauty?

507
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,567
Beu… Beauty?

508
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,568
Do you like it?

509
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,196
Come on, who names a boy "Beauty"?

510
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,906
I like it too, princess.

511
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,408
Beauty.

512
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,119
I said I don't like Beauty.

513
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,747
Wait. Did she just say "princess"?

514
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,123
Beauty.

515
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:06,836
They should've at least
let me choose my gender.

516
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,171
Perhaps…

517
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:12,175
God is much closer to us than we think.

518
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,945
Your new job must be pretty tough.

519
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,572
Hello, sir.

520
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,825
What brings you here?

521
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,327
I'm on vacation.

522
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,581
The breeze feels really nice today.

523
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,876
It'd be a shame
to just clock out and go home.

524
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,891
Everything's great in Heaven,

525
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,936
but it's a shame we don't have this.

526
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,773
This isn't just a drink.
It's life, you know?

527
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,567
Same soju,

528
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,237
but it can taste bitter one day
and sweet the next.

529
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,241
It's okay.

530
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,742
Okay.

531
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,672
It's similar to the memories
I go around erasing.

532
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,884
Some memories are bitter
while others are sweet.

533
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,974
This job isn't exactly pleasant, is it?

534
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,728
Well…

535
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,149
If I put myself in their shoes,

536
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,485
I guess I'd have
all sorts of thoughts too.

537
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,239
You forget all your past memories
when you reincarnate.

538
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,240
But then again,

539
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,120
you won't even know
that you've forgotten them.

540
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,376
Nak-joon.

541
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,547
I'd rather see you
move up to a higher level

542
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,092
for spiritual advancement
rather than reincarnating.

543
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,723
It's just that…

544
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,393
I owe Hae-sook too much.

545
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,440
I want to repay that debt somehow.

546
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,695
But I just don't know how.

547
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:42,950
Speaking of which,

548
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:47,121
she has also been qualified
for reincarnation.

549
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,166
You'll go down together once again
and be reunited.

550
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,257
"Once again"?

551
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:06,349
They say husbands and wives
are prisoners bound by the same chain.

552
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,851
It means

553
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,354
they eventually walk
in the same direction.

554
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,644
Hey, mister.

555
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,651
My wife.

556
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,278
Goodness.

557
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,738
You still recognize me,
so I guess you're not too drunk.

558
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,993
Where did you even drink?

559
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,828
Did you drink alone?

560
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,746
Just as I thought.

561
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,624
You're the only one for me.

562
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,755
-You're embarrassing us--
-I love you, my wife.

563
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,465
You're embarrassing us.

564
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,051
Let's go inside.

565
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,471
All right. As long as you're happy.

566
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,310
HEAVEN SUPPORT CENTER

567
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,395
You want to do a story on us?

568
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,313
Correct.

569
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,274
Our show, New Life, Good Reincarnation,

570
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:41,027
is a show where we follow
those who reincarnate.

571
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,113
We're preparing a special feature
for our 100th episode.

572
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,449
Has it been that long?
I've never seen your show.

573
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,909
-The ratings must be pretty bad.
-Honey.

574
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,997
So for our 100th episode special,

575
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,960
we'd love to interview you two,
the most popular couple in Heaven.

576
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,004
Us?

577
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,673
The president
strongly recommended you two.

578
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,842
He said you're a model couple.

579
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,678
But…

580
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,850
we haven't actually decided
to reincarnate yet.

581
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:13,851
What do you mean?

582
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,189
You said you'd been considering it
ever since I arrived here.

583
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,066
You wanted to reincarnate together.

584
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,195
We looked into it,

585
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,739
and you're both eligible
for reincarnation.

586
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,658
Am I finally eligible too?

587
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,743
Yes, well…

588
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,411
We don't know the details,

589
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:37,166
but the president said
you become eligible for reincarnation

590
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:40,795
when you no longer have
lingering regrets or grudges.

591
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,263
Just saying, but…

592
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,600
you don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

593
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:56,936
Do what?

594
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,563
The filming? Or reincarnation?

595
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:01,690
Both.

596
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,192
No.

597
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:07,279
I feel like there's a reason I met my mom,

598
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,367
mother-in-law, and even Eun-ho
here in Heaven.

599
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:15,788
The thought of them
used to torment me my entire life.

600
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,666
But they've been resolved here.

601
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,584
Right.

602
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:26,132
I want to go back down now
and start afresh with you.

603
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,259
Don't you feel the same?

604
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,137
What?

605
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,557
I mean, I'm fine with anything you want.

606
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,572
Why are you just sitting there
when the shoot is tomorrow?

607
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,408
Shouldn't you be
planning things out again?

608
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,659
Why are you so quiet?

609
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,790
Well…

610
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,211
To think that
we're actually reincarnating feels a bit…

611
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,176
How do you feel?

612
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,470
About reincarnating.

613
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,139
Are you happy about it?

614
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,515
Of course.

615
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,186
I'm going with you,
so I'm not even scared. I'm excited.

616
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,021
Right?

617
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,985
Fine. As for the shoot…

618
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,195
We can just wing it.

619
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,739
Why bother preparing?
Let's just be natural, okay?

620
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:32,656
-Okay.
-Okay.

621
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,413
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee,
but could you look this way?

622
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:44,376
I realized last time she was on TV

623
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,670
that her left side looks much better.

624
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,672
Honey, turn 15° to your right.

625
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,218
-Okay then. We'll begin the interview.
-Okay.

626
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,804
From the moment
you first arrived until now,

627
00:41:55,888 --> 00:42:00,476
we heard you two had
quite an eventful time.

628
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,770
That's a bit of an exaggeration.

629
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:07,816
Let's just say every day felt new.

630
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,527
It's nothing to brag about,

631
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,571
but I even went to Hell
due to an unpleasant matter.

632
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,698
Don't forget to mention
the 18,000°C story.

633
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,493
My husband went all the way
to that terrifying place

634
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,994
to save me.

635
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:23,249
I dove right into the 18,000°C fire
without any hesitation.

636
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,792
Yes, I did that.

637
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:30,130
A love that even Hell couldn't tear apart.
That's great.

638
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:31,966
How did you feel

639
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:37,137
when you saw your wife, still at 80?

640
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,182
Well…

641
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:45,062
Just thinking about it now
makes me emotional.

642
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:50,401
The day I saw her aged appearance
for the first time,

643
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,320
my heart broke in two.

644
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:58,867
If it was possible,
I would've aged in her place--

645
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,286
You cried.

646
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,582
Did I?

647
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,499
Yes.

648
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,543
Don't you remember?

649
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,087
I…

650
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,965
They said they couldn't make me younger
at the Support Center.

651
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,717
So you asked them to make you older,

652
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,927
but you were crying
because you didn't mean it.

653
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,263
Did I really do that?

654
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,598
One second.

655
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,562
You can start walking from there.

656
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,397
Look happy, and cue!

657
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:35,881
Table.

658
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,591
Hold on.

659
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,885
Why are you cleaning
every nook and cranny?

660
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,553
We're leaving tomorrow anyway.

661
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,807
They say you should always
leave a place clean.

662
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,975
Besides, this house has been
so good to us.

663
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,728
It gave us a place to sleep
and food to eat.

664
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,230
-You can put it down now.
-Okay.

665
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,151
Don't you agree?

666
00:44:56,235 --> 00:45:00,030
It feels like the day
before moving to a new neighborhood.

667
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,284
I feel excited and anxious.

668
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,955
But I have you, so…

669
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,915
-Flower pot.
-Okay.

670
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:12,960
This one too.

671
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,394
I'm falling for you all over again.

672
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,521
There you go again,
saying things you don't mean.

673
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,691
Is it okay? How do I look?

674
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,570
Beautiful.

675
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,031
You're the most beautiful right now,
my dear wife.

676
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:47,202
That's how you tricked me
into looking like this.

677
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,079
Let's go.

678
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,140
I've been such a nuisance to you,
haven't I?

679
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,809
This place used to be so quiet and dull.

680
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:14,188
But thanks to you,
it's been lively and fun.

681
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,482
You're good at backhanded compliments.

682
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,358
I learned it from my friend.

683
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:24,072
You also went through a lot
while you were here.

684
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,450
All I did was cause trouble.

685
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,494
I'm sorry, sir.

686
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,707
Seeing you two leave together
puts my mind at ease.

687
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,753
I know he'll take good care of you,
so I won't see you off too far.

688
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,546
Goodbye then.

689
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,377
What's this?

690
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,130
I thought we were going straight to Earth
after going through the door.

691
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,512
I'm so glad I came here with you.

692
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,683
I couldn't have managed this alone.

693
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:38,313
Apparently, they made the path
this long on purpose.

694
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,315
So that you can turn back

695
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,235
if you have second thoughts.

696
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,404
Are we allowed to do that?

697
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:46,989
Of course.

698
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,243
No one can force you to reincarnate.

699
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,953
It's entirely your own choice.

700
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,249
Do you think

701
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,585
Eun-ho made it through okay?

702
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,379
This is a long journey.

703
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,382
He's young.

704
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,676
He probably sprinted the whole way.

705
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,472
I can only imagine
how hard it was for you.

706
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,559
You lost your son

707
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:19,062
but couldn't even grieve properly
because I wasn't in my right mind.

708
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,066
Didn't you resent me?

709
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,490
I was just grateful
that you were still by my side.

710
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,369
After Eun-ho disappeared…

711
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,541
I was terrified
of what might happen to you.

712
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,503
You're the reason I held on.

713
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:48,925
You're so kind.

714
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,928
I'm not just saying that
because you're my husband.

715
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,931
You're truly gentle.

716
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,526
-Should we rest here for a bit?
-Okay.

717
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,111
Okay. Let's go down there.

718
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:15,952
Let's sit for a while.

719
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:16,870
Okay.

720
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:36,807
So the place I was staying in
wasn't actually Heaven?

721
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,393
No, it was.

722
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,270
It is Heaven.

723
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,565
But it's not the final destination.

724
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,362
Simply put,

725
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,447
think of it as a layover

726
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,200
before moving on to the next stage.

727
00:49:56,702 --> 00:50:00,622
I knew I couldn't possibly
belong in Heaven.

728
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,711
They say Heaven isn't a reward.

729
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:11,550
Letting go of your past life
and becoming free

730
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,052
is the real reward.

731
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:19,474
Does that mean
you came back here because of me?

732
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,226
Of course.

733
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,856
For you, I'd come back every time.

734
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:33,363
I'm so glad you were my husband.

735
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,300
Now we just need to cross this bridge.

736
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,802
It looks terrifying just looking at it.

737
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,599
What good is having a younger husband
if you don't use him? Right?

738
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,559
Hop on.

739
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,362
I guess I came here
to get my wish granted.

740
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,866
You carried me on your back so many times.

741
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:24,122
When was the last time
I carried you on my back?

742
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:29,002
It was before you became bedridden.

743
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:29,920
Right.

744
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,839
It was the day we found out
I was pregnant with Eun-ho.

745
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:36,885
I guess you're right.

746
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,221
Goodness.

747
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:43,058
Back then,
your morning sickness was so bad.

748
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,061
You have a gray hair here too.

749
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,687
Stop pulling them out.

750
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,607
What if I go bald just in the back?

751
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,692
But I can see it.

752
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:54,820
There.

753
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,406
Even the back of your head is handsome.

754
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,078
Honey.

755
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,040
Do you remember what I told you
a long time ago?

756
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:08,875
What?

757
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,711
About how married couples
were connected from past lives.

758
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,879
Married couples?

759
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:17,467
They say married couples
were sometimes enemies in a past life.

760
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,014
Enemies from a past life
meet again as a married couple.

761
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,432
That makes sense.

762
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,812
That's why couples fight so much
but still stay together.

763
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:34,526
We definitely weren't enemies
since we don't fight.

764
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,570
I'm pretty sure

765
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,739
that I must've been
your father in the past.

766
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,118
I must have loved you

767
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,537
so much.

768
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,874
The apple of my eye.

769
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,918
My daughter, Hae-sook.

770
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,838
Sure. It's not like we remember
our past lives anyway.

771
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,090
Believe whatever makes you happy.

772
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:59,217
If not,

773
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:03,930
how could I receive
such devoted care from you?

774
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:04,848
Don't you agree?

775
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,600
Just say, "Thank you."

776
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,727
Why bring past lives into this?

777
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,942
Were we married in our past life too?

778
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,528
Is that what the president said?

779
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:21,823
Yes.

780
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,995
Including this life,

781
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,581
we've met as a married couple 23 times.

782
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,293
We've met that many times?

783
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,005
Yes.

784
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,966
Then, in our next life,

785
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,345
will I become your daughter or something?

786
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,770
We should stop now.

787
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:53,813
Why?

788
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:44,781
You see…

789
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,999
I've held onto you for too long.

790
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,215
It seems I only made you suffer
in every single life,

791
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:04,134
and I felt bad about it.

792
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:09,305
So I told myself
I'd meet you again in our next life

793
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,599
and treat you better.

794
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,310
And then the next life…

795
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,479
And then the next…

796
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:18,898
That's what I did.

797
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,112
I'm sorry.

798
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,368
I think I kept searching for you

799
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,746
because of that regret.

800
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,174
And that was why it was always

801
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,176
so hard for us.

802
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,179
Actually, I made things hard for you.

803
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,641
So…

804
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,769
this time around…

805
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,231
I want you to have

806
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,818
a completely different life.

807
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:08,740
Without me.

808
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,077
Honey.

809
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,670
You can go on your own now, right?

810
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:51,866
Does this mean

811
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,536
I won't be able to…

812
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,997
meet you anymore?

813
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,752
That's how it should be.

814
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:10,009
Well, I suppose we've met enough times.

815
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,056
We sure have met each other a lot, right?

816
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:16,641
You're right.

817
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:20,520
How tiresome.

818
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:23,857
Gosh.

819
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,109
I should try meeting someone else now.

820
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,154
That's exactly how I feel.

821
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,993
But really…

822
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,954
Will I not get to see you again?

823
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,583
You just said it was tiresome.

824
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,293
I didn't say it wasn't.

825
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,839
I was just wondering
if we'd tiresomely meet again.

826
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,175
I was just checking.

827
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,763
Honey. You really went through a lot.

828
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,267
You suffered so much because of me.

829
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,396
I know I pushed you to say that,

830
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,608
but I don't mind.

831
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,277
You really suffered so much.

832
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,321
And I'm sorry.

833
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,783
Do you think I'll take you back
just because you said that?

834
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,078
Thank you.

835
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,751
I was truly happy…

836
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,255
that it was you.

837
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:49,317
I truly liked being with you

838
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,279
even though I complained
about being sick of you.

839
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,883
We'll keep this confidential.

840
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:42,388
Would you want to be Mr. Ko's wife again
once you reincarnate?

841
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,515
I think

842
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,893
I probably would.

843
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:48,728
Why?

844
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,147
You could meet someone else.

845
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,607
I suppose so.

846
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:58,738
It's just that I can't think
of anyone else but my husband.

847
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,284
He must treat you really well.

848
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,619
He must really dote on you.

849
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:08,206
It's not because
he doted on me or anything.

850
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:11,209
Even though he spent
more than half his life

851
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,129
lying in bed,

852
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,131
he was the only one for me.

853
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,594
He'd be alone in his room all day.

854
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,804
Then, when I came in,

855
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:26,057
he'd smile at me.

856
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,602
His smile was so radiant.

857
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:35,024
Even as his hair turned gray
and his age spots appeared,

858
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:38,277
he'd look so handsome and sleek

859
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,489
once I just combed his hair.

860
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,075
It's true.

861
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,160
It really is.

862
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,245
Okay.

863
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:48,621
In that case,

864
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,290
how do you think Mr. Ko will answer?

865
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:56,254
I think he'd feel the same way.

866
01:01:57,755 --> 01:02:00,550
I was sure of it even when I was dying.

867
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,011
I believed he'd come for me

868
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:08,266
when I drew my last breath.

869
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,936
So I wasn't too scared.

870
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:16,232
But instead, the Grim Reaper came,
just like in dramas.

871
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,294
Hae-sook. Are you doing well?

872
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:23,841
Heaven without you means nothing to me.

873
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,220
Now I finally understand.

874
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:31,849
All those years we spent together
weren't painful.

875
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,267
They were pure bliss.

876
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,562
KO NAK-JOON
LEE HAE-SOOK

877
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,524
If I could go back,

878
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,026
I'd go in a heartbeat.

879
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:47,365
Into the life with you
that's more beautiful than Heaven.

880
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,003
So…

881
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,715
how did I do?

882
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,518
Better than I expected.

883
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,437
You did a great job.

884
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,107
Even in this life.

885
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,531
But still…

886
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,909
I don't think I can do it…

887
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:41,914
without you.

888
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:57,054
Same here.

889
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:08,149
If you wonder where God is,

890
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,318
just take a look around you.

891
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,697
The one who lets us live and die…

892
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:20,327
The one who brings the crashing waves
of life's joys and sorrows…

893
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:10,252
They might be someone we've already met
or someone we'll meet someday.

894
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,546
You just never know.

895
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:20,513
HEAVENLY EVER AFTER

896
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:36,922
If you reincarnate and start a new life,

897
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,382
what would you like to try?

898
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,259
When I reincarnate?

899
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:41,635
Well…

900
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:44,847
This might sound silly, but…

901
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,432
an actress.

902
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:49,226
I'd want to be an actress.

903
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:54,106
Actors live a different life
in every role.

904
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:57,860
It's like being born again each time.

905
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:02,031
I want to become one
to try different roles.

906
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:06,368
I'd like to try playing
a smart, beautiful young woman.

907
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:10,456
And I think a modest country woman
could be fun too.

908
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:15,753
Wouldn't it be interesting
if a young actress played an old grandma?

909
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:19,673
Oh! I do love dramas,
but I really like films, too.

910
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:24,511
In movies, I could be someone sly.

911
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,847
How would you feel
if you won an award for your acting?

912
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,141
That'd be amazing.

913
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,686
I'd be so honored.

914
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:37,691
If I'm going to win something,
it'd be incredible to hear my name called

915
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:40,361
at a big international film festival.

916
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:41,862
I'd love that.

917
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:46,242
What kind of actress
would you want to be remembered as?

918
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:50,663
Hearing that question makes me feel like
I actually am an actress.

919
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:53,165
I am so nervous.

920
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,501
What kind of actress?

921
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:58,879
There's no one kind of actress.

922
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,800
If people could just remember me and say,

923
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:08,013
"She was an actress full of warmth,"

924
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:11,267
that would be more than enough.

925
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:21,193
