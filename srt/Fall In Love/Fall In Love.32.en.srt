00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:42,126
Supervisor Xu, since you don't consider this to be something a noble should do,

16
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:44,613
you don't have to attend this interrogation.

17
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:48,206
Executive Director Fay and I can go in together.

18
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:51,671
Officer Zuo, you don't trust me?

19
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:54,720
This isn't something you should do.

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,896
Executive Director, please.

21
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:59,262
- Hello, Sir.
- Yes, yes.

22
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:08,955
Brother Zuo, sit down.

23
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:12,541
Executive Director Fay.

24
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:18,660
Executive Director Fay.

25
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,963
Commander Tan, we've brought back Miss Mu already.

26
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,320
The evidence is solid. Is there anything else you want to say?

27
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:29,622
Where is Supervisor Xu?

28
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:33,336
Supervisor Xu is not feeling well, so I asked him to go back and rest.

29
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:41,120
But I just saw him when you got out of the car,

30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,010
and there was nothing wrong with him.

31
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,573
Commander Tan, you were really waiting for us to come back.

32
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:51,136
Why? You're feeling guilty?

33
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:53,071
Guilty?

34
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:57,230
Anyway, I'm innocent. You didn't find the arms and ammunition.

35
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,499
So, you'll have to let me go.

36
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:01,260
We didn't find the arms and ammunition?

37
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,140
If we didn't, why would we bring Miss Mu back?

38
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,509
Miss Mu told us everything in detail.

39
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:13,875
Commander Tan, your only way out is to tell the truth.

40
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:31,500
<i>No wonder something felt wrong.</i>

41
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,128
<i>That woman wasn't Wanqing.</i>

42
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,384
Brother Zuo, what truth do you want me to tell you?

43
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,708
I know nothing about any arms or ammunition.

44
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:45,928
I was clearly framed. What do you want me to say?

45
00:03:45,928 --> 00:03:49,659
Would you be satisfied if I just framed myself?

46
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:53,190
Then, why were you nervous?

47
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,896
How could I not be nervous?

48
00:03:54,896 --> 00:03:58,709
As you all know, Mu Wanqing and I had a falling-out not too long ago.

49
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,637
Who knows if she'll shift the blame onto me?

50
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:05,380
If she says anything to you, don't believe it.

51
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,456
She can't wait to see me fall.

52
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,403
You're afraid of that?

53
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:11,115
I won't blame you if you laugh at me.

54
00:04:11,115 --> 00:04:12,800
If you had to deal with such an unreasonable woman,

55
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,900
you'd be afraid too.

56
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,080
Now, I'm rather curious. What exactly did she say?

57
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:28,339
About that...

58
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,780
we can't tell you.

59
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,445
How about this?

60
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:34,580
You ask Mu Wanqing to come here,

61
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,700
and I'll confront her face-to-face. Okay?

62
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,480
You're still doubting me? Right?

63
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,300
Fine, you can call her over right now.

64
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,400
I'll prove everything one by one. Okay?

65
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,245
Commander Tan, we didn't find any arms and ammunition at the pier.

66
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:13,030
As for Miss Mu's testimony, it's only a reference.

67
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,120
We won't believe it.

68
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,215
How about I submit the closing report to Beijing first thing tomorrow morning.

69
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:19,760
We'll wait for Governor Pei's approval.

70
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,390
And then, you'll be cleared of suspicion.

71
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:32,228
Fine, Brother Zuo, I'll believe in you.

72
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:33,319
But there is one thing.

73
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,940
If that Mu Wanqing dares to accuse me again,

74
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,280
lock her up for a few more days.

75
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:42,446
Wait, no. Just keep her locked up so she won't try to harm me.

76
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:46,389
What is she?

77
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:55,942
Officer Zuo, you should now be able to rest assured.

78
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:57,889
I... I told you.

79
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:00,110
Those who are clear, are clear.

80
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,084
There's no harm in being cautious though.

81
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,978
Gentlemen, how did it go?

82
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:08,920
Did you reach a conclusion?

83
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,890
Once Commander Tan heard Miss Mu testified against him,

84
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,440
he became anxious right away.

85
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,320
He even asked us to lock up Miss Mu for a few days

86
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,485
in order to protect himself.

87
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:21,426
We always say a woman's heart is like a needle at bottom of the ocean.
<i>(T/N: Hard to find; to understand)</i>

88
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:26,236
I never thought that when a man is cruel, it's no less impressive.

89

<i>[Yamato Trading Corporation]</i>

90
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,925

91
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,081
Get in!

92
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:59,920
<i>What's going on?</i>

93
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,480
Hurry up!

94
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,578
Adjutant Xu,

95
00:07:26,936 --> 00:07:30,636
I've made an inquiry. Officer Zuo submitted his closing report this morning.

96
00:07:30,636 --> 00:07:32,430
He concluded that Tan Xuanlin isn't guilty.

97
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,210
They're waiting for approval from Beijing to release him.

98
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,396
How about Junichi Yamashita?

99
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:40,010
I heard that they searched Mr. Yamashita's place last night.

100
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,400
Many Japanese people were arrested too.

101
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,100
Even Secretary Hasegawa was taken away.

102
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:48,803
This Junichi Yamashita,

103
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:51,397
his plan was a pain in his own foot.

104
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:55,026
Such solid evidence, but Tan totally got away with it.

105
00:07:55,026 --> 00:07:57,198
We nearly made it.

106
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,056
We still have a chance

107
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:03,765
before the approval from Beijing arrives.

108
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:22,950
The investigation team found the arms and ammunition already.

109
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,409
Tan Xuanlin will be convicted very soon.

110
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:30,105
Even if you continue keeping your mouth shut, it will be futile.

111
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:38,838
Since he's getting convicted either way,

112
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:41,418
then is what I say still important?

113
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:46,802
I'm afraid it's you whose efforts are going to be futile.

114
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:55,547
Looks like you won't give up until you see your coffin.

115
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,424
Xu Bojun must really be at an impasse,

116
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:06,014
sending you pieces of trash here.

117
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:10,616
You can't even handle a woman like me, and you want to go after my young uncle?

118
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,490
Since it's all...

119
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,550
a stupid daydream.

120
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:25,306
I know Miss Gu has a strong body.

121
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,156
She's not afraid of getting beat up.

122
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:34,711
So, let's...

123
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:37,011
try something more exciting.

124
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:55,570
Rickshaw!

125
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,360
Go to the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.

126
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:22,583
Stop! Stop.

127
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,920
This isn't the direction to the Chamber of Commerce.

128
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,707
Mr. Yamashita?

129
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,300
Mu Wanqing set us up.

130
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,200
All my men were arrested.

131
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,400
I need your cooperation

132
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,500
to make Mu Wanqing pay the price.

133
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:57,099
Let go of me! Let me go!

134
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:59,213
Let go of me! What are you going to do?

135
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:02,676
Xu Yuan, what are you up to this time?

136
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,996
Don't be scared.

137
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:07,604
The first morphine injection is always like this.

138
00:11:07,604 --> 00:11:10,013
It'll be fine once you get used to it.

139
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:11,430
Oh right.

140
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,822
After the injection, you'll feel like you're floating in Heaven.

141
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,445
- Let's go.
- Morphine?

142
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,677
You! You!

143
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:24,937
Yes. It's a bit more addictive compared to opium.

144
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:26,436
But you can relax.

145
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:31,020
The dose I'll give you today is a little bit lower

146
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,999
compared to a lethal dose.

147
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:35,380
Don't you dare!

148
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,376
- Hold her.
- Stay away!

149
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,280
You bastard!

150
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,020
How could you do such a thing

151
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,222
to a cornered beast, you bastard!

152
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,200
You'd better start worrying about yourself.

153
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,781
The investigation team will be here soon.

154
00:12:00,781 --> 00:12:05,620
As long as you say you saw Tan Xuanlin collude with the Revolutionary Army,

155
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,473
I'll give you the cure right away.

156
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:10,973
You! In your dreams!

157
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,782
Still playing tough?

158
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:15,363
Half an hour from now,

159
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:19,309
I'll let you feel something worse than death.

160
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,848
Eldest Miss.

161
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:35,219
Good news!

162
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:38,216
Mr. Xu just called. He said that the approval from Beijing has arrived.

163

Commander Tan is fine!

164
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:44,614
Have they arrested those Japanese men?

165
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:48,016
Last night, Officer Zuo's men took out that Japanese stronghold.

166
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:49,370
They arrested many people

167
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,705
including Junichi Yamashita's Secretary, Hasegawa.

168
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:54,245
Unfortunately, they didn't catch Junichi Yamashita.

169
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:55,786
He probably ran away.

170
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:59,131
Junichi Yamashita escaped. How about Mu Wanting?

171
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:00,976
I've asked the Chamber of Commerce to keep an eye on the situation.

172
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:04,274

179
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,964
Anyway, I wasn't helping you.

180

181
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:38,733

182

183
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,892

185
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:47,730
and needs to be questioned.

186
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,821
Officer Zuo has already rushed over.

187
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:51,446
Commander Tan, please stay here for now.

188
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,050
A new witness?

189
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,228
- Who?
- It's Miss Gu Yueshuang.

190

193

Yes, I remember. I saw her enter the Zhabei Hotel.

325
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:26,722
<i>He says he doesn't know him.</i>

326
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,997
<i>Are you lying to me?</i>

327
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:49,642
I found Sergey and the former associates of the Foreign Gun Brigade.

328
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:53,698
They told me they once encountered a gang of Japanese bandits

329
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:56,086
who used explosive bullets in Jiangpu.

330
00:26:56,086 --> 00:26:58,327
And their leader

331
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:03,006
was a Japanese veteran who fought against Sergey on the battlefield.

332
00:27:03,006 --> 00:27:07,913
That veteran was you, Junichi Yamashita.

333
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,258
I never thought that you were acting all along.

334
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:19,149
That's right. I decided to follow along until the moment was right.

335
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:23,411
I intended to keep you alive for a few more days.

336
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:25,120
But you came to me yourself.

337
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,522
Old scores or new, let's settle them all today.

338
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,573
Now that you know all about it,

339
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:35,299
I want to see what you've got

340
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:37,451
to take my life.

341
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,520
You better not use your gun.

342
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:48,880
If you use a gun, none of us can live.

343
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,125
I don't need a gun to kill you.

344
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,641
Mu Wanting!

345
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:15,352
Wanting, give me that.

346
00:30:15,352 --> 00:30:17,585
Don't you know that the Japanese guy is using you?

347
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:21,011
He wants to throw fire into the pipes and ignite all the gas lamps in Shanghai.

348
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:22,894
Of course I know.

349
00:30:22,894 --> 00:30:25,980
I know that if that happens, the Mu family will be finished.

350
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,373
You and Tan Xuanlin will be doomed as well.

351
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:30,080
Are you still that self-centered?

352
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,940
Are you going to bury the entire city of Shanghai because of your personal grudges?

353
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,805
Personal grudges?

354
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:40,396
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have lost everything.

355
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:42,985
If it weren't for you, my mother wouldn't have died.

356
00:30:42,985 --> 00:30:46,979
Just for these personal grudges, I'll let Shanghai be buried! Is that a problem?

357
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,320
- You're insane. Come with me!
- I won't!

358
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,321
Come with me!

359
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,181
Don't move!

360
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,300
- Go!
- Let go!

361
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,736
- Don't move!
- Let go of me!

362
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:30,840
- Let me go! Let go of me!
- Wanting!

363
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,080
- I won't go with you!
- Let's go!

364
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,291
I want you to know what it's like to lose everything.

365
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:36,981
Let go of me!

366
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:39,302
Open the pipe!

367
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,127
Wanqing, let's go! Come on!

368
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,440
Let me down!

369
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,580
Let me down!

370
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:47,950
Let go of me! Didn't you want to abandon me?

371
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,480
Don't come near me!

372
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:53,360
Don't come near me!

373
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,221
I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

374
00:32:58,088 --> 00:32:59,749
I'm sorry.

375
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:14,590
Don't keep me in the dark again.

376
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,700
Never leave me alone anymore.

377
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,460
Okay.

378
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,221
I'm sorry.

379
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,300
<i>This silver pendant, although it isn't worth much,</i>

380
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,100
<i>but it is the most precious thing I have.</i>

381
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,300
<i>My most precious things are both here.</i>

382
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,500
<i>I will definitely be back soon.</i>

383
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,800
<i>Don't remove it.</i>

384
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,000
<i>Keep it for the rest of your life.</i>

385
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,700
<i>All right?</i>

386
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,600
This silver pendant…

387
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,600
I won't remove it.

388
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,900
Let it stay with you forever, all right?

389
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,700
<i>I…</i>

390
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,100
<i>I... I promise you.</i>

391
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,000
- Hurry.
- Here.

392
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,600
- Come on.
- Let's go.

393
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,000
Go!

394
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,200
Shuang'er is dead.

395
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,700
Xu Bojun did it.

396
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,800
It was all my fault.

397
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,800
It was all my fault that I didn't take care of her well.

398
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,020
Did you know?

399
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,800
When I was on my way here,

400
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,700
I was so scared.

401
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,500
I had never been this scared my entire life.

402
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,670
I was afraid...

403
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,800
I was afraid that if I was late for one second...

404
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,700
what if you too...

405
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,900
We had foreseen everything already.

406
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,800
We just never predicted that Xu Bojun would go after Miss Gu.

407
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,800
I thought I hid it well.

408
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
How did you see through it?

409
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,500
Actually, when I came home and saw the photo that day,

410
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,100
I already knew you were lying to me.

411
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,300
<i>The Foreign Gun Brigade?</i>

412
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,600
<i>Were they involved in a crossfire in Jiangpu?</i>

413
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,800
<i>Yes.</i>

414
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,000
<i>They encountered a gang of bandits,</i>

415
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,400
<i>but it was more to scare them off.</i>

416
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,900
<i>Bandits?</i>

417
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,200
<i>They didn't encounter soldiers?</i>

418
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,400
<i>The Foreign Gun Brigade was Master's escort.</i>

419
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,100
<i>Why would they shoot soldiers?</i>

420
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,200
I'm sorry.

421
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,600
Earlier,

422
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,000
I said those awful words.

423
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,300
I know you kept it from me because you were worried.

424
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,800
But I'm really glad that it was a lie.

425
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,300
I lied to you.

426
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,300
How did you switch the goods?

427
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,040
After you saw the photo at my house that day,

428
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,300
you suddenly left without saying goodbye.

429
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,100
I assumed Mu Wanting tampered with the photo album.

430
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,300
So recently, I had been keeping an eye on her.

431
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,900
I found out...

432
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,600
that she had contacted Hasegawa, Yamashita's Secretary.

433
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,700
<i>[Yamato Trading Corporation]</i>

434
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,900
So I thought they would be going after me soon.

435
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,800
Just as expected,

436
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,200
they moved shipments of Western medicine into the warehouse.

437
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,300
I was afraid that they were going after you.

438
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,000
But I didn't know what was going on over on your side.

439
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,500
It was only until Mr. Liao called me,

440
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,000
when I found out that things had reached a critical point.

441
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,900
I figured out a way to get rid of Yamashita's spies,

442
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,500
by going to the dock in disguise.

443
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,700
When I got to the dock,

444
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,600
I happened to see the arms and ammunition arrive at the pier.

445
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
<i>Hold it steady.</i>

446
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,500
To stall for time,

447
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,400
I switched the numbers of Warehouses Six and Nine.

448
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,400
But I was still worried when the steward came to open the door with the key,

449
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,800
the lie would be exposed.

450
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,800
But we were lucky.

451
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,400
One of the stewards happened to be drunk,

452
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,000
so I made a call and sent the other steward away.

453
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,200
I switched the positions of keys six and nine.

454
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,000
<i>Sir, there is a package for you at the door.</i>

455
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,600
<i>What?</i>

456
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,500
When I just finished switching the keys, Officer Zuo's men were there.

457
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,800
The drunk steward took them to Warehouse Nine.

458
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,800
<i>Open the door to Warehouse Six.</i>

459
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,600
Just like that,

460
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,000
when you were inspecting Warehouse Nine,

461
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,100
I moved the arms and ammunition from Warehouse Six.

462
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,600
Then I returned the key.

463
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,500
And I wrote down the name Junichi Yamashita

464
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,900
and registered the Japanese Chamber of Commerce on the shipping form.

465
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,000
<i>Please fill out the form.</i>

466
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,500
<i>[Yamato Trading Corporation]</i>

467
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,400
<i>[Shanghai Bund Pier]</i>

468
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,000
At last,

469
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,200
I asked Steward Mu to put the form with the shipment of Western medicine

470
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,300
and let their plan backfire.

471
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,000
Wanqing, did you know,

472
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,200
that was very dangerous for you to do?

473
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,800
What if the steward hadn't been drunk?

474
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,000
What would you have done then?

475
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,200
But collaboration is a capital offense.

476
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,700
I had to take the gamble no matter what.

477
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,100
I couldn't just stand by and watch you die.

478
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,200
Weren't you afraid?

479
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,600
For you, what am I afraid of?
