Governor Luo kidnapped our Young Master Yuanheng.

00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:33,230
I had to pretend the baby I was carrying was his,

34
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,520
and hoped that he would help me save Young Master Yuanheng for the sake of that.

167
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,310
Wasn't this part of your plan, Commander Tan?

168
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:57,179
Brother Guangyao, I really didn't mean for this to happen.

169
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:02,230
I can't think of a safer place in the whole hospital than your ward.

170
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,940
But to ensure your safety,

171
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,850
not only did I personally guard the place,

172
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,690
but the gate was also heavily guarded.

173
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,250
If it weren't for your heavy guards,

174
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,750
the assassins might not have come into the wrong room.

175
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:20,169
It's a good thing you're fine.

176
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:21,750
<i>Junior Marshal!</i>

177
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:24,169
Junior Marshal!

178
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,895
Junior Marshal, are you all right?

179
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:29,780
I'm fine.

180
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,232
Brother Guangyao,

181
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:32,699
since you have someone to take care of you,

182
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:34,509
I'll go and deal with the assassins first.

183
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:37,458
I'll see you. Let's go.

184
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:43,276
Junior Marshal, let's go back to Yue City to recuperate.

185
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:44,720
No matter how heavily guarded this place is,

186
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,940
it's no better than the governor's mansion.

187
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,100
<i>Wait. It's a trap!</i>

188
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,770
It's okay. They weren't here for me.

189
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,560
Don't worry.

190
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,280
<i>[First Ward]</i>

191
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,500
How's he doing?

192
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,282
You guessed right.

193
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:24,880
Someone did try to kill him.

194
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,160
It's a good thing he didn't get hurt.

195
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,290
Well, in your opinion, who's behind all this?

196
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,430
One of the assassins was killed and the other is wounded.

197
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,680
The wounded one has already confessed.

198
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,990
They said Cui Lianfeng was the one behind this.

199
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,070
So it was Cui Lianfeng.

200
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,160
He raped Cui Lianfeng back then,

201
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,050
causing Cui Lianfeng to have a miscarriage.

202
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,980
He thought the baby was his, but it wasn't.

203
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,820
Cui Lianfeng has hated him for a long time.

204
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,940
She's just using him.

205
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,150
That baby wasn't his?

206
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,970
The timing is suspicious.

207
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,110
That baby was my father's.

208
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,280
Now, I feel a little sorry for him.

209
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,040
<i>[First Ward]</i>

210
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,230
You heard what we said last night, didn't you?

211
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,056
I see that you've had a rough night.

212
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,960
Don't be so unhappy seeing me.

213
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,580
It was Cui Lianfeng who wanted to kill you.

214
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,402
I saved your life, too.

215
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,040
But I'm curious

216
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,050
as to why you worked for Cui Lianfeng,

217
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,980
you even risked your life to try to kill Mr. Mu's daughter.

218
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,350
Is it true that the baby Cui Lianfeng miscarried was Mu Zhiyuan's?

219
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,060
<i>[Cui Lianfeng had a miscarriage and the fetus was less than four months old]</i>

220
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,300
Take a look at this yourself.

221
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,020
The fetus was less than four months old.

222
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,550
According to the time, it was Mu Zhiyuan's baby.

223
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,860
<i>[Cui Lianfeng had a miscarriage and the fetus was less than four months old]</i>

224
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,480
Just for such a miscarried fetus,

225
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,020
you're so obedient to Cui Lianfeng

226
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,370
that you were willing to kill someone for her.

227
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,200
Min Dacheng, you're such an affectionate person.

228
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,410
Unless,

229
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,160
there's another secret between you and Cui Lianfeng.

230
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,956
Fine.

231
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,980
Let me show you something.

232
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,400
Tan Xuanlin, are you trying to trick me?

233
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,330
You're right.

234
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,470
I did trick you.

235
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,250
You tried to destroy this photo over and over again.

236
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,060
This child...

237
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,160
must be the real secret of you and Cui Lianfeng.

238
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,100
This is not the only photo I burned.

239
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,250
These are all photos of me and some relatives and friends.

240
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:56,870
I, Min Dacheng, always bear the consequences of my own actions.

241
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,630
I don't want to bring trouble to anyone.

242
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:04,380
So it's not unusual that I burned this so-called evidence.

243
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,740
As for this child,

244
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,300
she's just a child of a friend of mine.

245
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,030
A friend's child?

246
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,980
Min Dacheng, do you take me for a fool?

247
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,860
You're willing to risk your life for Cui Lianfeng's miscarried fetus.

248
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,390
So it's obvious that you just want to have a child of your own.

249
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,100
Then, why don't you go marry and have children?

250
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,830
A man like me,

251
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,530
who's facing death every day,

252
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,840
doesn't deserve a wife and children.

253
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,380
Without them, I can be truly safe.

254
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,003
Fine.

255
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,850
Then it goes back to the question I just asked.

256
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,210
Since you are a man who doesn't care about anything,

257
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,800
why are you willing to work for Cui Lianfeng?

258
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,960
If you don't tell me the truth,

259
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,720
I'll have to continue investigating this piece of evidence.

260
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,210
Cui Lianfeng has something of mine.

261
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,980
What is it?

262
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:31,680
More than ten years ago, the young master of the Mu family, Mu Yuanheng,

263
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,350
wasn't killed by Governor Luo.

264
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,600
Who did it then?

265
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,360
At that time, Cui Lianfeng lied about having my child.

266
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,810
She asked me to cooperate with her

267
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,530
in killing the young master of the Mu family

268
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,490
so that our child could replace Young Master Mu Yuanheng

269
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,050
and inherit the property of the Mu family.

270
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,210
I was out of my mind back then so I listened to her nonsense

271
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,820
and did such a vicious thing.

272
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,496
So...

273
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:08,000
Cui Lianfeng asked you to kill Mu Yuanheng?

274
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,620
Yes.

275
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,536
The hospital is such an easy place to kill someone.

276
00:20:28,536 --> 00:20:29,820
How did you fail?

277
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,880
You idiot!

278
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,460
Tan Xuanlin hid Min Dacheng in Junior Marshal's ward

279
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,630
and moved the Junior Marshal to a new one.

280
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,260
He heavily guarded around the new ward, deliberately confusing us.

281
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,010
Although we failed, we didn't blow our cover.

282
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,120
Is Min Dacheng awake?

283
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,477
Yes.

284
00:20:49,477 --> 00:20:50,990
Tan Xuanlin sent someone to say that

285
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,770
Min Dacheng still has an old case on him.

286
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,210
He wants you to hold a retrial.

287
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,570
An old case?

288
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,110
Did he say what the old case was about?

289
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,410
He said it's still related to the Mu family.

290
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:09,190
Min Dacheng wouldn't have told them all about what happened back then, would he?

291
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,000
Min Dacheng killed Cui Jie.

292
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,120
Mrs. Mu is now in a difficult situation and is unable to protect herself.

293
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,810
If he gave me up,

294
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,510
who would protect his child?

295
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:34,010
Go tell Tan Xuanlin that I agree to hold a retrial.

296
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,673
Yes.

297
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,160
<i>[Governor Xu agreed to hold a retrial of the Mu family's case.]</i>

298
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,000
<i>[Governor Mansion of Yue City]</i>

299
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,396
I understand. You may go.

300
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,060
I heard that Min Dacheng has confessed.

301
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,046
Yes. He has finally admitted that it was Cui Lianfeng who asked him to kill your brother.

302
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,870
Xu Bojun has agreed to hold a retrial.

303
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,900
I've always felt something was wrong.

304
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,830
How could he be so devoted to Cui Lianfeng for just a miscarried baby?

305
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,940
But who is the child in the photo?

306
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,050
What photo?

307
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,510
The night Min Dacheng was arrested, he had been trying to burn this photo.

308
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,760
Thanks to Tan Si's quick reflexes, he managed to save half of it.

309
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:49,660
<i>It's Commander Tan's name. Wanqing, you asked Commander Tan</i>

310
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,330
<i>to pay for you?</i>

311
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,766
What's wrong?

312
00:22:57,766 --> 00:23:00,350
I recognize this bracelet.

313
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,020
Cui Lianfeng has one exactly like this.

314
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:12,070
If the woman in this photo is Cui Lianfeng,

315
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,060
then this child...

316
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,860
This child is...

317
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,170
I remember now.

318
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,800
Not long after my grandfather died, my mother was in poor health.

319
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,500
Cui Lianfeng, as a servant girl, volunteered to help observe the mourning for my grandfather.

320
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,060
Not long after she left, it was Tomb-Sweeping Day.

321
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,580
My mother had a cold.

322
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,930
My father went alone to do the rituals and renovate the tombs.

323
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,090
It was during this time that they had an affair.

324
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,100
That was the year that Mu Wanting was born.

325
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,680
So...

326
00:23:49,243 --> 00:23:53,630
this is the real secret between the two of them.

327
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,660
We need to look into Mu Wanting's origins.

328
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,860
But after all this time, can we still find evidence?

329
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,603
Don't worry.

330
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,276
If it's really a lie,

331
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:10,230
then it's bound to be exposed.

332
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,020
<i>[Mu Mansion]</i>

333
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,700
My Lord said the Command Office has sent a notice saying that

334
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,720
there's a case concerning both a criminal surnamed Min and the Mu Family.

335
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,760
Mrs. Mu and Miss Wanting are now grounded and can't go out.

336
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,470
My Lord will take Miss Wanqing with him to attend the court trial.

337
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,440
If there are any results, he will inform you.

338
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,656
It won't happen.

339
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,850
- It's going to be okay.
- Mother.

340
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,843
It's going to be okay.

341
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,630
It's okay. It's okay.

342
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,870
Mother.

343
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,084
Mother, what's wrong with you?

344
00:24:54,084 --> 00:24:58,010
Don't worry. That Min Dacheng has been in the underworld for so many years.

345
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,800
He must have offended a lot of people.

346
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,960
Besides, our family business is so big.

347
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,600
Maybe he blackmailed us before.

348
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,590
Right. Black... Blackmail.

349
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,210
He blackmailed us.

350
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,916
Wanting.

351
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,950
Wanting.

352
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,060
Mother...

353
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,510
feels sorry for you.

354
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,280
Promise me one thing.

355
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,830
No matter what happens, you will live well for me.

356
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,450
Do you remember?

357
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,360
Your injury has almost healed.

358
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,760
But there are so many people who want to harm you.

359
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,150
It hadn't been long, yet another group of assassins came.

360
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,890
Now that the hospital is so heavily guarded, they search every person who's entering and leaving.

361
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,790
Yet, the assassins still managed to get in.

362
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,370
That's right. It's a good thing that they started the body search.

363
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:29,100
If the assassins really got in with a gun, then it would be another story.

364
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,890
That's so lucky of you. But who were the assassins this time?

365
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,850
Both assassins are dead.

366
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,230
As of now, we haven't been able to identify them yet.

367
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,470
I heard from Xu Cheng that

368
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:50,060
at that time, the assassin was pointing a needle at your neck.

369
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,090
If he had shaken his hand a little, it could have been pierced into your artery.

370
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:58,140
You're really lucky to be unharmed this time.

371
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,586
Old Su, point this pen at me.

372
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:21,680
What for? You don't want to recreate the scene, do you?

373
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,230
Hurry up.

374
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,330
What about me signing you my signature?

375
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,430
Cut it out. Just hurry and do it.

376
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,396
Are you okay?

377
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,560
<i>[The High Court of Shanghai]</i>

378
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:03,040
<i>[The Whole World as One Community]</i>

379
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,320
Bring the prisoner into court.

380
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,790
<i>[Chief Judge]</i>

381
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:27,490
Min Dacheng, I heard that you had some old cases to confess.

382
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,860
I remind you to tell the truth

383
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,510
and not to accuse the innocent, or you will be punished more severely.

384
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,540
I, Min Dacheng,

385
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,330
have been on the battlefield

386
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,500
and in the underworld throughout my life.

387
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,910
I have done numerous evil things, including killing people.

388
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,760
Today,

389
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,850
even if you shoot me in court,

390
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,580
there'd be nothing wrong with that.

391
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,350
I've killed a lot of people in the past.

392
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,900
But those people, they all deserved to die.

393
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,590
But there was a murder case ten years ago.

394
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,460
If I don't talk about it today,

395
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,010
I'm afraid I'll regret it on my way to hell.

396
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,850
I didn't expect a man like you

397
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,530
to have some conscience.

398
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,610
Ten years ago,

399
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,210
I killed a child.

400
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,970
The child's name

401
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,350
was Mu Yuanheng.

402
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,390
Father.

403
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,840
My Lord.

404
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,383
Father.

405
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:14,363
My Lord, you came?

406
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,720
Cui Lianfeng.

407
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,800
Give me back my son's life.

408
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:38,690
My Lord, you... How could he say that?

409
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,740
He's lying. Don't believe him, My Lord.

410
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,430
Min Dacheng made it very clear that

411
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,600
the baby you were pregnant with back then was his child!

412
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,190
You two murdered Yuanheng together.

413
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,060
You wanted to replace Yuanheng with your son

414
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,760
and make him the sole heir of our family.

415
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,036
My Lord. Don't listen to his nonsense, My Lord.

416
00:32:07,036 --> 00:32:09,330
He can talk nonsense. He blamed everything on me.

417
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,450
But I… I really didn't mean to harm Master Yuanheng. My Lord.

418
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:15,596
My Lord, I wanted to save Master Yuanheng. Do you remember?

419
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:18,690
- My Lord, what he said is not...
- Min Dacheng's statement is still at headquarters.

420
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,740
Do you want to see the case file?

421
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,910
No. He's just a random soldier. What he said is not true.

422
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,950
What he said is not the truth. What he said is not true.

423
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,480
It's not all true, My Lord.

424
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,512
Do you... Do you have proof?

425
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:44,490
Do you have any proof? Do you have any proof of that?

426
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,780
Did you let him frame me? Did you?

427
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,830
Cui Lianfeng!

428
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,590
I don't want to hear any more of your sophistry.

429
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,950
I'm telling you.

430
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,550
I was going to make you pay for Yuanheng's life.

431
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,900
But for the sake of your over ten years of service to the Mu family,

432
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,270
I'll spare your life.

433
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,360
But I will write a letter to announce our divorce.

434
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,680
From now on, you have nothing to do with the Mu family!

435
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,300
Father, please don't kick my mother out.

436
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,190
I'm begging you. All of this...

437
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,840
All this was all Mu Wanqing's doing.

438
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,656
Wanting!

439
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,810
If it weren't for your sake,

440
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,110
I would never go easy on her.

441
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,860
My Lord is right.

442
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,560
My Lord is already being merciful.

443
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,736
It is because I have been married to him for more than ten years,

444
00:33:51,736 --> 00:33:55,360
and I had given birth to his children

445
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,410
that My Lord goes easy on me.

446
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,020
It is true that you've given birth,

447
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,100
but it is not certain who you were giving birth for.

448
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,610
Mu Wanqing, don't confuse right from wrong!

449
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,930
The boy I was carrying was miscarried.

450
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,700
And it was My Lord's. The hospital has the document to prove that!

451
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,400
The baby who miscarried was indeed my father's.

452
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,900
But this daughter...

453
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,290
may not be his.

454
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,476
Mu Wanqing, don't you dare slander me here!

455
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:42,000
Don't talk nonsense!

456
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,896
Wanqing.

457
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,030
If you don't have any evidence, you can't say such a thing.

458
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,830
Mr. Mu,

459
00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:00,300
what Miss Wanqing said, has proof to back it up.

460
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,600
Commander Tan.

461
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,630
I'm sorry to come in uninvited.

462
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,720
It's just that I found something on the suspect Min Dacheng,

463
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,130
and I dare not hide it from you.

464
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,429
It's concerning you.

465
00:35:12,429 --> 00:35:15,786
Concerning... Concerning me?

466
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,060
Mr. Mu, do you still remember who this girl is?

467
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:32,050
The photo is of Wanting as a child.

468
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,316
Mrs. Mu, please take a look at it as well.

469
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,470
Why do you have my photo?

470
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,120
That night, Min Dacheng risked his life to return to the pawnshop

471
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,360
just to burn this photo.

472
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,780
He never got married and has no children.

473
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,010
That's why I've always wondered who the woman whose one hand

474
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,800
and child are in this photo.

475
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,355
This... isn't Wanting.

476
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,930
It's just someone who looks like her.

477
00:36:19,447 --> 00:36:21,479
Is that so?

478
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:26,320
Then, how come the bracelet is exactly the same as yours?

479
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,416
No.

480
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,342
Mr. Mu, take a look at her.

481
00:36:42,342 --> 00:36:44,690
This Dr. Liang... Do you remember her?

482
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,730
Eighteen years ago, it was her who delivered Mrs. Mu's baby.

483
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,683
Right. She is Dr. Liang who delivered Wanting.

484
00:36:53,683 --> 00:36:55,363
Dr. Liang.

485
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,350
Was Miss Wanting born full term?

486
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,100
Miss Wanting was born full term.

487
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,950
But why did you tell me she wasn't and asked me to take good care of her?

488
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,460
It was Mrs. Mu who paid me to say so.

489
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,680
Dr. Liang, then when did Mrs. Mu get pregnant?

490
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,120
In terms of time, it should have been

491
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,100
in February of that year.

492
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,850
That means when I went back to my hometown on Tomb-Sweeping Day,

493
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,410
you were already pregnant.

494
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,686
No. No. No.

495
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,560
Then let me tell you what really happened.

496
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,330
You had an affair with Min Dacheng and you got pregnant with his child.

497
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,420
That's why you went to observe the ritual on behalf of my mother.

498
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,100
Wanting is Min Dacheng's daughter.

499
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:05,550
Mother, what are they talking about?

500
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,470
Why can't I understand? Mother.

501
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,550
Mother, say something.

502
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,120
I've been fooled by you for so many years.

503
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,303
Mother! Say something!

504
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,896
Mother!

505
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,080
You have finally achieved your goal, haven't you?

506
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,540
You're finally satisfied, aren't you?

507
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,420
You've come back

508
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,710
just to set me up,

509
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,150
and to see me as I am today. Right?

510
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,520
I only believe that God observes what people do.

511
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,190
There's still justice in our family.

512
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,656
Good.

513
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,030
Commander Tan,

514
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:09,210
please don't tell anyone about what happened today.

515
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,950
Recently, there's been a lot going on in the Mu family.

516
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,020
We can't afford any more gossip.

517
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,300
Don't worry. This is your family business. I've overstepped boundaries.

518
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,350
It's just that the matter of bloodline is of great importance.

519
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,630
I don't want to hide it from you.

520
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,600
Commander Tan has found out the truth of the matter for me.

521
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,380
I am... very grateful.

522
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,736
Mr. Mu, don't mention it.

523
00:39:34,736 --> 00:39:38,360
I can't be the person in charge of Shanghai without your full support.

524
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,836
So everything I do will be in your best interest.

525
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,916
So for this matter, I don't know anything about it.

526
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,749
And I won't say a word about it.

527
00:39:46,722 --> 00:39:48,263
Thank you.

528
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:50,020
Well then, Mr. Mu, take good care of yourself.

529
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,700
I'll take my leave now.

530
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,530
My Lord.

531
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:14,480
For the sake of our more than ten years together as husband and wife,

532
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,910
I would like to talk to you alone.

533
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,396
Mother.

534
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,226
You bitch! I'm going to kill you!

535
00:40:50,226 --> 00:40:51,470
- Miss Wanting.
- Guards.

536
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,720
Let go of me! Let go of me!

537
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,600
I'm the first daughter of the Mu family!

538
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,130
My last name is Mu. I am the first daughter of the Mu family!

539
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,920
- Take her away.
- Take Miss Wanting away quickly!

540
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,440
- Let go of me!
- Take her away.

541
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,430
Mu Wanqing!

542
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:10,350
Actually, from the first day I accompanied Her Ladyship to this house as a servant girl,

543
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:14,520
and from the first moment I saw you,

544
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:21,200
I knew that Cui Lianfeng's life was over.

545
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,860
I was not content with just being a servant girl.

546
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:30,560
I was not content with just being a mistress.

547
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,770
I was not content with sharing your love

548
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,000
with another woman.

549
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,000
I just wanted to be

550
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,980
Mu Zhiyuan's only wife.

551
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:53,140
Now, it is...

552
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,490
all over.

553
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,230
I don't have to plot anything anymore.

554
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:03,540
And I don't have to lead a better-off life in fear.

555
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,680
But I only ask you for one thing.

556
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,610
For the sake of Wanting living with you and bringing much happiness to you these ten years,

557
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,700
can you be kind to her?

558
