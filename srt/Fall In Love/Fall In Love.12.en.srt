Uncle had to handle some things this morning

24

so he asked Wanqing to come to the ceremony alone.

The driver said they went that way.

At this time, who would do this to the Mu Family?

They did this to Uncle's car,

which means they wanted to catch Uncle.

29

More than half of the shops in the wharf belong to the Mu Family.

30

There are so many people around here. Why would they choose this place?

31
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,397

I should organize people to donate blood now.

166
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,370
- I'm type B. You can draw my blood.
- It… It may not be enough.

167
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,838
Stop talking nonsense. Hurry!

168
00:13:55,838 --> 00:13:57,471
Commander!

169
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,254
Don't move.

170
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,042
Doctor, how is Brother Guangyao?

171
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:40,166
Supervisor Xu has lost too much blood, and he is currently unconscious.

172
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,770
You can wait outside. We are about to operate on him.

173
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,322
Thank you.

174
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:10,054
Commander Tan, do you feel dizzy?

175
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:11,420
No, go ahead.

176
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,899
Okay.

177
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:23,655
Miss Wanqing, how are you feeling?

178
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,449
I'm fine.

179
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:04,620
Commander.

180
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,293
Commander, are you okay?

181
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:09,920
It's just a little blood. I'm fine.

182
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,320
How about I make something, some chicken soup for you?

183
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Do you think I'm in confinement?

184
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,052
How is Brother Guangyao?

185
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:24,205
Don't worry. The doctor said he's fine.

186
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,544
Commander, there are people waiting for you.

187
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:30,452
Okay. You guys wait here.

188
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:37,598
Commander, we have failed our duty.

189
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:40,292
Since the last celebration banquet, we've been following your orders

190
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,772
to secretly protect Miss Mu.

191
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:44,076
But we still let the gangsters succeed.

192
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:46,637
Please punish us.

193
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:49,753
This was unexpected. Don't blame yourself too much.

194
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:53,066
But from now on, you should increase the number of guards

195
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:54,960
and protect Miss Mu secretly.

196
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,660
If anything happens, you can act without my permission.

197
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

198
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,810
- Go.
- Last time, it was this one…

199
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,616
This patient.

200
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:14,207
What are you doing here?

201
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,574
To thank you for arranging people to protect me.

202
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:23,124
This is what I should do. You're my God of Wealth.

203
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:26,511
Anyway, thank you.

204
00:17:30,636 --> 00:17:32,766
Don't worry too much.

205
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:36,544
He'll be fine.

206
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,260
Maybe you can do it yourself. Wipe your face.

207
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,196
You don't want him to wake up and see you like this.

208
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,660
Brother Guangyao was shot to save me.

209
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,326
If Governor Xu blames someone, I'll bear the responsibility.

210
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,799
I don't want to implicate you.

211
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,565
Silly girl. You won't.

212
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:09,682
Stop staring at me like that. I'm always this handsome.

213
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:12,381
Wipe off your face. You look awful.

214
00:18:16,884 --> 00:18:18,734
What are you laughing at?

215
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:21,860
That sounds more like you.

216
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,738
<i>[Lofty Aspirations]</i>

217
00:18:31,738 --> 00:18:34,063
How's it going now? Did you find Wanqing?

218
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:37,903
Yes. Fortunately, Commander Tan and Mr. Xu arrived on time.

219
00:18:37,903 --> 00:18:41,527
Miss Wanqing is safe.

220
00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:48,116
But Mr. Xu was seriously injured while saving Miss Wanqing.

221
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:50,266
He's still in the emergency room.

222
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,626
Guangyao was injured? Is it serious?

223
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:54,341
It seems quite serious.

224
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,607
Commander Tan personally transfused blood for him.

225
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:58,977
The situation isn't very good.

226
00:19:01,404 --> 00:19:05,379
Madam, do you want to go to the hospital to visit him?

227
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:08,774
No.

228
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:15,392
I'm a little dizzy.

229
00:19:15,392 --> 00:19:17,453
I won't go.

230
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:20,166
I'm afraid of causing them trouble.

231
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,500
- You go first.
- Okay.

232
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,266
Director, his blood pressure is dropping.

233
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:38,899
Stethoscope.

234
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:46,427
There is a lot of blood accumulation in his body.

235
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:48,497
We should conduct a thoracotomy immediately to stop the bleeding.

236
00:19:48,497 --> 00:19:50,030
Thoracotomy?

237
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,525
Director, we've only observed one thoracotomy in the Union Hospital before.

238
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,347
We've never performed this operation.

239
00:19:55,347 --> 00:19:59,318
If something goes wrong, the patient will die on the operating table.

240
00:19:59,318 --> 00:20:02,050
But if we don't do the surgery, he'll die too.

241
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,780
He is the son of Governor Xu.

242
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,441
If we can't save him, we're all doomed.

243
00:20:13,354 --> 00:20:14,918
How's it going?

244
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:18,920
Supervisor Xu... He's not doing well.

245
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,200
What do you mean not well?

246
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,303
You just said we only need to give him a blood transfusion.

247
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:25,818
In fact, there's a lot of blood in his chest.

248
00:20:25,818 --> 00:20:28,280
If we don't operate in time to open the chest cavity

249
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,560
and find the bleeding point, I'm afraid...

250
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,781
he won't survive tonight.

251
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:35,053
Then what are you waiting for? Do the surgery now!

252
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:37,970
But we've never done such an operation before.

253
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,490
If something goes wrong, he may die on the operating table.

254
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,492
Will you do it or not?

255
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:47,222
Commander Tan, calm down.

256
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:50,810
Remember that Supervisor Xu is a noble.

257
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,685
We dare not make a hasty decision.

258
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:56,399
Besides, his family is not in Shanghai.

259
00:20:57,206 --> 00:21:01,520
How about you sign this operation consent form?

260
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,240
We can do this surgery.

261
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:12,280
Director, saving lives is your duty.

262
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,670
The decision should be up to you doctors.

263
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,220
Our commander doesn't know about medicine.

264
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,630
Why should he sign the consent form?

265
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,810
Officer, think about it.

266
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,470
Supervisor Xu is Governor Xu's only son.

267
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,660
We... We can't afford this responsibility.

268
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,240
You asked our commander to sign this.

269
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,114
If something happens to Supervisor Xu

270
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:36,680
and Governor Xu blames him, you'll avoid the responsibility. Right?

271
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,130
We really can't operate without an operation consent form.

272
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:45,512
I'll sign. I'm Xu Guangyao's fiancee.

273
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:48,687
It's not your decision. I should sign it.

274
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:50,703
Commander.

275
00:21:50,703 --> 00:21:54,480
If Commander Tan signs it, we'll conduct the operation.
<i>[Tan Xuanlin]</i>

276
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,400
- Arrange the operation immediately.
- Okay. Let's go.

277
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:09,320
- Doctor.
- Please wait here.

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,180
You two wait here. I'll go out for a while.

281
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,450
Commander, what are you going to do?

282
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,784
Xu Guangyao may die during the operation.

283
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:28,969
I'll call Xu Bojun now. They can meet each other for the last time.

284
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:30,421
Hold on.

285
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:33,070
I don't know what you were thinking when you signed the form.

286
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,374
You want to call Xu Bojun now?

287
00:22:34,374 --> 00:22:37,546
If something happens to him, we really don't know what will happen.

288
00:22:37,546 --> 00:22:41,138
Old Wu. At this time, if we only want to protect ourselves,

289
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:43,141
they can't see each other for the last time.

290
00:22:43,141 --> 00:22:45,033
That's immoral.

291
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,982
Deputy Commander Wu,

292
00:22:52,982 --> 00:22:54,700
instead of worrying about others,

293
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,980
you might as well bring Brother Guangyao's medical record.

294
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,375
Does he need the surgery? Is it necessary?

295
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,496
We can know from the medical record.

296
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:04,000
Okay, okay. I'll go now.

297
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:08,299
Tan Si, go to the Command center and bring some more soldiers here.

298
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:09,570
At the last banquet,

299
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,496
someone wanted to assassinate Guangyao and frame Commander Tan.

300
00:23:12,496 --> 00:23:14,313
I'm afraid they are going to come back.

301
00:23:14,313 --> 00:23:17,630
And I'll call my father to block the hospital. You are only responsible to protect the place.

302
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,153
Yes.

303
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:23,426

00:23:30,188 --> 00:23:32,588
What did Provincial Military Governor Xu say?

307
00:23:32,588 --> 00:23:36,372
He didn't say much. He just said he would come as soon as possible.

308
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:37,895
Why did you sign it?

309
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:40,354
If something happens to Brother Guangyao, what will you do?

310
00:23:40,354 --> 00:23:41,642
I also want to ask you.

311
00:23:41,642 --> 00:23:44,564
Why did you come out and say that you were his fiancée just now?

312
00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:47,140
If Xu Bojun knew that his son took the bullet for you,

313
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,460
can you still be his fiancée?

314
00:23:49,974 --> 00:23:52,970
- Are you a fool?
- You are the fool.

315

Brother Guangyao was shot because of me. I'll bear this responsibility.

I can't involve you.

I'm not.

319
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:11,759
You've offended him with the establishment of the militia.

320
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,550
What if he embarrasses you again for this?

321
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,845
I'm just a secretary.

322
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:18,945
He won't do anything bad to me even if he blames me.

Don't worry about Xu Bojun.

324
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:26,045
At this time, I can't let you take the responsibility alone.

325
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,514

She is afraid that the people who assassinated Supervisor Xu will do something again.

483

Then he captured the wharf again in the name of saving lives.

00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,000
Unless you can prove that

490
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,400
that these people are not your soldiers.

491
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,300
This requirement is too much.

492
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,400
Tan Si, shut up.

493
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,200
Governor,

494
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,900
today at the wharf,

495
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,500
I already knew that these people were pretending to be us.

496
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,300
I could have blocked the wharf and investigated it strictly.

497
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,700
I could have even arrested everyone.

498
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,000
But I missed the best opportunity to prove my innocence.

499
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,300
Just for Brother Guangyao's safety.

500
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,800
But, Provincial Military Governor,

501
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,600
I will never allow anyone with ulterior motives

502
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,200
to hold this charge on the army.

503
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,900
It's just your words.

504
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,300
Where is the evidence?

505
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,800
Commander Tan, you'd better show the evidence.

506
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,300
Otherwise, I really can't believe that

507
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,400
you can guarantee the safety of the concession.

508
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,600
Okay.

509
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,100
- Tan Si.
- Yes.

510
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,200
Bring all the people in my army here.

511
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
All of them.

512
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,600
Yes.

513
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
This is the British Concession.

514
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,100
Remember. I don't allow you to mess around.

515
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,800
What do you want to do?

516
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,600
Do you want to force me again?

517
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,300
Provincial Military Governor.

518
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,700
Executive Director.

519
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,500
I don't want to do anything.

520
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,100
I just want to prove the innocence of my brothers.

521
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,900
Boss, a letter from the governor.

522
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,700
<i>[Min Dacheng]</i>

523
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,100
Boss, what did the governor say?

524
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,400
Did he blame us?

525
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,300
<i>[Now spread the news that the Tan Army is lax and evil]</i>

526
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,800
Governor Xu said

527
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
that this is the end of the matter.

528
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,700
We can only make up for what we did.

529
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,100
Now the most important thing is to publish the news in the press.

530
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,900
We tell them that the Tan Army kidnapped Miss Mu.

531
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,000
Besides, we should find more people to

532
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,900
spread the news in the concession.

533
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,800
We need to tell them that the Tan Army

534
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,000
was a group of scattered soldiers,

535
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,200
before it was transformed into a militia group.

536
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
They do evil deeds everywhere.

537
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,900
It's better to cause panic among the people.

538
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,400
Understood.

539
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,700
<i>[Keep Quiet]</i>

540
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,800
Father.

541
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,300
I need to go to the police station.

542
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,600
Wanqing,

543
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,600
the situation between Xu Bojun and Tan Xuanlin,

544
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,800
we'd better not get involved in this.

545
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,200
I know who kidnapped me.

546
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
Okay, go.

547
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,700
She's leaving?

548
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,400
We'd better pay more attention to Guangyao.

549
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,800
But…

550
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,500
Commander, the first battalion has gathered.

551
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,400
The rest are already in line outside.

552
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,100
- Stand at ease!
- Stand at ease!

<i>[Do Your Duty]</i>

554
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,000
- Commander Tan.
<i>[Shanghai Public Concession General Police Station]</i>

555
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,900
What are you trying to do?

556
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,600
Governor Xu,

557
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,500
my army has fought in countless battles with me for ten years.

558
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,300
Everyone's hands, thumbs,

559
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,900
and forefingers have thick calluses.

560
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,100
Even including the cooks.

561
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,800
If you don't believe me, you can check them one by one.

562
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,000
Commander Tan,

563
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,200
is that the evidence you're giving me?

564
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,200
To show me how brave and skillful your army is?

565
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,300
Of course not.

566
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,900
You can see that these bodies

567
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,740
don't have calluses on their hands.

568
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,900
Commander Tan, are you sure that every soldier has calluses on their hands?

569
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,200
You can go check.

570
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,700
Show me your hands.

571
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,900
Show me your hands.

572
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,000
Come on.

573
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,300
Am I telling the truth?

574
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,900
But I only checked a dozen soldiers.

575
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,900
At present, it's not enough to prove anything.

576
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,500
Okay.

577
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,600
You can ask these policemen

578
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,300
to check them one by one.

579
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
I can cooperate with you no matter how long it takes.

580
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,600
But you must agree to our innocence after you finish.

581
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,200
Good idea. Come on.

582
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,100
Come here.

583
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,100
Come on.

584
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,800
- Commander Tan.
- Check them all.

585
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,500
I don't know how many people you have in your army.

586
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,400
How do I know if you received new recruits in Shanghai?

587
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,600
Even if you didn't, you can find bodyguards without anyone knowing.

588
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,900
It's not impossible.

589
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,700
Just relying on these calluses to get rid of suspicion?

590
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,400
Ridiculous!

591
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,500
Governor,

592
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,800
you made up your mind to frame me, didn't you?

593
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,500
If you want to prove your innocence,

594
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,400
you must show me the evidence.

595
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,800
It was easy to pick holes in other people's words.

596
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,200
Let me ask you.

597
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,700
How would you prove that these people are not lying?

598
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,600
It's you who messed up!

599
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,500
My son is still in the hospital!

600
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,800
You should be the one proving it!

601
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,700
Provincial Military Governor Xu.

602
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,000
I know who did this to Brother Guangyao.
