Be careful.

17
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:12,900
Wanqing, this is the turnover from the wharf these past few months.

18
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,200
Take a look at it.

19
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,046
You can leave it there.

20
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:20,591
Are you okay? You look pale.

21
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:22,280
I'm fine. Go ahead and finish your work.

22
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,350
Close the door, please.

23
00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:35,386
East wind.

24
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:36,910
The north, south, and west wind all have been discarded.

25
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,320
Yet Commander Tan still dares to discard the east wind?

26
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,803
You aren't afraid that one of us will win?

27
00:02:40,803 --> 00:02:44,736
The west, south, and north wind are divided amongst you three.

28
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:48,056
None of you can win. So what would I be afraid of? Red Dragon.

29
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:52,610
Commander Tan, your boldness stems from your skill.

30
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,719
Executive Director, your Chinese is getting more and more authentic!

31
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,446
Eight Dots.

32
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,232
Brother Guangyao, you've got a good hand.

33
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:03,617
You're trying to make all tiles in one suit, right?

34
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:07,317
Commander Tan, you've got a good hand as well.

35
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:11,353
You now have time to guess what other people's tiles are like.

36
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:14,042
With Mahjong, you just follow your instinct.

37
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:16,529
If you insist on making all tiles into one suit,

38
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,596
you might end up getting a smaller-than-expected return.

39
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,923
So you all plan to win big.

40
00:03:23,923 --> 00:03:25,650
White Dragon.

41
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:32,753
President, things are going pretty well.

42
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:36,515
The men sent by Military Governor Pei have sealed off the Command.

43
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:39,389
Good. As soon as the arms and ammunition arrive,

44
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,907
Tan Xuanlin's end will come.

45
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:43,339
What about Mu Wanqing?

46
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:46,940
I've asked Mu Wanting to put banned drugs

47
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,420
into the warehouse at the Mu Family Wharf.

48
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:53,182
It seems...

49
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:57,157
we just have to wait for the final victory.

50
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,974
You guys are so weak.

51
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:10,442
I didn't win once.

52
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:14,228
I didn't expect Commander Tan to be so good at Mahjong.

53
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:17,870
I'm going to make a lot of money today.

54
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:23,096
Brother Guangyao, why are you short of a tile?

55
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:29,539
Maybe it fell when we were shuffling the tiles.

56
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,456
Don't bother. I will just go to the storeroom and get another pair.

57
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:36,556
Hey, Commander Tan. I don't think that's a good idea.

58
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,210
I know what you're thinking.

59
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,476
How about this? The storeroom is next door.

60
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:46,716
Since Guangyao is short of a tile, he can come with me.

61
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:48,054
How about that?

62
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,425
Okay. I'll go with him.

63
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:52,141
What do you think?

64
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:56,340
Please.

65
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:06,645
Come on. Choose a pair of mahjong tiles you like.

66
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:23,271
What do you mean? What are you doing?

67
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:25,841
I'm doing this to prove your innocence.

68
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:28,150
Only if you cut off all contact with the outside world

69
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,320
will people not talk about you.

70
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:36,288
I'm an asshole. Please stay out of my business.

71
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:40,916
I don't care what happened between you and Wanqing.

72
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:44,479
But now, you're still her fiancé.

73
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:48,725
If anything happens to you, it is bound to bring trouble to her.

74
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:01,743
It was my father who reported you this time.

75
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:06,607
Once you show a mistake, he won't let you off the hook.

76
00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:10,182
So… I can't take the risk.

77
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,810
Do you know that

78
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,100
you are now acting as an accomplice to your father?

79
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,371
I'm trying to save you.

80
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:21,772
Save me?

81
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:24,935
The way you will save me is to let me sit still waiting for death?

82
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:26,550
Do you know that your father is using the

83
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,440
Japanese Chamber of Commerce to set a deathtrap?

84
00:06:29,448 --> 00:06:30,830
I bet you didn't know

85
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,860
how he defeated Luo Bingwen ten years ago.

86
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,395
It was all because of this Junichi Yamashita.

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,420
<i>Mr. Yamashita. Japanese.</i>

88
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,962
You're back?

89
00:06:57,394 --> 00:06:58,958
What about Supervisor Xu?

90
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,580
He said he'll go downstairs to buy a pack of cigarettes.

91
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,410
He told us to wait for him.

92
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,339
- Look.
- Hey, kid.

93
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:26,284
What kind of cigarettes do you want?

94
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,625
Two packs of Hatamen.

95
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,818
Here you go.

96
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:35,956
Keep the change. You can go back and count it.

97
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,996
Thank you, Uncle.

98
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,240
Supervisor Xu is such a heavy smoker.

99
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,507
Here it is. I didn't even see it.

100
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:02,170
The tiles are all here.

101
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,628
Then we don't need this set of Mahjong tiles.

102
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:07,596
Why don't we shuffle the tiles first? Let's wait for him.

103
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:11,929
The tiles are all here.

104
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,046
We've been searching for a long time.

105
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:18,577
You're all tired, right? Come on.

106
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:20,832
Have a cigarette to refresh yourselves.

107
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,932
Just now, we found that missing tile.

108
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,281
Who is it?

109
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:49,910
<i>I'm here for the money.</i>

110
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,343
Come on in.

111
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:08,242
Kid.

112
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,240
What do you come to me for?

113
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,820
Just now at Defense Command, one of the officers bought my cigarettes,

114
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,076
and he gave me a stack of money.

115
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:18,434
When I counted the money, I found some words written on it.

116
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,080
<i>[Hurry to Room 305, Licha Hotel for double reward]</i>

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,400
<i>[Avoid the water today]</i>

118
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:33,404
Where's my reward?

119
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:41,314
Let me ask you something.

120
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,235
The officer who bought your cigarettes… What did he look like?

121
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:46,320
He was tall, big, and very energetic.

122
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,204
Then, why didn't he come by himself?

123
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:51,356
I don't know. But today, no one came in or out of the Command all morning.

124
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:54,535
The officer called me over to buy some cigarettes.

125
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:58,021
Okay. Thank you. Come on.

126
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,356
- Goodbye, Uncle.
- Goodbye.

127
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,955
Sir, have we been exposed?

128
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,132
Commander Tan said to avoid the water today.

129
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:25,903
That means we shouldn't go to the pier.

130
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:31,223
Commander Tan used this method to send us a message.

131
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:33,421
That means that he is also being monitored.

132
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:37,658
If I don't go and those arms and ammunition are discovered,

133
00:10:37,658 --> 00:10:40,000
we'll be putting Commander Tan in jeopardy.

134
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,214
But if we go there now, we'll be walking into a trap.

135
00:10:45,214 --> 00:10:47,023
Not only will we be unable to transfer the arms and ammunition,

136
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:49,995
but even Commander Tan would be unable to escape.

137
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:01,746
Wanqing, are you going outside?

138
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,770
I don't know why my head hurts so much today.

139
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,510
I'm going to have a cup of coffee.

140
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:07,175
Okay.

141
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,500
<i>[Cafe]</i>

142
00:11:57,315 --> 00:11:58,978
Thank you.

143
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,203
- A cup of coffee, please.
- Okay, just a moment, please.

144
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:09,556
Thank you.

145
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,065
One Dot.

146
00:12:30,478 --> 00:12:32,043
I win.

147
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,025
How did you win again?

148
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:36,216
Forget it. I'm not playing.

149
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:39,750
Pay up first! Pay up first! Come on!

150
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,254
Let me count how much I've won today.

151
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:51,456
Commander Tan, it's past noon.

152
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:56,682
Maybe members from the Revolutionary Party have gotten arrested.

153
00:12:57,222 --> 00:12:59,670
Good. Well done.

154
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,706
I'd like to see which one of these bastards got me into trouble.

155
00:13:03,706 --> 00:13:05,492
It's been so long. Why isn't she back yet?

156
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:07,471
Should we go and check?

157
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:09,716
We have to go and check. What if we lost her?

158
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:11,759
Hey, she's back.

159
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,540
Okay, this way.

160
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,587
Hurry up.

161
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,065
Report!

162
00:13:32,065 --> 00:13:34,779
The goods have arrived at the pier and are temporarily stored in Warehouse Six.

163
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:36,150
According to the informant, there are more than ten boxes of rifle cartridges

164
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,920
there are more than ten boxes of rifle cartridges

165
00:13:37,922 --> 00:13:40,207
and eight heavy machine guns.

166
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,731
That's more than enough to equip two regiments.

167
00:13:43,731 --> 00:13:47,273
The Revolutionary Party spent quite a bit this time.

168
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:50,459
However, men from the Revolutionary Party didn't show up.

169
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,870
The goods are still in the warehouse. But there was no one to pick them up.

170
00:13:58,806 --> 00:14:00,271
Yes.

171
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:05,075
The men from the Revolutionary Party didn't show up.

172
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,140
Brother Zuo, don't look at me like that.

173
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,440
I've been playing Mahjong with you. I haven't even gotten past the doors of the Command.

174
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,539
You don't suspect me, do you?

175
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,700
It's too early to draw any conclusions.

176
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,570
Commander Tan, how about this?

177
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,240
Let's go to the pier to inspect the goods.

178
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:37,309
If it's arms and ammunition, you'll see it with your own eyes.

179
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,739
You wouldn't be able to say that we've tampered with it.

180
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:42,320
If it's not, you don't have to worry.

181
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,028
Our investigation team will definitely clear your name.

182
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,662
Okay. Just do as you said.

183
00:14:51,662 --> 00:14:54,176
Good. Please.

184
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,200
<i>- Come on.
- Okay.</i>

185
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,120
<i>- Hurry up.
- Coming.</i>

186
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,940
<i>[6]</i>

187
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:55,362
Commander Tan, please.

188
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:56,520
Brother Zuo,

189
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,434
I borrowed this warehouse from Mr. Joseph, a friend of the Executive Director.

190
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:02,207
But I don't know what's inside.

191
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:05,073
I'm just doing some small business. But the contact didn't show up.

192
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:07,406
You're not going to blame me for that, are you?

193
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:09,695
Commander Tan,

194
00:16:09,695 --> 00:16:14,425
I don't care if you rented this warehouse for business or for arms shipments.

195
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:17,521
But if the arms and ammunition are found in the warehouse today,

196
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:19,903
that means this report is by no means a groundless rumor.

197
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:21,790
Then, Commander Tan, it'll be hard to clear your name.

198
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,803
You are jumping to conclusions so soon.

199
00:16:23,803 --> 00:16:25,100
Staff Officer Zuo.

200
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,520
Even if you found arms and ammunition here,

201
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,720
it's a bit arbitrary to conclude that Commander Tan

202
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
was working with the enemy.

203
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,354
He's right.

204
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,831
There is a tip-off and hard physical evidence.

205
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:39,204
I don't think the Commander would be falsely accused.

206
00:16:39,204 --> 00:16:40,784
Let's go.

207
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:51,770
- Put it away.
- What do we do now?

208
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,030
If they find the arms and ammunition, and they take the Commander away,

209
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,340
we would have to resort to force.

210
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,595
Report, Officer! All the boxes only have bowls and chopsticks.

211
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,015
- Go and get the man in charge.
- Yes.

212
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,090
Officer, is there a problem?

213
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,980
All the goods that arrived in Warehouse Six today, are they all in here?

214
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,667
Officer, this is Warehouse Nine.

215
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,480
Warehouse Six is in the back.

216
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,978
Isn't this Warehouse Six? There is a sign saying it's six over there.

217
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,410
This is not a six.

218
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,512
Some careless worker must have hung the sign upside down.

219
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:36,242
<i>Could it have been her?</i>

220
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,514
- Where is Warehouse Six?
- It is over there.

221
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:46,643
- Take us there.
- Sure. Come with me.

222
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,640
Commander Tan, take it easy. We'll just take a look.

223
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,292
Please.

224
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,800
Let's go and keep up with them.

225
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,626
- Let's go.
- Hurry.

226
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:01,242
Okay.

227
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,309
This is six, not nine.

228
00:20:06,302 --> 00:20:08,517
Look at this wine.

229
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,439
On my command.

230
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,843
Report, Officer!

231
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:29,331
The boxes are filled with all kinds of wines and foreign liquors.

232
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:34,496
Look. This is a foreign liquor from 1916. You might as well smell it.

233
00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:36,517
Come on.

234
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,660
Commander Tan.

235
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,640
These are your own warehouses. Didn't you know they were wrong?

236
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,268
Brother Zuo, I've already told you. I'm an unrefined person.

237
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:53,317
I do business here mainly to gain profit.

238
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:56,331
I don't care about anything else but the money.

239
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:58,100
I really didn't know.

240
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,893
It's too much of a coincidence to make a mistake like this.

241
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,436
Brother Zuo. Look. We've checked everything that needed to be checked.

242
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:10,040
And I was doing my best to cooperate.

243
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,193
So please stop wasting all of our time.

244
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:14,062
Yes.

245
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:16,826
Maybe the information was wrong or it was just a misunderstanding.

246
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:18,256
That's right.

247
00:21:18,256 --> 00:21:20,420
Wait! It's not a misunderstanding.

248
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,160
I think it's a false accusation.

249
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:25,629
I don't know who I offended to make him do this to me.

250
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:27,041
Don't let me catch him.

251
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,000
Although we didn't find any evidence today,

252
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,460
there's something strange about the warehouse.

253
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,740
I can't rule out the possibility of tampering with evidence.

254
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,206
Regarding this matter, I will report to Beijing with the details.

255
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:41,921
The Military Governor will decide what to do with this investigation.

256
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:45,842
Commander Tan, you're still a suspect.

257
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:49,176
I need you to come with me. Soldiers!

258
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:54,645
Staff Officer Zuo, I don't think it's appropriate to arrest someone like this.

259
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:58,318
Supervisor Xu, I'm not arresting anyone.

260
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:01,428
I'm asking Commander Tan to return to assist us in our investigation.

261
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:03,680
If someone suspects something odd about this matter today,

262
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,080
there will be doubts about Commander Tan's innocence.

263
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,740
It would leave a stain on Commander Tan's future,

264
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,640
which is not a good thing for him either.

265
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,960
A clean hand wants no washing.

266
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,656
Commander Tan, if you are really innocent,

267
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:23,217
then the more carefully we investigate, the better it will be for you.

268
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,360
Fine. Since Brother Zuo is so cautious,

269
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,470
I will try my best to cooperate.

270
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:32,176
Please.

271
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,980
I can't believe it.

272
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,200
How could you make a mistake like this?

273
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,765
I don't know.

274
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,271
That's not possible.

275
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:45,720
How could the arms and ammunition disappear suddenly?

276
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,160
The investigation team did not find the arms and ammunition.

277
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,240
But Staff Officer Zuo still remains suspicious.

278
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,725
He temporarily detained Tan Xuanlin at the Licha Hotel,

279
00:22:55,725 --> 00:22:59,518
and he is seeking advice from Beijing on how to deal with this matter.

280
00:22:59,518 --> 00:23:01,159
What about Mu Wanqing?

281
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:03,500
Our men have been following her.

282
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,715
She was at the cafe the whole time.

283
00:23:04,715 --> 00:23:06,419
And she went home after drinking coffee.

284
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,412
She didn't go anywhere else.

285
00:23:11,502 --> 00:23:13,862
That's strange.

286
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,820
Where the hell could the arms and ammunition have gone?

287
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,403
Yes.

288
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,887
Warlord.

289
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,360
<i>[No munition was found but Staff Officer Zuo still has Tan Xuanlin detained for investigation.]</i>

290
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,640
They didn't find the munition?

291
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,800
Yes.

292
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,080
Staff Officer Zuo detained Tan Xuanlin and will continue with the investigation.

293
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,915
We couldn't catch him with the goods.

294
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:03,673
That means we've lost the lead.

295
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:05,606
It seems...

296
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:09,025
we need to ready two strings to our bow.

297
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:12,300
Governor, what you mean is…

298
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:14,745
Governor.

299
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,146
<i>Hello?</i>

300
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:30,878
- Hello. Is this the Licha Hotel?
- <i>Yes.</i>

301
00:24:30,878 --> 00:24:33,329
Could you please transfer me to Mr. Su Hongchen's room?

302
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:35,171
<i>One moment, please.</i>

303
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:44,518
Didn't I say I'd to treat you to dinner?

304
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:47,090
Do you still want my answer?

305
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:54,793
You are…

306
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,064
We are from the headquarters.

307
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,928
Commander Tan asked us to escort Miss Gu.

308
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,290
- Miss Gu.
- Miss Gu.

309
00:25:03,696 --> 00:25:05,895
<i>Young Uncle?</i>

310
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,016
Report! I've checked.

311
00:25:09,016 --> 00:25:11,245
There was only one pickup from Warehouse Six

312
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:13,304
between 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. today at the Shanghai Bund.

313
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,920
Here is the delivery order. It has the signature of the person who picked it up.

314
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,496
Because the warehouse numbers were mixed up,

315
00:25:18,496 --> 00:25:20,998
<i>[Shanghai Bund Pier Withdrawal Voucher]</i>
it's signed Warehouse Nine.

316
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:22,991
Why is it in Japanese?

317
00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:25,465
Did you ask whoever was in charge of the pier about this person?

318
00:25:25,465 --> 00:25:27,787
He said it was a young man.

319
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,185
Brother Zuo.

320
00:25:42,185 --> 00:25:43,684
Commander Tan.

321
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:48,410
Before we continue, I'd like to ask you to stay here for a few days.

322
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,505
It's okay. It's quite nice here.

323
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:53,041
It's much better than my office.

324
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:55,425
We know what happened.

325
00:25:55,425 --> 00:25:57,460
Commander Tan, on the grounds of doing business,

326
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,082
you asked Mr. Joseph to borrow Shanghai…

327
00:26:00,082 --> 00:26:02,122
Brother Zuo, let me correct you.

328
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:04,106
It was not on the grounds of doing business.

329
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:06,478
I'm a businessman.

330
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:11,782
Fine. Let me correct you. Regardless of what business Commander Tan wants to do,

331
00:26:11,782 --> 00:26:15,966
there are some things that need to be clear.

332
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:19,520
Okay, Brother Zuo. What do you want me to explain?

333
00:26:25,748 --> 00:26:30,400
This is a delivery order from the Shanghai Bund pier at 12:30 p.m. today.

334
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,589
When we checked Warehouse Nine, a shipment came out of Warehouse Six.

335
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:35,767
Commander Tan,

336
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:39,442
don't you want to know who the shipper was?

337
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,767
Who was it?

338
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:50,170
Do I know him?

339
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,756
Yes.

340
00:26:51,756 --> 00:26:53,928
You two are pretty close.

341
00:26:59,406 --> 00:27:02,218
Pretty close?

342
00:27:02,218 --> 00:27:05,295
People who are close to me are either my friends

343
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,148
or… my enemies.

344
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:10,684
I honestly can't guess.

345
00:27:10,684 --> 00:27:14,210
Why don't you make it clearer for me, Brother Zuo?

346
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:19,034
Since you cannot guess, I'll spare you the effort.

347
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:22,482
Once we've made a thorough investigation,

348
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:24,925
we'll know everything.

349
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:26,936
Okay. Staff Officer Zuo.

350
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,820
Then I'll wait for your good news.

351
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,785
Okay. Then we'll leave you to rest.

352
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:38,282
We will go now.

353
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,297
- Hello?
- Hello? I'm Su Hongchen.

354
00:28:00,297 --> 00:28:03,093
Did Miss Gu call me just now?

355
00:28:03,093 --> 00:28:04,729
<i>Someone from the Command came</i>

356
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:07,442
<i>saying that Commander Tan requested the presence of Miss Gu.</i>

357
00:28:07,442 --> 00:28:09,331
Tan Xuanlin?

358
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:10,842
Miss Gu?

359
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:12,987
Our Commander is still being held by the investigation team.

360
00:28:12,987 --> 00:28:14,450
Why would he ask for Miss Gu at this time?

361
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,046
Could the investigation team have summoned Miss Gu?

362
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:22,745
That's impossible. The investigation team would have informed us.

363
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,460
<i>[Defense Command of Shanghai]</i>

364
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,143
Go inside.

365
00:28:40,867 --> 00:28:42,828
Miss Gu.

366
00:28:46,086 --> 00:28:48,186
It's been a long time.

367
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,860
Aren't you Xu Bojun's adjutant?

368
00:28:52,902 --> 00:28:56,582
Miss Gu, you have a good memory.

369
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,028
I saw you from afar at the Mu family party.

370
00:29:02,028 --> 00:29:04,618
But I don't think we've had much contact.

371
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,426
Why did you bring me here?

372
00:29:07,426 --> 00:29:11,817
I've invited Miss Gu here to request a favor.

373
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:17,594
I'm just an actress.

374
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:21,342
I don't know anything about military affairs.

375
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,795
I'm sorry I can't help you.

376
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,264
Miss Gu, don't turn me down so quickly.

377
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:37,559
You are the only one… who can help with this.

378
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,100
<i>[Shanghai Public Concession General Police Station]</i>

379
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,600
- Put your money on the table, all of you!
- Don't hesitate!

380
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,062
Do you hear me?

381
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:04,550
Miss Gu Yueshuang from the Dahua Company has been kidnapped.

382
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,226
So much?

383
00:30:12,086 --> 00:30:14,748
Stop!

384
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:17,260
- Stop grabbing it.
- Hurry and find her for me now!

385
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,680
Right. Okay.

386
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,240
Let's go and find her quickly!

387
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,520
I'm sorry.

388
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,480
Go and find her for me at once.

389
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,396
<i>Although her name is not on the delivery order,</i>

390
00:31:10,396 --> 00:31:13,060
<i>where could she have hidden the arms and ammunition?</i>

391
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,120
<i>If she hid them in the Mu Family Wharf, and they find out…</i>

392
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,800
I didn't expect such things to happen.

393
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,360
- The warehouse is full of wine bottles.
- The wines in the warehouse are really good wines.

394
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,987
Report!

395
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,956
- You may go.
- Yes.

396
00:31:43,206 --> 00:31:46,246
Sirs, looks like we're going to the Mu Family Wharf.

397
00:31:46,246 --> 00:31:47,654
The Mu Family Wharf?

398
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:51,525
Someone reported that there's contraband at the Mu Family Wharf.

399
00:31:51,525 --> 00:31:53,360
What?

400
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,565
Staff Officer Zuo! Staff Officer Zuo!

401
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,446
- Staff Officer Zuo!
- Stop!

402
00:32:15,446 --> 00:32:17,416
Where's Staff Officer Zuo? I need to see him for something important.

403
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:20,945
We've just received a report that a new lead was found at the Mu Family Wharf.

404
00:32:20,945 --> 00:32:22,843
Staff Officer Zuo has already rushed over there.

405
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:24,603
Please remain calm, Commander Tan.

406
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:27,482
Staff Officer Zuo said he will arraign you.

407
00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:31,602
Let me know as soon as he comes back. Thank you.

408
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,531
<i>If it was Wanqing who changed the signs in front of the warehouse,</i>

409
00:32:59,531 --> 00:33:04,200
<i>she must have used the wrong warehouse to temporarily stall the investigation team.</i>

410
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,820
<i>That would mean that she probably moved the arms and ammunition</i>

411
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,964
<i>while we were checking Warehouse Nine.</i>

412
00:33:09,964 --> 00:33:13,509
<i>If the informant saw Wanqing move the arms and ammunition,</i>

413
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:16,401
<i>he wouldn't have waited until now to report it.</i>

414
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:19,460
<i>If the informant had found the arms and ammunition at the Mu Family Wharf,</i>

415
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,800
<i>then given Staff Officer Zuo's temper,</i>

416
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,142
<i>he would have definitely taken me with him</i>

417
00:33:24,142 --> 00:33:26,337
<i>and made me confess on the spot.</i>

418
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,985
<i>He didn't take me with him.</i>

419
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:31,214
<i>But he allowed one of his men to inform me of the news.</i>

420
00:33:31,214 --> 00:33:34,209
<i>It's very likely that he doesn't have a clue.</i>

421
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:36,319
<i>So, he may not have the evidence.</i>

422
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,437
<i>These are your own warehouses. Didn't you know they were wrong?</i>

423
00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:41,896
<i>He must be trying to trick me.</i>

424
00:33:42,407 --> 00:33:44,287
That must be the case.

425
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:48,554
She'll be fine.

426
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,862
It's okay.

427
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,916
- Miss Mu.
- Officer.

428
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:23,860
Why did you call me over at this hour?

429
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,950
There's a report saying you have contraband in your warehouse.

430
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,628
We rented this place out.

431
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:30,390
Whatever's inside, I do not know.

432
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,931
Whether you know it or not, we'll find out when we open it.

433
00:34:32,931 --> 00:34:34,206
These goods belong to another person.

434
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,000
It's not right for me to open the warehouse without their presence.

435
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,896
What? Is Miss Mu afraid that we'd find something?

436
00:34:38,896 --> 00:34:41,080
Is that why she won't let us see?

437
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,436
I know that you went to Joseph to rent the pier together.

438
00:34:55,436 --> 00:35:00,132
Where did Tan Xuanlin hide the arms and ammunition?

439
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,600
I've already told you.

440
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,615
I'm just an actress.

441
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:07,729
I don't know anything about munition.

442
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:10,640
Since you have someone watching my young uncle,

443
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,290
shouldn't you be asking your men this question?

444
00:35:15,428 --> 00:35:17,929
You don't have to beat around the bush with me.

445
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:22,907
If you don't tell me, I'll make you suffer.

446
00:35:22,907 --> 00:35:24,620
Xu Bojun is no longer in power

447
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,970
Shanghai is now my young uncle's territory.

448
00:35:27,972 --> 00:35:30,931
Just try making me suffer…

449
00:35:30,931 --> 00:35:34,339
and we'll see who suffers in the end.

450
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,564
Are you threatening me?

451
00:35:38,982 --> 00:35:41,051
I'm so scared.

452
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:44,558
I won't go easy on you just because you're a celebrity.

453
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:48,700
Tell me the truth now, so that I won't hit you.

454
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,810
You're like a dog relying on its master.

455
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,380
Even Xu Bojun is no match for my young uncle

456
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,120
especially against you lapdogs.

457
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:08,585
Good for you. You're so tough.

458
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:10,549
Since you don't want to listen to my kind words,

459
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:13,623
we'll do it the hard way.

460
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:17,398
Hit her.

461
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,065
Yes.

462
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:35,525
How is it, Miss Actress?

463
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:38,710
Weren't you quite arrogant just now?

464
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,739
I'm telling you.

465
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:44,426
Killing you is as easy as killing an ant.

466
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,625
Come on. Tell me the whereabouts of the arms and ammunition,

467
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:54,818
and I'll let you go.

468
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,843
I've told you.

469
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,418
I don't know anything.

470
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:03,550
You can have me killed if you want.

471
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,858
I really don't know anything about it.

472
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,256
- Have you seen her?
- No.

473
00:37:11,169 --> 00:37:12,629
Have you seen her?

474
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:14,221
No.

475
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,290
Junior Marshal! Junior Marshal Su!

476
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,103
Any news on the rest of them?

477
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:21,790
Junior Marshal Su. Shanghai is so big.

478
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,500
We've only searched less than half of it.

479
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,210
Tell the patrolmen to inform the civilians that

480
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,650
whoever finds Gu Yueshuang will receive one thousand silver dollars.

481
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,956
Gather everyone to find her together!

482
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:34,287
- Yes!
- We'll get going!

483
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,220
These are all Western medicine.

484
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,214
Yes. How can it be all Western medicine?

485
00:37:47,214 --> 00:37:49,007
These are contraband.

486
00:37:49,007 --> 00:37:51,200
Steward. Whose goods are these?

487
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,680
Eldest Miss, the militia withdrew two days ago.

488
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,856
You see… We can't even take good care of the business at the pier.

489
00:37:56,856 --> 00:38:00,596
We… We really don't have the staff to take care of the warehouse.

490
00:38:00,596 --> 00:38:03,192
That means you don't know who this shipment belongs to.

491
00:38:03,192 --> 00:38:04,672
And you didn't keep any records, right?

492
00:38:04,672 --> 00:38:08,157
- Now that they've been found out, aren't I the only one to blame?
- This…

493
00:38:08,157 --> 00:38:11,984
Miss Mu, it seems that this tip-off is true.

494
00:38:11,984 --> 00:38:13,600
Western medicine is contraband.

495
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,620
If you can't provide us with the owner's information,

496
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,327
then please come with us.

497
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,126
Eldest Miss.

498
00:38:36,793 --> 00:38:39,021
Here is the delivery order.

499
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:44,045
Officer, you can see that this shipment came from the Shanghai Bund,

500
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:46,962
<i>[Shanghai Bund Delivery Order]</i>
and we don't know when it was put there.

501
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,480
<i>[Shanghai Bund Delivery Voucher]</i>

502
00:38:56,295 --> 00:39:00,010
It seems the boxes here were the ones that were relocated

503
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,331
from Warehouse Six this morning.

504
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,740
Miss Mu, although this shipment did not come to your pier originally,

505
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,429
you are still guilty of the dereliction of duty.

506
00:39:13,429 --> 00:39:15,540
That would be biased of you to say so.

507
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,372
Cargo inspection is a matter for the pier.

508
00:39:17,372 --> 00:39:20,460
If this is a dereliction of duty, the Shanghai Bund should be to blame.

509
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,506
You should go to Mr. Joseph about this.

510
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,076
Staff Officer Zuo.

511
00:39:26,076 --> 00:39:27,720
It's now been established that

512
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,296
the shipments that left the Bund today

513
00:39:31,296 --> 00:39:34,905
were not arms and ammunition but Western medicine.

514
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:40,245
Then the top priority here should be to find the owner of these shipments

515
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:42,185
and bring him to justice,

516
00:39:42,185 --> 00:39:46,500
not to hold Miss Mu and Joseph responsible.

517
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,982
Anyway, they were also kept in the dark.

518
00:39:50,982 --> 00:39:52,931
They are both victims.

519
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:56,223
It seems they were set up

520
00:39:56,223 --> 00:39:59,825
in order to conceal a Western medicine smuggling business.

521
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,160
<i>[Warehouse Nine Yamoto Trading Corporation]</i>

522
00:40:06,008 --> 00:40:08,121
Japanese?

523
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:11,041
It says Yamato Trading Corporation.

524
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:14,420
It seems to be a Japanese trading company.

525
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:20,207
These damn Japanese. They're playing us for fools!

526
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:23,142
We have to report this matter to Beijing.

527
00:40:23,142 --> 00:40:25,121
We must investigate this Yamato Trading Corporation.

528
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:29,498
All the Japanese were sent to the Consulate for repatriation.

529
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,100
Did you see it all clearly just now?

530
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,584
From now on, you must walk and behave exactly like Miss Mu.

531
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,343
Staff Officer Zuo.

532
00:41:04,621 --> 00:41:05,948
What do you mean?

533
00:41:05,948 --> 00:41:09,081
Supervisor Xu, caution is the parent of safety.

534
00:41:09,081 --> 00:41:10,838
If Commander Tan really collaborated with the enemy,

535
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:12,610
and we make him think we captured Miss Mu,

536
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,610
it would force him to give himself away.

537
00:41:14,616 --> 00:41:18,836
We now know that the shipment was a ploy planned by the Japanese.

538
00:41:18,836 --> 00:41:20,560
Since it has nothing to do with Commander Tan,

539
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,340
he should be released immediately.

540
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:26,598
It's inappropriate to frame him and make a false accusation like this.

541
00:41:26,598 --> 00:41:29,260
Supervisor Xu, watch what you're saying.

542
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,282
I'm not framing him. It's just a test.

543
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:35,930
If Commander Tan is really innocent, he wouldn't give himself away.

544
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,506
But what if Commander Tan really collaborated with the enemy?

545
00:41:38,506 --> 00:41:40,531
If you and I were to make a hasty decision like this,

546
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,296
it may cause endless trouble in the future.

547
00:41:42,296 --> 00:41:46,048
Staff Officer Zuo, I don't think this is a good idea.

548
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:48,040
Supervisor Xu, from the beginning,

549
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,220
it was the Yue City Military Governor's Mansion who gave me the report about Tan Xuanlin.

550
00:41:50,223 --> 00:41:52,464
It stands to reason that you should stick to figuring out the truth.

551
00:41:52,464 --> 00:41:53,727
But you try every means to obstruct it.

552
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:54,780
What are you up to?

553
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,920
Was your tip-off false from the beginning?

554
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,200
It doesn't hurt to test him.

555
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,040
A clean hand wants no washing, right?

556
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,910
Staff Officer Zuo is just doing his job to make sure nothing goes wrong.

557
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,651
<i>Wanqing? That's not possible.</i>

558
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:57,486
<i>Did they really find the arms and ammunition?</i>
