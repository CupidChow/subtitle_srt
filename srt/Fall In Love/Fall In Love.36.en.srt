Commander, Tan Xuanlin has occupied the armory.

Stop shooting!

I know you resent me, Mrs. Chen. But Shaowu's death was definitely not what I wanted.

Who knew that Tan Xuanlin would start to kill in public?

And now, he's already started to move in on me.

What he wants

28
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,695
is to kill every one of us old men in Jiang City.

29
00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:34,095
I have no choice but to ask you to intervene.

30
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:37,504
Tell those men to drop their weapons.

31
00:03:37,504 --> 00:03:41,360
Tan Xuanlin has already ruined my family.

32
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,900
I'm just a woman. I can't kill him.

33
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,571
If I can help you win this battle,

34
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:50,390
it will also be revenge for Shaowu's death.

Liu Fu took Chen Shaowu's wife to the Chen Family camp.

38
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,300
Now, Chen Shaowu's troops have ceased fire.

Liu Fu's men are all coming our way.

40
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,015
- Is that machine gun site at the clock tower still there?
- Yes.

41
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:10,491
But Liu Fu's got so many soldiers. We're outnumbered.

42
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:13,103
I'm afraid we will lose this line of defense soon.

43
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:18,860
Old Fu, how many people are there left in the City Guard Office?

44
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,736
Apart from the people trapped by Liu Fu's main force in the south and north of the city,

45
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:23,311
we have less than 500 men left.

46
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:24,936
What about weapons? Do we have any weapons left?

47
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:28,216
I've brought all the weapons from the armory. There are three heavy machine guns left.

48
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:30,037
Three.

49
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:34,489
Let's do this. We'll set up two machine gun sites at the entrance to the first floor

50
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:37,916
and another one besides the windows on the second floor to form a crossfire

51
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,416
and divide our men into three lines of defense.
<i>[City Guard Office of Jiang City]</i>

52
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,090
Set up the first line of defense at the entrance to the first floor

53
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,016
and two sites on the roof for an ambush.

54
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:48,356
On both sides of the first floor, prepare a hundred people for an ambush

55
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:50,392
to prevent them from breaking through the gate.

56
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:54,253
The rest of the men will be in the four rooms in the backyard for another ambush.

57
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,780
As long as they dare to come in, we'll block their retreat and destroy them.

58
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,598
The Tan Army has fought a lot of battles in which the enemies have outnumbered us.

59
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:01,691
Liu Fu is no match for us.

60

The worst result would be mutual destruction,

00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,149

You came back with me so soon. I got suspicious.

113
00:10:19,812 --> 00:10:21,590
It's a pity that though the marshal has been brilliant all his life,

114
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,596
he's been made a fool by you now.

115
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:26,799
You came back to call for reinforcements to help Tan Xuanlin.

116
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,735
Father has agreed to hold peace talks. Besides, he has given me military power.

117
00:10:30,735 --> 00:10:32,420
Of course, I have the right to act as I see fit.

118
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,534
The marshal agreed to peace talks. But he didn't agree to spare Tan Xuanlin.

119
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,007
He has suffered so much because of Tan.

120
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:45,128
Not only do you not avenge him, but you are in cahoots with your enemies.

00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:50,511
- Xu Yuan!
- I think she instigated it.

122
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:53,302
You're just my father's adjutant.

123
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:54,917
You are going way too far.

124
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:58,020
But the marshal saved me from the battlefield.

125
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,550
He raised me up and taught me the way of being a man and doing things.

126
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,650
Without him, I would not be here.

127
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,690
I am grateful, unlike you.

128
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,810
You're ungrateful. You are an unfilial son.

129
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,467
Yes.

130
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,780
Back then, my father brought you back from the battlefield.

131
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,798
You were only a few months old.

132
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:23,638
My mother said that you were very weak and almost died.

133
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:26,728
So I will never forget the marshal's kindness!

134
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,920
But do you know why my father brought you back?

135
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,286
What do you want to say?

136
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:33,529
In the 22nd year of Emperor Guangxu's reign,
<i>(The 9th Qing Emperor who ruled from 1875-1908)</i>

137
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,510
the Big Sword Society in Shangdong started an uprising.

138
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,624
At that time, my father was the Commander of the Defense Battalion.

139
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:39,935
He led soldiers to kill the insurgents

140
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:44,037
and shot a couple with a baby.

141
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,300
That baby was only a few months old.

142
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,789
My father then walked up to the baby.

143
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:53,635
He wanted to wipe the blood on his bayonet

144
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:56,028
with the blanket on the baby.

145
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:58,140
But when he bent down,

146
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,517
a surviving insurgent shot an arrow at him.

147
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:04,992
My father escaped death because he bent down.

148
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:07,635
He believed

149
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:10,278
the baby could bring him good luck.

150
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,719
So he took him home.

151
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:16,859
You are lying to me.

152
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:20,687
This was written in my mother's diary.

153
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:22,709
She always felt like she owed you.

154
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:27,018
That's why when she was alive, she treated you so well.

155
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:31,609
She did so to atone for my father's sins.

156
00:12:58,598 --> 00:13:00,359
Just leave.

157
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:04,812
From now on,

158
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,780
I have nothing to do with you.

159
00:13:41,093 --> 00:13:42,854
Brother Yuan!

00:13:59,016 --> 00:14:01,516
Why are you here?

161
00:14:01,516 --> 00:14:03,434
You heard it, right?

162
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:05,632
Xu Yuan killed himself.

163
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:09,826
Don't look at me like that.

164
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:11,932
I didn't do anything.

165
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:14,220
He found out the truth.

166
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,120
He thought that he was loyal to the wrong person all his life.

167
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,620
But when I carefully think about it,

168
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,303
his loyalty was all a result of your lie.

169
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:23,700
And as you kept telling the lie,

170
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
you finally believed it yourself.

171
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,807
So when you do evil things,

172
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:30,421
you think you are doing the right things.

173
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,795
You have no right to accuse me.

174
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:41,307
A man of great ambition should not stick to trifles.

175
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:43,626
Look at emperors and generals of the past dynasties.

176
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:46,514
They all killed people to get what they wanted.

177
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:49,415
Millions died so that Caesar might be great.

178
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:52,325
The world is like this.

179
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,515
The world is like this?

180
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:58,307
Do you think you can get rid of your sins by saying that?

181
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,828
You killed my brother,

182
00:15:00,828 --> 00:15:02,448
framed Governor Luo,

183
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:05,528
tricked my father into raising money for you,

184
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:07,596
and used Mu Wanting to force Min Dacheng to work for you,

185
00:15:07,596 --> 00:15:09,467
so that he would do all the evil things for you.

186
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:11,628
Xuanlin proved my brother's innocence,

187
00:15:11,628 --> 00:15:13,084
so you wanted him dead.

188
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:15,428
And you got my father killed.

189
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:19,240
In the end, even Miss Gu died because of you.

190
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,752
Did the world force you to do all these?

191
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,155
Okay.

192
00:15:30,884 --> 00:15:32,345
Fine.

193
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:34,640
You shrew.

194
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,908
I want to kill you

195
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:39,829
for Guangyao's sake.

196
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:42,762
You... You...

197
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,400
The only good thing you have done in your whole life

198
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,515
is to care about your son.

199
00:15:55,515 --> 00:15:59,857
But Brother Guangyao will never follow your plans.

200
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:01,857
Guangyao.

201
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:03,400
Get him here for me.

202
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,210
Where is Guangyao?

203
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,660
Brother Guangyao is paying your debts.

204
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,000
He will try his best to make up for all the evil things you have done.

205
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:14,569
<i>Attention!</i>

206
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,823
<i>Turn right!</i>

207
00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:27,704
Don't you want to see your son?

208
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:29,323
He is in the courtyard now,

209
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,210
training his soldiers in high spirits.

210
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,340
The marshal is a scholar.

211
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,509
He always wants to contribute to the country.

212
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:39,006
For years, he has thrown himself into wars, trying to save the country.

213
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:42,106
But these are trying times.

214
00:16:42,106 --> 00:16:43,820
He has been led astray

215
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,544
and couldn't reach the goal.

216
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,261
As a result,

217
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:51,552
he stepped down for some introspection.

218
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,534
He is now in this courtyard.

219
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:57,453
He is getting ready

220
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:59,718
to travel to Jiang City to support them.

221
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:04,317
You must be very proud to have a son like that.

222
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,216
Throughout history,

223
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,820
no city was unbreakable,

224
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,815
and no one's territory

225
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:16,089
could be passed on for generations safely.

226
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:20,310
The real territory lies in the heart of our people.

227
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,370
Only when the citizens recognize us and respect us,

228
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:27,718
will we have a way out whenever and

229
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:31,626
wherever we go.

230
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,450

232
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,621
From this day forth,

233
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:57,114
I will take over the troops.

You are all a bunch of trash!

There are only hundreds of people at the City Guard Office.

And after such a lengthy assault, you couldn't even get through the gate!

The City Guard Office is easy to defend but difficult to attack.

264
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:48,465
Tan Xuanlin has set up a lot of machine-gun sites.

265
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:49,762
Their firepower is too intense.

267

00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:28,480
Tan Si! Tan Si!

325
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,241
Commander, hurry!

326
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,650
- Tan Si!
- Tan Si!

327
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:48,374
Brother!

328
00:25:50,808 --> 00:25:52,323
Leave!

329
00:25:52,323 --> 00:25:55,196
Old Fu! Fire cover!

330
00:26:28,976 --> 00:26:32,096
- Tan Si!
- Tan Si!

331
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:49,156
Retreat! Hurry!

332
00:26:49,156 --> 00:26:50,570
Hurry!

333
00:27:04,592 --> 00:27:06,253
Retreat!

334
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,831
Chase them!

335
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:35,258
Fire!

336
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,402
Commander, it's me.

337
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,460
Your wound is inflamed. Let me help you clean and dress it.

338
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,962
I'm fine. It's not that big a deal. I can handle it.

339
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:32,938
No. It may kill you if you leave it be.

340
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:37,568
Old Fu, do you have any liquor?

341
00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:39,049
Yes.

342
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,341
Hang in there.

343
00:28:57,672 --> 00:28:59,433
Old Fu.

344
00:29:01,612 --> 00:29:03,890
I owe you one.

345
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,017
When the battle is over,

346
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,318
let's have a good drink.

347
00:29:09,318 --> 00:29:11,704
Then you must keep your words.

348
00:29:37,705 --> 00:29:40,096
Fire!

349
00:29:40,096 --> 00:29:42,780
Commander, watch out for the barrage!

350
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,783
Take Tan Xuanlin alive!

351
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,344
Yes, sir.

352
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,117
<i>You've promised me.</i>

353
00:31:28,117 --> 00:31:30,497
<i>You promised we would be together forever,</i>

354
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,820
<i>not a day less.</i>

355
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,381
<i>Okay.</i>

356
00:31:36,413 --> 00:31:40,015
<i>You have my words. Not a day less.</i>

357
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,281
Get out of the way.

358
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:17,820
Tan Xuanlin! You're dead!

359
00:34:37,195 --> 00:34:40,513
Why do you work for Xu Bojun?

360
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:42,057
Why?

361
00:34:42,057 --> 00:34:44,952
My only son

362
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:49,776
was executed by your father for embezzling a mere 10,000 yuan of military pay.

363
00:34:49,776 --> 00:34:52,913
Do you really think I'm working for Xu Bojun?

364
00:34:52,913 --> 00:34:54,772
No!

365
00:34:54,772 --> 00:34:57,806
I'm avenging my son's death!

366
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,308
I'm sure you don't know, but back then, it was me

367
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:05,890
who told Xu Bojun about your father's marching route,

368
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,996
which led to your father's death.

369
00:35:07,996 --> 00:35:11,661
Today, I will kill

370
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:14,036
the remaining son of the Tan family!

371
00:35:14,036 --> 00:35:16,848
So it was you.

372
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,940
You lied to me. You said you wouldn't get hurt.

373
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,881
I'm fine.

374
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,681
It's okay.

375
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,081
It's still here.

376
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,024
<i>[City Guard Office of Jiang City]</i>

377
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:44,016
- Uncle Liao.
- Xuanlin, how's your wound?

378
00:40:44,016 --> 00:40:45,896
- It's a lot better.
- Then...

379
00:40:45,896 --> 00:40:49,650
Commander Tan, welcome back.

380
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,356
Uncle Liao, it was you who led me on this path.

381
00:40:52,356 --> 00:40:55,223
From now on, we'll be comrades.

382
00:40:56,704 --> 00:41:00,199
Commander, the special envoy sent by Governor Pei for peace talks has arrived.

383
00:41:03,414 --> 00:41:04,675
Junior Marshal Pei.

384
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:06,455
Brother!

385
00:41:06,455 --> 00:41:07,696
- Little Four!
- I missed you so much!

386
00:41:07,696 --> 00:41:09,720
Your brother's arm is injured.

387
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,776
- Get down quickly.
- Arm?

388
00:41:11,776 --> 00:41:13,059
Where? Let me see.

389
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:15,840
- Take your hands off me.
- No, I won't!

390
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,480
I won't take my hands off.

391
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,021
Who told you to cut me off from the family?

392
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:23,212
I'm telling you, blood ties cannot be cut off so easily.

393
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:26,660
Fine.

394
00:41:30,198 --> 00:41:31,959
Sangyu.

395
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,900
Move aside.

396
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,850
Commander Tan, long time no see.

397
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,550
Long time no see.

398
00:41:41,176 --> 00:41:43,611
My crazy little sister has stayed with you for so long.

399
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:45,344
I'm sorry for your trouble.

400
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:49,485
Brother! How can you say that about your sister?

401
00:41:49,485 --> 00:41:54,446
Don't say that. She changed me. I should thank her.

402
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:57,067
It seems that you have convinced your father.

403
00:41:57,067 --> 00:42:00,768
We're two people reaching the same goal by different means.

404
00:42:01,796 --> 00:42:04,557
You did what you promised. You're a man of character.

405
00:42:06,502 --> 00:42:09,600
Hey, you little brat, why are you siding with him?

406
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,440
You finally admit that, right?

407
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,510
Our Old Pei has always been a man of his words.

408
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:18,498
You talk too much!

409
00:42:18,498 --> 00:42:21,403
I'm trying to compliment my sister on her good taste.

410
00:42:21,403 --> 00:42:24,574
Commander Tan, we'll all be comrades from now on.

411
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:26,667
Why are you still giving me a hard time?

412
00:42:28,751 --> 00:42:30,212
Commander Tan!

413
00:42:30,212 --> 00:42:32,612
Look who's coming.

414
00:42:32,612 --> 00:42:35,961
- Commander Tan.
- Old Wu? Why are you here?

415
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:37,896
Screw that position of Defense Commander of Shanghai.

416
00:42:37,896 --> 00:42:41,261
From now on, I'll follow you.

417
