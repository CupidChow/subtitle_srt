15
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,300
How's it going, Commander? It's been settled?

16
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,300
Mr. Liao is on good terms

17
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,500
with several foreign newspaper companies.

18
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,600
He promised to help us publish the news of the retrial of the old case.

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
So with that kind of pressure,

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,400
Military Governor Xu won't be able to delay the case forever.

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,600
But hasn't Miss Mu already gone to Pei Xun to negotiate a deal?

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,100
Do we still need to force him to give in?

23
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,000
For an old fox like him,

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,600
we have to adopt every possible means,

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,500
both tough and soft.

26
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
You're back?

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,400
Come here. Have a seat.

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
How was it? He...

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,400
He didn't give you a hard time, did he?

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm exhausted.

31
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,300
Be careful. It's hot.

32
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,100
Did you make a deal?

33
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,800
Yes.

34
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,300
Well, you've made a deal,

35
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,900
but why do you look unhappy?

36
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,500
I've never seen anyone as greedy as Pei Xun.

37
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,700
He won't pay a penny, and I'll do all the work.

38
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,700
I'd give him 80% of the profit, and he still thinks it's too little.

39
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,400
It's really these men armed with guns who are the most ruthless.

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,100
It's honestly a deal that can guarantee great profit without any cost.

41
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,100
Honey,

42
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,500
am I on the list of men armed with guns

43
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,600
that you just mentioned?

44
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,300
You?

45
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,000
Not only do you keep me from making money,

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,300
you also make me lose money.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,600
Thank you for your hard work.

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,600
I've said that I'd support you for the rest of my life.

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Since the words have been spoken,

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,400
I can only shoulder the responsibility.

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,900
You're so nice.

52
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,500
Second Brother.

53
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,600
So you've been relying on my sister-in-law to support you?

54
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
- Move over.
- Then you're like a good-for-nothing gigolo.

55
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,000
- Little Four.
- Could you please hold your tongue?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,400
Your father-in-law is really greedy.

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,700
- Where's your Mr. Pei?
- Oh, right. Well...

58
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,500
Did Pei Xun say when the trial would be held?

59
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,600
No.

60
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,900
He only said that he would give the Mu family justice.

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,500
Justice?

62
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,800
I'll remain skeptical.

63
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,000
But dividends of the shops

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,100
provide a steady stream of benefits.

65
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,000
I think Pei Xun will no longer collude with Xu Bojun.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,300
The odds will be on our side.

67
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,200
The odds are in our favor.

68
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
But it'll cost too much.

69
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,300
Sister-in-Law, don't mind the price.

70
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,600
Think about it. If I am in a relationship with Mr. Pei,

71
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,100
then we'll all be family.

72
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,600
As the old saying goes,

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,700
keep the goods within the family.

74
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,800
Hey.

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
Do you plan on helping others and harming your family?

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,800
Do you really think of the Pei family as your in-laws?

77
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,200
Second Brother, how can you say that about me?

78
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,300
I just said a few words about the Pei Family,

79
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,000
and you're saying that I'm helping them and harming us.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But my sister-in-law hasn't even married you yet,

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,400
yet she's spending so much money on you.

82
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,000
So are you saying that

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,200
my sister-in-law is like me, helping others and doing harm to her family?

84
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,500
Do you want to get beaten?

85
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,300
Do you?

86
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,000
- I'm going to go. Bye!
- Don't go! Stop right there!

87
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,100
Naughty girl.

88
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,000
Who did you say helps others and harms their family?

89
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
Who is it?

90
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,300
Honey, come on. Calm down.

91
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't be angry.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,400
Honey, you've helped me a lot, and you know what's right.

93
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,700
Nothing I do can repay the favor, except marrying you.

94
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,100
Come on.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
Have some tea.

96
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,300
- It's so hot.
- Okay.

97
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,200
Thank you.

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Pei Xun, this old bastard.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,200
He's going to turn against me for good.

100
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
<i>[Soak up the old - case trial is - in sight]</i>
He attacked me with the newspaper.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,900
It seems that he is determined to ally with Tan Xuanlin!

102
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Even if he allies with Tan Xuanlin,

103
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,200
we don't have to worry.

104
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,900
I'm sure I can kill Min Dacheng before the court session is held.

105
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,900
Send out orders to the troops north of the Yangtze

106
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,400
to assemble at Hangu Pass,

107
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
and tell Guangyao to take the supplies and gear

108
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,500
to support the troops immediately.

109
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,700
Governor.

110
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,000
But the Revolutionary Army is now

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,600
confronting us on the south bank of the Yangtze River.

112
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,200
As the old saying goes, of two evils choose the lesser evil.

113
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,500
If the old bastard, Pei Xun, dares to convict me without witnesses,

114
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,700
that would destroy the Xu family.

115
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,100
I, Xu Bojun, will not stand by and wait for death.

116
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,600
If he wants to take my life,

117
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,300
I'd like to see whether he can do it!

118
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,000
What's wrong?

119
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,100
Adjutant Xu said to not bring newspapers to Junior Marshal.

120
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,300
- Okay, okay.
- Take it away.

121
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,000
Junior Marshal, reporting! We received a telegram from the military governor.

122
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,300
- What is it?
- The military governor ordered you to move the supplies to Hangu Pass.

123
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
But our troops

124
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,400
are confronting the Revolutionary Army along the Yangtze River.

125
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,000
What's the point of going to Hangu Pass at this time?

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,800
The military governor didn't explain the reasons on the telegram.

127
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,300
But he wants you to arrive there within five days.

128
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,000
Otherwise, you will be punished by military justice.

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,400
Young Uncle is not like that.

162
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,600
Well, you're here trying your best to defend him.

163
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,300
Did he take you to Beijing?

164
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,100
No, right? Instead, he's close to Mu Wanqing.

165
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
Then you are here defending Xu Guangyao.

166
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,100
You're still in the dark about his business, aren't you?

167
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,700
Isn't he your close friend?

168
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,900
After such a big thing, did he even inform you?

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,400
I don't want dinner. I want to go home.

170
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,500
Wait.

171
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,700
I've booked the table.

172
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,500
I am too angry to eat anything.

173
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,600
I am wrong, okay? You...

174
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,600
<i>Newspaper for sale! Newspaper for sale!</i>

175
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,500
<i>[Soak up the old - case trial is - in sight

176
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,200
Military Governor!

177
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,300
Commander Tan. Please.

178
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,500
Military Governor Pei.

179
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,700
You want to see me this late.

180
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,900
Is there anything important?

181
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Commander Tan.

182
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,600
This matter…

183
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,700
This is your doing, right?

184
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,600
<i>[Soak up the old - case trial is - in sight

185
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
You must be joking, Governor.

186
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,100
This is clearly Xu Bojun. How could I have?

187
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,200
You think I didn't know Xu Bojun was the murderer?

188
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,800
You bastard. Don't play dumb in front of me.

189
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,900
For this case,

190
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,700
I've talked to the Grand Justice long ago.

191
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,500
And we agreed to keep it under wraps for the time being.

192
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,900
But why did the news suddenly appear in foreign newspapers?

193
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,700
Tan Xuanlin, you're on good terms with the embassy.

194
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,500
If you didn't do it,

195
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,000
who else could have done it?

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,700
Military Governor,

197
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,740
I'll tell you the truth.

198
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,100
The news was actually my doing.

199
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,200
I'm afraid you'd miss the best time to hold a court session.

200
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,900
That's why I made a decision for you.

201
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,400
Tan Xuanlin,

202
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,500
don't think just because I used a few boxes of your wife's silver,

203
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,200
you could make your own decision without my permission.

204
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,100
- I wouldn't dare.
- You wouldn't dare?

205
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,800
You've already done it.

206
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,900
And now, you still want to play a scene in front of me, don't you?

207
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,100
I've already told you.

208
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
I was really afraid that you'd miss the best time to hold a court session.

209
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,300
I was thinking about your interest.

210
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,970
Bullshit!

211
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,500
Did you know

212
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,250
Xu Bojun's troops stationed on the edge of the Yangtze River

213
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,100
have already marched northward?

214
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,800
If I really went to war with Xu Bojun,

215
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
the small amount of money from the shops,

216
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,700
and even the Mu family wouldn't have enough money!

217
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,000
You bastard.

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,900
You keep saying you're thinking about my interests.

219
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,200
Do you think I am a three-year-old child?

220
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,100
Don't forget that

221
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,300
you're on my territory now!

222
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,400
Not only you, but your wife and sister as well.

223
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,100
I'm holding all three of your lives in my hands.

224
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,800
If you try to play tricks with me again,

225
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,800
I'll make sure you all die painfully.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,800
Military Governor,

227
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,300
I certainly believe in your ability

228
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,800
to make us all die in pain.

229
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,100
I'd like to venture to ask you a question.

230
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,000
Do you want to make sure Xu Bojun

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,100
dies painfully as well?

232
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,000
- What do you mean?
- Xu Bojun is already in Beijing,

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,700
He's living in the Guild Hall of Yue City.

234
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,400
He's in Beijing?

235
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,100
Yes, it's true.

236
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,600
He sent his adjutant to put you off with fair words,

237
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,300
and he's plotting behind the scenes.

238
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,900
Governor,

239
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,100
now is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

240
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,200
Once the court finds Xu Bojun guilty,

241
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,100
we can put him in prison right away.

242
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,700
At that time, whether he dies in prison

243
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,200
or commits suicide,

244
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,400
is a matter of your words.

245
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,500
But if we delay any longer,

246
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,300
when Xu Bojun leaves Beijing,

247
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,700
it will be too late for everything.

248
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,200
The court session will be held tomorrow.

249
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,400
They informed me overnight.

250
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,300
It's clear that Pei Xun, the old bastard,

251
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,500
is acting on a whim.

252
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,700
Yes.

253
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,800
The Supreme Court has informed us overnight

254
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,400
that the court session will be held at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

255
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,700
Governor,

256
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,600
shall we plan ahead?

257
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,400
Since Pei Xun put the news in the newspaper,

258
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
it's only a matter of time before the trial starts.

259
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,900
There is no need to be in such a hurry.

260
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,400
Maybe he wants to catch us off guard.

261
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,100
Have you made all the arrangements for Min Dacheng?

262
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,400
Don't worry, Military Governor.

263
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,700
Tomorrow is the day he dies.

264
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,800
I am sure he's in the car.

267
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,200
Hey, do you know how to drive?

268
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,400
Hey! You hit me and then run away?

269

You hit me and then run away?

275
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,900
The trial of the plaintiff, Mu Wanqing,

276
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,000
against Xu Bojun, the defendant in the case regarding

277
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
the murder of Mu Yuanheng,

278
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,600
in the 5th year of the Republic of China,

279
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,100
is being heard here today

280
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,300
by the Supreme Court of Beijing.

281
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,600
I, the presiding judge,

282
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,400
now declare the court open.

283
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,600
First of all, the clerk

284
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,900
will read out the discipline of the court.

285
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,500
According to the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China,

286
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
in order to maintain order in the courtroom,

287
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,800
all persons present

288
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,600
are requested to observe the following laws.

289
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,300
The autopsy results of that year

290
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,900
said that the time of my brother's death

291
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,100
was at 1:00 in the afternoon.

292
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,300
However, according to the time

293
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,900
when my brother's watch stopped,

294
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,500
the time of the bombing of the pier

295
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,300
was determined to be 3:00 in the afternoon.

296
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,000
Therefore, Xu Bojun was found not guilty.

297
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,700
But this footage clearly shows that

298
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,700
when the Japanese passenger ship Shandong Maru entered the port,

299
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,800
the pier had already been bombed.

300
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,000
And the passenger ship had a fixed schedule

301
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,500
to enter the port.

302
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
It was exactly 1:00 in the afternoon.

303
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,700
So it seems that the time of the bombing

304
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,700
and the time of my brother's death coincides.

305
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,200
Then Xu Bojun would be a major suspect in my brother's death.

306
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,700
Defendant.

307
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,900
Do you have any doubts

308
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,100
about the evidence presented by the plaintiff?

309
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,200
The plaintiff's memory is really not very good.

310
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,100
The most important factor in finding Military Governor Xu not guilty

311
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,300
was not the time of the bombing of the pier,

312
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,200
but the bullet holes in Mu Yuanheng's body.

313
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,800
If it was Military Governor Xu who ordered the bombing of the pier

314
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,000
that led to Mu Yuanheng's death,

315
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,600
then I would like to ask,

316
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,900
where did the bullet holes in his body come from?

317
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't forget that

318
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,200
at that time, the pier was under the control of Military Governor Luo.

319
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,500
Military Governor Xu's men couldn't even get in.

320
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,700
Plaintiff.

321
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,800
Do you have any new evidence to submit

322
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,900
in response to the defendant's objection?

323
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,300
We have a witness.

324
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,100
Bring in the witness.

325
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,860
<i>[Witness Stand]</i>

326
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,300
Silence! Silence!

327
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,300
<i>I've committed a capital crime.</i>

328
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,800
<i>I was supposed to be executed yesterday.</i>

329
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,400
<i>Luckily, I've lived another day.</i>

330
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,400
<i>And earned a pension for my wife and kid.</i>

331
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,600
<i>I have no regrets.</i>

332
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,500
I, Min Dacheng, as a witness,

333
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
hereby testify in court that the real culprits

334
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,000
behind the kidnapping and murder of Mu Yuanheng

335
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,500
more than ten years ago

336
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,700
were Xu Bojun and his men.

337
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,800
And Mu Yuanheng

338
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,900
did not die as a result of the kidnapping.

339
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,200
It was Xu Bojun who ordered his men

340
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,600
to fire the cannons on the warehouse,

341
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,700
resulting in the death of Mu Yuanheng.

342
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,000
This matter I witnessed personally.

343
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,500
So today,

344
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,600
I am willing to stand in this courtroom

345
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
and tell the truth about what happened that year

346
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,100
to prove the crimes of Xu Bojun and his men.

347
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,000
I also would like to ask the judge

348
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,800
to make a fair ruling.

349
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,000
The court has been in session for two hours, right?

350
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,200
Yes, Military Governor.

351
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,500
Without a witness,

352
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,900
it shouldn't have taken so long.

353
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,900
Now I declare that

354
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:16,300
Xu Bojun is guilty of murder and perjury.

355
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:02,000
<i>[Global Supply. Everything you need is available.]</i>

Hurry! Go back inside!
<i>[The Guild Hall of Yue City]</i>

- <i>Don't move! Everybody, get back!</i>

359
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,960
Hurry. Everyone, go to the yard for inspection.

360
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,000
What's going on here?

361
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,230
<i>Hurry! Hurry!</i>

362
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,643
Assistant Staff Officer, check every room one by one.

363
00:22:29,643 --> 00:22:33,090
And gather all the guests in the living room and check them one by one.

364
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,723
Yes!

365
00:22:37,537 --> 00:22:41,427
You two, go over there! Everybody else, hurry!

366
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,740
Officers. This… What is this for?

367
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,110
Our Guild Hall has always been law-abiding.

368
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:59,760
By order of the Supreme Court, Xu Bojun, the Military Governor of Yue City,

369
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,430
is guilty of murdering civilians and falsifying evidence

370
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,596
and is to be arrested immediately!

371
00:23:05,596 --> 00:23:07,816
How come the murderer is here?

372
00:23:07,816 --> 00:23:10,110
Officer, this Guild Hall was built by a few merchants

373
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,395
from Yue City during the Guangxu era.

374
00:23:12,395 --> 00:23:14,450
It has nothing to do with Military Governor Xu.

375
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,470
Don't worry. We didn't say he had anything to do with you.

376
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,810
We just received the news that Xu Bojun, the Military Governor of Yue City,

377
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:25,560
came to Beijing a few days ago and is staying at the Guild Hall of Yue City.

378
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,015
- This…
- Officer, I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

379
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:31,470
If Military Governor Xu came to Beijing, he must be staying at the Liuguo Hotel.

380
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,570
He wouldn't choose to stay here.

381
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,905
Besides, we don't have the check-in record of Military Governor Xu.

382
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:41,800
Xu Bojun must have come to the capital in disguise.

383
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,100
I'm sure he won't use his real name.

384
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,750
Don't be panicked, everyone. Cooperate with us.

385
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,780
We only want to arrest the criminal. We won't harm the innocent.

386

<i>[The Guild Hall of Yue City]</i>

387
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,273
Governor Pei.

388
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,500
Mr. Watanabe.

389
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,319
Military Governor Pei, we have received a request for help

390
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:21,260
from our Japanese expatriates, saying that something happened here,

391
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,630
and that they have been restricted of personal freedom.

392
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,900
I want to know what's going on.

393
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,636
Mr. Watanabe, what's happening here has nothing to do with Japanese expatriates.

394
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:37,591
We're in the process of searching for a murderer.

395
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:39,600
That's good.

396
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,246
However, it is the duty of our embassy

397
00:24:44,246 --> 00:24:47,510
to protect the safety of Japanese expatriates.

398
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,917
I'd like to take them away now, so they won't get frightened.

399
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:54,120
Of course, you may.

400
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,830
But only after we've completed our search and inspection.

401
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,930
That won't be necessary.

402
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,897
Unless the man you're looking for is one of our Japanese citizens.

403
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:07,520
But… even if our citizens commit a crime,

404
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,856
they are entitled to consular jurisdiction,

405
00:25:11,856 --> 00:25:15,203
and should be handed over to our consulate to handle.

406
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,330
Mr. Consul, if you want to protect your expatriates, there is nothing wrong with that.

407
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,485
It's just that we need to check them one by one.

408
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:28,433
I am afraid the murderer is disguised as a Japanese person.

409
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:30,910
Don't worry about that.

410
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,996
The consulate will check their passports one by one.

411
00:25:33,996 --> 00:25:39,671
You have no right to search our expatriates.

412
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:44,780
Citizens, please line up here.

413
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,840

You have no right to interfere in the affairs of our expatriates.

419
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,571
This is the Guild Hall of Yue City.

420
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:32,557
This is the place where merchants from Yue City stop for a rest.

421
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,967
Why are there so many Japanese expatriates?

422
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:38,307
I'm afraid someone is trying to cover up something.

423
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,869
Governor Pei, this man looks very much like Xu Bojun.

Mr. Watanabe.

425
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,750
This gentleman with glasses looks like the murderer we're searching for.

426
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,707
Can I check his passport?

427
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,076
Military Governor Pei, I've checked his passport. There's no problem.

Excuse me, Mr. Sakamoto. What are you doing in Beijing?

430
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,390
<i>[Kazuhiko Sakamoto]</i>
I am sorry.

431
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,700
Many of our expatriates don't understand Chinese.

432
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,803
They don't understand what you say.

433
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,210
Everyone, go outside.

Ban Ben He Yan.

435
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:00,510
This Mr. Sakamoto doesn't look like he doesn't understand Chinese.

436
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,120
And your Japanese name is not pronounced like that.

437
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,816
Don't pretend you can't understand Chinese. Come out and let's have a talk.

438
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,390
I've already said that you have no right to interfere in

439
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,130
the affairs of our expatriates.

440
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,390
This is China!

441
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:18,300
There's an important criminal amongst your expatriates! I have the right to interfere!

442
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,910
You can try.

443
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,383
You're right. This is China.

444
00:28:35,383 --> 00:28:39,433
So our Japanese citizens enjoy consular jurisdiction

445
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:41,280
and diplomatic immunity,

446
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,790
and you have no right to search them.

447
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:51,136
And I… Even if I shoot you dead now,

448
00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:54,120
you have no right to prosecute me.

449

Assistant Staff Officer.

450
00:29:10,846 --> 00:29:12,726
Put the guns down!

451
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,099
Governor Pei.

452
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,985
Look. I dare to point a gun at you.

453
00:29:27,985 --> 00:29:31,950
But your soldiers don't dare to point a gun at me.

454
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,642
You feel it isn't fair, right?

455
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:38,110
Well, I think so as well. But I'm sorry.

456
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,335
This is what your government allows.

457
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:45,580
You Chinese have to be inferior to us

458
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,260
in your own land.

459
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,660
Everyone, tell them to get in the car quickly.

460
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,883
Hurry up!

461
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,160
<i>[The Guild Hall of Yue City]</i>

462
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,723
Military Governor Pei, I'm done with my business.

463
00:30:34,723 --> 00:30:38,690
You can start your search. Excuse me.

464
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,838
Governor, will we just let them go like that?

465
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:09,973
What else can I do?

466
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,340
Do you want me to use force against the Japanese?

467
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,610
They must be going to the Japanese Concession in Tianjin now.

468
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,896
We can set up a roadblock on the road to intercept them now.

469
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:24,723
If Xu Bojun really enters the concession, then it'll be too late for everything.

470
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:27,626
Commander Tan.

471
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,490
This is my territory.

472
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,840
It's not your place to tell me what to do.

473
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,683
Governor, I don't mean to overstep my bounds.

474
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:43,260
But you also know that Xu Bojun has already started moving his troops.

475
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,960
If you let him go like this, this matter…

476
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,060
I'm afraid it will be difficult to resolve peacefully.

477
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:53,385
Don't worry. I've seen it all coming.

478
00:31:53,385 --> 00:31:56,910
I've moved my troops from the south to the Yangtze river

479
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,140
to surround the Xu Army.

480
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,163
If he dares to make a move, I'll go to war with him.

481
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:06,990
Don't worry, Governor. We've never been afraid to fight Military Governor Xu's army.

482
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,550
Not to mention, north of the Yangtze River is our territory,

483
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,480
and we have all the advantages of the time and place.

484
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,940
That's right. Once Xu Bojun's scandal comes to light,

485
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,580
the public opinion will drown him.

486
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:16,780
If he dares to provoke us

487
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,370
we'll even have a better reason for waging a war.

488
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,020
I know you boys are ready to fight.

489
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,450
Unless Xu Bojun hands over his power obediently and steps down,

490
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,830
the area around the Hangu Pass

491
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,750
will be the place where his army falls.

492
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,330
- We'll observe the governor's instruction.
- Good.

493
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,694
Let's go.

494
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,700
<i>[The Supreme Court of Beijing]</i>

495
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,345
Xuanlin, how's it going?

496
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,640
Did you catch Xu Bojun?

497
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,368
I'm sorry.

498
00:33:04,903 --> 00:33:06,667
He got away.

499
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,243
It's okay.

500
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:14,300
You have let everyone know the truth.

501
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,280
My brother has also been cleared of his grievances.

502
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,770
But I still haven't been able to give you true justice.

503
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,280
You have done a good job.

504
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,380
Mr. Liao.

505
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,660
Min Dacheng has gone to press his handprint.

506
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,230
When the verdict is announced, you can take him back to Shanghai.

507
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,489
Thank you, Mr. Liao.

508
00:33:38,489 --> 00:33:40,495
Thank you for your help.

509
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:42,295
Don't mention it.

510
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,590
I heard that

511
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,860
Xu Bojun got away?

512
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,650
The Japanese Consulate took him away from under our nose

513
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,940
on the pretext of protecting the expatriates.

514
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,200
The Japanese Consul

515
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,443
pressured us with diplomatic immunity and consular jurisdiction.

516
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:06,906
I watched Xu Bojun get in the car of the Japanese consulate.

517
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:08,323
And I could do nothing about it.

518
00:34:08,323 --> 00:34:09,940
That's not your fault.

519
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,280
Even Pei Xun didn't dare to stand up to the Japanese.

520
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,930
There is nothing anyone can do about it.

521
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,056
The Japanese Consul also said that

522
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:20,940
we Chinese are inferior to them in our own country.

523
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,650
Why is that, Mr. Liao?

524
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,075
Pei Xun had so many soldiers with him.

525
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:26,940
Yet he didn't even dare to point a gun at the Japanese.

526
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,000
Mr. Liao, why has our country become like this?

527
00:34:33,776 --> 00:34:35,759
Our revolution

528
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,690
is to bring down the great powers,

529
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,074
to get rid of the military governors,

530
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:42,470
and to make China different from what it is now.

531
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,790
Now, I really don't know

532
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,300
if all this trouble I've gone through

533
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,380
was right or wrong.

534
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,250
You've brought the truth to light.

535
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,510
How can it be wrong?

536
00:34:56,822 --> 00:34:58,289
Yes…

537
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,630
Pei Xun and Xu Bojun

538
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,923
are ready to go to war.

539
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:07,980
Once Xu Bojun refuses to step down,

540
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,350
there will be a battle between the Pei and Xu Family.

541
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,580
By then, how many soldiers and people will have to die in vain?

542
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,500
I'm the one who started this war.

543
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,420
And they're the ones who have to bear the consequences.

544
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,592
Do you think I'm right or wrong?

545
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,060
Xuanlin... the two who will bring suffering to the people

546
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,354
and let soldiers die in vain,

547
00:35:34,354 --> 00:35:36,570
are Pei Xun and Xu Bojun,

548
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,339
not you.

549
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,250
But this age of deceit and bloodshed

550
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:48,900
will wrap every one of us in it.

551
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,720
No eggs can remain unbroken when the nest is upset.

552
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,620
So not one of us can detach himself from the world.

553
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,179
Please.

554
00:36:35,482 --> 00:36:39,448
Governor Xu, this is the Japanese Concession.

555
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:43,065
This yard is the consulate's own property.

556
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:44,629
It's safe here.

557
00:36:44,629 --> 00:36:46,905
- Please.
- Okay.

558
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:50,060
You can rest here.

559
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,220
I'll send someone to bring Xu Yuan back as soon as possible.

560
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:59,520
Thank you, Mr. Watanabe, for saving my day.

561
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,730
I can't thank you enough.

562
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,330
You and I have been friends for many years.

563
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:09,543
We don't see each other as often, but President Yamashita told me that

564
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:13,465
these past few years, you've done a lot for us.

565
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,880
So there's no need for us to be so polite to each other.

566
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,390
But there is something

567
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,070
I think would be interested to know.

568
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,740
Mr. Watanabe, please go ahead.

569
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:29,649
Your son and Pei Xun's son were classmates

570
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:31,520
when they studied in Japan.

571
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,890
A few days ago,

572
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:37,040
your son went to the Military Governor's mansion to visit Mr. Pei.

573
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,360
But they shut the door on him.

574
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,260
According to his servants, Mr. Pei is under house arrest

575
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,720
for ruining the Pei family's arms smuggling business.

576
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,090
But I have heard from other sources that

577
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,450
the truth is

578
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,560
the person who ruined the Pei family's arms smuggling business

579
00:37:55,563 --> 00:37:59,030
was not Mr. Pei, but your son,

580
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,060
Xu Guangyao.

581
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,922
Guangyao?

582
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,420
It seems that

583
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,070
your son didn't tell you about this.

584
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,650
I was thinking…

585
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:16,870
Mr. Pei got locked up just after he returned from Shanghai.

586
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:21,120
Then Pei Xun started to turn against you.

587
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,640
Does all this have something to do with the Pei family's business?

588
00:38:26,235 --> 00:38:27,726
Also,

589
00:38:27,726 --> 00:38:30,986
did your son find out something questionable?

590
00:38:30,986 --> 00:38:35,871
And that's why he didn't say anything to you?

591
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,612
You've been of a lot of help

592
00:38:47,612 --> 00:38:49,469
in bringing down Xu Bojun this time.

593
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,570
But you have a murder case on you after all.

594
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,105
So… if I take you back to Shanghai,

595
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:56,873
even if you don't get the death penalty,

596
00:38:56,873 --> 00:38:59,113
you'll be sentenced to life imprisonment.

597
00:38:59,113 --> 00:39:01,350
If you leave now,

598
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,815
maybe you can still live in anonymity for the rest of your life.

599
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:06,738
It's your choice.

600
00:39:06,738 --> 00:39:08,388
Actually,

601
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:13,110
my life has been a torment for me.

602
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,870
If it weren't for bringing down Xu Bojun,

603
00:39:16,513 --> 00:39:19,380
I might not have decided to live to this day.

604
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,770
Don't worry.

605
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,633
Mu Wanting's now living in Hong Kong.

606
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:26,773
And I'll make sure she leads a good life.

607
00:39:26,773 --> 00:39:29,717
You are the last person I trust in my life.

608
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,050
I hope I didn't trust the wrong person.

609
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:36,674
Commander Tan,

610
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:40,870
I may appear to be the boss of a gang,

611
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:46,216
but after all, I was just a puppet in Xu Bojun's hands.

612
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,010
Over the years,

613
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,520
I've never been able to decide on anything on my own.

614
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,450
I'm tired of

615
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,890
living in this kind of darkness.

616
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,310
Actually, compared to prolonging my life

617
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,230
and living in anonymity,

618
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:07,040
I think being able to decide one's own life and death

619
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,553
would be much of a blessing.

620
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,523
I used to be a soldier as well.

621
00:40:16,523 --> 00:40:18,360
If it's possible,

622
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,963
I would like to choose to end my life in a military fashion.

623
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,280
You won't regret trusting me.

624
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,283
In the suburbs of Beijing, find a suitable place

625
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:18,068
to bury him.

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,360
♫ <i> I immediately saw your charming face </i> ♫

643
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,780
♫ <i> To the endless sky and ocean </i> ♫

644
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,260
♫ <i> I made a promise </i> ♫

645
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:59,420
♫ <i> Let’s let the mortals fall down with us </i> ♫

646
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,320
♫ <i> If I forget your profile </i> ♫

647
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,180
♫ <i> How would I put back together </i> ♫

648
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,860
♫ <i> The memories that revived me </i> ♫

649

♫ <i> Let’s embrace either during the sunrise of sunset </i> ♫

650
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,720
♫ <i> I have exhausted myself in this life </i> ♫

651
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,360
♫ <i> My whole life has become lonely </i> ♫

652
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,760
♫ <i> Even if my vision is blurred and I can’t clearly see </i> ♫

653
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:35,980
♫ <i> I’ll still sing with you on horseback </i> ♫
