15
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,000
Good evening, everyone.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're all here today for my sake.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,700
I know I am young and successful,

18
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,000
and it was because of Governor Xu's care for me

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,300
that I was able to become the Defense Commander of Shanghai.

20
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,000
Rumor has it that I am the "youngest King of Shanghai,"

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,500
but I don't think so.

22
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,200
In fact, I am serving everyone here today,

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,500
to help you live a peaceful life

24
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,800
and do business smoothly.

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,400
It's my responsibility to do that as the commander.

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,900
He got promoted because of the Mu Family.

27
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,400
Now, when he holds a party,

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,400
we actually have to come to attend it.

29
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,200
It's quite ridiculous.

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,900
The situation is quite different now.

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
I believe this is also what the Governor's family

32
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,700
and what Governor Xu wants.

33
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,500
Only when Shanghai is stable,

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,300
can we focus on dealing with the Southern government.

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,700
Supervisor Xu, I guess you have something to say.

36
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,700
Come.

37
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,200
Let's give him a round of applause.

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,500
Mr. Chen, you made me drink.

39
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm not drinking anymore. I'm not drinking.

40
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,800
<i>Why does that guy have a gun on him?</i>

41
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,600
Commander Tan's words touched me deeply.

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,200
Among all the commanders managing Shanghai,

43
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,100
Commander Tan is the only one who publicly stated

44
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,100
that he wants to serve the business community.

45
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,300
I'm sure you can turn to the headquarters for help,

46
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,200
if you have any problems.

47
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,000
I believe that Commander Tan will help you in any way he can.

48
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,900
We have a problem right now

49
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,400
and we need Commander Tan to help us.

50
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,800
Go ahead, Junior Marshal Su.

51
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,100
We all know that my family

52
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,200
runs a loading dock in Shanghai.

53
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,400
Recently, due to the ongoing turmoil and war,

54
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,200
more than half of the workers left Shanghai for their hometowns

55
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,800
so a very large workforce is needed.

56
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,200
It's widely known that Commander Tan's army

57
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
is awaiting demobilization.

58
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,700
I have an idea.

59
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,800
Why don't you use them as labor?

60
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,200
This way, they'll have stable jobs.

61
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,000
I volunteer to work with Junior Marshal Su

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,600
and undertake the heavy task of

63
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,000
handling the placement of Commander Tan's soldiers.

64
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,700
What do you think, Commander Tan?

65
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,000
Junior Marshal Su. Junior Marshal Pei.

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,300
I'm very touched

67
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,800
that you are willing to share the burden for me.

68
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,300
However, my soldiers have been following me for over ten years.

69
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,200
I want to give them better jobs.

70
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,100
Commander Tan, you've set your standard so high.

71
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Do you want all of your men to be commanders?

72
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,700
Commander Tan, you don't accept others' help

73
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,100
and you're unwilling to tell us your plan.

74
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,200
You don't plan to put it off forever, right?

75
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,800
How is that possible?

76
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,600
Supervisor Xu, I will do what I've promised.

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Commander Tan,

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,500
you are the first defense officer in Shanghai

79
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,600
who has a private army.

80
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,800
To tell you the truth,

81
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,100
if an army has no plans

82
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,200
and only takes orders from you, who always stays in Shanghai,

83
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,800
and not take Supervisor Xu's orders,

84
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,700
we should be very worried.

85
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,400
No matter how strict you are, you can't guarantee

86
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,800
that all of your soldiers won't rebel and cause trouble.

87
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,500
So, we'd like you to give us a deadline.

88
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,800
You can give us a deadline so that we can be witnesses.

89
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,700
Everyone,

90
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,800
why does it sound like you don't trust me?

91
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,700
Then who are you guarding against, with your private army?

92
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,300
Who can I guard against?

93
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Then do what we've asked.

94
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Give us a deadline.

95
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,500
Supervisor Xu, you're forcing me.

96
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,400
I wouldn't dare.

97
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,100
I learned it from you.

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,100
There's a man with a gun. You must protect Commander Tan.

99
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,100
- Miss Wanqing, are you sure?
- I saw it with my own eyes.

100
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,600
What are you doing?

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Tan Si, what's going on?

102
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,100
It's nothing, Commander. It was just a misunderstanding.

103
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,500
Miss Wanqing, you must've seen things.

104
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,700
That's impossible. I felt the gun, too.

105
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,500
Could it be…

106
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,800
People, there's no need to panic.

107
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,000
It was all just a misunderstanding.

108
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,100
We just want a deadline.

109
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,000
Commander Tan, you don't have to struggle.

110
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,300
Fine.

111
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,500
Since you've all asked me to give you a deadline,

112
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,300
today, I promise

113
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,200
to demobilize all my soldiers

114
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,980
by the end of the year.

115
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,200
Supervisor Xu,

116
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
these soldiers have been following me for ten years.

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
I want to spend the Spring Festival with them.

118
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,000
It isn't too much, is it?

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,900
Now, it's twenty days before the Spring Festival.

120
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,800
Commander Tan,

121
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,600
I hope you won't forget the promise you made today.

122
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,200
<i>Come in, please.</i>

Drop the gun or I'll shoot her.

Put your gun down. Let's talk.

131

Put the gun down,

Stay here. Don't move.

138
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,800
Wait till I come back.

139
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,100
Let her go, and we'll let you go.

140
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Shut up! Tell your men to get out of the way.

141

Go!

I want to save her.

167
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,750
Let's go to the guest room.

168
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,307
Oh my god!

169
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,723
Old Pei, you've finished before I can do anything.

170
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,256
Watch out!

171
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,685
Hello. I would like to ask you about two young men who just went upstairs.

172
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:58,236
One of them is very handsome.

173
00:14:58,236 --> 00:15:00,570
What floor did they go to?

174
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,543
The third floor?

175
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,903
Thank you.

176
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,230
Okay. This is it.

177
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,465
Commander, we're on the fourth floor.

178
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,083
I'll be fine.

179
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,263
I'm here.

180
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:56,846
- Brother Guangyao.
- I'm here. Let go of her,

181
00:15:56,846 --> 00:15:59,766
and talk to me about anything you want.

182
00:16:00,797 --> 00:16:02,357
Stop!

183
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:04,857
Stay right here!

184
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:07,036
Isn't it me you want to kill?

185
00:16:07,036 --> 00:16:09,210
I'm right in front of you.

186
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,943
- Trade me for her.
- No!

187
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:13,530
- How about it?
- No!

188
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,883
Fine. Put the gun down first.

189
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,654
- Put it down!
- No!

190
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,476
No!

191
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:35,256
Kick it here.

192
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,510
Can you replace her with me now?

193
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,029
- Brother Guangyao!
- Don't move!

194
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:27,226
If you move again, I'll shoot you.

195
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:18,963
It's over.

196
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,930
With you around, I didn't need to do anything.

197
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,867
You handled everything yourself.

198
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:29,830
Second-guesser.

199
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:41,603
Junior Marshal Pei!

200
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,060
I sprained my ankle.

201
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,003
I can't walk anymore.

202
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:53,233
Junior Marshal Pei,

203
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:56,130
how could you just leave me here alone?

204
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,376
I sprained my ankle. I came here for you, so how can you leave without me?

205
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:02,260
If someone suddenly comes out and kills me,

206
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,950
I will blame you for my death.

207
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,450
I will not let you go even if I become a ghost.

208
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:09,930
Junior Marshal Pei!

209
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,376
You…

210
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,040
You saved my life again.

211
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,077
Have we met before?

212
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:22,276
We met in Beijing. At the student demonstration.

213
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:25,520
You were high-spirited and vigorous at that time.

214
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,710
You looked so bright in the crowd.

215
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,780
At that time, I decided that I must meet you.

216
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:35,043
Hey, Old Pei.

217
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:55,300
Junior Marshal Pei, I sprained my ankle.

218
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,700
Old Pei, how can you be so serious?

219
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,490
Couldn't you see me when I was standing here?

220
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:05,417
Why is your face so red?

221
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:09,690
Was the fight... very tiring?

222
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,570
You're Commander Tan's biological younger sister after all.

223
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,130
You both like to lie.

224
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,636
You...

225
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,330
I'm telling you.

226
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,010
You can insult me, but you can't insult my brother.

227
00:21:42,597 --> 00:21:45,787
You were a lot more enthusiastic before,

228
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:48,563
but now you're not kind at all.

229
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,515
Junior Marshal Pei!

230
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,330
Junior Marshal Pei!

231
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,430
Stop following him.

232
00:21:59,516 --> 00:22:04,286
I haven't gotten over it. Why haven't you been so enthusiastic to me before?

233
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,443
- Young Uncle.
- Brother Guangyao.

234
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:16,790
- Are you all right?
- Young Uncle, are you all right?

235
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,312
- I'm all right.
- Guangyao.

236
00:22:19,312 --> 00:22:21,430
You... What happened to your arm?

237
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,166
I'm fine. It's just a little skin trauma. Bandaging it up will be enough.

238
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:29,276
Supervisor Xu, leave everything to me.

239
00:22:29,276 --> 00:22:32,970
Xu Cheng, take Supervisor Xu to take care of his wound.

240
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,570
Commander Tan, thank you.

241
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,310
My pleasure.

242
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,880
Brother Guangyao.

243
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,630
Miss Gu.

244
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,483
Commander Tan, thank you for your aid.

245
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:53,693
My daughter is now safe and sound. Thank you.

246
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:55,800
Mr. Mu, you are welcome.

247
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,510
Today, I must thank Miss Wanqing. She found the assassin in time and pushed him away.

248
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,930
Otherwise, many people would have been hurt.

249
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,600
Mr. Mu, since Miss Wanqing is the first witness,

250
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,290
I'll need her testimony during the interrogation.

251
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,450
Can you allow her to stay?

252
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:14,379
It's of great importance. So she should cooperate.

253
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:18,560
Commander Tan, while you interrogate the assassin,

254
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,980
please take care of my daughter and help her remain calm.

255
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,916
Rest assured. I'll take care of Miss Wanqing.

256
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,585
Thank you.

257
00:23:30,663 --> 00:23:33,396
Shuang'er, you should go home first.

258
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:36,729
- Okay. Please stay safe.
- Of course.

259
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,230
Commander.

260
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:46,946
- Where's Joseph?
- He's being held on the first floor.

261
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,900
Let's go talk with him.

262
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,580
You've been crying a lot. Were you scared?

263
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,403
Who says I was crying?

264
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:57,920
You wiped your tears on another and you say you didn't?

265
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,930
Can't you…

266
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,030
Did I hurt you?

267
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:06,190
It doesn't matter. Let's go.

268
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,840
Why didn't you tell me just now? You're hurt.

269
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,740
Well… I saw you tending to Xu Guangyao.

270
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,086
Besides, it's just a little wound. I'll just take care of it myself. Let's go.

271
00:24:28,086 --> 00:24:32,990
I'll go get some alcohol and bandages from the hotel.

272
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,627
No…

273
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,050
You go first.

274
00:24:54,852 --> 00:24:57,232
You need to take your clothes off.

275
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,870
You dare not look at me. How can you dress my wound?

276
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,290
Who said I don't dare to look at you?

277
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,274
Fine.

278
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,470
Forget it. There are too many scars, I don't want to scare you.

279
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,803
- I'll ask Tan Si–
- It won't. Sit still.

280
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,740
It'll hurt. Endure it.

281
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,451
Okay.

282
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,460
Those injuries caused you more pain, didn't they?

283
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,000
It's fine.

284
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,560
You have so many wounds.

285
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,590
You must have taken the lead in battles. Were you afraid of dying?

286
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:35,019
I had brothers behind me. I had to stay strong.

287
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:38,756
I was their junior marshal. I had to protect them.

288
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,380
<i>No wonder his soldiers have been loyal to him</i>

289
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,950
<i>and keep fighting together with him even though he's young.</i>

290
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:51,747
You protect them. But who protects you?

291
00:26:51,747 --> 00:26:54,382
I'm lucky. Nothing will happen to me.

292
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,170
Do you see this wound?

293
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,360
I got it when I was fifteen years old.

294
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,150
Fifteen?

295
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,840
Do you know what it's like getting shot?

296
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:32,820
To be honest, it's kind of fun.

297
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,780
At first, you won't feel the pain.

298
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,425
It felt like I had been hit hard by something.

299
00:27:38,425 --> 00:27:42,048
It felt very numb and hot.

300
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,160
If it weren't for the bleeding, you wouldn't know that you'd been shot.

301
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,360
But after a few seconds, you feel a sharp pain.

302
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:56,476
You have no idea what it's like.

303
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,070
At the time, I could even smell the bullet hole.

304
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,930
It smelt like... like barbecue.

305
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:11,790
How did you get through it?

306
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,152
As time passed, I got used to the pain.

307
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,280
Get ready.

308
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,895
All right.

309
00:29:15,483 --> 00:29:17,476
Do you want my life?

310
00:29:17,476 --> 00:29:20,026
Who would want your life?

311
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:29,930
Since you don't want my life,

312
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,943
do you want my body?

313
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,290
Be gentler!

314
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,120
I can't be too nice to you.

315
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,740
<i>[St. John's Hospital]</i>

316
00:30:08,277 --> 00:30:10,457
Your bones need to heal. Remember to take your medicine.

317
00:30:10,457 --> 00:30:12,110
Don't get water on your wound.

318
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,795
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

319
00:30:14,795 --> 00:30:16,510
Thank you.

320
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:23,013
Your relationship with this Miss Mu is such a mess.

321
00:30:23,013 --> 00:30:28,110
She was held hostage because of you, and you got hurt for her.

322
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,640
Guangyao, where was the assassin from?

323
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:38,363
He was shot by Commander Tan before I could speak to him.

324
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:41,336
But the assassin had two other accomplices.

325
00:30:41,336 --> 00:30:44,080
They are now being held by Commander Tan for questioning.

326
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,539
Should we go and question them, too?

327
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:49,079
Sure.

328
00:30:49,773 --> 00:30:52,953
- Mr. Joseph.
- Commander Tan.

329
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:57,910
I really don't know how this happened. Both of my followers are new employees.

330
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,746
This whole thing has nothing to do with me.

331
00:31:00,746 --> 00:31:03,680
So those two attendants were new employees.

332
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:10,836
- Supervisor Xu.
- Commander Tan, were you able to extract any information?

333
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:15,156
Supervisor Xu, Mr. Joseph said he had nothing to do with it.

334
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:17,560
I think it'll be better for us to question them separately.

335
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,740
I'll interrogate the attendant with Guangyao.

336
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,530
After all, Joseph is a celebrity.

337
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:26,290
It would be better if you ask him yourself.

338
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:37,243
Junior Marshals, I don't want to bother you with the interrogations.

339
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:41,900
You hosted a party tonight, but assassins showed up.

340
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,570
People are criticizing the security at the headquarters.

341
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,600
If you interrogate them alone, I'm afraid someone will make use of it.

342
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,200
Yes. If we can interrogate and be witnesses, you can avoid further complications.

343
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,740
Commander Tan doesn't believe us, but we still have a ghost in our hearts.

344
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,910
I'm an honest person. I have nothing to be afraid of.

345
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,010
If you want to interrogate, just do it. I'd love to be free of the burden.

346
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,230
Okay.

347
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,090
- Xu Cheng.
- Yes.

348
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,676
Take the assassin to the room next door.

349
00:32:16,676 --> 00:32:19,402
Yes. Take him away!

350
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:32,263
Open the door.

351
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:42,599
Guangyao, do you know why I want to interrogate him?

352
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:47,153
Are you afraid Tan Xuanlin will cheat and get himself off the hook?

353
00:32:47,153 --> 00:32:48,410
You're right about one of the reasons.

354
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,800
What's the other reason?

355
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,510
Old Su and I were both here tonight. Tan Xuanlin has always been cunning.

356
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:58,559
I was afraid he would pin it on the Su Family and my family.

357
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,793
We have to be vigilant against him.

358
00:33:00,793 --> 00:33:03,160
Old Pei, you're very considerate.

359
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,960
We do have to be careful when facing bandits like Tan Xuanlin.

360
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,385
In the end, we must thoroughly investigate the whole thing.

361
00:33:11,385 --> 00:33:14,950
We can't give anyone the opportunity to make an issue of it.

362
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:19,379
Commander Tan, when will you let me go?

363
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:21,579
Mr. Joseph, I'm so sorry.

364
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:23,989
I know what happened tonight has nothing to do with you.

365
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:25,999
So, I'll call for someone to drive you home right now.

366
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:28,340
Do... do you mean I can go now?

367
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,595
Of course. Tan Si, have someone drive Mr. Joseph home.

368
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:35,135
- Say hello to his wife for me.
- Yes.

369
00:33:35,135 --> 00:33:37,590
Commander Tan, since you knew I was not behind this,

370
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,240
why did you still hold me here?

371
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,160
The assassins tried to kill the son of Governor Xu,

372
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,636
so I had to hold you and go through the motions. I'm really sorry.

373
00:33:47,636 --> 00:33:51,216
But... you could have told me beforehand.

374
00:33:51,216 --> 00:33:54,066
Were you playing with me?

375
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,940
Mr. Joseph, this way, please.

376
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:16,536
You clearly knew that Joseph wasn't behind the scenes, but you pretended to interrogate him.

377
00:34:16,536 --> 00:34:19,720
Were you deliberately acting in front of Brother Guangyao?

378
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:22,503
You guessed it again.

379
00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:24,400
Brother Guangyao is a gentleman.

380
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,626
Don't play those dirty tricks on him.

381
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:30,173
How can you say they are dirty tricks?

382
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:34,573
Let me tell you. I was acting for your sake today.

383
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,576
- For my sake?
- Yes.

384
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:40,490
Although you and Xu Guangyao are childhood friends,

385
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,310
you've not seen each other for over ten years.

386
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,296
A man's mind is unpredictable.

387
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:46,116
Besides, you're his secretary now.

388
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:48,264
If I didn't test him,

389
00:34:48,264 --> 00:34:51,470
how could I let you stay with him?

390
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,959
You're being unreasonable.

391
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,009
If I really find something

392
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:58,940
that can prove Xu Guangyao is a hypocrite,

393
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,179
then I'll be more than relieved.

394
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:02,257
What do you mean?

395
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,605
At least,

396
00:35:05,202 --> 00:35:08,836
you wouldn't choose him over me. Right?

397
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:11,427
It's none of your business.

398
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,463
I'm talking about sides.

399
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:17,746
See? You misunderstood me again.

400
00:35:19,426 --> 00:35:22,216
You're always fantasizing about me.

401
00:35:22,216 --> 00:35:24,670
I only want to do one thing right now.

402
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,350
It's to sew your mouth together.

403
00:35:31,486 --> 00:35:35,296
Did you mean Commander Tan sent you to assassinate me?

404
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,111
That's right. It was him.

405
00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:40,579
We owed him,

406
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:43,059
and we were supposed to be loyal to him.

407
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:45,330
But when one of my partners failed an assassination,

408
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:49,470
he actually shot my partner to cover his tracks.

409
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,820
He even tried to kill me to avoid further problems.

410
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,768
Since he is unkind, he can't blame me for being unkind to him.

411
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:01,549
Guangyao, I told you that Tan Xuanlin must be behind this.

412
00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:05,956
He is so unlucky.

413
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:08,333
He deserves it.

414
00:36:11,257 --> 00:36:14,190
Junior Marshal, this was all I could find.

415
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,400
<i>[Military Government of Guangzhou in the Republic of China, General Check]</i>

416
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,842
Guangyao, should we report to your father right away?

417
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:46,336
Let's go see Commander Tan's interrogation.

418
00:36:51,863 --> 00:36:54,379
Commander Tan, where's Joseph?

419
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,190
We have wronged him.

420
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:00,136
Joseph had nothing to do with what happened tonight, so I let him go.

421
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:02,840
It wasn't Joseph indeed.

422
00:37:04,126 --> 00:37:06,746
This brat has already made a confession.

423
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,223
You.

424
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:14,727
Repeat what you just said.

425
00:37:19,563 --> 00:37:21,103
That's right.

426
00:37:21,103 --> 00:37:24,922
That's him. Commander Tan. It's him!

427
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,500
You can't blame him.

428
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,550
You can only blame the man who ordered him around.

429
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,230
He's too stupid.

430
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,106
What do you think, Commander Tan?

431
00:37:34,106 --> 00:37:36,480
Do you want to say something?

432
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,680
I have nothing to say.

433
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,143
You condemn me because of a thug's words.

434
00:37:43,143 --> 00:37:45,342
What else can I say?

435
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,300
I don't think Commander Tan would be so stupid.

436
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,626
Who would carry out an assassination at his own victory party?

437
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,730
Commander Tan,

438
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,200
now that his life is in your hands,

439
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,750
he doesn't have to slander you. Does he?

440
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,876
It must be because you wanted to kill him to hide something.

441
00:38:04,876 --> 00:38:09,043
He was so desperate, that he gave you away.

442
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,166
Brother Guangyao, when his partner tried to shoot you,

443
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,230
Commander Tan rushed forward and saved you.

444
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,536
We were all there.

445
00:38:17,536 --> 00:38:19,860
What if he knew the assassination would fail

446
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,063
and decided to save Guangyao on the spur-of-the-moment

447
00:38:22,063 --> 00:38:24,530
in an attempt to clear his name?

448
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,478
Supervisor Xu,

449
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:33,451
what do you think?

450
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,850
Before we jump to conclusions,

451
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,000
I'd like to show you all something.

452
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,330
- Xu Cheng.
- Yes.

453
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,116
Give me the money.

454
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,777
<i>[Military Government of Guangzhou in the Republic of China, General Check]</i>

455
00:38:53,777 --> 00:38:55,150
This is a Cantonese check.

456
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:58,380
Look at the issue date. It was issued this year.

457
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,869
I'm curious why, as an attendant of a Jewish merchant in Shanghai,

458
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:06,246
you would carry Cantonese checks that can only be used thousands of miles away?

459
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,283
I…

460
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:12,289
I went on a business trip to Guangzhou.

461
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:17,030
You just said yourself that you just came back from America.

462
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:20,696
As soon as you came back, you went to work as a clerk in Joseph's foreign firm.

463
00:39:20,696 --> 00:39:22,560
If you went a few years ago,

464
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,159
why do you have Cantonese banknotes issued this year?

465
00:39:30,446 --> 00:39:34,356
So, you didn't return from America after studying there.

466
00:39:34,356 --> 00:39:36,610
You lied to Joseph.

467
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,140
You were sent by the Southern government.

468
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,170
You created a fake identity and a fake resume.

469
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,960
Also, you exchanged your Cantonese checks for silver dollars and Shanghai checks

470
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,875
so that you could easily use them in Shanghai.

471
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,705
But the reason why you left a few Cantonese banknotes

472
00:39:58,705 --> 00:40:02,870
is so you could take the train back to Guangzhou after the assassination.

473
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:07,350
You would need Cantonese banknotes and change for the rickshaw.

474
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:11,000
You wouldn't be able to exchange silver dollars or use Shanghai banknotes there.

475
00:40:11,628 --> 00:40:13,495
Am I right?

476
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,600
Well said.

477
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,460
You deserve to be called a student of Baoding Military Academy.

478
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,900
I really admire you.

479
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:34,816
Commander Tan, are you actually in the mood to make jokes right now?

480
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:39,226
If it wasn't for the Cantonese banknote, you would still be a suspect.

481
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:43,825
I believe you won't treat me wrongly.

482
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,840
Junior Marshal, he's already dead.

483
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,756
- Take him away.
- Yes.

484
00:41:03,756 --> 00:41:05,350
Come here!

485
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,577
Good for you.

486
00:41:15,577 --> 00:41:16,936
We can't get his testimony anymore.

487
00:41:16,936 --> 00:41:21,430
It's obvious. It was the Southern government that sent those assassins.

488
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:24,710
The plotter behind it is trying to drive a wedge between us and the Governor's mansion.

489
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:29,316
The prisoner died without telling us who was behind it.

490
00:41:29,316 --> 00:41:31,530
Besides, we don't know…

491
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,670
I'll try to find out who was behind it.

492
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:41,249
I believe that this has nothing to do with Commander Tan.

493
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:48,570
I believe you, Supervisor Xu.

494
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:52,050
You're not like the others who slandered me

495
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:55,160
- without finding proof.
- You!

496
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,230
Brother Guangyao, your arm is hurt. You should go home and rest.

497
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,835
Okay. Let's leave together.

498
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:06,380
Supervisor Xu, Miss Mu hasn't finished her statement yet.

499
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,678
She can't leave yet.

500
00:42:08,678 --> 00:42:12,402
- Don't worry. I'll go home when I finish the statement.
- But…

501
00:42:12,402 --> 00:42:17,190
Rest assured. I'll drive her home safely.
