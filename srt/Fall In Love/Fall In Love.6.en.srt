23
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:27,720
Since you promised to protect me,

24
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,119
I will return the favor.

25
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,839
Cui Jie?

26
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,439
This is my nephew.

27
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,226
What did you do this time?

28
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:46,603
Uncle, when Miss Mu was

29
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:50,239
at her mother's grave yesterday, he broke into Fayuan Temple

30
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,516
and tried to do something indecent.

31
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:54,796
What? You!

32
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:57,086
He said he worked for Mrs. Mu.

33
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:59,836
And that Mrs. Mu ordered him to do that.

34
00:02:59,836 --> 00:03:01,245
M-Me?

35
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:03,910
It pertains to Mrs. Mu's reputation, so I brought him here

36
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,898
and am handing him over to you for questioning.

37
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,280
What's wrong with you? When did I let you go to Fayuan Temple?

38
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,020
How can you do such a heartless and evil thing?

39
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,839
Do you have a conscience? You!

40
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:21,765
You bastard!

41
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:24,053
Even a dog won't bite its owner.

42
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:27,490
Guangyao, I'll leave this thing to you.

43
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,150
Beat or punish him as you wish.

44
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:30,520
This has nothing to do with the Mu family.

45
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,540
Uncle! Uncle! Why would you think that I would do that?

46
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,539
I would never do such a thing!

47
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:40,336
I… I wouldn't do that! It's as if a toad tried to swallow a swan!

48
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,940
Wait...

49
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,919
Cousin Wanting said…

50
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,059
- She said…
- What did she say?

51
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:55,633
She said that my aunt intended for me to marry Miss Mu.

52
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,956
And so she asked me to go to Fayuan Temple to meet Miss Mu.

53
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:02,643
She said if I was fond of her, that I could molest her.

54
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,490
Me?

55
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,830
What I said is true! Help me! Help! Aunt, help me.

56
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,659
Really! Cousin Wanting really said this to me!

57
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:14,150
No!

58
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,646
Is he telling the truth?

59
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:20,750
Sir, do you think I could possibly say that?

60
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:25,048
- Go and bring Wanting here.
- Go!

61
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,663
Wanting.

62
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:47,820
Yesterday, this bastard snuck into Fayuan Temple

63
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,745
and tried to rape Wanqing.

64
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:52,726
He said that you told him to go there. Is that true?

65
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,479
I-I didn't.

66
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,640
Cousin, how could you say that? I didn't do anything wrong to you!

67
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,489
How could you say that?

68
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:01,634
But you did tell me that!

69
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,975
You said… You said that Aunt intended to have Miss Mu marry me.

70
00:05:04,975 --> 00:05:07,639
You told me to go to Fayuan Temple to meet her.

71
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,497
And if I liked her, I could rape her.

72
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,660
What are you talking about?

73
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,095
Father, I'm an unmarried girl. How could I let him do such a thing?

74
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:18,280
You did say that!

75
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,245
You specifically went to the Jin Casino to look for me!

76
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:23,759
<i>Young Master Cui.</i>
<i>[Check: Two Thousand Silver Dollars - Mu Wanting]</i>

77
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,703
<i>Let go of him.</i>

78
00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:28,863
<i>It's the young lady from the Mu family. She's my cousin!</i>

79
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:30,773
<i>Let's go.</i>

80
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,039
Those servants were all witnesses!

81
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,859
If you didn't tell me, how would I have known about Ms. Xiao's funeral

82
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:43,783
and that Miss Mu was there?

83
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:47,556
I did run into you at Jin Casino yesterday.

84
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,370
There, I happened to see you being chased due to debt.

85
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,515
So, I helped you pay it back.

86
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:54,612
Cousin, how can you say that about me?

87
00:05:54,612 --> 00:05:57,895
You told me Miss Mu came from Japan and grabbed your spotlight,

88
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:01,115
so you asked me to help you take revenge. Did you not tell me that?

89
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:03,154
I didn't! You're lying!

90
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,845
You! My Lord, it's all my fault.

91
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:09,259
I spoiled you too much; look at you now.

92
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:13,160
You are now behaving irrationally and saying random things.

93
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,032
But she may have just used words without thinking.

94
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:21,195
She can't do such harmful things.

95
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:27,369
You said Miss Wanting ordered you.

96
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:30,070
- Do you have any proof?
- Proof?

97
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:34,426
Yes, I do have proof. That check.

98
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:36,706
That's the evidence!

99
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,259
- Check?
- Yes.

100
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,619
Wanting,

101
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:46,752
is there such a thing?

102
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:48,617
I…

103
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:51,683
I…

104
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,440
You asked me for a check yesterday.

105
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,920
You said that one of your classmate's family members was in trouble,

106
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,185
and you wanted to help him pay off a debt.

107
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:07,535
Were you lying to me? Tell me the truth!

108
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:17,236
Father, I did bump into him yesterday.

109
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,336
But I did it because you are a part of my family.

110
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:23,166
I didn't want to see your fingers getting chopped off and our family being disgraced.

111
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,215
- That's why I helped you and didn't tell Moth–
- You brat!

112
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:29,400
Mu Wanting, you have to tell the truth or you will get me killed!

113
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,480
Do you understand? I'll get killed!

114
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,671
Please tell the truth. You said it was a reward! A reward!

115
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:35,979
- I'm not lying.
- Reward!

116
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:38,875
If you don't believe me, call the men at Jin Casino here

117
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,457
and they'll confirm it!

118
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:59,320
Wanqing.

119
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,180
It's all your father's fault. I didn't think it through.

120
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,720
I should have sent someone to go with you.

121
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,943
Of course, Wanting also has her issues.

122
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:10,880
If she hadn't said something wrong,

123
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,380
it wouldn't have given this shameless guy a chance.

124
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:20,849
For the sake of Wanting's unintentional mistake

125
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:22,920
that she also admitted to,

126
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,495
please forgive her.

127
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:26,302
Is that okay?

128
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,078
Older Sister, I didn't mean to hurt you.

129
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:36,499
I was also used by those people.

130
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:39,659
Please forgive me. Okay?

131
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,259
It's up to you, Father.

132
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,919
You shall be grounded for a month and won't be allowed to go anywhere.

133
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:11,103
Mother, thank you.

134
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:14,546
Otherwise, I wouldn't have known what to do.

135
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:18,306
Whatever you do,

136
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:20,910
you should consider the immediate consequences.

137
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,953
Do you know how dangerous things are these days?

138
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:25,840
I know. I was wrong.

139
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,760
Whatever you do in the future, don't do things by yourself.

140
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,838
Come to discuss it with me first.

141
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:36,846
But this time, that bitch got off easy.

142
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:38,360
Don't worry.

143
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,228
We have plenty of time. We will get our chance.

144
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:52,612
I can't believe

145
00:09:52,612 --> 00:09:56,113
Uncle Mu would accept those explanations so easily.

146
00:09:56,113 --> 00:10:01,158
Because in Father's mind, he can't believe Wanting would do all of that.

147
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:05,471
It would've been futile to keep trying.

148
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:08,200
I really hate that.

149
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,034
How can he not think about you?

150
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:13,559
You don't have to try and defend me.

151
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,420
When my brother died,

152
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,990
my father immediately brought Aunt Cui and Wanting home.

153
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,420
This is nothing.

154
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:25,036
I understand.

155
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:31,822
I'm worried about you staying by yourself in a family like this.

156
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:33,840
I'll help you figure something out.

157
00:10:35,726 --> 00:10:37,362
Come in!

158
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,200
Brother Guangyao,

159
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,082
I told you to give me some time. Please stop pestering me.

160
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,830
If you need more time, I'll give it to you.

161
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,520
As long as you're not afraid of running out of money,

162
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,595
I can have a longer discussion with you.

163
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,396
Brother Guangyao, thank you. Please, have a seat.

164
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:04,743
I came to see you not because of the plan,

165
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:06,572
but for another matter.

166
00:11:06,572 --> 00:11:09,040
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

167
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,396
Are you asking me to help you?

168
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:15,087
Sure.

169
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:17,246
I'll do whatever you want if it's within my abilities.

170
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:19,739
It's not a big deal.

171
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:23,099
I want Wanqing to be my foreign language secretary.

172
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,259
Wanqing has agreed to this idea.

173
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:27,839
Are there any problems with that?

174
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,519
If it's for work,

175
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,960
I'll get you a secretary

176
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,523
from the Commercial Press who can speak five languages.

177
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:37,086
Wouldn't that be better?

178
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:39,825
Wanqing excels in both Japanese and English.

179
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,639
And for the Mu family's sake,

180
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,656
if you want to make good deals with the Municipal Council in the future,

181
00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:46,586
she can also help.

182
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:48,159
You're right.

183
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,186
Okay, let Miss Mu come to work tomorrow.

184
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:55,339
If she can't work alone, I'll find her an assistant.

185
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,180
I've known her since we were young.

186
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,563
I know her very well.

187
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:03,859
I'm certain she will do her part.

188
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:05,591
I'll go and tell her right now.

189
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,920
I'll thank you for her.

190
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:13,083
Don't bother.

191
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:24,409
Who cares if you knew each other before?

194
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,196

- Good morning, Madam.
- Good morning, Uncle.

196

Good morning. Please have a seat.

197

Did you sleep well?

198
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:05,196
Eat some more. You have to go to work later.

199
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:07,003
Okay.

200
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:09,931
Sir, have some porridge.

201

Thank you.

202
00:13:11,787 --> 00:13:15,039
Guangyao, Commander Tan called just now.

203
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,596
He wants Wanting to be your foreign secretary.

204
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:21,323
All formalities have already been completed.

205
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,790
Uncle,

206
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,159
I clearly told Commander Tan to have Wanqing go.

207
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:35,613
Commander Tan said Wanqing is still mourning for her mother.

208
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:38,740
And regarding the kidnapping, he feels sorry for Wanqing.

209
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,464
So he thinks it's better to let Wanting be your foreign secretary.

210
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:44,906
Also to avoid embarrassing everyone.

211
00:13:45,873 --> 00:13:49,832
That Commander Tan. He really went back on his word.

212
00:13:54,893 --> 00:14:00,396
Guangyao, in fact, between Wanqing and Wanting,

213
00:14:00,396 --> 00:14:03,495
whoever is your secretary is fine.

214
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:06,019
As long as you think you two will cooperate well with one another.

215
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:10,344
Madam, the Command has very high requirements for a foreign language secretary.

216
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:13,457
Someone who speaks English, Japanese, and Chinese.

217
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:16,166
I'm afraid Wanting is not a good choice.

218
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:20,439
Brother Guangyao, when I was at school, it's true, I wasn't good at studying.

219
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:23,063
But now I've tried my best to catch up.

220
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,540
Besides, you don't even let me try.

221
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,019
How do you know I can't do it?

222
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:29,070
Miss Wanting,

223
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,050
this is a job, not a game.

224
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,080
Guangyao, you probably do not know.

225
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,230
Once Wanting works hard, she will do very well.

226
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,687
You should give Wanting a chance, okay?

227
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,536
Brother Guangyao, since Wanting wants to try, let her do it.

228
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:56,740
I'm tired today and would like to take a rest anyways.

229
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,920
Yes, Wangqing.

230
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,360
You look so exhausted after the past two days.

231
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,420
Since you came back from Japan

232
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,923
and have been busy with your mother's funeral,

233
00:15:05,923 --> 00:15:07,150
you haven't been able to take some rest.

234
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,780
I happened to stew some blood-swallow soup.

235
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,495
I'll send it to you when it's ready. It'll be good for your health.

236
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,643
Thank you, Aunt Cui.

237
00:15:15,643 --> 00:15:17,716
You're welcome.

238
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,600
Brother Guangyao, you should eat some more.

239

243
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,023
Brother Guangyao.

244
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:53,876

Let me hold the door for you.

246

Hello?

Stop pretending. I have something to ask you.

00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,203
Let's meet at the usual place.

265
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,794
Okay.

266
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,659
I was stopped when I was about to go out.

267
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:13,113
Your sister is going too far.

268
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:14,319
Stop acting.

269
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,999
Do you know how important it is for me to be a secretary?

270
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:18,976
Of course, I know.

271

As a secretary at the Command center,

272
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,739
your status in the Mu family will be totally different.

273
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,320
You still did that after knowing?

274
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,100
Did Mu Wanting pay you?

275
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,116
Not bad.

276
00:18:28,116 --> 00:18:30,119
You guessed it right.

277
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,319
But your sister was being very generous. I had no way to reject her.

278
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,540
Commander Tan,

279
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,170
you're the one who wanted to cooperate with me at the beginning,

280
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:39,219
and even set ground rules.

281
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:42,735
The first rule is to trust each other and be consistent.

282
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:45,979
I can't believe you're ungrateful now because of a little money.

That's not a little money. It's 50,000 silver dollars!

00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:50,832
It'll be a waste if I don't take it.

At the time of my mother's wake, I thought you would be a reliable ally.

But I didn't expect you to be so ungrateful so fast.

287

487
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:07,600
Even if you don't fear death, I do.

488
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,279
The seal was so small. Who could see it clearly?

489
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,699
Besides, if I had known it was a confidential file,

490
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:16,780
I wouldn't have asked for your help.

491
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:20,500
When your boss comes, you have to make things clear.

492
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,940
Don't get me into military court.

493
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,919
What court? He is my fiancée.

494
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:28,350
Wait and see.

495
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,940
When Brother Guangyao comes,

496
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,860
he will definitely punish those two guys for me.

497
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,660
But it's getting late.

498
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,659
How come your fiancé hasn't come back yet?

499
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,680
Somebody get in here! Come here!

500
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,740
I need to see Brother Guangyao. Is anybody here?

501
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,083
Don't shout. I told you Supervisor Xu is not here. Stay there.

502
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:53,819
How dare you shout at me? Wait, I will punish you later.

503
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,279
<i>[Cathay Theater]</i>
<i>Here. Take it. Thank you.</i>

504
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,100
Sir, buy a flower for madam.

505
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,280
Each flower is one dollar.

506
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,299
Okay, I'll pick this one.

507
00:34:09,853 --> 00:34:13,193
How can you call such a pretty girl "madam"?

508
00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:15,040
You should call her "sister."

509
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,239
Little kid, you know a lot about business.

510
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,963
Here. I'll take all these flowers.

511
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:29,136
- Here you are.
- Thank you, Young Uncle.

512
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:30,583
Here.

513
00:34:31,665 --> 00:34:33,415
Here's the money. Keep the change.

514
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:36,440
Including Supervisor Xu's flower.

515
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,439
Thank you, Uncle.

516
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:38,936
Go.

517
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:44,400
Commander Tan, you got a bouquet of flowers.

518
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,560
But I only got this one here. It's quite fit for the scene.

519
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,480
So as I said you're a cultured person.

520
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,180
I'm a rough guy and I don't know how to say nice things.

521
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:58,815
But what I do know is, if the beauty likes it, the more the better.

522
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,499
It seems that Commander Tan does not know

523
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:06,959
the sense of cherishing the only thing he likes.

524
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:10,740
Thank you for your flower, Brother Guangyao. I like it a lot.

525
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:15,939
In that case, I shall leave you two alone.

526
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:19,195
I'll leave first. See you at the Command center tomorrow.

527
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:26,040
Let's go.

528
00:35:26,702 --> 00:35:28,102
It's so pretty.

529
00:35:28,102 --> 00:35:30,680
<i>[Far East Hotel]</i>

530
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:40,928
Brother Guangyao!

531
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,760
Sorry, Miss Wanting.

532
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,860
My men are such fools. They didn't know you. I'm sorry you were wronged.

533
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,960
Yeah, exactly. Those two guards are so clueless.

534
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,060
They shut me in there without saying a word.

535
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,879
Commander Tan, you should teach your men well.

536
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:58,780
Of course, I'll teach them.

537
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,439
Listen.

538
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:04,156
Do you hear that? They are being punished right now.

539
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:05,743
Okay.

540
00:37:05,743 --> 00:37:08,400
But how come you are here?

541
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,220
Where is Brother Guangyao?

542
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,859
Do you mean Supervisor Xu?

543
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:17,240
He seems to have gone to the film premiere with Miss Wanqing.

544
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,920
The movie should be over by now.

545
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,076
What? To watch a movie?

546
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:24,616
Didn't you know?

547
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:26,660
Miss Wanqing is a fan of Gu Yueshuang,

548
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,399
so Guangyao asked me for two VIP tickets.

549
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:32,639
I think it was the loveseat, too.

550
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:36,090
Miss Wanting!

551
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,719
Please go back, Mr. Wei.

552
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,726
Don't tell anyone about what happened today.

553
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:14,519
You may stop. It might still be needed tonight.

554
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:16,327
Yes, Sir!

555
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:23,110
Oh, you...

556
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:27,080
Military secrets should be kept confidential.

557
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,159
How can you not understand that?

558
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:34,840
Mother, I worked hard all day there.

559
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,220
I didn't even have lunch.

560
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,639
But that bitch went to the movie premiere with Brother Guangyao.

561
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:44,840
I worked all day long, but she took advantage of it.

562
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,180
What's the use of me?

563
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,680
Are you still blaming others?

564
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,265
You do things without thinking.

565
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,323
Please.

566
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,945
What are you going to do?

567
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:09,750
You.

568
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,080
Are you going to fight with Mu Wanqing? You—

569
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,680
You screwed everything up.

570
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,699
Do you want Xu Guangyao to see your mistake?

571
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:21,100
Mother, I worked all day and went to jail.

572
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,339
Yet, they could stay together? I quit.

573
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:26,239
Screw being his secretary. Screw his Command center.

574
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,779
I'll never go there anymore!

575
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,219
It's better if you don't go there.

576
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,500
On your first day at work,

577
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,680
you make a huge mistake by leaking military secrets.

578
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,559
If time goes on, I don't know what other mistakes you will make.

579
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:50,019
If Governor Xu finds out, how can you have a good image?

580
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:53,139
Well, wouldn't it be cheaper to let that little bitch go?

581
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:55,259
She'll spend every day with Brother Guangyao.

582
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,719
The Command is a military agency.

583
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:00,859
She will go to work as a secretary. She has to work.

584
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:03,839
Do you think she's going to date someone there?

585
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,700
Forget it, I won't go anymore.

586
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:14,119
Well, you! You're foolish.

587
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,679
It was 50,000 silver dollars in exchange for one day of work at the Command.

588
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:21,739
It was all for nothing!

589
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,760

590
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,300

You give me a great honor.

I have also prepared a special office for you.
