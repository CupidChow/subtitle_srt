Keep a better eye on him.

16
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,830
Someone wants him dead.

17
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,039
I will send more people here.

18
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,540
I've asked the boss of Drunk Immortal House.

19
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,020
He confirmed that his employee was knocked out while delivering the meal.

20
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,550
The guy surnamed Min wanted too much.

21
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,360
He insisted on ordering meals from outside.

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,540
Otherwise, this wouldn't have happened.

23
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,680
Why did he insist on ordering meals outside?

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,800
He's a proud man. And he would throw a fit if we didn't let him.

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,880
He has a filthy temper.

26
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,540
Keep ordering meals from Drunk Immortal House,

27
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,270
but don't give the meals to him.

28
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,456
Check the inside and the outside of the container box carefully,

29
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:17,070
because it's the only way for Min Dacheng to contact the outside world.

30
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,730
We'll catch a big fish this time.

31
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,850
Commander, you're so brilliant.

32
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,160
By the way,

33
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,900
have you investigated his family?

34
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,030
I have. He didn't get married and has no children.

35
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,260
He has no children?

36
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,300
Then, what was the paper we found under the Buddha statue?

37
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,360
Old Fu went to all the temples nearby

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,850
and confirmed that this paper is for releasing the souls of fetuses from purgatory.

39
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,110
Fetuses?

40
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,020
Then, who is the child in that photo?

41
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,760
We really don't know. He won't say.

42
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,930
We don't know where to find out.

43
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,476
It's interesting.

44
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,496
I need you to keep an eye on this. I have to go to the hospital.

45
00:03:11,496 --> 00:03:14,170
Come on, Commander. You…

46
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,437
A-Are you still going to monitor Miss Mu and Supervisor Xu?

47
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:21,966
Um… Can we deal with our business first this time?

48
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,530
When did you start thinking of me as irresponsible?

49

<i>[Shanghai St. John Hospital]</i>

50
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:25,220
You're still watching him as he sleeps. Are you obsessed with him?

51
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,050
Are you jealous?

52
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,769
I'm not jealous.

53
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:33,583
I'm just afraid that your obsession will delay any work we have.

54
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:37,215
You spent the entire day at the hospital, and you still tell me we have work to do?

55
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:39,515
I just came here to tell you

56
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:41,490
that the time's up.

57
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,010
It's time for you to deal with Cui Lianfeng.

58
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,490
I know what to do.

59
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,390
Have a look at this.

60
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,870
Tan Xuanlin asked me to go to Shanghai to close the case myself.

61
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,110
Tan Xuanlin just wants you to acquit the Tan Army of all counts yourself.

62
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,927
He gave me a reason that I can't refuse.

63
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:10,566
He told me that there are still some matters to deal with in the Tan Army, and he can't do this on his own.

64
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:14,624
It has to be done by the provincial military governor's mansion to be fair and reasonable.

65
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:17,580
Provincial Military Governor, if we don't handle this in a fair and reasonable way,

66
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,280
then we will be seen as being unfair.

67
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,870
I tried to poison Min Dacheng's food last time.

68
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,460
But I failed. It's my fault.

69
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,250
Now I have to do it myself.

70
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,060
- My Lord.
- Thank you.

71
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,113
Mother, I want to go visit Brother Guangyao today.

72
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,340
You're right. Guangyao has been making some progress with his recovery.

73
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,760
We should go and visit him.

74
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,710
My Lord, do you want to go with us?

75
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,000
I have some business to deal with in the Chamber of Commerce. I won't be able to.

76
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,087
Wanqing, weren't you looking after Guangyao at the hospital?

77
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:14,680
When did you come back?

78
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,570
Commander Tan replaced me in the middle of the night so that I can come back and sleep.

79
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,056
How is Guangyao?

80
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:25,436
Don't worry. He can eat and drink now. He's fine.

81
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:26,770
That's great.

82
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,698
Speaking of… how did the investigation of the kidnapping go?

83
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:32,280
The deadline is approaching.

84
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,740
Commander Tan said he already knows who did this.

85
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,230
It is just that the person has no relation with our family.

86
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,770
So I just wonder why this would happen.

87
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,936
Was it… Was it the militia?

88
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:46,610
It wasn't Commander Tan's militia.

89
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,990
They just tried to frame him and pretended to be his soldiers.

90
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,303
Then, who were they?

91
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,016
It's the boss of Baoli Pawnshop. Min Dacheng.

92
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,420
Baoli Pawnshop?

93
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,320
We had no problems with him.

94
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,750
And we even helped him a lot before.

95
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,660
Why would Min Dacheng do this?

96
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,870
That's right. Why would he do that?

97
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:26,264
My Lord, it's war time now.

98
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:30,580
He just wanted to blackmail us.

99
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,356
Aunt Cui, aren't you describing them too nicely?

100
00:07:34,356 --> 00:07:37,990
They really tried to kill me at the dock.

101
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,930
They wouldn't go this far if they just wanted money.

102
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,574
Yes…

103
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:47,796
She's right. We businessmen do not need to kill for money.

104
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:50,800
Has Commander Tan been making some progress in the investigation?

105
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,880
Commander Tan said he couldn't discuss the case with anyone.

106
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,580
He wants Provincial Military Governor Xu to come to Shanghai to close this case.

107
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,520
Oh, it has to be Provincial Military Governor Xu?

108
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,896
Yes. Commander Tan is normally under the administration of the provincial military governor's mansion.

109
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:12,360
So him requesting Provincial Military Governor Xu to handle this case is showing his respect.

110
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,250
Of course…

111
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,170
Father, I have to go to the hospital to take care of Brother Guangyao. I'm going now.

112
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,158
Okay. You may leave.

113
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,475
Mother, what are you still doing here?

114
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:58,150
You should get changed. We're going to visit Brother Guangyao.

115
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,110
Honey, you can go first.

116
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,910
I've got something to do.

117
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,036
Mother, Brother Guangyao was badly injured.

118
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:10,800
It would be unreasonable if you don't come with me.

119
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,340
But I have something important to do.

120
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,846
Be a good girl. Go visit Guangyao first, and tell him I said hello.

121
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:20,572
Go now.

122
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,110
I've told Cui Lianfeng.

123
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,650
What she will do next is up to you.

124
00:09:35,393 --> 00:09:37,003
Don't worry.

125
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:39,550
Our plan has been going as planned.

126
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,480
It's time to finish it.

127
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,216
Let's go.

128
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,404
Commander Tan.

129
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,551
Miss Wanting.

130
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,180
Why did my sister come here with Commander Tan?

131
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,890
I ran into Miss Mu at the front door of the hospital.

132
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,903
So we came together.

133
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,815
I'm going now.

134
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,999
Brother Guangyao.

135
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,320
Brother Guangyao, I've been worrying about you every day.

136
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,180
I wasn't able to eat or sleep properly after you got hurt.

137
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,955
Sister Wanting, you should have come to visit Brother Guangyao earlier then.

138
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:37,123
Then you wouldn't have had to worry at home.

139
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,000
My mother said the hospital is heavily guarded.

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,420
So she asked me not to come here and bother you.

141
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,750
But Brother Guangyao, we have been worrying about you every day.

142
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,000
I've been praying to Bodhisattva for you every day.

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,870
I thank you and your mother for caring so much about me.

144
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,040
I feel better now.

145
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,969
Don't worry about me.

146
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,530
Brother Guangyao,

147
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,640
my sister has been taking care of you every day. She must be tired.

148
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,600
Maybe she should go home and have a rest.

149
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,260
I'll take care of you.

150
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,340
Thank you for your kindness, Miss Wanting.

151
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,780
But Wanqing is my secretary.

152
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,040
Even though I'm in the hospital, I still have quite a lot of work to do.

153
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,480
Wanqing can help me a lot here.

154
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,923
It's fine.

155
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:24,180
I don't want to bother any outsiders.

156
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,370
So you think I'm an outsider now.

157
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,520
The doctor said you shouldn't move your upper body.

158
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,880
You've been taking care of me every day.

159
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,510
I'm sorry to trouble you like this.

160
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,270
If you think it would trouble me, you better get well soon.

161
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,850
Elder Sister really works hard.

162
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,780
You clearly left home half an hour earlier than me,

163
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,850
and you came here with Commander Tan.

164
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,770
I don't know why you're so busy.

165
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,500
These are some documents sent to the headquarters.

166
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,260
I previewed them for you.

167
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,859
It's nothing important. You can take your time.

168
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:15,420
That's fine. Put them here.

169
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,920
Miss Wanting,

170
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,440
where is Mrs. Mu? She usually

171
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,060
likes Brother Guangyao the most.

172
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,580
My mother said she had some kind of emergency.

173
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,580
So she sent me to visit Brother Guangyao alone.

174
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,100
Tell your mother I said thank you.

175
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,270
Brother Guangyao, if you don't need anything else,

176
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,850
I guess I'll leave now. Have some rest.

177
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,430
Let me walk her out.

178
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,740
Goodbye, Miss Wanting.

179
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,680
Brother Guangyao,

180
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,950
you won't be able to enjoy the love from both of these ladies.

181
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,466
Commander Tan, please don't make fun of me.

182
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,730
Mu Wanqing, you're really good at this.

183
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,540
Brother Guangyao said that you're an outsider.

184
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,276
You…

185
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:36,640
Do you think Brother Guangyao doesn't know what you're up to?

186
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,820
Don't think that he doesn't know what's going on between you and Commander Tan.

187
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,139
Take care!

188
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,712
You…

189
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,596
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

190
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:02,830
- Are you going to kick me out of here, too?
- I didn't say anything.

191
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,220
If you feel comfortable here, then just stay.

192
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,742
You…

193
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,648
Wanqing,

194
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,720
- Wanting didn't say anything to you, did she?
- No.

195
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,964
She is rather ruthless with her words.

196
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:21,620
If she says something that offends you, please don't mind it.

197
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,650
Don't worry. She is young and naive.

198
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,080
Of course, I won't take it to heart.

199
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,460
I'm just thinking too much into it.

200
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,166
I've seen her bullying you.

201
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,860
And I'm afraid that she'll keep bullying you.

202
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,703
Brother Guangyao,

203
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,140
you don't know her very well.

204
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,550
Nobody can bully her.

205
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,720
You talk too much.

206
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,580
Hey, didn't you go visit Guangyao?

207
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,980
Why did you come back so quickly?

208
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,430
Why should I stay there?

209
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,740
I don't want to see them displaying their affection.

210
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,290
Forget it.

211
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,190
You can't be patient. And you talk too much.

212
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,060
It's better if you don't stay there.

213
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,690
- You're all here.
- My Lord, you're back.

214
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,000
Don't make any plans tomorrow.

Provincial Military Governor Xu is going to interrogate the suspect of the kidnapping himself in the Command.

216
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,040
Commander Tan invited our family to sit in.

217
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,530
We… We're not the judge.

218
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:30,090
And we don't know anything about the case. My Lord, we can't help.

219
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,150
Wanqing is the victim.

220
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,090
Commander Tan is showing his respect to us.

221
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,400
We can't refuse his kindness.

222
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,230
You're right.

223
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,480
Besides, I want to know why this lunatic

224
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,560
Mr. Min is so brave enough to kidnap someone from the Mu Family.

225
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,000
By the way, have you ever met this Mr. Min

226
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,870
when you had your jewelry repaired?

227
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,620
No.

228
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,840
I just went to the front hall.

229
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,420
And I've only met the jewelry repair guys.

230
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,170
Then tomorrow's a good opportunity to listen to Min Dacheng

231
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,230
to hear his explanation.

Where did Wanting buy her herbal tea last time?

At Chen's Herbal Tea Shop on Seven Treasure Alley. It's been around for a while now.

253
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,880
Yes, Provincial Military Governor. This case has been fully investigated.

254
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,050
The suspect is the boss of Baoli Pawnshop, Min Dacheng.

255
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,680
He has mingled in society for many years.

256
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,610
He has relationships with both officials and gangs.

257
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,800
The militia's purpose is to fight these gangs.

258
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,970
So these people were cornered

259
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,620
to fabricate everything.

260
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,200

It's my fault.

285
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,360
However, Tan Xuanlin told me that

286
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:43,030
he didn't accept the confession on the file.

287

He implied that he wanted to make a deal with me.

You have no idea!

293
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,360
If I have proof that the Tan Army is innocent,

294
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,040
then I have no reason to stop them from becoming a militia.

The Tan Army were illegitimate for more than ten years. They were homeless.

296
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:18,330
If the militia becomes legal, it means that he has established his own power in Shanghai.

297
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,820
Shanghai will be under the Tan Family's domain.

Provincial Military Governor Xu, can we begin now?

321
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,030
Min Dacheng, your trial will be conducted

322
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,560
by Provincial Military Governor Xu himself today.

323
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,760
You must tell the truth or you'll be facing one more charges.

324
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:02,910
Min Dacheng, did you kidnap Miss Mu?

325
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,238
Yes.

326
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:08,390
Why did you do that?

327
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,480
And why did you frame the Tan Army?

328
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,010
His army was aiming to gain recognition.

329
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,310
They offered to protect the businessmen.

330
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,406
And just asking,

331
00:24:19,406 --> 00:24:23,520
if they do, then who will pay me for protection?

332
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,970
They are taking my business,

333
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,830
it is the same as killing my parents.

334
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,600
If you just want to frame the army,

335
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,380
then why did you kidnap Miss Mu?

336
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,000
Aren't you afraid the Mu Family will get back at you?

337
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,510
Guangyao took the bullet for Miss Mu and he almost died.

338
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:44,070
Criminals like him deserve capital punishment.

339
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,197
Min Dacheng, you'd better tell the truth.

340
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:50,730
Why on earth did you take such a dangerous risk

341
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,491
to kill someone?

342
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,810
It seems that he is a businessman but is actually part of a gang.

343
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,346
He's brutal.

344
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:01,706
We can't compare him with ordinary people.

345
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,290
If this was not done by yourself,

346
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,510
then tell us who was behind it.

347
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,980
Then, we will spare your life.

348
00:25:17,471 --> 00:25:19,530
My Lord,

349
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,030
my stomach is a bit upset.

350
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,380
I want to go home and rest.

351
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,410
Fine. Have Wanting to take you home.

352
00:25:30,147 --> 00:25:32,150
Please stay, Mrs. Mu.

353
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,020
Is your stomach upset?

354
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,170
Yes.

355
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,440
Is that because you had some herbal tea from Chen's Herbal Tea Shop?

356
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,180
Commander Tan,

357
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,130
are you teasing me?

358
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,570
What herbal tea?

359
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,540
During the morning of the kidnapping,

360
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,060
Miss Wanting had an upset stomach because she had some herbal tea.

361
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,170
So you had Mr. Mu stay behind to check on her.

362
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:09,240
Then, Miss Wanqing got in Mr. Mu's car alone.

363
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,776
I believe that was not a coincidence.

364
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,460
I don't know anything about that.

365
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,900
Junior Marshal, you're getting better these days.

366
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,110
Is Wanqing's case today?

367
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,520
Mr. Su and Mr. Pei went there.

368
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,600
If you get any updates about that, tell me immediately.

369
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,116
Yes.

370
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,350
Miss Wanting did say that the herbal tea

371
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,730
<i>[The Witness]</i>
tasted different when she was drinking it.

372
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:52,270
And at first, she was unwilling to drink it.

373
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,260
This madam came to buy some herbal tea on the 28th.

374
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,780
<i>[The Witness]</i>
Here is the record.

375
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,780
Please have a look.

376
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,520
<i>[Chen's Herbal Tea Shop.]</i>

377
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,320
<i>[Two doses of herbal tea]</i>
<i>[Cui]</i>

378
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,400
- Provincial Military Governor.
- On the morning of 28th,

379
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,140
this madam bought some folium sennae from my pharmacy.

380
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,130
What is folium sennae?

381
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,660
<i>[The Witness]</i>
My Lord, folium sennae is a laxative.

382
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,100
<i>My Lord,</i>

383
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,660
<i>Wanting has a stomachache, so she's bedridden.</i>

384
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,470
It can stimulate the intestines and the stomach. It can also treat edema and constipation.

385
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:34,200
It can cause colicky pain if you don't use it right.

386
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,560
This way,

387
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,326
Mrs. Mu was holding Mr. Mu back

388
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:47,810
by using Miss Wanting's stomach ache as an excuse.

389
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,500
This was to purposely let Miss Wanqing get in the car alone.

390
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,416
Am I right?

391
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:54,350
No. N… No.

392
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,264
What happened?

393
00:27:56,264 --> 00:27:59,520
My Lord, don't listen to their nonsense.

394
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,500
It's not true, My Lord.

395
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,650
Mrs. Mu,

396
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,700
then explain to me.

397
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,970
What is this handkerchief?

398
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,350
The design on this is strange.

399
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,740
This… This… It just says

400
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,120
"The phoenix flies high."

401
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,210
Mrs. Mu,

402
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,030
you really have foresight on this.

403
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,090
I hadn't even unfolded it yet.

404
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,000
How did you know the words on this?

405
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,320
I…

406
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,730
The moment you took it out,

407
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,260
a gust of wind blew,

408
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,250
I just... saw it.

409
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,370
<i>Of course.</i>

410
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,520
<i>What a coincidence!</i>

411
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,023
<i>Exactly.</i>

412
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,030
Did you see it clearly?

413
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,530
I did.

414
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,176
Good.

415
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,380
But the words on this handkerchief

416
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,660
is clearly "Twin lotus flowers on one stalk."

417
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,600
<i>[Twin lotus flowers on one stalk]</i>

418
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:16,170
I… I…

419
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,980
I was wrong.

420
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,963
But...

421
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:27,800
I also have the handkerchief with the words "The phoenix flies high."

422
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,580
<i>[The phoenix flies high]</i>

423
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,870
However, this handkerchief was found

424
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:38,100
in the container box that was delivered from the Drunk Immortal House to Min Dacheng.

425
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,290
Mrs. Mu, did you put this in yourself?

426
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,140
No. No.

427
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,460
My Lord, I didn't do this!

428
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,050
Min Dacheng the accused,

429
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,960
do you know Mrs. Mu?

430
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,557
Provincial Military Governor,

431
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,260
I've already looked into it.

432
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,423
Look.

433
00:30:09,423 --> 00:30:12,990
<i>[Investigation Report]</i>
He and Mrs. Mu are from Lingshan village, Ningbo.

434
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,710
There are only forty families in this village in total.

435
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,250
Before you joined the army at sixteen,

436
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,250
Mrs. Mu worked as a servant girl in Xiao's Mansion at the same age,

437
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,930
and was always in the village.

438
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,900
It's unlikely that you didn't know each other.

439
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,280
My Lord,

440
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,120
it's true Mr. Min and I know each other.

441
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,680
But we're just from the same village.

442
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,470
I saw Cui Jie sneaking around the front door of the mansion that morning.

443
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,220
And I asked him.

444
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,590
He said he was working for Boss Min.

445
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,350
I was just afraid that he will do something bad to you,

446
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,840
so I didn't let you go that time.

447
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,283
I didn't know

448
00:30:56,283 --> 00:31:00,100
Wanqing would get in the car alone.

449
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,610
Mrs. Mu, can you explain

450
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,690
why you gave this handkerchief to Min Dacheng?

451
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:08,320
I did not. That handkerchief was not for that Mr. Min.

452
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,870
That handkerchief...

453
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,430
was for Cui Jie.

454
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,180
In our village,

455
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,590
the words "The phoenix flies high" is a saying for young men,

456
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,210
hoping they will have a bright future.

457
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:23,490
I gave it to Cui Jie to tell him,

458
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,320
don't implicate me, his aunt,

459
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,586
for his own future, My Lord.

460
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:34,016
Wasn't Cui Jie, your nephew, already killed by Min Dacheng?

461
00:31:37,536 --> 00:31:39,383
What did you say?

462
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,200
Cui Jie is dead?

463
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,060
My nephew is dead?

464
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,760
That's impossible. How did my nephew die?

465
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,330
When did it happen?

466
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,780
My Lord,

467
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,880
that's impossible.

468
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,060
How could I possibly

469
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,740
be complicit with the person who killed my nephew?

470
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,340
I have been framed.

471
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,830
My Lord, how did my nephew died?

472
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,550
My Lord!

473
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,660
My Lord!

474
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,820
You almost got Wanqing killed.

475
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,460
And you caused Guangyao to get hurt so badly.

476
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,260
Your sin is hard to redeem.

477
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,830
My Lord! It's my fault.

478
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,190
It's my fault. But I didn't mean it.

479
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,960
I just went along with it, which helped the bad guys.

480
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,130
My Lord!

481
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,810
Such a vicious wife!

482
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,680
You're still trying to excuse yourself from this.

483
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,310
Min Dacheng,

484
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,480
tell us the truth.

485
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,670
Was she helping you

486
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:33,070
or was she the one who ordered you to do this?

487
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,000
Min Dacheng,

488
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,100
do you still want to cover for her?

489
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,800
Or is there another person who ordered you to do this?

490
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
<i>If you do your best to</i>

491
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,500
<i>maintain the reputation of the provincial military governor's mansion,</i>

492
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,800
<i>for the things I promised you,</i>

493
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,400
<i>I will keep my word.</i>

494
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,300
It's Mrs. Mu.

495
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,300
She ordered me to do it.

496
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:12,400
She told me to kidnap Miss Mu and kill her.

497
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,100
That's a lie!

498
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,300
That's nonsense!

499
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:21,100
- That's nonsense! That's nonsense!
- Mother! Mother!

500
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,400
- That's nonsense! I'm being framed!
- Father, are you okay?

501
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,200
I was framed!

502
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,800
That's an unfounded accusation!

503
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,600
Mrs. Mu,

504
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,900
the evidence is solid.

505
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,500
You'd better plead guilty now.

506
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,200
It's going to look terrible if we subject you to torture.

507
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
- No!
- Mother!

508
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,600
- No! No!
- Mother.

509
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,500
I'm being framed!

510
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
This is nonsense! I'm being framed!

511
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,400
My Lord! My Lord!

512
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,600
My Lord!

513
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,200
Mother! Mother!

514
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,800
- Madam… Madam…
- Mother!

515
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,300
- Min Dacheng, you're spouting nonsense!
- Madam.

516
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,200
I won't let you get away with this!

517
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,300
- Madam.
- Mother!

518
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,300
It is easy to know one's face, but hard to know their heart.

519
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,700
Mother!

520
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,700
Mother!

521
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,200
<i>[The High Court of Shanghai]
Newspapers! Newspapers!</i>

522
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,500
Provincial Military Governor Xu. Commander Tan.

523
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,600
What happened today

524
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,100
is because I couldn't manage my family.

525
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,900
My wife is guilty of terrible crimes.

526
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,100
Her sin is hard to redeem.

527
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,000
But she and I have been married for many years.

528
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,200
And she bore me a daughter.

529
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,900
Please leave her at my disposal.

530
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,900
Save some face for the Mu Family.

531
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,400
Mr. Mu is blurring the line between right and wrong.

532
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,600
Provincial Military Governor Xu needs help from the Mu Family.

533
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
I'm sure he is going to agree to this.

534
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,300
After all, Guangyao is out of danger now.

535
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,300
Leave Mrs. Mu to Mr. Mu.

536
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,800
It's their family business after all.

537
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,300
I don't want it to be known to all.

538
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,100
Mr. Mu.

539
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,900
As for Min Dacheng,

540
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,200
I'll take him back to the Command and handle this impartially.

541
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Please don't worry about this.

542
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,400
Thank you, Provincial Military Governor.

543
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,900
Thank you, Commander Tan.

544
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,000
Mother.

545
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,600
You two.

546
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,400
Thank you for sitting here and caring for Guangyao.

547
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,300
Uncle, you're very kind. Everything is clear now.

548
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,400
I think we should go now.

549
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,400
This criminal is guilty of the most heinous crimes.

550
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,700
He should face capital punishment.

551
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Provincial Military Governor, you're right.

552
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,600
However, this Mr. Min was part of society for many years.

553
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,700
He must have many secrets.

554
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,800
It's better to find them out before sentencing him to death.

555
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,200
You're really thoughtful.

556
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,800
Thank you, Provincial Military Governor.

557
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,300
Take him away.

558
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Hurry! Take him to the hospital.

559
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,800
He is still alive! Hurry!

560
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Provincial Military Governor Xu, I assure you,

561
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,000
I'll try my best to save his life.

562
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,000
Old Fu, let's go.

563
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,400
This worthless wretch can't even kill himself.

564
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,800
Find someone who is capable of doing this.

565
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,900
We have to kill him this time. We cannot fail.

566
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,700
Yes. I got it.

567
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,500
- Madam is awake.
- Mother!

568
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,200
Madam.

569
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,400
My Lord!

570
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,100
- My Lord!
- Mother!

571
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,600
My Lord! Don't listen to Min Dacheng.

572
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,400
He was spouting slander, My Lord.

573
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,200
People from gangs are savage and cruel.

574
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,400
And I'm just a woman.

575
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,300
How could I put them up to this? My Lord!

576
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,600
My Lord, this was just a favor done out of sympathy.

577
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,300
It's a slight error in thought. My Lord, I was wrong.

578
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,900
Mother.

579
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,500
You're saying Min Dacheng is framing you.

580
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,400
You can ask the gang to help.

581
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,100
You two really have an unusual relationship.

582
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,500
Wanqing,

583
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,500
we're family!

584
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,500
You can't hit me when I'm down.

585
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,900
You can't speak carelessly.

586
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,200
Father.

587
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,800
Actually, Commander Tan had already looked into their relationship.

588
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,200
In court, he wanted to save face for our family

589
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,600
so he didn't make everything public.

590
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,100
Here is the evidence.

591
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,300
You can make a decision after that.

592
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,300
<i>[Evil spirit, be safe and sound for all four seasons]</i>

593
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,500
You can't frame me with a piece of paper.

594
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,400
What's this?

595
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,400
This paper was found by Commander Tan in the niche for Min Dacheng's Buddha statue.

596
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,000
It's a piece of paper from Fayuan Temple for releasing souls from purgatory.

597
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,500
It has Cui Lianfeng's name on it.
<i>[Cui Lianfeng, Jiayin Year, 8th of March]</i>

598
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,490
Commander Tan asked Monk Yan Jing from Fayuan Temple.

599
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,000
He said that this paper

600
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,500
is for releasing the soul of a fetus born on the 8th of March, Bingchen year.

601
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,600
Bingchen year?

602
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,000
That's ten years ago.

603
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,100
Aunt Cui, if my memory's right,

604
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,300
in the early spring ten years ago,

605
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,800
when my elder brother was murdered,

606
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,200
you had a miscarriage.

607
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,800
My mother didn't know about your relationship with my father.

608
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,400
And she found it because you had a miscarriage.

609
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,900
After she found out about Mu Wanting, who was raised elsewhere,

610
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,800
she took me to Japan,

611
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,600
so that my father could marry you.

612
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,100
The day of your miscarriage was the 8th of March.

613
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,700
Could that fetus be Min Dacheng's?

614
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,800
My Lord!

615
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,700
That's not true, My Lord!

616
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,300
My Lord, think about it!

617
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,000
My Lord. The fetus was only four months old

618
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,700
when I had the miscarriage.

619
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,400
I got pregnant with your child in Guangzhou, My Lord.

620
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,000
My Lord, I never cared for the title,

621
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,200
and I was always with you.

622
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,000
I have devoted my heart to you.

623
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,400
My Lord,

624
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,800
you were afraid that the madam would find out when I had Wanting.

625
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,900
We placed our child in the commercial house in Guangzhou.

626
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,300
I could only see my child

627
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,100
when you brought me on your business trip.

628
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,000
I have never made it difficult for you, My Lord.

629
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,100
And I never complained.

630
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:54,100
In Guangzhou, every minute, every second I could not bear to leave your side.

631
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,200
How could I have affairs with other men?

632
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,000
What's your explanation for Min Dacheng worshipping your child?

633
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,200
You two must have slept together.

634
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You had gone back to your hometown before you came to Guangzhou.

635
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,600
Is it possible that

636
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,300
you were having an affair with that man at that time?

637
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,200
No! No!

638
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,500
My Lord, that's not true.

639
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,300
Then why would Min Dacheng think you were having his child?

640
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,800
Oh…

641
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,600
Maybe because Min Dacheng was the adjutant of Provincial Military Governor Luo at that time.

642
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
So you were leaving a way out for yourself.

643
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,200
She was afraid that if you didn't want her anymore,

644
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,800
she could be the wife of an officer.

645
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,800
- Fine! I admit!
- Mother!

646
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,400
- I admit!
