15
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,560
Xu Bojun kept the soldiers' pay and provisions for himself.

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,180
He even took my elites to fight bitter battles.

17
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,520
Thousands of good men from the Pei Army died.

18
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,090
My soldiers were also raised by their parents.

19
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,001
They died but why shouldn't his son die?

20
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,690
So you sent assassins to have Guangyao killed

21
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,380
and you werer going to put the blame on the Revolutionary Army.

22
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,010
Then Xu Bojun would have begun to wage a bloody struggle against the Revolutionary Army.

23
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,500
Then the Pei Army could retreat from the front, right?

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,600
That's right.

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,190
Xu Bojun, that old man, is always thinking of self-preservation.

26
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,900
If he didn't suffer from some tragedy,

27
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,510
how would he fight bitterly against the Revolutionary Army?

28
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,837
But Guangyao is my best friend.

29
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:21,210
My son, there are no friends in the official circle. Don't you get it?

30
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,960
Xu Guangyao is Xu Bojun's son.

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,720
A dutiful son is obliged to pay his father's debts.

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,260
A son has to pay his father's debts?

33
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,220
Guangyao's kindness was in vain.

34
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,520
When we were investigated, he still hid it from his father.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,040
He did all these things to bury the hatchet and to avoid conflicts.

36
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,600
Silly boy, do you think Xu Guangyao

37
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,330
can really hide it from Xu Bojun, the old fox?

38
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:49,771
Impossible. Your family name is Pei and his is Xu.

39
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,980
Once you were born, you were tied to your family war chariots.

40
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,346
Father, can't we stop fighting?

41
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:57,224
No, we can't.

42
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,393
Fight or die.

43
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:03,960
This is my fate and also yours.

44
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,874
I don't accept my fate!

45
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,670
Junior Marshal, I'm sorry.

46
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,902
Father, what are you doing?

47
00:03:16,902 --> 00:03:21,796
My son, are you going to Shanghai to be Xu Bojun's hostage?

48
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:24,610
Guangyao won't break his word.

49
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,470
In front of the interests of others, don't be gullible.

50
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,203
I agreed to send a friend back to Shanghai.

51
00:03:30,203 --> 00:03:32,990
Is it Tan Xuanlin's younger sister?

52
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,290
I've sent men to take her back to the military governor's mansion.

53
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,726
Father, Miss Tan has nothing to do with this.

54
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:41,210
Please don't involve the innocent.

55
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,446
Don't worry. I will treat her well.

56
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,491
Military Governor, Miss Tan is here.

57
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:55,920
Miss Tan, this way, please.

58
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,484
Miss Tan, I met you during the party at the Mu Mansion.

59
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:05,035
Uncle Pei, you look more vigorous than we last met.

60
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:10,440
You and Mr. Pei look like brothers rather than father and son.

61
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,320
Little girl, your words are sweet.

62
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,117
As soon as I saw you, I found you very kind, so I talked to you as friends.

63
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:23,320
I hope you don't mind it.

64
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,359
Of course not. Come and take your seat.

65
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,490
I'd better stand with Mr. Pei.

66
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,850
As the younger generation, I shouldn't behave impolitely in front of such a noble character.

67
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,770
Little girl, you understand well.

68
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,480
Like attracts like.

69
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,850
If I don't behave well and if I don't know the rules,

70
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,920
how can I be friends with Mr. Pei?

71
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,563
Good. You are frank and generous.

72
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:55,999
We'll get along well.

73
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,270
How is Commander Tan doing?

74
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,320
Not so well.

75
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,187
There is gossip about my brother and Miss Mu. This offended Military Governor Xu.

76
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:11,130
My brother is being monitored by Military Governor Xu.

77
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,520
Everyone thinks my brother is riding on the crest of success

78
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,550
and will soon become the noble son-in-law of the Mu family.

79
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,300
In actuality, he's on a grill.

80
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,130
One false step would mean he would suffer a major disaster.

81
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,954
You're saying Commander Tan has been having a hard time recently?

82
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:30,670
My brother is narrow-minded.

83
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,960
He is set on making a humble living under the supervision of the governor's mansion.

84
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,396
Moreover, while he's being supervised by the military governor's mansion, he's watching them while watching me.

85
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:41,800
Luckily, I'm smart enough and came to Beijing.

86
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,870
Little girl, you are not timid.

87
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,532
Tell me. Why have you come to Beijing?

88
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,445
I…

89
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,580
I want to pursue your son.

90
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,213
Miss Tan,

91
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:04,400
my son is a cold character.

92
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,740
Many daughters from aristocratic families pursued him but were refused.

93
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,030
You are a wild girl born in a bandit lair.

94
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,320
And you want to pursue him? I worry for you.

95
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,560
I know I come from a bandit lair with a low family status.

96
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,750
But Mu Guiying also came from a bandit lair.
(T/N: Mu Guiying is a legendary female warrior from The Generals of the Yang Family)

97
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,640
She has been widely praised for her love with Yang Zongbao.
<i>(T/N: a character in the Generals of the Yang Family legends)</i>

98
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,326
Anyway, my brother is the Commander of Shanghai.

99
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:33,160
Anyhow, please give me a chance.

100
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,226
Mu Guiying could take command and go to battle.
<i>(T/N: she led war widows on an expedition against Western Xia)</i>

101
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:41,524
But what can you do?

102
00:06:41,524 --> 00:06:43,697
I…

103
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,060
I've prepared a big gift for you.

104
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,662
What's this?

105
00:07:04,662 --> 00:07:08,920
The truth of the death of Mu Yuanheng, the eldest son of the Mu family,

106
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,530
at the time.

107
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,900
How could you ask the Fourth Young Miss to do such a dangerous thing?

108
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,250
She is very prudent.

109
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,750
She is used to deceiving people and acting secretly.

110
00:07:28,502 --> 00:07:30,350
By the way,

111
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,840
should I redeem my reward as promised?

112
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,070
What reward?

113
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,500
What if I win?

114
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,830
What reward would you give me?

115
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,830
If you won…

116
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,990
What a rascal you are!

117
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,120
It is fair.

118
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,510
Then again, you used to watch the Fourth Young Miss so closely.

119
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,370
She wanted to visit Pei Shaojun, and you firmly refused.

120
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,310
Now, she wanted to go to Beijing and you granted her permission.

121
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,190
Xu Bojun is watching me very closely.

122
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,477
What else can I do?

123
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:15,212
If you were me, what would you do?

124
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:18,390
Luckily, the Fourth Young Miss is willing to help you.

125
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,551
She…

126
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:24,090
She honestly wished to go to Beijing to see Pei Shaojun.

127
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,920
What a real brother and sister!

128
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,930
Both of you like tormenting each other.

129
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:32,255
We don't like tormenting each other.

130
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,290
I am her only brother.

131
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:40,210
If I shelter her away from any storm,

132
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,110
she would never understand the ways of the world.

133
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,056
Therefore, the only way to give her a peaceful life

134
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:51,220
is to enrich her experience so that she can assess every situation.

135
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,910
You are a good brother.

136
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,650
You are my good wife.

137
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,060
You are worried about your sister-in-law.

138
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,990
I didn't promise to marry you.

139
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,704
But… well we kissed,

140
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:13,383
and our relationship was made public by the newspaper.

141
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:16,780
If you disagree, no one would want you.

142
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,080
What?

143
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,130
Nothing was found?

144
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,876
No. They searched the whole cabin thoroughly and carefully.

145
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:46,780
Nothing suspicious was found except some clothes and some valuables.

146
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:52,332
Governor, do you think it could be possible that they really went to Beijing to visit Tan Sangyu?

147
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:57,140
The spy said Tan Xuanlin planned to send his younger sister back to Jiang City.

148
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,120
But his younger sister got rid of Tan Xuanlin's people in the station

149
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,010
and took the train to Beijing.

150
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:08,506
It's not so simple.

151
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:11,090
Ask your people to follow them after they arrive in Beijing,

152
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,010
and report back about Tan Xuanlin's whereabouts in real time.

153
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,444
I will.

154
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:25,880
<i>[Yung Zong]</i>
<i>[Rent formal attire or buy custom clothing]</i>

155
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,210
Why are you back?

156
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,450
I read the newspapers and hurried here.

157
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,640
I feared that you would drink alone again.

158
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,056
If you fell, nobody would be there to lift you up.

159
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,849
It hurts.

160
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:53,151
What's wrong with you?

161
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:54,570
Nothing.

162
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,255
I was lightly hurt on that day.

163
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,070
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,161
Thank you for your help on that day.

165
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,810
So how will you thank me?

166
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,270
Shall we go to dinner?

167
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,090
Then my wound will get better faster.

168
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,080
Nonsense.

169
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,740
Shouldn't you show good faith rather than

170
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,200
make empty promises of thanking me?

171
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,266
Fine. No problem.

172
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,520
I'll treat you to some Western food tonight.

173
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,020
<i>[Sincere Insurance Company]</i>

174
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,190
It wasn't nice of Tan Xuanlin to do such a thing.

175
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:55,564
If I were him, I would be reluctant to

176
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,752
make you sad, especially considering how such a beauty was loving me.

177
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:03,790
It's not his fault.

178
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,440
Actually, I never told him that... I love him.

179
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,380
You didn't tell him?

180
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,350
It's not necessary to say something straight.

181
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,560
I followed him from the age of ten.

182
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,020
We'd lived together on the battlefield.

183
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,631
If he had a bit of feelings for me,

184
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:29,134
I'd have been his long ago.

185
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,130
I envy him.

186
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,490
In fact, early on... it was clear that he didn't love me.

187
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,290
The way he looks at me and Miss Mu...

188
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,820
is very different.

189
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,590
So look at me.

190
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,270
Do I look at you the same way Tan Xuanlin looks at Miss Mu?

191
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,210
I can never see through his eyes,

192
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:28,040
but... I can see through yours.

193
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:30,405
What can you see?

194
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,410
You act like a romantic, but you are actually a wealthy idler.

195
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,850
You misunderstand me.

196
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,056
Look at this.

197
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,200
Have you seen any wealthy idler

198
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,540
wear a farmer's style silver pendant?

199
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,860
This…

200
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,210
This is my mother's legacy.

201
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,390
My mother was an actress.

202
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,680
She met my father and became his concubine.

203
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,060
During my childhood,

204
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,530
my mother and I lived in a courtyard behind the military governor's mansion.

205
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,180
Whenever I went to the front yard,

206
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,490
I would be bullied by the brothers from the principal room.

207
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:28,010
They teased me... calling me "little actor."

208
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,080
Because of this,

209
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,210
I went to Baoding Military Academy at the age of thirteen.

210
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:39,751
I did this to leave a cold family,

211
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,540
and the people who humiliated me.

212
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:59,233
I've never thought you had such an experience.

213
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,248
This pendant...

214
00:15:02,395 --> 00:15:04,855
was left behind by my mother.

215
00:15:06,902 --> 00:15:09,902
Before she died, she put it in my hand, saying

216
00:15:11,107 --> 00:15:15,627
the life in the military governor's mansion was like a long nightmare.

217
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:19,890
In her next life, she wanted to wander in the wide world

218
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:23,644
instead of living a hard life deep in the courtyard.

219
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:43,080
I don't want to mention these old things, or you would be upset.

220
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,747
I've come to make you happy.

221
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:52,396
It seems you are not heartless after all.

222
00:15:52,396 --> 00:15:56,370
You've just hidden everything in your heart.

223
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,110
Life is already difficult.

224
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,330
When we become heartless, we can be a bit happier.

225
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,626
A toast to our heartless life.

226
00:16:08,107 --> 00:16:11,688
Cheers! A toast to us, heartless and happy!

227
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:17,030
What did you say?

228
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:19,849
A toast to…

229
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:21,872
Us.

230
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:23,875
Us?

231
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,514
You've included me in your life.

232
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:32,120
You're so annoying! Just drink!

233
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,733
Where is Junior Marshal?

234
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:49,395
He's there.

235
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,761
Junior Marshal.

236
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,160
<i>[Commander Tan Xuanlin and Miss Mu kiss at the Paramount]</i>

237
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,110
How dare you bring these newspapers to Junior Marshal? Inconsiderate!

238
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,240
Junior Marshal said he wanted to read Shanghai's newspapers.

239
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,695
Take it away.

240
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:21,280
Don't bother him with such news anymore.

241
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,140
Yes.

242
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:24,831
Go.

243
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:36,253
Junior Marshal.

244
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:43,531
It doesn't matter. Don't blame him.

245
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:45,760
I requested to read them.

246
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,135
Why do you bother yourself?

247
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,170
As long as she is well,

248
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,210
I won't be worried.

249
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,410
- Second Brother!
- <i>Attention!</i>

250
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:34,369
Military Governor Pei, it's my great honor to accept your greetings in person.

251
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:38,567
Commander Tan, you are now the real King of Shanghai.

252
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:41,570
It's rare for you to accompany Miss Mu to Beijing.

253
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,340
I'm supposed to do my duties as the host.

254
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,957
Military Governor, I've come to take my sister back.

255
00:18:48,957 --> 00:18:52,393
She ran out secretly and caused a lot of trouble for you.

256
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:55,612
I feel very guilty as her brother.

257
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,913
Don't mention it.

258
00:18:57,913 --> 00:19:01,616
Miss Tan is lively and frank.

259
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:04,080
We got along quickly.

260
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,700
Now we are good friends despite the difference in age.

261
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,601
Commander Tan. Miss Mu.

262
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:14,200
Dinner is ready at the military governor's mansion, welcoming you from afar.

263
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,596
- Please.
- Please.

264
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,770
Uncle Pei.

265
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:31,700
Please.

266
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:34,118
Look at this girl.

267
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:40,011
Second Brother!

268
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:42,569
Well done. You flattered him well.

269
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:44,460
He is my future father-in-law.

270
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,280
I should do my best to flatter him.

271
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,642
Listen. Come back with me after everything is over.

272
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:55,700
This is not your domain. You can't decide whether I go back.

273
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,340
I…

274
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,372
- Bad girl!
- All right.

275
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:02,050
Please.

276
00:20:12,217 --> 00:20:14,522
Go and monitor Tan Xuanlin near the military governor's mansion.

277
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:16,080
I will send a telegram to Adjutant Xu.

278
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,980
If you see anything important, we will meet in Yue City Guild Hall.

279
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,444
Yes.

280
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,567
Little Four, where is your beloved Pei Shaojun?

281
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,090
Don't mention it.

282
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:35,100
He provoked Military Governor Pei and is now in confinement.

283
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,920
While he is being confined by his father,

284
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,160
you are living so happily in front of Pei Xun. Very good.

285
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,625
Of course. Don't you know me well?

286
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:49,280
In this world, nobody can escape from me if I want to flatter him.

287
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,410
What a young schemer!

288
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:56,652
Second Brother, I'm not as sly as you are.

289
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,260
You've trapped the most famous lady in Shanghai. Very good.

290
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,079
Sister-in-Law!

291
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,900
I will punish you when we go back.

292
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,220
Listen, Second Brother. Now, I have my sister-in-law.

293
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,380
If you beat me again, my sister-in-law will teach you a lesson.

294
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:18,163
Sister-in-Law, how did my brother trap you?

295
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:20,556
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

296
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,800
Did Pei Xun go to the railway station in person to greet Tan Xuanlin?

297
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,400
Yes. Our people saw with their own eyes.

298
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,000
Pei Xun took Tan Sangyu to greet Tan Xuanlin.

299
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,900
Our people also found that

300
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,300
his younger sister lived with the Pei family the day before.

301
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,200
It's said that the girl is pursuing Pei Shaojun very closely.

302
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,700
Tan Xuanlin has just gotten Mu Wanqing.

303
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,600
Now he asked his younger sister to pursue Pei Shaojun.

304
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,200
He wants to claim kinship with the Pei family

305
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,000
and to solidify his rule in Shanghai.

306
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,180
It's very possible.

307
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,300
He quickly traveled to Beijing to claim kinship.

308
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,700
It doesn't make sense.

309
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,200
It's impossible for the Tans, a family of bandits, to claim kinship with the Pei family.

310
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Send people to watch Tan Xuanlin closely,

311
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,600
and see what he wants to do.

312
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,200
Yes.

313
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,100
It's Commander Tan's first visit to Beijing after his appointment.

314
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,200
Congratulations! Let's drink a toast. Come on.

315
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,600
Raise your glasses.

316
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,800
It's my great honor to accept Military Governor Pei's hospitality.

317
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,400
Please.

318
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,300
Miss Mu,

319
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,600
I've heard about the love between you and Commander Tan.

320
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,970
Congratulations to you, the beauty and the hero!

321
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,800
Thank you, Military Governor Pei.

322
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,300
Commander Tan and I were cautious in Shanghai.

323
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,800
You've been the first to send your wishes

324
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,500
since it was reported on the newspaper.

325
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,900
As I should.

326
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,000
The love between two should be mutual.

327
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,590
As long as you love each other, no one should hold you back.

328
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Xu Bojun, the old thief, wants to force you with his power.

329
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,400
He is in the wrong.

330
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,500
Though I am a rough man,

331
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,400
I look down upon the means to separate lovers.

332
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,000
Military Governor Pei,

333
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,600
if you don't like to separate lovers,

334
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,300
then your son Mr. Pei and I…

335
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,100
Little Four.

336
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,800
Shut your mouth!

337
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,000
Military Governor Pei, I must apologize.

338
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,600
This girl has lacked discipline since childhood.

339
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,300
Brother…

340
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,300
If she has offended you,

341
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,900
I wish to apologize for her.

342
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,100
What do you mean? Don't mention it.

343
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,700
I didn't offend him.

344
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,800
Uncle Pei likes me.

345
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,600
She's right.

346
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,600
I like her a lot.

347
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,200
This sweet girl impresses me.

348
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,600
She traveled a long way to visit me in Beijing

349
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,200
and brought me a special gift.

350
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,000
Military Governor Pei, shall we talk privately?

351
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,700
Sure.

352
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,800
Adviser Zuo, entertain our guests.

353
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,000
Miss Mu, excuse me, but I must be leaving now.

354
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,100
- Please.
- Please.

355
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,300
Commander Tan, you've offended Xu Bojun for Miss Mu.

356
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
Now, you may fall at any moment.

357
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,900
Are you worried about your escape route?

358
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,700
Military Governor, perhaps you also have no escape route.

359
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,300
Do you want me to rehear the assassination case

360
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,000
of Mu Yuanheng ten years ago

361
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,100
and bring Xu Bojun down?

362
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,800
Xu Guangyao has already investigated the assassins during the celebration.

363
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,200
You and Xu Bojun currently maintain a harmonious relationship on the surface.

364
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,600
But how long can you maintain that friendship?

365
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,800
You'd better go on active offense instead of passive defense.

366
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,700
As the saying goes, "He who strikes first gains the advantage."

367
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,100
Do you want to take my advantage to remove your threat?

368
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,100
Xu Bojun is also your biggest threat, isn't he?

369
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,900
This isn't impossible.

370
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,400
I've had plans to deal with Xu Bojun.

371
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,800
But if I brought Xu Bojun down,

372
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,000
everything belonging to the Xu family

373
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,100
will be owned by the Pei Army,

374
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,200
including Shanghai, which is within the jurisdiction of the Military Governor's mansion of Yue City.

375
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,980
Don't forget

376
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,000
the most important physical evidence. The film was found by me.

377
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,600
It's all right if you ignore my contribution,

378
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,000
but it's not reasonable if you covet Shanghai.

379
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,800
Commander Tan,

380
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,100
the physical evidence is now in my hands.

381
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,500
What position are you in to discuss conditions?

382
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,400
You are right.

383
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
But you can only reverse the verdict

384
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,500
with both the testimony of a witness and the physical evidence.

385
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,000
True, you have the physical evidence.

386
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,400
However, the testimony is in my control.

387
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,800
Do you have the testimony of a witness?

388
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Min Dacheng, Military Governor Luo's former adjutant, is not dead.

389
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,800
It was he who hid the truth for Xu Bojun.

390
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,100
Where is he?

391
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,700
In Beijing.

392
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,600
Of course,

393
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,200
as long as you agree with my simple terms...

394
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,700
If you issue a letter in your name

395
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,300
clarifying my full authority over Shanghai,

396
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,700
I will offer the testimony of the witness out of respect.

397
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,700
It's easy if the witness is in Beijing.

398
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,600
Without your clues, I can still find him.

399
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,000
I certainly believe you can.

400
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,500
However…

401
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,200
While you can find him, you can't take him away.

402
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,700
That's funny.

403
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,200
In Beijing, there is nobody beyond my control.

404
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,500
Commander Tan, you've overestimated yourself.

405
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,900
The film can only prove Xu Bojun bombed the wharf in advance.

406
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,700
It cannot prove he killed Mu Yuanheng.

407
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,900
If there is a lack of evidence,

408
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,300
although you can manipulate the court and convict Xu Bojun,

409
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,400
you cannot convince the public.

410
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,400
I'm afraid that he would bite you back.

411
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,090
Stop!

412
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,100
<i>What are you doing?</i>

413
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,600
Military Governor Pei is discussing something important with the guest.

414
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
I come to provide food for Mr. Pei.

415
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,400
<i>If you keep me away,</i>

416
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,200
<i>I'll ruin Military Governor Pei's important meeting, and he will blame us.</i>

417
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,600
Could you bear the responsibility?

418
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,400
Mr. Pei.

419
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,100
I cooked this especially for you.

420
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,800
It's delicious!

421
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,900
Have a taste.

422
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,600
I'm not hungry.

423
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,900
It's past dinnertime.

424
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,900
You've been confined for a day.

425
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,200
How can you not be hungry?

426
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,500
Please feel free with me.

427
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,900
I cooked this by myself.

428
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,400
Help yourself.

429
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,100
If you like it, I will cook for you every day.

430
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,700
Okay?

431
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,200
No, thank you.

432
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,500
You must be tired after acting for such a long time.

433
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,600
What do you mean?

434
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,000
You deliberately planned to get close to me

435
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
to pave the way for Commander Tan, didn't you?

436
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,900
When I knew you at the student protest last year,

437
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,600
my brother was not the Commander of Shanghai yet.

438
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Why would I need to do that?

439
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,900
Because of the encounter in the protest,

440
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,400
you decided to get close to me. Am I right?

441
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,600
You misunderstand me.

442
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,400
I'm sincere with you.

443
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,700
I want to read this book.

444
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,600
Please go away.

445
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,200
I want to tell you! You are misunderstanding me.

446
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,100
I will prove that you are wrong!

447
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,200
<i>Forgive me, but you are free.</i>

448
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
<i>You shouldn't stay here.</i>

449
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,800
Therefore, this testimony is critical.

450
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,300
As long as you give up Shanghai, you will ensure success.

451
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,200
Isn't this a good deal?

452
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,850
Commander Tan,

453
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,500
do you know the consequences if you bargain with me?

454
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,300
Military Governor, you're kicking down the ladder.

455
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,000
Commander Tan, work together with me.

456
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,700
Offer the testimony of the witness, and I will help you out.

457
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,500
What's wrong? You look unhappy.

458
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,000
What a stubborn man!

459
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,600
I show my warm feelings, but he always returns them with a cold response.

460
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,200
I wonder what I owed him in a previous life.

461
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,700
Well, will you return to Shanghai with me?

462
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,700
No way.

463
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,200
I'm a person with good faith.

464
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,600
If I owed him in a previous life,

465
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,800
I must return it to him in this life.

466
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,000
I shouldn't go backward.

467
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,200
You called him a stubborn man, but you are reluctant to leave him.

468
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,900
Sister-in-Law,

469
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,900
would you say some good words to my brother and let me stay?

470
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,400
Uncle Pei!

471
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,900
No…

472
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,400
Where are you taking my brother?

473
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Military Governor Pei, let's discuss things peacefully.

474
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,800
Why use force?

475
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,000
You got the point.

476
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,800
We should discuss peacefully.

477
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,700
But Commander Tan had a good plan.

478
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,120
He didn't want to talk with me.

479
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,500
Uncle Pei, my brother speaks coarsely.

480
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,700
If he offended you and made you angry,

481
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,600
may I apologize to you for him?

482
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,400
- What did you say?
- Shut up!

483
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,800
Miss Tan. Miss Mu. Please leave this place.

484
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,100
Pei's mansion never uses force on women.

485
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,000
Go.

486
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,600
Stay away!

487
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Today, no one will take my brother away.

488
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,900
I'm a woman. Who dares to use force on me?

489
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,300
Well, Little Four,

490
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,500
I have proper business with Military Governor Pei.

491
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,700
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

492
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,900
A proper business, but there are so many people carrying guns.

493
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,700
The price is pending.

494
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,300
They want to force you to sell, right?

495
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,400
All right, Little Four.

496
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,300
Your brother has proper business. Don't bother him.

497
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,900
- Take them away.
- Proper business?

498
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,000
- Take them.
- Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

499
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,800
Brother!

500
00:33:48,272 --> 00:33:50,978
Don't worry. He has a sense of propriety.

501
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,500
<i>[Kang Fu Shou Hospital]</i>

502
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,500
Commander Tan, did you hide him here?

503
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,400
Military Governor, I did this in case of danger.

504
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,130
Please don't laugh.

505
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,200
I never thought you had a relationship with the consulate.

506
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,300
I don't have a relationship, but I have lots of friends.

507
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,700
Are you playing with me?

508
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,300
Here you are.

509
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,200
How is it going, Commander Tan?

510
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,000
How are you, Translator Liao?

511
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,500
Commander Tan, your friend has settled in. Everything is fine.

512
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,400
Thank you, Translator Liao.

513
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,200
Is this…

514
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,700
Is this Military Governor Pei, right?

515
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,800
I saw your photo in the newspapers.

516
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,600
Are you coming to visit the Consular Officer for important affairs?

517
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,100
Let me help you report to him.

518
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,700
That won't be necessary.

519
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,000
I've come to accompany Commander Tan in his visit to his friend.

520
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That's right.

521
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,900
Commander Tan's friend has settled in here.

522
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,900
He is safe. Please don't worry.

523
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,200
Translator Liao.

524
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,900
Yes?

525
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,500
How do you know Commander Tan?

526
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,100
Commander Tan and I became friends after being introduced by the Consular Officer.

527
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,600
When the Consular Officer was a war correspondent,

528
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,800
Commander Tan saved his life.

529
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,200
We dare not neglect anything required by Commander Tan.

530
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,300
You are very popular.

531
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,400
What do you mean popular?

532
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,200
I have little power, so I dare not offend anyone.

533
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,800
The more friends, the better.

534
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,900
Well said!

535
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,300
Good. I hope after this, we can also become friends.

536
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,700
Military Governor, it'll be my honor to gain your appreciation.

537
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,700
Translator Liao, thank you for your time.

538
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,000
Goodbye.

539
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,800
Goodbye, Military Governor Pei.

540
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,300
Please.

541
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,100
Warlord,

542
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,300
do you think Tan Xuanlin really saved the Consular Officer's life?

543
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,100
We'd prefer to believe it's true.

544
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,700
Our rival is Xu Bojun.

545
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,400
It's not necessary to offend foreigners.

546
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,100
If Tan Xuanlin wants the letter, we will give it to him.

547
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,100
The Revolutionary Army will soon cross the Yangtze River.

548
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
I don't think he will keep his position

549
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,400
as the King of Shanghai.

550
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,000
Liao, where did you go?

551
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,400
This is the official approval for the aspirin you need.

552
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,300
<i>[Official Approval of Aspirin]</i>
I've sealed the document.

553
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,000
You may take it.

554
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,400
Elijah,

555
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,100
thank you on behalf of the comrades at the front line.

556
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,400
Not at all.

557
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,200
When I was a war correspondent,

558
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,600
if you hadn't saved my life,

559
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,400
the grass on my grave would have been very high.

560
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,500
You speak Chinese more and more like a native.

561
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,600
I learned all these from you, an old Bolshevik.

562
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,000
By the way, I hear your army always wins.

563
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,100
Why not show yourself at the front line

564
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,800
and win a military medal?

565
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,300
As communists, we never struggle for merits.

566
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,100
I will transport this batch of medicines to the front line

567
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,600
and save more wounded comrades.

568
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,600
This will be more valuable than any military medal.

569
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,500
Sister-in-Law,

570
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,100
will my brother be fine?

571
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,400
Don't worry. Your brother never fights a battle without preparation.

572
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,800
He has a plan in his heart.

573
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,600
Take it easy.

574
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
- Good, Commander Tan.
- Brother!

575
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,000
Tomorrow, I will order the High Court to start retrial

576
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,400
and to issue a subpoena to the military governor's mansion of Yue City,

577
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,100
urging Xu Bojun to come to Beijing immediately

578
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,900
and to cooperate with the investigation.

579
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,200
Military Governor Pei, trust me.

580
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,600
The testimony of the witness is under my control.

581
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,700
Everything will go well.

582
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,900
We didn't drink as much as we could today.

583
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,200
Forget it.

584
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,700
After we bring Xu Bojun down,

585
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,000
let's have a dinner and drink to our success.

586
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,600
Sounds good.

587
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,200
Please.

588
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,100
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

589
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:43,900
Not only is this man fickle, he's also erratic.

590
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,400
Second Brother,

591
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
what happened to you and Military Governor Pei?

592
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,800
Just now you were ready to use force.

593
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,800
Now, you are holding hands with him.

594
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,500
Your relationship is really confusing.

595
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,600
Try to learn.

596
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,700
You don't understand the adult world.

597
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,900
The adult world is true or false.

598
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,200
Both fake and real.

599
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,700
Stop teasing the Fourth Young Miss.

600
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,200
How is it going?

601
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,100
It's finished.

602
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,300
He promised that after we succeed,

603
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,200
he won't take a share of Shanghai.

604
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,500
You captured his interest.

605
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,800
Everything went as expected.

606
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,500
Sister-in-Law, why am I more and more confused?

607
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,700
You weren't friendly with him before, were you?

608
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,700
Why did he come to terms with you?

609
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,810
He threatened me with guns

610
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,100
because he wanted to find Min Dacheng

611
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,600
and pocket everything for himself.

612
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,400
Did you give in?

613
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,100
You fool!

614
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,000
Of course not.

615
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,600
Besides, I hid Min Dacheng in a place he can do nothing about.

616
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,300
Is there a place Military Governor Pei cannot find in Beijing?

617
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,000
I don't believe it.

618
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,100
It's the foreign embassy.

619
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,700
Second Brother.

620
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:04,000
You are an old fox.

621
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,100
But...

622
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,600
if my brother tricks Military Governor Pei like this,

623
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,300
he would assume that we are alike.

624
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,600
Wouldn't my future father-in-law's view of me

625
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,600
be fully damaged by you?

626
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,900
What father-in-law? Go back as soon as the business is done!

627
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,100
Got it?

628
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,200
Why should I go back?

629
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,700
- You…
- Sister-in-Law!

630
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,700
Look, my brother glares at me.

631
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,500
I'm weak, a female, and young.

632
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Aren't you ashamed of bullying me?

633
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,800
Sister-in-Law, look, he still glares at me.

634
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,300
Are you courting death? Do you want me to beat you?

635
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,800
Just wait!

636
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,300
Bad girl.

637
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,900
If I knew she would behave like that, I should have kept her with me.

638
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,700
You don't know how she worried about you

639
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,000
when you were absent just now.

640
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,700
She is just stubborn.

641
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Wanqing, I want to tell you.

642
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,200
After everything is done,

643
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,300
if she is reluctant to return to Shanghai, please help me persuade her.

644
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,700
In a word, she can't stay here.

645
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,300
She also asked me to persuade you.

646
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,800
You are at odds with each other,

647
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,900
placing me, an outsider, in a dilemma.

648
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,500
You aren't an outsider.

649
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,600
You are my future wife, my fiancée.

650
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,400
You're not an outsider.

651
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,600
Do you want to go back on your word?

652
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,100
I'm going to put a stamp on you,

653
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,900
and tell everybody that you're mine.

654
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,700
Stop it. There are so many people here.

655
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,100
It's not good to be seen.

656
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,760
It's for them.
