It's the Southern government that wanted to frame him.

You could have just played along

I don't understand why you didn't do that.

51

Do you think the Southern government would be so kind

52

as to help us get rid of him?

They have their motives.

54

Our fathers are busy mobilizing allied forces of the five provinces.

55
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:46,640
At that moment, the South sent an assassin to kill Guangyao and frame Tan Xuanlin for it.

56
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,190
Shanghai would have been in turmoil had they succeeded.

57
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,590

Guangyao.

60
00:03:55,346 --> 00:03:59,290
From the very beginning, you requested to deal with the case yourself.

61
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,839
Were you trying to prevent Uncle Xu from creating trouble?

62
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:05,284
Since you had seen to this case yourself,

00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:08,376
Uncle Xu won't be able to take advantage of the situation.

Uncle Liao, I know.

146
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:30,897
Back then, because you argued fiercely with Provincial Military Governor Luo

Back then, they ran into horse bandits who stole our supplies.

And your father died on the battlefield. Not only did Provincial Military Governor Luo not care,

151
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:47,701
he also blamed your father entirely for losing the battle

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,960
and tell us that we couldn't even beat horse bandits.

159

00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:31,955
You saw how brutal the defeat was.

164
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:35,782
Have you ever had any doubts?

165
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:38,259
Actually, I've always suspected

166
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:42,040
that your father didn't run into horse bandits.

167
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,010
Uncle Liao, you also think they weren't horse bandits?

168
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,780
Horse bandits usually just want money.

169
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,100
They don't simply slaughter people.

170
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:58,492
But back then, they detonated rocks in the mountains to block the path.

171
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:02,880
Your father, older brother, and every single soldier were killed.

172
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,480
I can't imagine horse bandits having such combat effectiveness.

173
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,780
For the past ten years, I searched everywhere,

174
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,630
but I never heard of those bandits again.

175
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,430
If they were truly horse bandits,

176
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,630
they wouldn't simply abandon their life as outlaws after just one fight.

177
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:25,439
Unfortunately, there were no survivors.

178
00:13:26,107 --> 00:13:28,413
Every time I dream of my father,

179
00:13:28,413 --> 00:13:33,055
I want to ask him what actually happened back then.

180
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:36,588
But I eventually wake up.

181
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,968
This is a bullet I removed from your father's body.

182
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:04,162
I've kept it all these years.

183
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:07,714
Maybe it can help.

184
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:13,495
An expanding bullet.

185
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,248
The wounds in all the bodies were large.

186
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:21,655
Many had half of their chest blown up.

187
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:27,375
This kind of bullet is prohibited in regular armies around the world.

188
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,681
Mr. Liao, so what you're saying is

189
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:35,070
if regular armies wouldn't use it, then horse bandits wouldn't ever use it.

190
00:14:39,654 --> 00:14:43,300
Xuanlin, I also want to tell you that

191
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,017
many things are not what they seem.

192
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:54,060
The injustice that the Tan Family suffered years ago should not be inflicted on others now.

193
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,635
Uncle Liao, what are you implying?

194
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,780
That year, the horse bandits your father confronted might not be horse bandits.

195
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,796
And last night's Revolutionary Party member in the Far East Hotel,

196
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:13,491
might not have been a Revolutionary Party member.

197
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:23,109
Uncle Liao, what new business are you in?

198
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,624
Don't make others do what you yourself don't want to do.

199
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:32,378
What happened in the past and what happened today…

200
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:37,740
I just hope that Little Commander Tan can find the truth.

201
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,618
Yes.

202
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:47,216
The case has been closed already. The Revolutionary Party was indeed behind it.

203
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:50,564
Father, I simply couldn't ignore the truth.

204
00:15:50,564 --> 00:15:52,380
The truth is not important.

205
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,177
You are too soft-hearted to beat that Mr. Tan.

206
00:15:56,177 --> 00:15:58,812
You let such a good chance slip.

207
00:15:58,812 --> 00:16:00,799
<i>Yes… Father.</i>

208
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,302
It's my fault. I deserve to be punished.

209
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:06,683
<i>Never mind that. You are a righteous man.</i>

210
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:08,750
If you actually did something against your heart,

211
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,454
I'm afraid you wouldn't be able to live with it.

212
00:16:10,454 --> 00:16:12,052
Thank you for your understanding.

213
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:14,576
<i>Politics is like playing chess.</i>

214
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:18,268
Once you lose your opportunity, you can never get it back.

215
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,820
Luckily, you don't win or lose in just one round.

216
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,591
<i>According to the first article of the covenant signed by Tan Xuanlin,</i>

217
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:27,440
the deadline to dismiss the Tan Army is approaching.

218
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,369
This round, we must win.

219
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:31,974
Yes.

220
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:36,399
Uncle Liao, since the assassination attempt last night,

221
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,812
the military governor's mansion has ordered me to hunt down every Revolutionary Army member in the city.

222
00:16:40,812 --> 00:16:44,427
It'll be chaotic out there for quite some time.

223
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:49,807
Doing business isn't easy. Please take care.

224
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:51,568
Of course.

225
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:55,778
But I'm just a businessman. No one will look for trouble with me.

226
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,819
Uncle Liao, don't make it difficult for me.

227
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,229
I understand.

228
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:13,209
Commander Tan,

229
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,745
until next time.

230
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,870
Mr. Liao, until next time.

231
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:58,960
Where did you get the bullet? Is it really from Old Commander Tan's body?

232
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,705
Old Fu, do you remember Dr. Liao?

233
00:18:03,318 --> 00:18:05,966
I remember him. The doctor beside Old Commander Tan.

234
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:08,759
He was very gentle. An educated person.

235
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:12,715
I met him. He gave it to me.

236
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:15,177
He kept it for all these years.

237
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:19,466
He also believes the people who killed my father

238
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,513
might not have been horse bandits.

239
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:23,180
I knew it!

240
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,476
Commander Tan could never be defeated by a bunch of horse bandits.

241
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:30,680
However, all of the soldiers who followed Commander Tan died with him.

242
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,299
No one knows what happened in the valley.

243
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:44,859
Unacceptable!

244
00:18:45,318 --> 00:18:48,663
How dare they rank Tan higher than us!

245
00:18:48,663 --> 00:18:52,234
<i>[Tan Xuanlin ,Top of The Four Junior Marshals]</i>
Calling him the Top of the Four?

246
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:55,580
Are they out of their mind? Him?

247
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:06,699
It's just a tabloid. Don't take it so seriously.

248
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,830
Tan Xuanlin is simply a horse bandit.
<i>[Junior Marshal Su Hongchen, Junior Marshal Pei Shaojun, Junior Marshal Xu Guangyao]</i>

249
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,920
How can he be on the same level as us?

250
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,543
But in terms of title, we are indeed lower than him.

251
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:27,566
He's just a puppet commander. That's nothing to be proud of.

252
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:32,166
I just hate seeing him looking so proud.

253
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,680
He is reluctant to dismiss the Tan Army.

254
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,710
Maybe he wants to be more than a puppet.

255
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,868
That's not up to him.

256
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,724
Mr. Executive Director, it's been a long time.

257
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:33,763
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

258
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:36,896
You invited me over several times before,

259
00:20:36,896 --> 00:20:40,099
but I was too busy filming to meet you.

260
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:43,839
So be my guest today, and accept my apology.

261
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,337
Miss Gu, don't apologize.

262
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:49,740
Whenever you want to see me, I…

263
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,326
I'm always available.

264
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:55,273
Thank you, Mr. Executive Director.

265
00:20:55,273 --> 00:20:59,123
Mr. Executive Director! What a coincidence!

266
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,020
Commander Tan.

267
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,310
- Tan Xuanlin?
- Your secretary said you have an appointment tonight.

268
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,680
- Anton Fay?
- It turns out you're with Miss Gu.

269
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,068
What…

270
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:11,831
Why are they two together?

271
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:15,200
I don't think we are meeting here by coincidence.

272
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:18,599
No one can fool you.

273
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,399
I tried to make an appointment several times but was always rejected by your secretary.

274
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:26,279
That's why I had to ask Miss Gu for this favor. Please don't blame me.

275
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,823
Mr. Joseph is my friend.

276
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:32,800
You captured him, calling him an assassin.

277
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,127
You, Commander Tan, just took office.

278
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:39,409
Are you flexing your strength?

279
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:43,570
Mr. Executive Director, you are very well versed in the Chinese language, you even know this idiom.

280
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,699
But, really, the idiom is not very suitable.

281
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:52,471
In front of you, I'm actually a follower.

282

<i>[Supervisor's Office]</i>

283
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100

- I was at the cigar bar...
- Wait.

285
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,100
How did you get in?

286
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,700
I'm Junior Marshal Su.

287
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,800
Can't I enter?

288
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,200
I want to tell you something serious.

289
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,300
I was selecting cigars at the bar.

290
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,800
Guess who I saw?

291
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,420
Gu Yueshuang.

292
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,300
Yes, I saw her indeed.

293
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,400
But she was with Tan Xuanlin.

294
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,200
They're a couple.

295
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,700
There's nothing weird about them being together.

296
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,300
But the other person with them is

297
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,600
someone you can never guess.

298
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,500
Big deal. Who was it?

299
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,700
Anton Fay.

300
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,800
You want to build…

301
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,600
You want to build a Chamber of Commerce militia?

302
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,700
Yes.

303
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,200
My men are all veterans who fought in real battles.

304
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,000
They can surely maintain law and order well.

305
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,100
Now the Municipal Council only has patrolmen and military police,

306
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,000
and it's not appropriate for them to intervene

307
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
in disputes between Chinese people.

308
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,800
If we can build this militia, things can be much easier.

309
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,600
Well…

310
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,500
If I remember it correctly, Commander Tan,

311
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,100
as soon as you took office,

312
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,800
you signed an agreement with the military governor's mansion.

313
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,300
The first article was to dismiss your army.

314
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,100
And the deadline is approaching.

315
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,800
Mr. Executive Director, you have a great memory.

316
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,200
The thing is, my soldiers' only skill is fighting.

317
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,100
But the military governor's mansion insists that they be sent to factories.

318
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,100
It's a waste of their fighting skills.

319
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,400
Besides, the current situation is very uncertain.

320
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,900
The Revolutionary Army may enter the city at any time.

321
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,700
The military governor's mansion obviously has its hands full.

322
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,900
Mr. Executive Director, don't you want a private militia

323
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,100
that truly belongs to Shanghai?

324
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,400
Depending on the sky and the earth

325
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,900
is no better than depending on ourselves.

326
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,500
I think it is you who wants an armed force

327
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,300
without any interference from others.

328
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,700
Great minds think alike.

329
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,900
Your proposal is quite interesting.

330
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,600
I think...

331
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,900
I... I can consider it.

332
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,900
It's just that…

333
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,500
It's just that I need to see

334
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,200
your sincerity.

335
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,400
Rest assured, Mr. President.

336
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,700
I'll arrange a romantic night for you.

337
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,800
Tan Xuanlin went to find Anton Fay.

338
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,200
What exactly does he want to do?

339
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,700
No matter what he wants,

340
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,500
it can't be a good thing for us.

341
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,200
I remember you and Anton Fay's female secretary are pretty close.

342
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,900
She's just one of my many admirers.

343
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,000
You could say we are close.

344
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Anyway, that foreign girl does like me.

345
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Say it. What do you want me to do?

346
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,800
I want you to ask her what they talked about.

347
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,400
<i>[The Dancing Hall]</i>

348

<i>Oh dear, we've been married for so many years.</i>

349
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,200
<i>I didn't even know you were so romantic.</i>

350
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,400
<i>I'm so happy with this anniversary.</i>

351
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,200
<i>Anything you want, darling.</i>

352
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,100
Young Uncle, you are so bad.

353
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,700
You had everything arranged but didn't tell me. I was so nervous.

354
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,400
You shouldn't have been. I'm here.

355
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,900
No one can take advantage of you.

356
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,500
That's true.

357
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,400
I only need my Young Uncle in my life. I don't have to marry.

358
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,100
All right, all right. Go back home.

359
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,500
- Drive slowly.
- I'm off then.

360
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,600
- Take care.
- Bye.

361
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,400
Don't drive too fast.

362
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,800
Commander, Miss Shuang'er is just like before.

363
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,000
- She's so close to you.
- Of course, she is close to me.

364
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,100
I saved her life. It would be impossible if we didn't have a bond.

365
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
Commander,

366
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,700
do you think Anton Fay will help us for Miss Shuang'er's sake?

367
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,500
Of course, he won't. He's shrewd.

368
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,400
It won't be easy to win him over.

369
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,200
And you are not worried?

370
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,400
The deadline to dismiss our army is approaching.

371
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,500
Food should be eaten one bite at a time.

372
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,000
A journey should be taken one step at a time.

373
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,800
Great!

374
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,400
If I were you, I'd be in no mood to eat or sleep.

375
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
You know, that phrase...

376
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,800
that describes when the sky collapses suddenly in front of your face,

377
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,000
yet you remain completely calm.

378
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,200
The sky fell when I was fifteen.

379
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,700
Don't worry. The sky of the Tan Family won't fall.

380
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,300
- Open the door.
- Okay, okay.

381
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,600
<i>[Supervisor's Office]</i>

382
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
<i>I got the information, Guangyao.</i>

<i>Tan Xuanlin wants to reform his army</i>

All right, I got it.

387
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,900
Junior Marshal?

388
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,900
Tan Xuanlin is scheming to persuade Anton Fay,

389
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,300
so he can reform his army

390
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,000
into a militia for the Chamber of Commerce.

391
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,500
He's just a nominal commander of Shanghai.

392
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,400
Anton Fay won't risk offending the military governor's mansion to help him, right?

393
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,000
It's hard to say.

394
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,700
From Anton Fay's perspective,

395
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,400
the current situation is uncertain.

396
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,800
Having more guns in his hands means more certainty.

397
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,000
Tan Xuanlin's proposal is exactly what he wants.

398
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,400
There's no guarantee he won't be tempted.

399
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,800
If we had known it,

400
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,900
we should have framed him for the assassination.

401
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,800
And the military governor would have been satisfied.

402
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,700
I know, I know. One shouldn't only follow the ways of the world

403
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,200
but also righteousness.

404
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:04,100
It seems that I need to visit this Mr. Executive Director.

405
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,900
Come in.

406
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,700
Why are you here?

407
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,100
The door was open, so I just entered.

408
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,800
Well, Tan Si forgot to keep the door closed.

409
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,400
Should I not be here?

410
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
No.

411
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,000
Give them to me.

412
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,800
Thank you.

413
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,300
Why did you want to see me?

414
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,800
No reason. I just wanted to see how your wound was.

415
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,500
Don't worry. It's just a small wound.

416
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,400
It's almost fully recovered.

417
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You're in a bad mood today.

418
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,320
Am I?

419
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,200
Are you worried about the reorganization of the Tan Army?

420
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,800
You said that it'll happen by the end of this year.

421
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,000
I heard the military governor's mansion has been pushing you.

422
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,700
If you find it difficult, maybe I can ask my father

423
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,500
if he can move your men onto Mu property.

424
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,200
I'm not pushing you for Brother Guangyao.

425
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,000
I really just want to help you.

426
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,100
After all, my family can offer the highest salaries for your men.

427
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,900
You... might not be able to help me on this issue.

428
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,300
Don't worry. A self-interested man like me…

429
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,200
I'll surely ask for your help if it's needed.

430
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,000
I won't be passive about it. You can go.

433
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,400
Brother Guangyao?

434
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,800
What's going on?

435
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,700
I made an appointment with Anton Fay.

436
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,200
I'll discuss with him the reorganization of the Tan Army.

437
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,800
You can go back and rest today.

438
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,600
You don't need to prepare my dinner.

439

Of course, I should show you my gratitude.

Let me introduce you. This is Miss Mu Wanqing.

485
00:34:40,756 --> 00:34:42,928
She is my foreign language secretary now.

486
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:47,616
Miss Mu, I've seen you at some parties before but it was only a glimpse of such beauty.

487
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:51,080
Now I see you do have an outstanding disposition.

488
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,270
Truly, the First Daughter of Shanghai.

489
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,640
I'm flattered, Mr. Executive Director.

490
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,270
I hope in the future you will be able to advise me during my work in Shanghai.

491
00:34:59,278 --> 00:35:03,480
Then it will be my pleasure to serve Miss Mu.

492
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:13,892
Mr. Executive Director, let's sit down and talk while we have dinner.

493
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:15,502
All right.

494
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,080
<i>[Far East Hotel]</i>

495
00:35:25,674 --> 00:35:28,720
Commander, Miss Mu is with Supervisor Xu.

496
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,120
Do you still have to look out for her?

497
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,596
You have no idea. Anton Fay is a pervert.

498
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:37,220
Xu Guangyao can't handle him.

499
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:43,520
Executive Director Fay,

500
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,130
Today, the Municipal Council sent the Command a copy of a report

501
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:48,459
on the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry of Japan.

502
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:50,450
The report says that Japanese cotton yarn factories are

503
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,718
willing to provide low-interest loans for Chinese cotton yarn factories.

504
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,593
Have you seen it?

505
00:35:55,593 --> 00:35:57,040
Yes, I have.

506
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,079
But I think Miss Mu knows best

507
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,760
about issues about the cotton yarn industry.

508
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,160
After all, almost half of the cotton yarn factories here in Shanghai

509
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,699
belong to the Mu Family.

510
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:13,692
What's your opinion, Miss Mu?

511
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:18,203
The loans from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce. Should we take it?

512
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:21,779
Executive Director Fay, a shrewd man like you must know the pros and cons of this issue.

513
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,840
The Japanese cotton yarn businessmen want to take over the Chinese market using this method.

514
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,820
They would then dominate the market and inflate the prices.

515
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,147
They've already ruined the cotton yarn market in Tianjin and Qingdao.

516
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:36,779
Now they want to do it again with Shanghai's market.

517
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:41,659
If Executive Director Fay allows them, Shanghai would be in turmoil sooner or later.

518
00:36:43,192 --> 00:36:45,626
Look at her. She's not only a foreign language secretary,

519
00:36:45,626 --> 00:36:49,617
but an economy secretary as well.

520
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:53,753
But your family have their own cotton suppliers

521
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,320
and warehouses on the pier.

522
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,439
You also have established sales channels.

523
00:36:57,439 --> 00:37:01,179
I guess you won't be affected.

524
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:04,060
But the cotton yarn industry is critical to the people's well-being.

525
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,139
It affects the common people.

526
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:09,420
If it falls into Japanese hands, we'd be under their control.

527
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,979
Just imagine, Executive Director Fay, if we'd have to get our coats for the army,

528
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:18,159
quilts for civilians, or medical gauze for hospitals from the Japanese.

529
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:20,379
I don't believe you would be at ease.

530
00:37:20,379 --> 00:37:22,380
That's Mr. Mu's daughter.

531
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,899
You have great long-term thinking.

532
00:37:24,899 --> 00:37:26,684
The Mu Family is willing to offer loans

533
00:37:26,684 --> 00:37:29,114
to the cotton yarn factories so they can get through the hard times.

534
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,860
Also, without interest.

535
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,942
Aren't you openly confronting the Japanese then?

536
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:40,248
So… if I choose your side and turn the Japanese down,

537
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:43,562
then… I would seem unfair.

538
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,954
You don't have to worry about that, Executive Director Fay.

539
00:37:45,954 --> 00:37:50,145
I have an idea where you can please both sides.

540
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:52,960
Tell me about it.

541
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:25,570
Executive Director Fay, the Tan Army is awaiting reorganization.

542
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,860
If they can be put into the cotton yarn factories,

543
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,379
the Mu Family can give the factories money in the name of their resettlement fees.

544
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:33,407
With the money to overcome their hardship,

545
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:35,720
the factories naturally won't have to take loans from the Japanese.

546
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
And the Japanese can't blame you

547
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,190
for preventing the factories from taking their loans.

548
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:46,160
And more importantly, by resettling the Tan Army into cotton yarn factories,

549
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,915
Commander Tan can't build his Chamber of Commerce militia.

550
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:58,756
<i>So he wants to turn the army into a militia.</i>

551
00:38:58,756 --> 00:39:01,439
<i>No wonder he doesn't want my help.</i>

552
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:06,748
Junior Marshal Xu, look at you, beating around the bush for so long.

553
00:39:06,748 --> 00:39:12,319
You simply wish to remove this militia idea.

554
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:13,984
Right?

555
00:39:19,189 --> 00:39:22,682
Executive Director Fay, let me put my cards on the table.

556
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:26,400
Shanghai is under the jurisdiction of the military governor's mansion.

557
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,000
And the military governor's mansion won't allow any militia to exist.

558
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,150
So the best solution is to put them into industries, making them workers.

559
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,264
Miss Mu, it's a matter of your family's interest.

560
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:45,260
You are asking me to offend the Japanese and Commander Tan.

561
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:51,180
Shouldn't you have a couple of drinks with me first to show your sincerity?

562
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,094
Come on.

563
00:39:53,094 --> 00:39:55,250
Come on.

564
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,922
Executive Director Fay, Miss Mu can't drink.

565
00:39:57,922 --> 00:40:00,084
I'll drink for her.

566
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,638
Miss Mu, you ask for my help, but you won't drink with me.

567
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:10,240
Well… you are not sincere enough.

568
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,115
Executive Director Fay, I really can't stand foreign wine.

569
00:40:14,115 --> 00:40:16,470
No problem. Then…

570
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,343
we can drink Chinese Moutai.

571
00:40:19,343 --> 00:40:20,708
<i>[Moutai]</i>

572
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,987
Right?

573
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:33,802
Hurry up. Let's drink this.

574
00:40:33,802 --> 00:40:35,220
Here.

575
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,559
Be careful.

576
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,302
Executive Director Fay, Miss Mu really can't drink.

577
00:40:52,302 --> 00:40:54,620
Allow me to drink with you.

578
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,179
Hold on, Junior Marshal Xu.

579
00:40:56,179 --> 00:41:01,079
Well, if it's Miss Mu with whom I drink,

580
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,017
naturally, I drink one for her,

581
00:41:04,017 --> 00:41:05,909
and she drinks one for me.

582
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:09,900
But if it's with you, it's inappropriate.

583
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,493
Well then, how does Mr. Executive Director Fay want to drink with me?

584
00:41:15,493 --> 00:41:17,501
Six.

585
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:20,699
I like six. It's a good number.

586
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:22,759
Let's do this.

587
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:24,620
She drinks one,

588
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,480
then you drink six for her. Okay?
