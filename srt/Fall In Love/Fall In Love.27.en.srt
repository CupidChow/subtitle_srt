00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,400
Even though we lost many people this time,

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,100
I believe Pei Xun also lost many too.

17
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,400
On the whole, we have successfully accomplished our mission.

18
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,600
Accomplished our mission?

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,500
Every war will cause destruction to both sides.

20
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,600
What's the point of fighting?

21
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,800
Military Governor has lost his position.

22
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,900
We have to keep our army and territory

23
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,800
so that we can make a comeback.

24
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,100
It's a battle of life or death for the Xu family.

25
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,200
Keep fighting like this,

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,500
and we won't need others to deprive us of our military power.

27
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,200
Our army would have lost all its soldiers!

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,200
This is a direct order from the military governor.

29
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,000
Junior Marshal, are you going to defy the order?

30
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,400
A general in the front line can decide

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,300
on things even if it is against the king.

32
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,800
Guess who I am?

33
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,100
What are you doing, Old Su?

34
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,300
You're boring.

35
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,400
But why did you come here?

36
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,300
You left me in Shanghai.

37
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,400
It's too difficult for me to endure

38
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,000
when my bad friends are not around.

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,400
I have to get even with you for this.

40
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,300
Get even?

41
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,400
You're someone who favors women over friends.

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,100
Why didn't you stay with Miss Gu

43
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,700
instead of coming to find me?

44
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,500
You really are a man who has gone to war.

45
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,000
I can hear your combative tone.

46
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,000
<i>My leg!</i>

47
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,400
My leg!

48
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,400
- <i>Please!</i>
- Be careful with him.

49
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,900
- <i>Please save my leg.</i>
- We understand, Junior Marshal.

50
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,300
<i>Please save my leg!</i>

51
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,200
Are you okay?

52
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm fine.

53
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,000
My father sent you here?

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What? Are you afraid that I would take credit from you?

55
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,000
You shouldn't be here.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,900
Do you know why my father sent you to talk to me?

57
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,700
You're so stubborn and don't listen to him.

58
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,800
Who else can coerce you to go back home,

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,400
except for your childhood friend?

60
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,200
That's one reason.

61
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,800
The more important thing is that

62
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,600
you're the son of Military Governor Su.

63
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,500
He wants to put you in the middle of this.

64
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,100
That is to say that he wants the Su family to be in the middle of this.

65
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,500
That would force the Pei family to make concessions.

66
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,800
You knew your father was being deliberate.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,200
So why don't you come back with me?

68
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,500
If I go back home,

69
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,500
no one will care about the lives of the soldiers here.

70
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,600
I made it very clear when I came here.

71
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,200
We are all soldiers of the Xu family.

72
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,100
We only have one life.

73
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,800
We'll go together,

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,100
or we'll die together.

75
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,800
You can go back now.

76
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,300
Just tell my father you can't persuade me.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,400
My father won't put you in an awkward situation.

78
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,000
What a powerful line, going together or dying together.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,300
You're loyal.

80
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,000
And I'm not terrified either.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,200
I definitely won't leave you alone.

82
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,900
Do you know once you're in the middle of this,

83
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,700
you can't get away.

84
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,600
I certainly know.

85
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,400
To force the Pei family to make concessions…

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,100
What's your father going to do?

87
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,200
Pei Xun wants to force my father to retire from politics

88
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,500
and hand over his army.

89
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,700
My father wants to protect the army as the bottom line.

90
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,300
He refused to hand over the army.

91
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,300
By putting you in the middle of it,

92
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,600
he's trying to use you as the last chip of this battle.

93
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,300
If Military Governor Pei retains the Xu Army,

94
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,000
then there's no need to fight anymore.

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,300
What are you going to do?

96
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm already in the middle of this.

97
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,700
I have to make some noise for you.

98
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,600
Take me to see your commander.

99
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,700
Staff officer.

100
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,800
Aren't you Military Governor Su's son?

101
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,500
Yes, that's me.

102
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,200
I can't believe you remember me.

103
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,800
I remember you.

104
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,000
When I was the adjutant of Military Governor Pei,

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,600
you asked our junior marshal to cut classes with you.

106
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,100
Our junior marshal was whipped by

107
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,700
our military governor many times because of that.

108
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,000
The Pei family people are so vindictive.

109
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,200
Sir, this is a battlefield.

110
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,400
What are you doing here?

111
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,600
Mr. Xu and Mr. Pei

112
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,500
are my best friends.

113
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,100
I just don't want to see them

114
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,600
hurting each other.

115
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,300
Things aren't going to work if you stick to this.

116
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,500
Why don't you meet each other halfway?

117
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,300
You're a persuader from the Xu family.

118
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,400
I'm a mediator, not a persuader.

119
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
If you keep fighting for one more day,

120
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,300
there will be more people who will die on both sides.

121
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,000
Military Governor Xu has to retire from politics and hand over his army.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This is non-negotiable.

123
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,300
What would you do if he hands over the army?

124
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,600
Aren't you afraid that if his army assimilates into your own,

125
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
there might be spies...

126
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,800
that might be planted from within?

127
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,300
You are biting off more than you can chew.

128
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,800
If you fight again,

129
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,800
I'll just stand on the battlefield.

130
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,700
Who would dare to shoot me?

131
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,900
Boy, you want to enter the battlefield?

132
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,200
I'll tie you up now and send you to your father.

133
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,000
Who dares?

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,500
<i>[Mailbox]</i>
<i>Worthless.</i>

135
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,600
You're all worthless!

136
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,500
We were set up by that kid,

137
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,400
and you didn't even notice that?

138
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,300
Father.

139
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,800
Please don't be angry.

140
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,200
Your friend Su Hongchen

141
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,700
trespassed into our military camp yesterday afternoon,

142
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,400
and he put a gun to his head

143
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,200
to stick up for the Xu family.

144
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,400
Who does he think he is?

145
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,100
Nobody cares if he is not part of the Su family.

146
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,600
Father, it's my fault.

147
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,700
If I had listened to you and gone to the front line,

148
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,210
maybe I could have talked to Old Su.

149
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,800
Is that so?

150
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Once in a blue moon, you talk some sense.

151
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,000
The sun has risen from the west.

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,200
Father, I was ignorant before.

153
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,100
I just cared about myself,

154
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,400
and forgot my responsibilities.

155
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,300
Now that the situation on the battlefield is becoming dire,

156
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,600
I keep thinking if I go to the front line

157
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,100
and my enemy is Guangyao,

158
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,200
our armies might not suffer so many casualties.

159
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,400
Your whipping was not for nothing.

160
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,600
You remember that!

161
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,400
Now you're talking!

162
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,500
Father, what's done is done.

163
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
We have to deal with Xu Bojun

164
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
and the Revolutionary Army.

165
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,800
But we can't afford to offend the Su family.

166
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,200
But your childhood friend, Su Hongchen,

167
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,400
seems to have decided to help the Xu family.

168
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,400
I don't think he's helping the Xu family.

169
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,000
This battle won't do us any good too.

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,300
You have said that before.

171
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,000
If we can settle the matter another way,

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,600
we wouldn't lose more soldiers.

173
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,900
But now, the Xu family will fight to the death.

174
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,600
We'll suffer great losses

175
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
even though we broke them down.

176
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,500
I have a good reason

177
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,700
for waging this battle.

178
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,400
I have every confidence in it.

179
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,600
That old dog, Xu Bojun, won't have any chance to win.

180
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,000
If we give everything we've got,

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,100
we can certainly win.

182
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,100
But now,

183
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,200
Guangyao and Old Su are on the front line.

184
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,500
If they die, we not only offend the Su family,

185
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,300
but this can also lead to the reversal of public opinion.

186
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,400
The public will condemn our family.

187
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,600
What do you mean?

188
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,100
Guangyao is the only child of the Xu family.

189
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,400
He always maintains a good reputation.

190
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,400
If he dies in battle,

191
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,500
there would be no descendants of the Xu family.

192
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,800
This would make everybody feel pity for Xu Bojun.

193
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,500
We would have wasted all the efforts we had made before.

194
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,500
<i>Junior Marshal is right.</i>

195
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,100
Send a telegraph to the staff officer.

196
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,600
Order the troop to retreat 20 miles.

197
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,000
And temporarily cease fire.

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,600
Yes.

199
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,900
And tell Xu Bojun,

200
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,800
if he hands over his army

201
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,500
and resigns as Military Governor of Yue City,

202
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,000
I can appoint him as

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,200
political envoy of the four provinces of eastern China.

204
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Yes.

205
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,300
That's a promotion for Xu Bojun, even though he lost the case.

206
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,200
That won't work with the public.

207
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Everyone will question whether Xu Bojun is guilty or not.

208
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,400
You don't understand.

209
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,900
I'm kicking him from upstairs.

210
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,500
No matter if he's guilty or not,

211
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,300
as long as he hands over his army,

212
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,000
it doesn't matter if he is a political envoy or messenger.

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,900
He'll be left out from the military or commanding office.

214
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,100
Will our people still believe us

215
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,600
if we keep doing this?

216
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,400
You think like a woman.

217
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
There's no point in making them believe in you.

218
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,200
You need to make them fear you.

219
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,400
Pei Xun is afraid that he'll offend the Su family.

220
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,600
He fears that the fight against us will lead to personal casualties.

221
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,600
So he's offering a truce.

222
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,800
I sent Su Hongchen to the front line.

223
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,500
it's not because he's a childhood friend of Guangyao,

224
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,500
but because he's part of the Su family.

225
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,000
He can help me bring Guangyao back home because they're childhood friends.

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,800
He can also force Pei Xun

227
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,200
to make a truce because of his family.

228
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,800
In this game of chess, there is no winning or losing.

229
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,400
Pei Xun and I are in a deadlock.

230
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,800
So Su Hongchen

231
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,400
will allow us all to live.

232
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,800
You're cautious and prudent.

233
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,000
Pei Xun not only offered a truce,

234
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,600
but also pronounced that if you hand over the army,

235
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
he will also give you a promotion.

236
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,800
The military officer of the four provinces is just a nominal position.

237
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,900
He wants to exchange my army with that position?

238
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,100
That's not going to happen.

239
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,700
Go and tell Pei Xun.

240
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,900
I can resign from the ,military governor position and offer him

241
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,300
my seat in the Beijing government.

242
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,000
But I will never give my army.

243
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,000
Reporting for duty.

244
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,900
Governor, as Adjutant Xu required,

245
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,100
we found the people that Junior Marshal

246
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,200
<i>[File]</i>
was searching for in the smuggling case.

247
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,900
They did smuggle firearms for the Pei family.

248
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,910
They also confirmed that

249
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,200
those who attempted to assassinate Junior Marshal at the dinner party at the Command

250
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,000
were not from the Revolutionary Army but one of theirs.

251
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,700
It really was Pei Xun.

252
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,400
This suddenly makes sense.

253
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,800
Guangyao knew about his dirty business.

254
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Pei Xun thought he couldn't hide the facts, so he attempted to assassinate Guangyao.

255
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,300
When he said he wanted to reverse the case for the Mu family,

256
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,400
he actually wanted to take me down.

257
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,500
Guangyao is soft-hearted.

258
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,800
He tried to smooth things over.

259
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,200
However, he accidentally helped our enemies turn against me.

260
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Governor, since we have some evidence

261
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,300
that can be held against Pei Xun,

262
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,900
why don't we take this chance

263
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,300
to pin him down?

264
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,700
This is destiny.

265
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,400
What is done by night appears by day.

266
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Pei Xun is preparing to take my position in the Beijing government.

267
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,100
If a scandal about him becomes exposed,

268
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,000
the Pei family would completely lose face.

269
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,200
He would have nothing left to bargain with me.

270
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,400
Junior Marshal.

271
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,800
These were sent by Xu Bojun.

272
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,300
He's trying to buy his army back with this.

273
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,000
Did you see that?

274
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,400
What else can you say about

275
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,000
Xu Guangyao being nice?

276
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,400
He was keeping information from Xu Bojun,

277
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,600
and he was trying to smooth things over.

278
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,900
You said that he's trying to turn hostility into friendship.

279
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,400
That's bullshit!

280
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,700
You should be aware that

281
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,800
they're father and son sitting on the same bench

282
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,700
in this moment of life and death!

283
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,200
Father, I know that I was wrong.

284
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,900
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

285
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,600
Xu Bojun is holding evidence that is unfavorable to us.

286
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
He said if we promise to let his army go,

287
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,700
he'll be silent.

288
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,400
Otherwise, he'll tell the truth publicly.

289
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,700
I wanted to take this chance to defeat Xu Bojun.

290
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,900
But now, he has grabbed me by my neck.

291
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,600
This is called losing the whole game after one careless move.

292
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,800
Father, what's done is done.

293
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,100
Why don't we agree with his terms?

294
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,500
That's easy for you to say!

295
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,300
Do you know his terms?

296
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,500
He only agreed to resign his status as military governor, and his position in Beijing.

297
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,000
But he said he won't give up his army.

298
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,800
If I agree with him,

299
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,700
that would mean that he did not actually retire from politics.

300
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,300
Father.

301
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,400
What if Xu Bojun hands over his army to you?

302
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,500
Do you dare to use them?

303
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
You not only would be afraid of using them,

304
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,100
but you would have to redeploy a large number of people to monitor them.

305
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,300
Why don't we send them back

306
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,800
to their stations instead?

307
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,400
They can protect us from the Revolutionary Army.

308
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,000
<i>[To Military Governor Xu]</i>

309
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,600
Pei Xun wrote on the telegraph saying that

310
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,400
he agrees with our terms.

311
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,500
He'll ask for the man you recommend

312
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,000
to administrate our army,

313
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,800
as long as you resign.

314
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,200
That was a good play on our part in this game.

315
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,400
Even though we lost some nominal titles

316
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,000
and lost face,

317
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,400
we still have our military power and territory.

318
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,500
Pei Xun has fought against us for so long,

319
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
yet he only looks good on the surface.

320
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,700
So who won?

321
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,700
I'd say we won.

322
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,300
Now that we have achieved our purpose,

323
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,000
it's not worth playing with Pei Xun.

324
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,800
All right.

325
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,100
Send a telegraph informing him that

326
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,300
I'll resign my status as military governor

327
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,100
of Yue City starting today.

328
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,000
All armies of the military governor's mansion will be

329
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,500
managed by you two for the moment.

330
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,400
Send a telegraph to Guangyao

331
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,900
asking him to bring the troops back.

332

To win without bleeding.

336
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,700
I'm not enjoying the undeserved fame of graduating

337
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,400
from the Baoding Military Academy.

338
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,600
Yes, you let Shaojun and me

339
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,300
get the spotlight all the time.

340

It's really a waste of your talent.

It's good of you to know that.

342
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,800
I just showed off a little bit of my abilities this time.

343

You guys always look down on me.

344

I'm sorry.

345
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,100
A great man will not remember the faults of a nobody.

346
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,700
The feeling of achievement is pretty good.

347
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,300
It's really better than drinking and eating.

348
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
How can I describe it?

349
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
You have a sense of accomplishment.

350
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,400
That's right.

351
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
A sense of accomplishment.

352
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,400
I have something

353
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,400
to brag about to Miss Gu this time.

354
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,100
Anyway,

355
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,900
I'm a soldier who has been in battle.

356
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,800
Not an inexperienced man

357
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,900
like she said before.

358
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,600
Guangyao.

359
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,000
To be honest with you,

360
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I used to be a man who thought he'd enjoy drinking

361
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and eating until the end of my life.

362
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,400
But when I saw

363
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,600
the deserted fields and abandoned villages,

364
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,000
I felt really terrible.

365
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,500
I finally understood

366
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,800
why Old Pei was willing to take the punishment

367
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,900
and not go to the front.

368
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,800
And I understand you.

369
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,000
I understand why you had

370
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,300
to go and retreat with your soldiers.

371
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,400
Hongchen,

372
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
thank you for coming here to rescue me.

373

You guys don't take me with you for important things.

374
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,300
But for me,

375
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,600
brotherhood is important.

376
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,500

Why have you suddenly decided to follow the teachings of Buddha?

400
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,449
Our family has made many mistakes

401
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:41,781
for us to come this far.

402
00:23:41,781 --> 00:23:43,444
Although we were forced to in many cases,

403
00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:46,728
I still feel guilty about that.

404
00:23:46,728 --> 00:23:49,438
I read Buddhist scriptures and maintain a vegetarian diet every day

405
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:51,040
in order to pay penance.

406
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,294
Even if we're not forgiven,

407
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:57,140
we can feel inner peace.

Father.

409
00:23:59,186 --> 00:24:02,510
You've been fighting for most of your life.

410
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,867
You've devoted all of your energy to it. And you lie awake all night.

411
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:06,676
If you can be at peace

412
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:08,800

413
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,893
that's really a fault on the right side.

Yes.

415
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:16,805
When I knew that you were besieged by Pei Xun,

416
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:18,576
I was thinking

417
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:22,681
wealth and power are but a flash in the pan.

418
00:24:22,681 --> 00:24:25,200
As long as you can come back safely,

419
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,589
I would resign my position.

420
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:30,026
I would even die

Why has the Marshal suddenly taken up the teachings of Buddha?

My father has changed.

429

Sit down for a minute.

497
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:49,261
My child was risking her life outside.

498
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,878
And I wasn't able to help.

499
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,820
Now she returns home triumphantly.

500
00:29:57,499 --> 00:30:00,239
I want to pick her up.

501
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:03,661
My Lord, you're…

502
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,076
- Commander.
- Old Wu.

503
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:20,002
I hope you had a good trip.

504
00:30:20,002 --> 00:30:23,224
It was good, thanks to you and Old Fu.

505

he'll wait for our wedding on the other side.

Who?

563
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:31,566
He was from Yue City. He was probably one of Xu Bojun's men.

I knew it was him.

He was protected by the Japanese in Beijing,

and I didn't get rid of him.

- No, Commander!
- What are you doing?

569
00:34:44,674 --> 00:34:46,729
I'm going to kill him.

570
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:48,047
He can disguise himself and go to Beijing.

571
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:49,691
I can disguise myself and go to Yue City.

572

Calm down, Commander! Boss Mu is dead.

574
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,276

It seems that having bodyguards to protect Wanqing when she's out is not enough.

604
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,542
It's not safe at home either.

605
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,806

I'll meet him as soon as the funeral is over.

617

Also, there was a call from Hong Kong

618
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:18,805
saying that Mu Wanting bought a ticket to Shanghai,

619

and she had a black gauze wrapped around her arm.

She is probably hurrying back for the funeral.

621

622

I'd look after her.

I didn't expect Boss Mu to come forward.

That old man, Mu Zhiyuan,

knew that he wouldn't live long.

629
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:47,881
So he traded one life for another.

630
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:51,953
He wanted to leave Mu Wanqing a supporter.

631
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,920

00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:06,790
Governor, do you think I should do it myself this time?

636
00:38:09,506 --> 00:38:12,370
No. Tan Xuanlin must be killed.

637
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,639
But he can't be killed by you.

I'm retired now and must reflect on my misdeeds in private.

I only do that to redeem our reputation

00:39:46,305 --> 00:39:48,285
to Wanqing a long time ago.

661
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,946
He lived in Fayuan Temple,

662
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:53,140
practiced abstinence from meat, and recited prayers.

663
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,320
Who would assassinate him this time?

664
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,698
Mr. Mu had kept Shanghai under control for many years.

665
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,126
And he had offended quite a few people.

666
00:40:11,126 --> 00:40:15,140
Maybe, someone was settling old scores with him.

667
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,220
I wouldn't know.

668
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,380
<i>[Buddhist Scriptures]</i>

669
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,016
Father, why are you transcribing Buddhist scriptures?

670
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:27,137
I feel guilty and sorry for the Mu family,

671
00:40:27,137 --> 00:40:29,534
so I wanted to transcribe Buddhist scriptures

672
00:40:29,534 --> 00:40:31,800
to calm my mind.

673
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,580
<i>[Mr. Yamashita]</i>
<i>Mr. Yamashita.</i>

674
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,365
<i>The Japanese.</i>

675
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,200
I just saw Xu Yuan go outside in a hurry.

676
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,312
Was it something urgent?

677
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,360
I asked Xu Yuan

678
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,223
to send a telegraph to Mr. Yamashita.

679
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,780
We have never had a connection with the Japanese before.

680
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,458
Why are you contacting Yamashita Junichi at this moment?

681
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:12,758
That's what I have to do.

682
00:41:12,758 --> 00:41:15,339
Pei Xun is keeping Beijing under his control now.

683
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:18,527
He also decided that our army was not good.

684
00:41:18,527 --> 00:41:21,136
Division commanders have kept looking for me these past two days.

685
00:41:21,136 --> 00:41:24,000
They said the army didn't get paid in full.

686
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,579
Our relationship with the Mu family is broken.

687
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:30,696
How can we maintain these troops

688
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,712
if we don't find a sponsor?

689
00:41:32,712 --> 00:41:34,129
So are you

690
00:41:34,129 --> 00:41:37,352
going to cooperate with the Japanese Chamber of Commerce?

691
00:41:37,874 --> 00:41:40,254
We're just using each other.

692
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:41,819
And we don't know whether

693
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:43,510
we can reach an agreement or not.
