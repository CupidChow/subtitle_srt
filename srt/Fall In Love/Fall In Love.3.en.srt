So this is the future you said you'd help me find.

16
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,690
Seems reasonable.

17
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,650
If you agree to hand over your military and financial power

18
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,740
and disband the Tan force,

19
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,690
then my father will not only send a telegram to admit you,

20
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,860
but will also recommend you to Army Headquarters

21
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,100
as a follower of the Xu family.

22

As soon as the letter of appointment arrives,

23
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,890
you'll be the rightful Commander of Shanghai.

A fine fowl perches only on fine trees.

25

Wouldn't this be a good time to join us?

26
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,900
"A fine fowl perches on fine trees." That's a very good line, I quite agree.

27
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,890
Well, how can I be sure that in your father's eyes,

28
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,090
I am a fine fowl and not a fat goose?

29
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,220
What do you mean?

30
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,960
Junior Marshal Xu, I'm afraid.

31
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,160
If I act on impulse and occupy Shanghai,

32
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,990
how many days can I stay as a member in the Provincial Military Governor's mansion

33
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,830
and also as the Commander of Shanghai,

34
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,820
after I agree to the ground rules and hand over the military and financial powers?

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,300
You don't trust my father?

36
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,050
Junior Marshal Xu, you can't say this.

37
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,090
You guys are forcing me to hand over military power.

38
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,290
Isn't it because you don't trust me?

39
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,620
You are disrespecting your elders.

40
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,960
My father is already very generous in acknowledging your coup

41
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,610
and recommending you as the Commander of Shanghai.

42
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,130
If you want to secure your position, the only way

43
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,520
is to hand over your powers.

44
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,770
So you are saying I have no other choice?

45
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,600
You are here to inform me instead of discussing it with me. Am I right?

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,980
This is not negotiable.

47
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,410
If you give up the powers, we'll let you be the commander.

48
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,070
If you do not,

49
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,840
the number of days you can remain in your position all depends on your luck.

50

After the Revolutionary Army retreats and the provincial military governor's army comes back,

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,830
what we will want from you won't be your powers, but your life.

52
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,136
It seems that I really have no choice.

<i>[Defense Deployment Map of Shanghai]</i>

54
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,470
Junior Marshal Tan, when you brought your army into Shanghai,

55
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,730
you should have known that you would be in trouble.

56
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,970
Let us both take a step back.

57
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,890
It's the best way to solve this problem.

58
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,570
You don't want to turn Shanghai into a battlefield,

59
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,640
do you?

60
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,640
Junior Marshal Xu,

61
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,290
I am a man who's not greedy for money and won't abuse power.

62
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,850
Of course, I can hand over the military and financial powers. I have no problem with that.

63
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,480
But my brothers from the Tan Army have been with me for ten years.

64
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,620
I won't leave them without finding them a way out.

65
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,790
This is simple.

66
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,844
I can take your soldiers to factories and offer them jobs.

67
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:09,680
As long as they are willing to retire, meaning they

68
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,350
take off their uniforms and hand in their guns,

69
00:05:11,356 --> 00:05:15,156
I promise that the Provincial Military Governor won't make things difficult for them.

70
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,060
Fine. If I agree to these ground rules,

71
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,440
how can you guarantee

72
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,330
that your father won't renege on it and go after me?

73
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,470
What do you want me to do so that you trust me?

74
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,928
How about this?

75
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,750
While your father promotes me, he shall also promote you

76
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,370
to the supervisor of the Defense Command of Shanghai.

77
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,800
You'll be based in Shanghai and cooperate with me to defend Shanghai.

78
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,650
What do you think?

79
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,876
Junior Marshal Tan, do you want me to be your hostage?

80
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:58,870
Junior Marshal Xu, I am treating you like a brother.

81
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,250
Moreover, there is a mixed group of people in Shanghai, both good and bad.

82
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,580
There are a variety of people with different ways of life.

83
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:07,050
Of course, I should find a respectable and prestigious person to help me in the Defense Command.

84
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,130
If I agree with you, will you agree to the ground rules?

85
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,650
Yes, and I will follow them word for word.

86
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,976
Okay. I will be your supervisor.

87
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:24,160
That's right.

88
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,770
As I expected, he added another condition.

89
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,630
He asked Guangyao to stay in Shanghai and be his supervisor.

90
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,330
And he asked both me and Provincial Military Governor Pei to send the telegram.

91
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,970
Provincial Military Governor Pei, what do you think?

92
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,860
It depends... on Mr. Mu's sincerity.

96
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,226
Don't worry. You can go home soon.

97
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,630
What did you talk about?

98
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,590
Don't worry about it. In short, the matter has been resolved.

99
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,240
Thank you. You're willing to risk negotiating for a nobody like me.

100
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,550
You're not a nobody. Everyone is worried about you.

101
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,570
Otherwise, how would that Mr. Tan agree to let you be the hostage instead of me?

102
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,970
He is not a fool.

103
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,290
That's because he didn't know

104
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,770
it was Wanting who should have done the first dance with you.

105
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:48,163
Frankly speaking, I have no intention of marrying Wanting.

106
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:50,966
But we're facing difficulties right now, so the elders want me to do so.

107
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:53,270
And I can't disobey them.

108
00:07:54,003 --> 00:07:57,830
I thought it was settled.

109
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,716
But then you showed up, making things different.

110
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:06,256
Maybe... this is destiny.

111
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:15,476
I've already called my father.

112
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:18,836
After we get the telegram, I'll take you home.

113
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,150
How could you accept those rules?

114
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,340
The three ground rules are just like three orders to control you.

115
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,930
After you hand in the financial and military powers, and disband the army,

116
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,640
you'll be the leader of nothing!

117
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,530
If Xu Bojun wants to settle old scores,

118
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,270
we can only wait and die.

119
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,539
Old Wu, do not worry. This is nothing to be concerned about.

120
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,850
Let's coax Xu Guangyao first. Let his father send the telegram

121
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,890
and make me the Commander of Shanghai.

122
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,040
We have no rights or money now. We have nothing to lose after all.

123
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,463
Why hasn't the telegram arrived yet?

124
00:08:57,463 --> 00:08:59,616
It's no rush.

125
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,635
Now, we can do nothing about this telegram anymore.

126
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:08,590
It all depends on Mr. Mu and how much he's willing to pay

127
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,000
to save his daughter.

128
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:22,650
Mr. Mu, we have done our best.

129
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,130
You should also take a step back.

130
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,170
After all, your daughter is still in danger.

131
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,330
Don't you worry about her?

132
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,470
Is there anything wrong with the Provincial Military Governors?

133
00:09:48,026 --> 00:09:51,090
No. I made it clear to my father.

134
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,179
Maybe they're writing it now.

135
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:04,903
Don't be afraid. If he doesn't let you go, I won't leave, either.

136
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,810
I didn't expect Shanghai to be in such a mess.

137
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,690
I've only been away for a decade.

138
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,870
It's us soldiers' fault.

139
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:22,910
Don't blame yourself. You are different from them.

140
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,000
We're in the same uniforms.

141
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,280
What's the difference?

142
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,420
Do you remember what you told me when we were young?

143
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,200
"A soldier's gun is not used to kill but to save people.

144
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,660
We bleed and make sacrifices on the battlefield in order to stop wars

145
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,270
and bring back peace so that people can live a better life."

146
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,430
You remembered after all this time?

147
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,460
I didn't understand when I was young.

148
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,750
And I didn't expect, by the time I grew up and understood it, I would be in Japan.

149
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,520
How come I understood it when I was young.

150
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,610
But as an adult, I'm confused.

151
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,280
Let's change topics.

152
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,296
After coming back this time, you won't leave again. Right?

153
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,565
These past few years I have wanted to write to you.

154
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:08,250
But I didn't know your address.

155
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,550
Are you still thinking about the airplane model I smashed?

156
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,630
I don't have money to pay you now.

157
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,060
You didn't smash it.

158
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,690
Your brother did. He was not…

159
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,170
I'm sorry, Wanqing.

160
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,090
I shouldn't have mentioned this.

161
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,225
It's fine.

162
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:28,840
My brother loved excitement and making friends.

163
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,180
He would be happy that another person still remembers him.

164
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,690
It's late.

165
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,629
Get some rest.

166
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,523
I'll stand guard at the door.

Did you receive the telegram?

As you expected, the military governors from every province

received a joint telegram from Xu Bojun and Pei Xun.

They appointed you as the Defense Commander of Shanghai.

Junior Marshal Tan,

191
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,580
you look refreshed.

192
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,070
You must be satisfied with the result, right?

193
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,860
Of course, I'm satisfied.

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,810
I am just a bandit who came out of a ravine.

Somehow I became a student of an aristocratic family.

How could I not be satisfied?

197
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,783
Junior Marshal Tan. Wait.

198
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:59,420
I should call you Commander Tan now.

199

It can't be a perfect result for you.

200

Indeed, there was something unpleasant.

201
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,530
Your father was too slow.

202
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,250
He didn't send it until this morning.

203
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,810
I barely slept last night.

204
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,720
Not like Junior Marshal Xu.

205
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,690
With such a beauty at hand, you must have had a wonderful night.

206
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,660
That's nonsense!

207
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:22,770
Commander Tan, we're going to be colleagues at the headquarters.

208
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,956
Let's respect each other.

209
00:14:25,956 --> 00:14:29,110
Respect? Of course, I will.

210
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,380
But I am so jealous of you.

211
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,320
You got fancy food

212

and a beautiful lady.

213
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,420
Last night, I rested at the door.

214
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,330
I didn't share the room with Wanqing.

215
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,680
If you don't believe this,

216
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,330
just ask your soldiers for proof.

217
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:49,500
Junior Marshal Xu, although you were outside the room,

218
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,623
you must be longing.

219
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,770

220
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,050
All right. I won't say anything.

Junior Marshal Xu can't take a joke.

222

Let's go.

223

Provincial Military Governor Xu, thank you for trusting and supporting me.

I will abide by the soldier's vocation

232

in order to maintain peace in Shanghai.

234

I'm really grateful.

you can always sleep well at night.

Of course.

241

I hope you won't regret it.

00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,946
Provincial Military Governor, I am your student.

244
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:30,200

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,790
I want to apologize to Mr. Mu today.

247
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:39,610
I didn't know that Miss Wanqing was your beloved daughter.

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,890
All right. A reunion is rare for you two families.

252
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,680
I won't bother you.

253

254
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,720

Mu Wanqing, tell me.

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,090
But you can't be like them.

324
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,210
Rest assured, Commander.

325
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,823
We have all suffered before.

326
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:58,930
Moreover, after ten years of vagrancy,

327
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,270
we finally have a stable residence.

328
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,040
We will cherish it.

329
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,750
It's not enough.

330
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,120
Follow me. Good days are yet to come.

331
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,390
Of course.

332
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,310
Since you were fifteen years old,

333
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,830
you have led us into all kinds of battles.

334
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,080
We are so lucky to follow you.

335
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,740
We will never be disgraced.

336
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,616
How is it? Have all the brothers settled down?

337
00:21:19,616 --> 00:21:21,366
Report. All soldiers

338
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:22,940
have arranged their training and lives well.

339
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,550
Don't worry. But…

340
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,960
Old Fu, just tell me.

341
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,327
Please look.

342
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:32,470
The refugees lack clothes and food.

343
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,870
They look so pitiful.

344
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,300
So I asked the brothers in the kitchen to set up a porridge shed

345
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,030
and offer them porridge every day.

346
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,690
I see.

347
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,210
Well done. As long as you are here, I'm at ease.

348
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,430
Mu Wanqing!

349
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,443
You bitch!

350
00:22:06,443 --> 00:22:08,730
Do you think you belong to the Mu family?

351
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,820
You stole my thunder at the dance party

352
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,846
and even said that you were Brother Guangyao's fiancee.

353
00:22:12,846 --> 00:22:15,410
You are so shameless!

354
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,110
Brother Guangyao is my older brother.

355
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,030
There was an emergency, so I said I was his fiancee.

356
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,590
I haven't collected my thoughts, so I'll go easy on you.

357
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,010
But if you dare to treat me like this again,

358
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,290
I will fight back twice as hard.

359
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,830
I'm going to worship my mother now. Please get out.

360
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,080
How dare you? Who do you think you are?

361
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,520
My mother thought you were pitiful,

362
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,270
so she offered you a place to live.

363
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,066
Do you really think you're the Mu family's oldest daughter?

364
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,890
If I can't be Mu's eldest daughter,

365
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,410
can an illegitimate daughter of a maid?

366
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,863
You…

367
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,900
What are you two doing

368
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,060
pushing each other?

369
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,330
Wanting said she wanted to pay homage to Mother.

370
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,320
I said there was no need, so we had a spat.

371
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:07,690
Wanting has grown up and is considerate.

372
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,470
As a junior, you should pay tribute.

373
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:14,916
Yes.

374
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,330
Father is right.

375
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,436
Wanting, please.

376
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,543
Wanting?

377
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,020
Yes, My Lord.

378
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,680
Wanting should do so.

379
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,920
Not only Wanting.

380
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,270
I should also pay respect to Ms. Xiao.

381
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,443
Yes.

382
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:19,726
Families should live in harmony.

383
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:22,080
Yes, My Lord.

384
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,120
From now on,

385
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,663
I should treat Wanqing as my own daughter.

386
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:34,186
Wanting, you should get along well with your older sister in the future

387
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:37,090
and take good care of her.

388
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,000
Wanqing, you must be tired.

389
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,600
Get some rest.

390
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,340
Did you hear that?

391
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,180
Mother and I will take good care of you in the future.

392
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:29,589
Mother, don't be angry.

393
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:31,820
Tonight, I'm going to ask Father

394
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,649
to give me all of your dowry.

395
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:36,840
I will listen to you

396
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,530
and not fight with such vile people.

397
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,105
I'll live my own life.

398
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,680
But it takes time to plan the funeral

399
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,220
and choose a proper graveyard.

400
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,910
You could only stay here for a few days.

401
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,683
I will find Brother's jade pendant

402
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:57,290
and bury it with you.

403
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,800
This way, you can reunite with Brother earlier.

404
00:26:15,613 --> 00:26:17,236
Commander.

405
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:31,666
Speak!

406
00:26:32,896 --> 00:26:34,236
Now that the financial powers are handed over,

407
00:26:34,236 --> 00:26:36,930
the provincial military governor's mansion will be in charge of the money.

408
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,430
What about the brothers' wages?

409
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,890
Tan Si,

410
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,450
you have been with me for so long.

411
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,970
Did I ever default on a payment?

412
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,880
It's not just the brothers' wages.

413
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,680
We only paid a deposit for the small courtyard we rented.

414
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,480
The bill should be settled at the end of the month.

415
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,240
Do we have the money?

416
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,533
Of course not.

417
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,520
But…

418
00:27:11,042 --> 00:27:13,629
You are now the Commander of Shanghai.

419
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:15,640
Everyone fawns over you.

420
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,100
How about this?

421
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,320
Just say that you expropriated this place.

422
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,620
They would dare not say a word.

423
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,650
- Bastard!
- Stop!

424
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,346
I've told you! I am in this position, but we can't deprive the people!

425
00:27:31,346 --> 00:27:34,696
But we are so poor.

426
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,220
Tell me. How much do we need?

427
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:46,269
It's about forty to fifty thousand silver dollars altogether.

428
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,370
Wanqing.

429
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,763
Wanqing.

430
00:28:11,763 --> 00:28:13,480
I haven't seen you for ten years.

431
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,410
You've grown up.

432
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:19,760
I wasn't filial. I didn't accompany you and made you worry.

433
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,600
Wanqing, let's stop talking about the past.

434
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,010
This time you are back,

435
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,280
and Lianfeng has worried about not taking good care of you.

436
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,376
And Wanting has been arrogant since childhood.

437
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:34,736
But she has no ill intentions.

438
00:28:34,736 --> 00:28:37,380
Of course, there will be quarrels as we live together.

439
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,450
Don't take it personally.

440
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,880
Okay, I will get along well with them.

441
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,770
Good girl.

442
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:51,376
Now our family is finally reunited.

443
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:53,720
Family harmony is most important and will make all affairs prosper.

444
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,930
It's late. Go to bed early.

445
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,200
If anything happens, just tell Lianfeng.

446
00:29:14,993 --> 00:29:17,143
<i>Reunited?</i>

447
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,760
<i>Did you totally forget about</i>

448
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,370
<i>Mother and Brother?</i>

449
00:29:30,622 --> 00:29:32,452
This time after I go back to Yue City,

450
00:29:32,452 --> 00:29:36,220
I'll conduct an investigation on every officer who is close to Wu Xiangying.

451
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,840
Wu Xiangying betrayed us.

452
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,840
I want to figure out whether they are involved or not.

453
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,523
Father, I don't think this is a good decision.

454
00:29:44,523 --> 00:29:46,210
You can't put them on record.

455
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,510
You'd better send an official letter to Wu Xiangying

456
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,890
and change the date to several days earlier.

457
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,996
The content of the letter is to order him

458
00:29:53,996 --> 00:29:57,130
to assist Tan Xuanlin in handling the defense of Shanghai.

459
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,570
We need to make people believe that it is your order

460
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,060
to make Tan Xuanlin the commander.

461
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,670
Then we can maintain the prestige of the Provincial Military Governor's mansion.

462
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,220
More importantly, now the Revolutionary Army is like a broken bamboo.
<i>(Idiom meaning that the once broken piece can take root again)</i>

463
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,540
If we investigate Wu Xiangying's betrayal at this moment,

464
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,050
the soldiers will panic.

465
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,090
If things continue to be like this,

466
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,456
there might be another Wu Xiangying.

467
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:23,950
Son, you are taking everything into consideration now.

468
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,130
But what do you plan to do next?

469
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,080
Since Tan Xuanlin promised to follow the ground rules,

470
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,226
I'll be here and watch him execute them.

471
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,690
Of course, you should keep a close watch on him.

472
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,303
But besides this, you should also watch for his mistakes.

473
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:42,110
Get something on him to prepare for future emergencies.

474
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,240
We gave Shanghai to the bandit like this.

475
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,610
I'm not happy with it.

476
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,480
Let's see how many days he can stay in this position.

477
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,083
Yes.

478
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:53,620
For now, your marriage with Mu's daughter will be delayed.

479
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,170
But Wanqing is back.

480
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,750
You two grew up together.

481
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,263
Families in the North and the South are trying to win over the Mu family.

482
00:31:00,263 --> 00:31:02,963
Since you're staying in Shanghai, visit them more.

483
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:06,080
Try to get some information about them, especially their economic conditions.

484
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,600
War is upon us.

485
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,793
We need to rely on the Mu family.

486
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:16,183
Yes, I understand.

00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,686
Aunt Cui, I want to use the car.

You two!

525
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,170
Quarreling with each other every time you're together.

526
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,710
Go. Tell Mu Fang.

527
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,350
Just say that I agree. He'll send you a car.

528
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,690
Thank you, Aunt Cui.

529

You are welcome.

530
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,496

531
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:38,303

we'll stay with you.

537
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,483

538
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,590
Shaojun genuinely wants to stay with me.

539
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,910
As for you...

540
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,520
you must have met some new girl.

541
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,760
I mainly want to accompany you

542
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,120
and conveniently I can go out with girls in our spare time.

543
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,200
He fell in love with that celebrity, Gu Yueshuang.

544
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,870
Why are you talking about me only?

545
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,200
That female student came right up to you to pursue you.

546
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,570
I'm suspicious of you.

547
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,220
You must have other intentions for being here.

548
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,470
Anyway, I have nothing to do.

549
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,583
Guangyao doesn't need me all the time.

550
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:40,040
It's not a big deal if I hang out with girls.

551
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,280
Boring.

552
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,040
What isn't boring?

553
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,670
Staying with you? Someone who hates talking?

554
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:49,600
Will you die if you don't scold me every day? Will you?

555
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,150
All right. Calm down.

556
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:54,100
You guys have been quarreling since we were students.

557
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,010
But you never leave each other.

558

559
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,160
Save your words.

560
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,760
By the way, Guangyao.

561
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,570
Uncle Xu talked to you for such a long time.

562
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,320
What did he say?

563
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,250
Something serious. You wouldn't understand.

564
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,870
Looking down on me again? I tell you what.

565
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,600
I'm just too lazy to think and discuss with you.

566
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,050
If I really think about something,

567
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,520
I'd be much better than you.

568
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,700
Then tell me.

569
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,910
Uncle Xu wants you to get something on that Mr. Tan, right?

570
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,200
I think you should keep your mind on girls.

571
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,050
Don't get involved with this.

572
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,950
I see.

573
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:39,970
You are stuck here by that Mr. Tan.

574
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:43,280
To stabilize the overall situation, you have no choice but to stay.

575
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,290
If anyone asks me, I'll say so.

576
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,180
Wait for me.

Your briefcase.

Check it.

No rush. Let's settle this slowly. Have a seat.

584
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,280
I think it's better to make it clear now.

585
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,761
Fine.

586
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:09,200
What a pity! Everything is here.

I don't know if I can see you again in the future.

588
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,050
There's no need. It will be settled today.

589
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,040
Miss Mu, don't be so confident.

590
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,940
I think you will definitely want to see me again.

591
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,430
I'm not here to chat with you. Where's my stuff?

592
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,350
You mean this?

593
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,770
I remember a paragraph.

594
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,290
It's very well-written and so emotional.

595
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,040
Fine. I'll stop.

596
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,370
But I do think your father is a bastard.

597
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,900
His son had just died, but he was happy

598
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,570
with his wife's maid and her daughter.

599
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,040
He's really not like a father at all.

600
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,470
It's none of your business.

601
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:01,500
I had a bet... on you.

602
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,970
You want to make a deal with me?

603
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,596
Smart.

604
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:13,142
That's right.

605
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,620
I want to make a deal with you.

606
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,490
As long as you can get me military wages from the Mu family,

607
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,420
I'll return your diary.

608
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,320
You overestimate me.

609
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,620
I'm just a poor girl living in their house. I can't help you.

610
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,700
Fine.

611
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,390
You'd better make a decision as soon as possible.

612
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,260
Or else, those tabloid reporters

613
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,330
will be ready to spend big money on your diary.

614
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,910
I'm afraid

615
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,460
I can't resist their money.

616
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,860
- Give it back to me!
- No!

617
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:02,676
What's wrong?

618
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,080
Are you scared?

619
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,403
Stay back.

620
00:39:36,013 --> 00:39:38,103
See these scars?

621
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,770
The people who have given me these scars

622
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,620
are all dead.

623
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,443
All of them.

624
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,940
You want to try?

625
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:22,600
What's wrong?

626
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,660
You're blushing.

627
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,740
Did you fall in love with me?

628
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,330
Rogue.

629
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:35,620
I always think this is one of my many advantages.

630
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:44,130
Tell me. How much do you want?

631
00:40:50,513 --> 00:40:51,650
Fifty thousand silver dollars.

632
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,270
Only fifty thousand silver dollars?

633
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,460
I thought you would ask for a lot.

634
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,900
Will you return my diary after I give you the money?

635
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,530
Miss Mu, you are rich.

636
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,970
Great. That's the daughter of Shanghai's biggest tycoon.

637
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,350
It is only fifty thousand silver dollars.

638
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,040
I don't even need the help of the Mu family.

639
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,433
I can take it from my mother's dowry.

640
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:15,100
I'll contact you after I get the money.

641
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,770
I'll give you the money, and you'll return my stuff.

642
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,350
Okay?

643
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,940
My wife is so rich.

644
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,370
Now, I don't want you to leave me.

645
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,630
Stop talking nonsense.

646
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,050
You'd better keep your promise.

647
00:41:31,649 --> 00:41:35,330
I... play games with girls.

648
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,490
But I never break promises.

649
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,843
Wait for my call.

650
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:52,359
