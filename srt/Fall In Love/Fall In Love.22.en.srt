15
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,000
Wanqing,

16
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,900
I'm going back to Yue City.

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,400
Can I give you a hug?

18
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,900
You can't make my ten years of waiting to go all to waste.

19
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,600
In the future, I will always be your Brother Guangyao.

20
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,700
As long as you need me,

21
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,900
I'll always keep you company.

22
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,900
Thank you.

23
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,600
Goodbye, Wanqing.

24
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,300
Don't worry.

25
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,800
Are you okay?

26
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,700
Someone is stalking us. Let's leave.

27
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,300
Where are we going to go?

28
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,000
Now, these detectives will definitely report our whereabouts to Xu Bojun.

29
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,800
The place where Min Dacheng is hiding is also dangerous.

30
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,700
We must move him, too.

31
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's go.

32
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,800
Aren't you bored of drinking here alone?

33
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,000
Why are you here?

34
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,600
I'm here to drink with you.

35
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't need you.

36
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,900
I prefer to drink alone.

37
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,600
I don't feel like talking.

38
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,100
Then you don't have to talk.

39
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,800
Just listen to me.

40
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,900
That's my glass.

41
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,400
You're drinking alone,

42
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,900
heartbroken and sad.

43
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,600
Does he know about this?

44
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,400
He's currently enjoying his life with his woman.

45
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,500
Is this all worth it?

46
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,200
Who told you I'm sad?

47
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
How can I be sad?

48
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,200
I'm happy right now.

49
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,300
I'm being happy for them.

50
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,100
I'm happy for my young uncle.

51
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Stop lying to yourself.

52
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,500
Nothing is going to happen between you and Tan Xuanlin.

53
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,600
You should give up now.

54
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,600
Where is that nonchalant woman I know?

55
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,900
Where is that woman who was brave enough to slap me?

56
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,000
The Gu Yueshuang I know never takes men seriously.

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,400
She will never drown her sorrow in alcohol

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
because of a man.

59
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,600
A man?

60
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,500
He saved my life.

61
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Without him, I would have been dead at the age of ten.

62
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,700
He's more than just a man.

63
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,200
He's the light of my life.

64
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,200
I can also be the light of your life.

65
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,500
Have you forgotten?

66
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,400
We're just friends.

67
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,500
I don't want to be "just" friends with you.

68
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,000
I like you.

69
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,900
Don't you understand?

70
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,800
What do you like about me?

71
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,400
I'm sorry.

72
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,400
You... Why did you...

73
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,700
Because...

74
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,200
T-There is someone I treasure.

75
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,700
Thank you for your hard work in the past few days.

76
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,770
Today's meal is all on me.

77
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,500
Let's have some fun at the Paramount!

78
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,900
<i>Okay! Great!</i>

79
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,800
- Old Fu, guard here with some men.
<i> - Go, go, go.</i>

80
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,800
- Let the rest of them come with me.
- Don't worry, I will take care of it here.

81
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

82
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Let's go!

83
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Everyone come with me!

84
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,000
Guangyao, come here.

85
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,600
Now you know.

86
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,800
Now you should know how evil men can be.

87
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,300
Mr. Mu just called me,

88
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,200
he apologized to me for his poor parenting.

89
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,500
He also said that

90
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,800
the feeling between Mu Wanqing and Tan Xuanlin was mutual.

91
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,400
As her father, he was to blame.

92
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,500
He wanted me to cancel your engagement with the excuse of the escalating war,

93
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,100
to protect the dignity of our two families.

94
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,000
In exchange, he is willing to pay for all the provisions for us at the frontline.

95
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,500
Father,

96
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,500
Tan Xuanlin and Wanqing do love each other.

97
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,300
Father, please don't blame them.

98
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,550
You. That Tan beat you on tactics.

99
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,300
Now he even robbed your woman.

100
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,860
Look at yourself!

101
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,860
How can you be a good governor in the future?

102
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:37,956
If I must be like you so that I can be a good governor,

103
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,790
then I really can't do it.

104
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,460
You must even if you can't!

105
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,010
I only have one son!

106
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,060
If you can't, our legacy will become the legacy of others!

107
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,849
This Tan Xuanlin has an army.

108
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:05,019
Now that he has the help from the Mu family,

109
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:08,220
even if you continue to stay here, you can't stop him.

110
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,460
But you will become my weak spot.

111
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,180
I think you should go back to Yue City now.

112
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,564
The provisions offered by the Mu family must be tracked by someone on our side.

113
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,018
I'll listen to all your plans.

114
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,300
Look at you now.

115
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,210
You're torturing yourself just for a woman.

116
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,100
Are you still my son?

117
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,955
Are you?

118
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,543
Brothers! Everyone must have fun tonight.

119
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,156
Everything is on me.

120
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:09,807
I only have one requirement though.

121
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:11,481
Don't mess around.

122
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,116
Thank you, Commander. Let's go.

123
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:15,220
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

124
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,866
<i>- Let's go.
- Let's go.</i>

125
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,960
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

126
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,390
Governor.

127
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:43,360
Did the man that's tailing Tan Xuanlin come back?

128
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,612
Yes.

129
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:48,356
He said Junior Marshal went to meet Tan Xuanlin tonight at the headquarters.

130
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:50,980
Then, they went to a private residence in the suburbs.

131
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,840
They spent over two hours inside.

132
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,790
Why did they go to a private residence?

133
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,700
The detective spent a few days there,

134
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,616
and he said that the militia had surrounded the house.

135
00:13:00,616 --> 00:13:02,915
There was no way for him to get in.

136
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,950
Villagers around said a prisoner is locked in there.

137
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,640
He wore a mask when he came.

138
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,790
They couldn't see his face.

139
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,230
Have you checked Min Dacheng's body?

140
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,150
By the time I arrived, Tan Xuanlin had already gotten rid of his body.

141
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,860
I only saw the execution letter.

142
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,940
Where is Tan Xuanlin now?

143
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,430
After he left the house,

144
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,920
he took Junior Marshal to meet Miss Mu.

145
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,350
He then brought Miss Mu back to that house and stayed there for a short time.

146
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,380
Afterward, he took her to the Paramount.

147
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,370
They are still there right now.

148
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,995
Tan Xuanlin took Guangyao to a private residence?

149
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:47,730
Then, is Min Dacheng still alive?

150
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,640
If he is still alive, it will be bad.

151
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,084
Send someone to check that house.

152
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,467
Yes.

153
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,376
<i>Drink!</i>

154
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,443
<i>Drink!</i>

155
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,360
<i>Come on! Come!</i>

156
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,080
<i> - No.
- Try this.</i>

157
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,003
<i>Come on!</i>

158
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,880
<i> You lost! Drink!</i>

159
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,100
<i> Okay, okay. I'll drink.</i>

160
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,760
Come, Wanqing. Drink with me.

161
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,843
Relax. Your man is right here.

162
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:41,416
There's nothing for you to fear.

163
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:45,436
I know. You're fearless.

164
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:48,240
The only thing that scares me at the moment is you ignoring me.

165
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:50,634
You're being childish again.

166
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,432
Everything is ready.

167
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,910
Come on. My Miss Mu,

168
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,842
may I ask you to dance with me?

169
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,640
Why didn't you tell me before we would dance?

170
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,377
It's not too late to tell you now.

171
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,828
Come.

172
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,860
You've been fighting in wars this whole time.

173
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,630
How did you learn to dance?

174
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,933
I didn't have many choices.

175
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:45,930
I not only had to fight in wars but also socialize.

176
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,940
By socializing, I mean dancing and playing cards with rich ladies.

177
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,412
It's really hard work.

178
00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:52,790
That's awful.

179
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,820
No wonder you're such a smooth talker.

180
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
I was kidding. How can you buy it?

181
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,310
Listen. With me by your side,

182
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,250
you don't have to fight for anyone

183
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,860
or beg anyone for money.

184
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,660
The whole Mu family and I support you.

185
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,826
So that means... you will take care of me?

186
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:13,471
Of course.

187
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:10,010
Everyone, from today on,

188
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,000

<i> Great! Let's go!</i>

Why did you put on that show?

210
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,712
Are you afraid there aren't enough people spying on you?

211
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:14,340
Well...

212
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,900
I just want to shine brighter than Xu Guangyao at the ball.

213
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,371
I just want to be better than him.

214
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,960
From now on, whenever Miss Mu is brought up,

215
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,800
no one will remember the ball at the Mu's.

216
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,003
They will only think about the one at the Paramount.

217
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:30,620
You are both cheeky and childish.

218
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,610
<i>Drink! That's too much!</i>

219
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,960
The house was empty?

220
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,013
Yes.

221
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:47,560
We searched every room, but we didn't find any traces of a prisoner.

222
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,737
Governor,

223
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:53,000
do you think Tan Xuanlin knew that we were sending people to tail him?

224
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,889
That's why he took precautions.

225
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:56,133
Yes.

226
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:59,156
That means he doesn't want me to find out who he is hiding.

227
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,410
Maybe it is Min Dacheng.

228
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,260
- Is he still at the Paramount?
- He is.

229
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,810
We had people tailing him the whole time.

230
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,007
His men are inside as well.

231
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,210
Report to the police station that a revolutionist is hiding in the Paramount.

232
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,730
Send some police officers there to search.

233
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,030
Keep an eye on those policemen.

234
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,270
Find out if Min Dacheng is inside.

235
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,536
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

236
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:45,579
Adjutant Xu, what's going on?

237
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,870
Why are you searching here yourself?

238
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,620
Commander Tan. Miss Mu.

239
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,830
You two seem to be in a very good mood.

240
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,680
We just received a report

241
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,180
claiming that some revolutionists are hiding here.

242
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,460
We are searching now.

243
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,180
If the intelligence is proven to be true,

244
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,610
it will be your negligence that is to blame.

245
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,900
You haven't found any evidence, yet you already announced my fault.

246
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,000
It's better that we find nothing.

247
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,950
Commander Tan, you are the governor's student.

248
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,741
You better be more cautious about your words.

249
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:22,954
Of course. Thank you for your advice.

250
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,500
Nothing was found?

251
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:38,687
Did you search carefully?

252
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:40,863
Yes, we did.

253
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:42,807
We even checked the lady's restroom.

254
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:44,935
We didn't find Min Dacheng.

255
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,230
Where on earth did he hide him?

256
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,603
Indeed. I'm wondering as well.

257
00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:53,680
Tan Xuanlin didn't go anywhere other than the Paramount.

258
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,280
How can a living person disappear in broad daylight?

259
00:21:58,803 --> 00:22:03,593
Send some more people to follow everyone around Tan Xuanlin.

260
00:22:03,593 --> 00:22:05,480
Don't let any of them escape your sight.

261
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,937
Yes.

262
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,624
Governor, if Tan Xuanlin really did help Min Dacheng hide,

263
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,715
what is he trying to do?

264
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,400
Maybe it's related to the past.

Second Brother, why did you ask me to come here?

Stand!

270
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,800
Why do you always look so mean?

271
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,700
Shouldn't you be occupied dating your girlfriend? Why do you still have time to care about me?

272
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,800
Let me tell you.

273
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,300
Sister Mu still hasn't yet agreed to your proposal yet.

274
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,100
Now that you don't keep an eye on her,

275
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,300
let's see how regretful you will be

276
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,400
when someone steals her away.

277
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:20,165
That's none of your business.

278
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:24,121
Tell me. Why did you go to the Licha Hotel?

279
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,700
Me?

280
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,200
What else could I do there?

281
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,600
Did you meet Pei Shaojun?

282
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:36,260
No. He left long ago.

283
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,101
When did he leave?

284

Tell me. When did he leave?

286
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,860
Yesterday morning.

287
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,130
I asked that Su, he didn't know

288
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,520
why Pei Shaojun went back to Beijing so early either.

289
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,660
He even missed Xu Guangyao's wedding reception.

290
00:24:05,606 --> 00:24:09,070
But it doesn't matter, even if he stayed.

291

As long as you are here,

292
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:15,082
he couldn't make it to the reception.

293
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:20,391
Your body is here, but your soul is probably in Beijing already.

You brat.

After you two escort the Fourth Young Miss to Jiang City,

298
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:44,940
stay a bit longer and keep an eye on her.

299
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,510
This would be a great help to the commander.

- Yes.

- Yes, sir.
- Understood.

But what if she goes to shower or to use the bathroom?

310

Mind your words.

Wait. Fourth Young Miss has been to the bathroom for quite some time, right?

It's about twenty minutes.

00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,900

330
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,560
That boy.

331
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,170
How dare he fool with his father?

332
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:31,280
Last year, during that student protest,

333
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,640
I just arrested several poor students and he was not pleased.

334
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,150
He didn't complain to me but privately, he caused me a lot of trouble.

335
00:26:42,908 --> 00:26:49,398
Not a single task I handed him... was accomplished well.

336
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,400
But see what he's doing now.

337
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,020
The Revolutionary Army is still on the other side of the Yangtze River,

338
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,000
and he has begun to care about things beyond his responsibility.

339
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,800
That surprises me, too.

340
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,200
Before, Junior Marshal didn't care about military affairs at all.

341
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
This time, he's being particularly proactive.

342
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
But, Governor, I think this is a good sign.

343
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,100
It means he's beginning to share your responsibilities.

344
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,200
Share my responsibilities? Bullshit!

345
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,900
I'd rather believe that he's going to make more trouble for me.

488
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,700
Then, where did you hide it?

489
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,500
How about this? Let's make a bet.

490
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,300
If you win, I'll give you a reward.

491
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,800
But if you're wrong, you have to give me one.

492
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,100
Father.

493
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,400
I heard you wanted to see me.

494
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,800
<i>[Aspiration; Martial Ethics; Persistence]</i>

495
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,500
I heard you've begun to care about survivor's pensions recently.

496
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,800
You used to not be interested in military affairs.

497
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,900
Why are you interested in this all of a sudden?

498
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,400
The situation in the south has been escalating.

499
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,500
I'm just getting myself prepared.

500
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Just to get yourself prepared?

501
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,300
That's right.

502
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,800
Hey.

503
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,600
Come train with me.

504
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,000
<i>[Aspiration; Martial Ethics; Persistance; Martial Soul]</i>

505
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,100
You little bastard.

506
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,200
Are you trying to make a fool out of your father?

507
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,900
How dare you look into my past

508
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,600
and investigate me for Xu Guangyao?

509
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,600
If Xu Bojun, that old rascal, wants me to die,

510
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,500
you're planning to be his knife! Is that it?

511
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,800
How can my own son be a traitor?

512
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,200
Father,

513
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,100
if you're innocent, you won't be afraid of me looking into your past.

514
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,300
- How dare you to talk back to me!
- Father!

515
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,400
Were you the one who sent the assassins for Guangyao?
