A telegraph from Xu Bojun.

He hopes that we can help him kill Tan Xuanlin.

And he offers a generous reward.

19
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:19,595
This business is really a good deal.

20
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:32,057
Thank you.

21
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,600
Marshal, you look like a teacher dressed like this.

22
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,229
Did you know?

23
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:43,748
When I was young, I earned my rank by passing exams.

24
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:45,720
If I chose to be a teacher at that time,

25
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,124
my life would have been more stable and comfortable than it is now.

26
00:02:49,124 --> 00:02:54,340
Since ancient times, talented people have been ambitious.

27
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,518
You're meant to be somebody.

28
00:02:57,518 --> 00:03:03,999
Whether I can get back to the top or not depends on you.

29
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:06,680
Military Governor Xu, as long as you keep your promise,

30
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,314
I will help you no matter what it takes.

31
00:03:10,977 --> 00:03:12,837
Don't worry, Mr. Yamashita.

32
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:16,953
When Tan Xuanlin is dead, I'll ask my men to take over Shanghai.

33
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:19,917
At that time, everything in the Mu family

34
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:21,640
will be yours.

35
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,426
Don't worry, Military Governor Xu.

36
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:25,825
We're determined to make that happen.

37
00:03:25,825 --> 00:03:29,154
Mr. Yamashita, don't underestimate your enemy.

38
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:32,560
Now, Tan Xuanlin and Mu Wanqing are preparing for their marriage.

39
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,916
One of them has the guns.

40
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,375
One of them has the money.

41
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,629
If Tan Xuanlin and the Mu family work together,

42
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:40,937
it will be difficult to handle Tan Xuanlin then.

43
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:43,218
Don't worry, Marshal.

44
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,290
We have our own plan.

48
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,065
Wanqing, after hearing

49
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,260
the news of your father's death,

50
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,527
I rushed back in a hurry.

51
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:32,418
I didn't tell you in advance.

52
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:34,125
You won't blame me, will you?

53
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,590
Why would I blame you?

54
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:41,979
My life in Hong Kong is good.

55
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:44,362
Thank you for your help, Commander Tan.

56
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:45,643
Thank you.

57
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:47,769
You're welcome.

58
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:50,492
I made this promise to your real father.

59
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:58,659
Wanqing, can I take a look at the room I used to live in?

60
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,562
Of course.

61
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,280
If you like the furniture,

62
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,360
I can send them to your place.

63
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,980
Don't bother. I just want to take a look.

64
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,138
The past has passed.

65
00:05:33,138 --> 00:05:36,837
You can tell me whatever you need in the future.

66
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,976
You and Commander Tan are getting married, right?

67
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,186
Yes.

68
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:49,062
Congratulations.

69
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,912
Now that you have paid your respects to Uncle Mu,

70
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:55,295
how about I take you home now?

71
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:59,316
I have some photos of my mother here.

72
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:01,795
I want to take them back with me.

73
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,451
Okay.

74
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:18,310
Speaking of her, she's a pitiable woman.

75
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,740
After all, she didn't know what Cui Lianfeng did.

76
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,140
So Cui Lianfeng paid the price with her life.

77
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,482
But she just lost her status.

78
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,500
Considering the vicious methods she used against you,

79
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,344
her current situation isn't even a punishment.

80
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:40,323
She's not worthy of being pitied.

81
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,220
Your heart is so cold.

82
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,260
I won't let go of anyone who hurt you.

83
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,159
What are you looking at?

84
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:21,709
Looking at the photos of your childhood.

85
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,649
You were so cute.

86
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,866
By the way,

87
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:30,721
did you notice that Mu Wanting came back this time as a different person?

88
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:33,395
She lost all her noble lady's temper.

89
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:35,805
She's keeping a low profile now.

90
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,700
A leopard cannot change its spots.

91
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,288
I think she can't change her nature in such a short time.

92
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:47,401
You should be careful.

93
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,856
Don't worry. I'm here.

94
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:52,897
No one can hurt you.

95
00:08:57,878 --> 00:08:59,158
This…

96
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:01,244
Is this Xu Guangyao?

97
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:03,020
This was taken when he was ten years old.

98
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,320
When he came to my house as a guest.

99
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,740
He knew who you were since he was ten, right?

100
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:13,049
No.

101
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:15,420
He was probably nine years old.

102
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,568
Knowing you earlier won't help.

103
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:25,609
You're still mine.

104
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,060
Then, why are you jealous?

105
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,556
- Who's jealous?
- You.

106
00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:30,985
I…

107
00:09:32,226 --> 00:09:34,688
Well… He has known you for more than a decade.

108
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:36,516
I have just known you for a few months.

109
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:39,080
He should be the jealous one.

110
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,930
But...

111
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,796
we haven't taken a photo together like this one.

112
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:47,900
After we get married, we can do that at any time.

113
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,616
From the time we are young until the time we are old.

114
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:53,900
And we'll have our children and grandchildren.

115
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,720
We'll take a family photo every year. Okay?

116
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,848
Okay!

117
00:09:56,848 --> 00:10:01,506
We will record every moment in this lifetime.

118
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:03,152
Okay?

119
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,275
My lady.

120
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:08,656
Eldest Miss, there are some files in Master's study.

121
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:11,976
I don't know which ones should be kept and which should be thrown away.

122
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:13,376
How about you take a look?

123
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:14,637
I'll be right there.

124
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:16,484
Yes.

125
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:18,796
- Sorry, excuse me.
- Okay.

126
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,962
Commander Tan.

127
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,162
Uncle Fang.

128
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:48,336
About this. When did Mr. Mu take this photo with them?

129
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:50,450
He took this photo when he escorted the goods

130
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,210
and hired the Belarusian Foreign Gun Brigade.

131
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:54,870
Belarusian Foreign Gun Brigade?

132
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,664
Mr. Mu hired foreigners before?

133
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:59,816
Master heard that the Foreign Gun Brigade's shooting skills were pretty good.

134
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:01,580
One of them can go against four or five gunmen.

135
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,936
During those days, people were suffering from wars and horse bandits.

136
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:08,200
Finding some capable soldiers would make everything safe.

137
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,387
What shooting skills are so magical?

138
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:13,192
- Were those foreigners exaggerating?
- They were not exaggerating.

139
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:15,580
The foreigners' bullets were particularly powerful.

140
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,300
Those were explosive shells.

141
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,740
If you were shot, half of your body would be gone.

142
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,180
<i>This is the bullet taken from your father's wound.</i>

143
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,380
<i>I kept it all these years.</i>

144
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,840
<i>Maybe you could use it.</i>

145
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,634
<i>Explosive shells?</i>

146
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:35,983
Commander Tan, do you have anything else?

147
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,823
Uncle Fang, which road did Mr. Mu take?

148
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:43,425
- It must've been a dangerous road.
- A decade ago,

149
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:46,514
Military Governor Luo and Xu Bojun were at war.

150
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:50,260
Master escorted Xu Bojun's military supplies back to Shanghai.

151
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,260
After he arrived at Jiangpu, he couldn't move forward.

152
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,364
The two armies began to fight on the river.

153
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:55,656
Master had no other option.

154
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:58,320
So he went ashore from Jiangpu and took a land route.

155
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,280
Fortunately, he hired the Foreign Gun Brigade.

156
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,700
<i>Jiangpu is not far ahead. You camp here and get some rest.</i>

157
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,668
<i>When Lin'er recovers, you can set out.</i>

158
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:07,887
<i>I'll escort supplies with Yu'er first.</i>

159
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:09,403
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

160
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:13,511
Uncle Fang, I have something to do. I'm leaving now.

161
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,878
Go back to the Command.

162
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,390
Where is Xuanlin?

163
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,236
Commander Tan left. He said it was an emergency.

164
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:39,320
Why was he in such a hurry? He didn't even say goodbye.

165
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,087
Yes.

166
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,034
- What about this?
- Put it away.

167
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,760
<i>[The Sincere Co. Ltd]</i>

168
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,066
<i>Were those foreigners exaggerating?</i>

169
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,830
<i>They were not exaggerating.</i>

170
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,009
<i>The foreigners' bullets were particularly powerful.</i>

171
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:56,120
<i>Those were explosive shells.</i>

172
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,120
<i>If you were shot, half of your body would be gone.</i>

173
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,076
Tan Si, Licha Hotel.

174
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:14,705
Okay.

175
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:21,471
Thank you.

176
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:26,931
You don't look so well.

177
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:31,000
Did you get tired after dealing with Boss Mu's death recently?

178
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,896
I'm fine.

179
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,140
You used the Mu Family's old case to force Xu Bojun to be dismissed.

180
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,360
He'll never let you go.

181
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,415
You should be careful.

182
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:44,111
I was negligent.

183
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:49,834
However, I have almost gotten everything out from Xu Bojun's spy.

184
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:53,160
It won't be easy if he wants to do something to me.

185
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,968
That's good.

186
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,524
Mr. Liao.

187
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:03,600
I came to your place in such a hurry.

188
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,468
Actually…

189
00:14:06,091 --> 00:14:10,591
Actually, there is a private matter and I want to ask you for help.

190
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:12,400
There is no need to be polite with me.

191
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,385
Just tell me what you need.

192
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:18,929
I know that you know a lot of people in the Embassy District.

193
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:22,060
Have you heard of

194
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:25,200
the Belarusian Foreign Gun Brigade?

195
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,580
Belarusian Foreign Gun Brigade?

196
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,889
Yes.

197
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:31,400
Their shooting skills are pretty good.

198
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,567
And they were well-known more than a decade ago.

199
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:37,790
They earned commissions by protecting businessmen.

200
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,860
After the Russian October Revolution,

201
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,184
some Russian officers fled to China.

202
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:49,090
Some of them did return to do their old jobs to make a living.

203
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,843
Why do you ask that?

204
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:57,524
Uncle Mu hired the Belarusian Foreign Gun Brigade once before.

205
00:14:57,524 --> 00:15:00,865
The bullets they used were explosive shells.

206
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,340
Coincidentally,

207
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:10,156
they went to Jiangpu at the same time as my father.

208
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:14,752
I understand.

209
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:16,654
But Xuanlin.

210
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,365
There are many coincidences in the world.

211
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:22,940
Maybe,

212
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,831
it's not what you think.

213
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:27,463
You're right. I wish it were a coincidence.

214
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:30,457
But Mr. Liao, I just found out about it.

215
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:32,896
I'm so confused right now. I don't know whom I should talk to.

216
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:35,936
So I came to you.

217
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,709
Don't worry.

218
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:42,609
If those people are still alive,

219
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,076
I will definitely help you find them.

220
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,474
Thank you, Mr. Liao.

221
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:49,280
Then I won't bother you.

222
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,693
Thank you.

223
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,143
Xuanlin!

224
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,426
I also want you to help me with one thing.

225
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:03,274
What is it?

226
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:06,973
You came to Shanghai. You can tell me everything you need.

227
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,460
I got a batch of munition at the Beijing Embassy.

228
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,700
Now, these arms have been loaded onto a British cargo ship.

229
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,276
But those Britons are afraid of death and are unwilling to ship them to the front line.

230
00:16:15,276 --> 00:16:17,070
They can only ship them to Shanghai.

231
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:20,606
I want to ask you for help transfer this batch of arms in Shanghai

232
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:22,242
and ship them to Guangzhou.

233
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,048
That won't be a problem.

234
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:28,441
I now basically control Shanghai.

235
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:31,682
In the future, if you transport arms and medicine,

236
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:34,351
you can transfer directly through Shanghai.

237
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,420
Did Commander Tan call this afternoon?

238
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:15,331
Please call the Command.

239
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:17,049
<i>Hold on, please.</i>

240
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,285
Commander, won't you have dinner with Miss Mu?

241
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:21,174
No.

242
00:18:21,174 --> 00:18:22,862
Why not?

243
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,604
Let's go back.

244
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,465
Okay.

245
00:19:07,173 --> 00:19:08,773
I asked Alyosha to inquire about this.

246
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:12,968
Sergey Onegin was a Russian soldier who fled to China.

247
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:16,880
He participated in the Russo-Japanese War and was a famous sharpshooter.

248
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:22,140
- Guard the door.
- Yes, sir.

249
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:29,457
This is Commander Tan.

250
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:34,696
He wants to know which bigwigs you have protected.

251
00:19:34,696 --> 00:19:36,156
Has there ever been danger?

252
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:40,410
Do you have enough experience to be a Commander's bodyguard?

253
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,890
I've protected many important people, including Mr. Du from Guangdong,

254
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,640
Commander Zhan from Shandong,

255
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,430
and Mr. Mu, president of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce,

256
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,520
over the past 10 years.

257
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,100
He said he has been in China for more than ten years.

258
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,280
He has protected many business bigwigs,

259
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,136
including Mr. Du from Guangdong, Commander Zhan from Shandong,

260
00:19:55,136 --> 00:19:57,476
and Mr. Mu, President of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.

261
00:19:57,476 --> 00:20:00,560
I'm not interested in the first two.

262
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,956
Tell me how you protected Mr. Mu.

263
00:20:03,956 --> 00:20:06,440
When we landed at Jiangpu, we found another team of soldiers.

264
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,420
Mr. Mu recognized that it was Military Governor Luo's army, but Mr. Mu was escorting Military Governor Xu's supplies.

265
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:48,168
<i>He said when they landed at Jiangpu,</i>

266
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:49,810
<i>they found another team of soldiers.</i>

267
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,319
<i>Mr. Mu recognized that it was Military Governor Luo's army.</i>

268
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,043
<i>But Mr. Mu was escorting Military Governor Xu's supplies.</i>

269
00:20:56,043 --> 00:20:57,520
<i>So they began to fight.</i>

270
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,848
<i>They're enemies of each other.</i>

271
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:05,420
<i>For their safety, Mr. Mu ordered them to shoot those soldiers when they </i>

272
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,103
<i>entered the valley in formation.</i>

273
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:14,727
<i>No one survived.</i>

274
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,841
Commander!

275
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,760
<i>Father!</i>

276
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,760
<i>Father!</i>

277
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,760
<i>Father!</i>

278
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,940
<i>We shot them.</i>

279
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,240
<i>Father!</i>

280
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,940
<i>We shot them.</i>

281
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,320
<i>- Big brother!</i>
<i>- We shot them.</i>

282
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,483
<i>Big brother!</i>

283
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:51,700
Big brother!

284
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,464
Father!

285
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,927
It's me.

286
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,647
Mr. Liao? Was I dreaming?

287
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:07,900
Your heart is beating very fast.

288
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,685
Commander, you really scared us.

289
00:23:10,685 --> 00:23:13,320
You kept yelling for the old Commander in your dream.

290
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,699
It was a dream.

291
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:28,698
I was dreaming about the Russian saying they took the shot.

292
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,663
It turned out that it was not a dream.

293
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:02,044
Commander, Miss Mu just called.

294
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:07,659
Tell her I'm busy.

295
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,675
No one can disturb me.

296
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,120
But Mu's mansion is preparing for your wedding.

297
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,840
She called just for…

298
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,347
Let me rest.

299
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:20,100
- You may leave now.
- Commander.

300
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,050
Leave me alone!

301
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,364
Go.

302
00:24:43,602 --> 00:24:49,063
Mr. Liao, what did that foreigner say to Commander?

303
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:53,272
Your Commander encountered the biggest setback in his life.

304
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:55,100
What happened, Mr. Liao?

305
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,380
There has been something wrong with Commander since he came back.

306
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,496
It's best not to ask.

307
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:11,573
If he wants to speak, he will naturally tell you.

308
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,810
Okay. It looks so beautiful.

309
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:28,358
Miss Mu, this wedding dress suits you very well.

310
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,220
The waist can be tightened by another inch which will make the curves look better.

311
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,420
Okay.

312
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,100
Miss Gu,

313
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,760
are there any actors in your company about the same height as Xuanlin?

314
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:45,353
Why do you ask about this?

315
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,800
You'll be Commander's wife in a few days.

316
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,447
Are you still thinking of male stars?

317
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:51,620
I'm not.

318
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,836
Today, we're going to try on the wedding attire but I don't know where he is.

319
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:58,020
I called the Command but no one answered.

320
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,741
I want to find someone to try it on for him.

321
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,036
That's strange.

322
00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:06,936
Young Uncle promised you, and he never breaks promises.

323
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:08,928
Yes.

324
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,861
Xu Bojun used to pay attention to him every day,

325
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:13,040
and he would not break a promise no matter what.

326
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,403
What's going on now?

327
00:27:16,088 --> 00:27:18,050
It's okay. Don't think too much.

328
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,700
Maybe he was delayed by something.

329

I don't worry about that.

330
00:27:22,204 --> 00:27:25,142
I worry that he's keeping something from me.

331

Why don't you just ask him?

332

He said I should trust him without any conditions.

- You have to do it like this.

Is he in a bad mood?

338
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,743
Okay. Usually when he is in a bad mood,

339
00:27:49,743 --> 00:27:53,300
he either sleeps in the Command or he goes to the shooting range.

340

Okay.

I was going to see you in the Command. But no one knew where you were.

Although I only touched the gun when I was fighting with you when I was a child,

I haven't used a gun for so many years.

Of course not.
