00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:44,099
The weather in Yue City is just like its people.

16
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,307
So capricious.

17
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:49,280
But it's quite good.

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,716
These days, I've been sick in bed.

19
00:01:51,716 --> 00:01:55,996
The smell of medicine is everywhere. I can smell it all the time.

20
00:01:55,996 --> 00:02:00,103
It's good to have some fresh air outside.

21
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:03,910
Marshal, if you like it, I'll take you for a walk every day.

22
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,282
You are the most faithful one around me.

23
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:12,240
Marshal, years ago, if you hadn't saved me on the battlefield

24
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,537
and raised me up, I wouldn't be who I am today.

25
00:02:18,663 --> 00:02:22,524
Do you have any news about Guangyao?

26
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:25,160
Someone saw the Junior Marshal at the train station.

27
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,820
He got on the train to Guangzhou with Junior Marshal Su.

28
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,821
Marshal! Marshal, don't worry.

29
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,800
I will send someone to spy on him.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,280
I will definitely find out what he's doing in Guangzhou.

31
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,947
You must find him.

32
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:42,783
It's Tan Xuanlin.

33
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:45,590
It must be Tan Xuanlin who planned everything.

34
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,462
He not only kicked me out,

35
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:53,022
but he also wants to take my only son away from me.

36
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:57,503
He must pay for what he did.

37
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:01,340
I heard that Tan Xuanlin took the initiative

38
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,700
to serve as the City Guard of Jiang City

39
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:06,412
and even brought the Tan Army back to the city.

40
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:09,521
He returned the position of Commander of Shanghai back to Wu Xiangying.

41
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:12,941
I have no idea what he's planning.

42
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,029
What is he planning?

43
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,231
He's not afraid of bad deals. He's ambitious.

44
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:24,961
Marshal, what shall we do next?

45
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,330
A thousand hours of training for five minutes of pure chaos.

46
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,764
Inform the one in Jiang City,

47
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:34,800
- it's time for him to take action.
- Okay.

48

<i>[Commander Tan and Miss Mu are returning to Jiang City to get married]</i>

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,390
- I don't believe it.
- What don't you believe?

50
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:44,836
I don't believe that my brother asked me to go back to Jiang City to attend the wedding.

51
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:46,360
I have a hunch.

52
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,975
Once I go back,

53
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:50,996
I won't be able to return here again.

54
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:54,732
How are you going to reply to him?

55
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,584
Let me tell you.

56
00:03:57,584 --> 00:04:02,292
No matter what happens, you need to protect me.

57
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,361
Of course. You stayed here for me.

58
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,680
I won't let you won't regret this.

59
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,280
I believe you.

60
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,440
When I came here, I never thought about going back again.

61
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:27,061
Get everything prepared.

62
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:30,560
Xiao Cui, hurry up to the kitchen and bring all the dried seafood.

63
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,760
- Okay.
- You must be careful with this.

64
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,178
- Be careful with this, too.
- Uncle Fang.

65
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:37,665
I'm going to Jiang City, not going camping. Why are you packing so many things?

66
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:40,901
Eldest Miss, you should be fully prepared.

67
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,340
In a rural area like Jiang City,

68
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,340
there is no delicious food or beautiful clothes.

69
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:49,980
That's right. Why would your distinguished miss

70
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,942
fall in love with a bumpkin like me?

71
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:55,376
Commander Tan, don't say that. I really didn't mean that.

72
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:58,356
Uncle Fang cares about me, he has no ill intentions. Why are you so mean?

73
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:00,106
I know.

74
00:05:00,106 --> 00:05:02,201
Uncle Fang, rest assured.

75
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,374
Although Jiang City is not as prosperous as Shanghai,

76
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:08,034
I'll take good care of Wanqing as long as I'm with her.

77
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:11,779
Great. Commander. Miss. I'll get back to work.

78
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,840
- Okay.
- Please.

79
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,920
Look at you. You scared him.

80
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,795
It's my fault.

81
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:21,739
Commander! Commander.

82
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:25,720
The Fourth Young Miss sent a telegram. She said she can't attend the wedding.

83
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,280
She asked you and Miss Mu to take good care of yourselves.
<i>[Sent by: Tan Sangyu. To: Tan Xuanlin]</i>

84
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,476
She said not to miss her too much. She also wrote a poem.

85
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:34,521
"Though separated by a mountain, we'll share the same clouds and rain.

86
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:37,657
The bright moon belongs not to a single town.

87
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:40,400
May you enjoy the beautiful moon in Nanhai.

88
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,159
The moonlight will be scattered in Jiang City."

89
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,731
She figured out your plan.

90
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:55,989
Commander. Miss Mu. Why don't I understand what you're saying?

91
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,960
In ancient times, Guangzhou was called Nanhai County.

92
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,364
Through the last two lines of this poem,

93
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:03,807
she wishes Xuanlin can leave the Beiyang government as soon as possible

94
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:06,315
and support the National Revolution.

95
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:11,154
Commander, once we declare that we support the revolution,

96
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:13,230
it means a clean break from the Beijing government,

97
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,890
then Fourth Young Miss will be put in danger.

98
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,803
If Pei Xun takes her hostage,

99
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:20,428
we... we will be in a dilemma.

100
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:25,531
Now, we can only rely on Pei Shaojun and hope that he will protect her.

101
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,841
Tan Si, go to the press now.

102
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:35,916
Make a statement on my behalf.

103
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,777
Just say...

104
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,078
Just say...

105
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,490
Just say that Tan Sangyu, Fourth Lady of the Tan Family,

106
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,310
is too stubborn and rebellious.

107
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:51,320
She left home without permission and eloped with Pei Shaojun.

108
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,260
She is so shameless. The Tan family won't cover for her.

109
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,903
As a result, she is expelled from the family forever.

110
00:06:56,903 --> 00:06:58,764
From now on,

111
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,603
her life has nothing to do with the Tan family.

112
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:06,096
No, no, Commander. Are you crazy?

113
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:08,518
As soon as this statement is released, the Fourth Young Miss can never come back.

114
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:10,400
What else can I do?

115
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,896
I have found a way out for her, but she won't come back.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,861
Unfortunately,

117
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:20,406
she loves Pei Shaojun too much.

118
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:24,503
No matter what happens, she won't come back.

119
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,270
Once the statement is released, the Fourth Young Miss

120
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,160
will no longer be a member of the Tan family.

121
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,239
So even if Pei Xun catches her, he can't hurt her.

122
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,116
This is the best way out right now.

123
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,880
I can't protect her forever.

124
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,760
Just let her...

125
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:55,514
choose her own way.

126
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,201
Go.

127
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,680
<i>[Tan Xuanlin, Commander of Shanghai, Expelled His Sister. Statement on Tan Sangyu Leaving the Tan Family]</i>

128
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,801
Brother, thank you.

129
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,410
Your brother is brave.

130
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,480
He thinks big and acts in time.

131
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,975
You should be proud of him.

132
00:08:38,526 --> 00:08:40,905
I don't regret staying.

133
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:47,346
But when I think that my brother and I are going our separate ways

134
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:50,040
and that we may never meet again,

135
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,108
I still feel so sad.

136
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,861
Don't. You will definitely meet again.

137
00:08:56,861 --> 00:09:01,260
I won't let you lose your beloved family because of me. I won't let it happen.

138
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:05,295
What... What do you mean?

139
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:10,050
These days, I've been trying to persuade my father

140
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,240
to live in peace with the Revolutionary Army.

141
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:14,905
His attitude has changed a bit.

142
00:09:14,905 --> 00:09:17,225
He's thinking about accepting my proposal.

143
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:19,644
Really?

144
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:22,385
That's great!

145
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:25,227
If Uncle Pei agrees,

146
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:30,214
that would be great.

147
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:34,694
I promised your brother that I will make a difference for you.

148
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:36,878
I must keep my promises.

149
00:09:38,193 --> 00:09:41,653
I just knew it. You are my Mr. Right.

150
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,936
You are my hero.

151
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
<i>[Jiang City]</i>

152
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:41,200
They all know you will take office today.

153
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,620
Why aren't they showing up and welcoming you?

154
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:46,032
I don't know.

155
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,664
The Tan family's second child really resigned his position as Commander of Shanghai

156
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:03,124
and came back to Jiang City to be the City Guard?

157
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,176
He has already received the letter of appointment from Beijing. Now,

158
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:10,528
he must be at the city gates by now.

159
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:12,835
He hasn't been back in ten years.

160
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:15,505
But now he suddenly steps in.

161
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:17,710
He's so ignorant.

162
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:22,707
Stop talking.

163
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:25,310
In the past ten years, Tan Zijie did nothing.

164
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,228
You were the one doing the real work.

165
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,144
Now, he is finally dead.

166
00:11:29,144 --> 00:11:31,409
But the Tan family's second son suddenly pops up.

167
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:35,072
Does that brat want to be your boss? How dare he?

168
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:38,724
Soldiers are born to follow orders.

169
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:40,719
Stop complaining.

170
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,860
<i>[Jiang City]</i>

171
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,727
If I'm not mistaken,

172
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:18,617
you must be Commander Tan from Shanghai.

173
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:20,924
You must be Division Commander, Chen Shaowu.

174
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:23,533
I am.

175
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:26,427
Commander Tan, you must know that it has been my duty

176
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:28,435
to defend Jiang City during the past few years.

177
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:30,524
My Uncle Zijie was always in poor health,

178
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:33,101
so you did his work. I appreciate your efforts.

179
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:34,360
But now, you don't have to worry.

180
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,514
I'll take over as the City Guard of Jiang City.

181
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:40,188
You can just do your own business.

182
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:43,840
My business is to keep Jiang City safe.

183
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,850
Commander Tan, you took office and

184
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,477
brought back so many people from nowhere.

185
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,005
I'm afraid I can't follow your orders.

186
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:54,404
All my soldiers are soldiers from the Tan Army.

187
00:12:54,404 --> 00:12:55,811
They do not come from nowhere.

188
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:58,840
Each of them has a bond with the Tan family that is deeper than yours.

189
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,880
I just wanted to bring them home.

190
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,570
Bring them home?

191
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,813
What's their number?

192
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:07,635
As far as I know, they are nothing but

193
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:10,317
a militia of the Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.

194
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:12,420
They're not even soldiers.

195
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,721
Commander Tan,

196
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:16,722
it's not proper to bring them back. Isn't that so?

197
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:18,141
Division Commander Chen,

198
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:20,366
are you trying to embarrass me?

199
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,213
Commander Tan, you are the City Guard

200
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:24,930
appointed by the Beijing government.

201
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,449
You're coming here for work.

202
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:28,948
Of course, I'll send you my warmest welcome.

203
00:13:28,948 --> 00:13:33,166
But I can't accept the people you brought here.

204
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:36,839
Fine.

205
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:40,505
Since I am the City Guard of Jiang City now,

206
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,296
I order you
<i>[Tan Xuanlin is Appointed the Guarding Officer of Jiang City]</i>

207
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:46,438
to prepare the barracks and military wages,

208
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:49,821
and give your welcome to all my brothers.

209
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,840
<i>[Letter of Appointment]</i>

210
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:24,523
Commander Chen,

211
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:27,300
are you defying my order now?

212
00:14:36,615 --> 00:14:38,376
Enter the city!

213
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:44,715
Welcome, the new City Guard of Jiang City!

214
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,810
<i>[City Guard Office of Jiang City]</i>

215
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,781
<i>Catch it.</i>

216
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,561
<i>Here.</i>

217
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,402
Are you reminiscing about the old days?

218
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:57,788
After my father died,

219
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,182
the Tan Army's number was revoked by Luo Bingwen.

220
00:16:02,182 --> 00:16:05,741
Then, Jiang City became Xu Bojun's territory again.

221
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,240
I couldn't go back even to my hometown.

222
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,540
I've been wandering all the time.

223
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,760
But now,

224
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,260
I can finally come back confidently.

225
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,240
But everything has changed.

226
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,322
I understand.

227
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:23,299
When I just returned to Shanghai

228
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:25,210
and walked into the Mu Mansion,

229
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,311
I felt exactly the same way.

230
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:31,816
I grew up there,

231
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:34,160
but I got a totally unfamiliar feeling.

232
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,301
<i>Look.</i>

233
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,910
<i>Each grain was hard-earned.</i>

234
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,541
I'm back,

235
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,619
but they're all gone.

236
00:17:06,686 --> 00:17:08,830
So lonely.

237
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:14,238
But you still have me.

238
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,491
Yes.

239
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,871
I still have you.

240
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,914
In the future, we'll have our own children.

241
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,460
They will play here.

242
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,000
If you like them,

243
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,544
we can have several children.

244
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:35,220
How about a platoon of children?

245
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,690
I would be exhausted!

246
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,921
Commander!

247
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,581
Commander.

248
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:46,907
A division commander named Liu Fu wants to see you.

249
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:48,741
Liu Fu?

250
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:49,983
Uncle Liu?

251
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:51,262
Invite him in immediately.

252
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:52,841
I will.

253
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,020
When we entered the city,

254
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,156
that Chen Shaowu didn't welcome us.

255
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:01,180
Why is Commander Liu coming here now?

256
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,837
Liu Fu has been working for my father for years.

257
00:18:03,837 --> 00:18:05,900
When we were still bandits,

258
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,868
he was my father's right-hand man.

259
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:10,811
When I was younger, he taught me how to ride a horse.

260
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:12,400
But you haven't seen him in ten years.

261
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,715
He might have changed.

262
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,708
Today, Chen Shaowu

263
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,472
made it clear that he would stand against me.

264
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:22,420
If I want to be unassailable,

265
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,283
I have to get the support of these old division commanders.

266
00:18:25,283 --> 00:18:28,346
Among them, the only one I know is Uncle Liu.

267
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:30,599
But is he reliable?

268
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,880
I would like to think so.

269
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,001
Second Young Master.

270
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:41,638
Uncle Liu!

271
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,940
Long time no see.

272
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,750
When you left Jiang City,

273
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,240
you were still a ten-year-old boy.

274
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,261
But now,

275
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:56,080
you've grown up and have become a famous City Guard.

276
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,685
Uncle Liu, you haven't changed either.

277
00:18:57,685 --> 00:18:58,830
Please take a seat.

278
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,137
How did I not change? I'm so old now.

279
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,551
Uncle Liu.

280
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,432
Let me introduce you to this woman.

281
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:10,015
This is my fiancée. We're going to get married soon.

282
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,214
She is Mu Wanqing.

283
00:19:11,214 --> 00:19:12,236
Nice to meet you, Uncle Liu.

284
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:13,413
The girl is so elegant.

285
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:16,625
She must come from a noble family.

286
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,589
If your father and mother saw her,

287
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:20,993
they would be extremely happy.

288
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,961
Uncle Liu,

289
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:35,840
over the past ten years,

290
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,213
I've never come back to pay my respects.

291
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,980
I'm not a good son.

292
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:43,863
It's not your fault.

293
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:46,297
It must've been hard for you being all alone.

294
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:48,013
Every year on Tomb-Sweeping Day,

295
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:52,830
I would prepare incense and sacrifices on your behalf.

296
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,030
Your parents won't blame you.

297
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,741
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

298
00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:00,815
Right.

299
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:03,121
When you entered the city today,

300
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:06,871
did Chen embarrass you?

301
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:11,681
Commander Chen has been dealing with military affairs over the years.

302
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:13,100
He has done a lot.

303
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,760
If I hadn't come back,

304
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,207
he would definitely have been promoted to be the City Guard of Jiang City.

305
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:22,088
It's reasonable for him to be disappointed.

306
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,140
There's something

307
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,040
I don't know if I should tell you or not.

308
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,621
Uncle Liu,

309
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:37,284
just tell me whatever you want to say.

310
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:42,275
I suspect...

311
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,730
that your Uncle Zijie didn't die of an illness.

312
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,381
Brother Shaowu.

313
00:20:55,327 --> 00:20:56,918
Brother Liu Fu.

314
00:20:56,918 --> 00:20:59,100
Shouldn't you be recuperating at home

315
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,100
and caring about nothing outside?

316
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,720
Why are you here?

317
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,659
Are you feeling better now?

318
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:07,721
I'm fine.

319
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,060
Come here. Let's sit down and talk.

320
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,719
Okay.

321
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:16,190
Have some water.

322
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:19,762
Brother Shaowu,

323
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:23,050
I'm here to send a message for Commander Tan.

324
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,132
Commander Tan has been in the city for no more than four hours.

325
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:30,296
Are you here to defend him?

326
00:21:30,296 --> 00:21:34,454
I know you're not happy.

327
00:21:34,454 --> 00:21:36,158
But to be fair,

328
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:38,469
I've been working for the Tan family for years.

329
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:41,865
I also watched Second Young Master grow up.

330
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:43,974
He is not a resentful person.

331
00:21:43,974 --> 00:21:47,502
You should just apologize to him

332
00:21:47,502 --> 00:21:49,905
and mind your own business in the future.

333
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:52,988
He will never make it difficult for you.

334
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,721
Commander Tan...

335
00:21:56,721 --> 00:21:59,707
came to Jiang City and became the City Guard.

336
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:02,055
This is the order from high-ranking officials.

337
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:04,772
I have no objections.

338
00:22:04,772 --> 00:22:07,681
But he brought some of his own men here.

339
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:09,788
This is a problem.

340
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:12,301
But this is a special case, isn't it?

341
00:22:12,301 --> 00:22:14,719
If their number was not canceled back then,

342
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:17,576
they would have been soldiers in Jiang City.

343
00:22:17,576 --> 00:22:20,500
Besides, we now have

344
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,543
more than 50,000 soldiers in Jiang City.

345
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:24,654
Another 2,000 soldiers won't be an issue. Just economize.

346
00:22:24,654 --> 00:22:26,200
The military wage is not a problem.

347
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,583
Why are you making things difficult?

348
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,584
We do have to follow the rules,

349
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:33,780
but we should also be considerate and think about others.

350
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,241
Okay.

351
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:38,677
For your sake,

352
00:22:38,703 --> 00:22:41,364
I will allow it.

353
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:43,382
Great.

354
00:22:43,382 --> 00:22:47,502
But Brother Shaowu, you should still do something. Right?

355
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:49,986
Okay.

356
00:22:49,986 --> 00:22:51,940
Tonight,

357
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,140
I'll hold a dinner party here and invite Commander Tan over.

358
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,316
We are all tough guys.

359
00:22:57,316 --> 00:23:00,240
We'll just have a drink together and this will be over.

360
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,869
All right?

361
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:08,630
Do you really want to go?

362
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,250
You clearly know this is a trap.
<i>(T/N : She is actually referring to the Hongmen Banquet, a historical event that took place in 206 BC )</i>

363
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,865
He dared to hurt your uncle,

364
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:14,205
he might do the same to you.

365
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,961
Don't worry. He's not my opponent.

366
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:21,666
Don't talk like a king.

367
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,640
The situation in Jiang City is not as simple as you think.

368
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,863
I know. But your man has been through everything.

369
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,661
Don't worry.

370
00:23:41,015 --> 00:23:42,876
My colleagues.

371
00:23:42,876 --> 00:23:45,541
Commander Tan came to my humble house.

372
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,240
I feel extremely honored.

373
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,520
Commander Tan served as the Commander in Shanghai before.

374
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,156
Now, he came back to Jiang City, a small place.

375
00:23:56,156 --> 00:23:58,175
It is a great honor to us!

376
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:00,015
Everybody, listen up!

377
00:24:01,478 --> 00:24:05,413
Let's make a toast to Commander Tan.

378
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:08,972
From now on, as long as Commander Tan gives an order,

379
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:11,880
we'll walk through fire and do everything for him!

380
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,820
<i>We'll walk through fire and do everything for him!</i>

381
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,841
Everybody, wait a minute. Listen to me.

382
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:22,001
Commander Chen, it is too kind of you to say so.

383
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:24,017
I feel ashamed.

384
00:24:24,017 --> 00:24:27,197
This is a dinner party. Let's put aside our official positions.

385
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:30,641
Most of you here are my seniors and elders.

386
00:24:30,641 --> 00:24:33,860
I'll drink for everyone. Come on. Cheers!

387
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,680
<i>- To Commander Tan!
- To Commander Tan!</i>

388
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,616
- Please have a seat.
- Please.

389
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:48,565
One can't drink without cigarettes. Come on. Have one.

390
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:51,257
Hatamen. That's a good one.

391
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:57,360
Look. The drink is so strong.

392
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,684
- I feel a little dizzy already.
- This is the liquor from your hometown.

393
00:24:59,684 --> 00:25:03,338
You must have been out for too long. Let me light it for you.

394
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,845
The cigarette is great. It's perfect.

395
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,520
<i>[Lush Bamboos and Red Maple Leaves]</i>

396
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,481
Marshal, we received a telegram from Jiang City.

397
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:37,594
<i>[The Tan Army has been separated]</i>
Things are running very smoothly. Tan Xuanlin didn't find out.

398
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,531
If he dies in Jiang City,

399
00:25:44,073 --> 00:25:47,142
he will finally return home.

400
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:51,643
<i>Come on.</i>

401
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:53,618
<i>- Fill the cup.</i>
<i>- Drink more.</i>

402
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,440
Commander Chen,

403
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,386
you say, why do I feel tightness in my chest?

404
00:25:58,386 --> 00:26:00,240
And I'm a little lightheaded, too.

405
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,661
<i>Drink more.</i>

406
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,321
Brothers, I would like to make a toast.

407
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:09,381
It's too noisy here. How about we go out for some fresh air?

408
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:11,121
All right.

409
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,776
- Please. Please.
- Let's go!

410
00:26:14,776 --> 00:26:16,261
Let's go!

411
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:19,737
This way.

412
00:26:35,371 --> 00:26:37,232
How do you feel?

413
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,541
Are you okay?

414
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:43,610
I can't breathe.

415
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,397
<i>Come on. To Commander Liu!</i>

416
00:27:41,397 --> 00:27:43,845
<i>Okay. Drink.</i>

417
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:45,531
<i>- Cheers.
- Cheers.</i>

418
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,619
<i>Drink. Fill the cup.</i>

419
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:49,501
<i>Okay.</i>

420
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,060
<i>Drink. Let's get drunk!</i>

421
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,115
Commander Tan is drunk.

422
00:27:53,115 --> 00:27:55,688
He's getting some air outside.

423
00:28:29,778 --> 00:28:34,639
Commander Chen, the cigarette you gave me was poisonous.

424
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:36,418
<i>One can't drink without cigarettes.</i>

425
00:28:36,418 --> 00:28:38,936
<i>Commander Tan, have one.</i>

426
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,721
Commander Tan, we all welcomed you with our utmost sincerity.

427
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:28,001
But you killed two men without blinking!

428
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:29,445
What are you doing?

429
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:32,405
<i>That's right. What are you doing?</i>

430
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,335
Chen Shaowu murdered Tan Zijie, the former City Guard,

431
00:29:44,335 --> 00:29:47,692
for no reason other than for his own greed.

432
00:29:47,692 --> 00:29:49,313
What does that mean?

433
00:29:49,313 --> 00:29:51,644
<i>- Impossible.
- This is impossible.</i>

434
00:29:54,697 --> 00:29:56,058
<i>Yes.</i>

435
00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:57,504
<i>What is happening?</i>

436
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,962
Everybody.

437
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:02,910
Former City Guard, Tan Zijie, drowned in a hot spring.

438
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,046
He suffered a heart attack.

439
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:08,776
<i>Heart attack? How did that happen?</i>

440
00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:10,401
<i>Yes.</i>

441
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,780
Before he died, he smoked Hatamen

442
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,946
<i>[Hatamen]</i>
given by Chen Shaowu.

443
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,151
Later, we tested the cigarette given by Chen Shaowu

444
00:30:26,151 --> 00:30:28,027
and found that the cigarette

445
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:30,134
contained highly concentrated digitalis.
<i>(T/N: Plant extremely toxic to humans)</i>

446
00:30:30,134 --> 00:30:33,542
Digitalis can send people into cardiac arrest.

447
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:37,620
- Just now, Chen Shaowu tried it again
<i>- So he was poisoned!</i>

448
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,630
and offered the same cigarette to Commander Tan.

449
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,600
<i>How could he be so insidious?</i>

450
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,207
<i>He's crazy!</i>

451
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:46,780
<i>- He deserved to die!
- Such a bad guy.
- Yes.</i>

452
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,976
Chen Shaowu tried to murder the Commander

453
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,682
in order to gain military power.

454
00:30:52,682 --> 00:30:55,042
He deserved it!

455
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:56,520
<i>- Yes!
- Such a person deserved to die.</i>

456
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,140
<i>- He deserved to die.
- Yes!</i>

457
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,389
<i>Devil!</i>

458
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:01,150
<i>Go to hell!</i>

459
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:14,744
What do you think? The new City Guard brought his own soldiers to Jiang City.

460
00:31:14,744 --> 00:31:18,046
This is a change of leadership. What about our future?

461
00:31:18,046 --> 00:31:19,481
What future do we have?

462
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:22,125
Haven't you heard that the City Guard of Huainan got caught by the Revolutionary Army?

463
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,060
Great changes will take place in Jiang City sooner or later.

464
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,719
If the Revolutionary Army comes, we'll all die.

465
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,720
You two should pray for yourselves.

466
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,719
We all worked for Chen Shaowu.

467
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:31,673
We don't know what punishment is waiting for us.

468
00:31:31,673 --> 00:31:34,400
It's said that Commander Tan works for Governor Pei.

469
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,007
What if Governor Xu collects taxes for decades and refuses to admit it?

470
00:31:39,007 --> 00:31:41,999
Every time a new officer comes, our life will be hard for some time.

471
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,452
Don't you think so, too?

472
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:45,656
<i>- Yes.
- Yes. You're right.</i>

473
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:46,780
Hello, everybody.

474
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,308
I'm part of Commander Tan's family.

475
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:51,403
I promise you on his behalf, that you don't have to pay unnecessary taxes anymore.

476
00:31:51,403 --> 00:31:53,160
Miss Tan, is this true?

477
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,360
- Really?
- Really.

478
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,160
- Really!
- Commander Tan is in charge of soldiers,

479
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,385
and I can help him with the bills.

480
00:31:58,385 --> 00:32:01,924
That's great to hear. We are relieved now.

481
00:32:03,002 --> 00:32:05,582
It seems that our life is full of hope.

482
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,281
- Please.
- Please.

483
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,304
Dear colleagues and soldiers,

484
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:32,317
our brothers who defend Jiang City and make great contributions,

485
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:36,542
everybody now knows that Jiang City is in a dangerous situation.

486
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:38,716
Changes are taking place.

487
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:41,530
Without a good commander, everyone is terrified.

488
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:46,341
But fortunately, Commander Tan, a descendant of the Tan family,

489
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:48,686
cares about his hometown and stands up for it.

490
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:50,991
He gave up his position as the Commander of Shanghai,

491
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:55,379
and took the initiative to serve as the City Guard of Jiang City.

492
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:59,513
This is a blessing to our citizens.

493
00:32:59,513 --> 00:33:02,929
It's also a great honor for us.

494
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:07,265
Now, let's welcome Commander Tan Xuanlin,

495
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:10,439
the new City Guard of Jiang City, to give his speech!

496
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:12,943
<i>- Great!
- Good!</i>

497
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:14,326
<i>Great!</i>

498
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,439
<i>Good.</i>

499
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,089
I've been away from home for many years.

500
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:35,124
I believe that not many people recognize me.

501
00:33:35,124 --> 00:33:37,438
But it doesn't matter.

502
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:39,344
You must have heard of Commander Tan,

503
00:33:39,344 --> 00:33:44,288
the youngest King of Shanghai since the founding of the National Republic of China.

504
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:48,864
He not only grabbed the resources of Xu Bojun, the Governor of Yue City,

505
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:50,870
but also caused his downfall.

506
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,522
That's right.

507
00:33:53,522 --> 00:33:55,484
I was that King of Shanghai,

508
00:33:55,484 --> 00:33:57,373
Tan Xuanlin.

509
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:05,883
I volunteered to come back to Jiang City and be its City Guard.

510
00:34:05,883 --> 00:34:08,913
Jiang City is now at the forefront of the battle between the two armies.

511
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,859
The Revolutionary Army always wants to occupy

512
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:13,143
this key amphibious point on the north bank of the Yangtze River.

513
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:16,301
And the Beijing government has been sitting on the sidelines.

514
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:17,890
As long as we don't perform well in battles,

515
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:21,131
they will send someone at any time to take us over,

516
00:34:21,131 --> 00:34:23,080
or even fight against us.

517
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:27,081
There's one sentence that can describe our current situation.

518
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:29,735
We're now surrounded on all sides.

519
00:34:34,678 --> 00:34:38,039
So, the future of Jiang City

520
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,940
not only involves me,

521
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,090
but also relates to your life and death.

522
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,493
I did not come back to gain power.

523
00:34:46,493 --> 00:34:48,179
Nor do I want fame or fortune.

524
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:52,143
I just want to find a way out for Jiang City.

525
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:56,558
More importantly, I want to find you all a way out.

526
00:34:56,558 --> 00:35:00,066
As the old saying goes, "Smart guys know the ins and outs."

527
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:02,215
Now the Revolutionary Army is on the other side of the shore.

528
00:35:02,215 --> 00:35:04,960
Even if we bury mines and close the gate,

529
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,160
how long can we hold on?

530
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,022
Over the past ten years,

531
00:35:09,022 --> 00:35:12,341
be it Governor Luo, Governor Xu, or Governor Pei,

532
00:35:12,341 --> 00:35:17,527
which one really regarded citizens' lives as his first priority?

533
00:35:17,527 --> 00:35:21,893
To them, Jiang City is just a barrier against wars

534
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:25,519
and something that can be discarded at any time.

535
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:29,653
So, as the new City Guard of Jiang City,

536
00:35:29,653 --> 00:35:31,522
I now declare

537
00:35:31,522 --> 00:35:35,081
that Jiang City will support the revolution!

538
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,996
We… We are on the same boat.

539
00:35:48,996 --> 00:35:50,929
- How can we fight against each other?
- What is he doing?

540
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:52,299
Don't be afraid.

541
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:55,021
I'm Mu Wanqing, President of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.

542
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:57,124
I volunteered to come to Jiang City with Commander Tan,

543
00:35:57,124 --> 00:35:59,982
because the war of the governors really makes our life miserable.

544
00:35:59,982 --> 00:36:03,396
We've been paying taxes for decades, but nobody is living a good life now.

545
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:07,316
Supporting the revolution will only bring us benefits.

546
00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:09,140
Yes, we can feel better if you say that.

547
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,983
So, everyone, please trust us.

548
00:36:10,983 --> 00:36:12,720
<i>We believe in you.</i>

549
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,820
<i>You are young and promising.</i>

550
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,659
<i>We believe you.</i>

551
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,841
<i>Yes.</i>

552
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:19,860
<i>We can do this.</i>

553
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,540
<i>I believe you.</i>

554
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,281
<i>Great.</i>

555
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,540
It's my decision to support the revolution.

556
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,580
But everyone has their own choice.

557
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,443
I won't force you.

558
00:36:32,443 --> 00:36:35,863
Now, those who are willing to follow me,

559
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,781
I'll treat you as my brothers.

560
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:39,952
Those who are unwilling,

561
00:36:39,952 --> 00:36:41,870
I won't force you to stay.

562
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:44,480
I'll count to five.

563
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,396
Those who are willing to follow me, put down your guns.

564
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,241
Five.

565
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,161
Four.

566
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:08,267
Three.

567
00:37:10,082 --> 00:37:11,743
Two.

568
00:37:15,382 --> 00:37:17,043
One.

569
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:36,716
<i>Why are they leaving?</i>

570
00:37:36,716 --> 00:37:39,141
<i>What's going on?</i>

571
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,020
<i>What's going on?</i>

572
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,180
<i>Commander Tan has really got something.</i>

573
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,400
<i>Yes. He is amazing.</i>

574
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,710
You have been through real battles.

575
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,220
Of course, you're different from others.

576
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,100
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

577
00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:57,656
All right.

578
00:37:57,656 --> 00:37:59,941
Since you chose to stay,

579
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:02,309
you are all my brothers.

580
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:03,980
Let's fight together,

581
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,082
and enjoy the good times together.

582
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,644
Defend Jiang City!

583
00:38:09,644 --> 00:38:11,430
We will survive with the city!

584
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:16,380
<i>We will survive with the city! We will survive with the city!</i>

585
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,880
<i>We will survive with the city!</i>

586
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,641
Junior Marshal.

587
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,260
How did you forget again?

588
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,601
I'm so forgetful.

589
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:36,880
Commander, the battle in Huainan yesterday

590
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,960
was truly a triumph.

591
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,924
Look at the City Guard of Huainan.

592
00:38:40,924 --> 00:38:43,400
We caught him with his pants down.

593
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,360
We acted so quickly and accurately.

594
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:50,334
That City Guard was the Commander of the Defense Battalion in the late Qing Dynasty.

595
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:53,024
His soldiers are just some punks.

596
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:55,408
They just want to get more money and have no training at all.

597
00:38:55,408 --> 00:38:57,501
Of course, they would be no match for us.

598
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,080
That's right.

599
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:13,855
Commander, is that Su Hongchen?

600
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:25,862
I heard about it in Guangzhou already.

601
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:30,447
Everyone praises you as a prodigy from Baoding Military Academy.

602
00:39:30,447 --> 00:39:33,050
You succeeded in the very first battle and caught the City Guard of Huainan

603
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,610
without suffering a single loss.

604
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,040
I'm so proud of you.

605
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,736
Stop this. They're all old and weak soldiers.

606
00:39:38,736 --> 00:39:40,821
It's not even worth mentioning.

607
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:44,497
Anyways, everybody knows about you now.

608
00:39:44,497 --> 00:39:47,591
Guys in Guangzhou know that you are an able man now.

609
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:49,259
Stop talking about this.

610
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,726
Why are you here?

611
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:57,432
Shouldn't you be at the front line at this time?

612
00:39:57,432 --> 00:40:00,700
I'm here to bring good news to you.

613
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:06,873
<i>[Tan Xuanlin Supports the Revolution Right After He Took Office in Jiang City]</i>

614
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,904
Finally, he made his choice.

615
00:40:10,904 --> 00:40:16,101
In the past, I hated him so much.

616
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:17,525
But thinking about it now,

617
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:20,113
he is the one who can do big things.

618
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,913
He took over the key amphibious point easily and quietly.

619
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,632
I can't help but respect him.

620
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:33,860
But things are going too smoothly.

621
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,145
I feel a little bit insecure.

622
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,116
Are you worried about your father?

623
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:47,453
Jiang City used to be part of my father's territory.

624
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:49,908
Although he stepped down,

625
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:54,696
it's too strange that he's not taking action.

626
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,482
Don't worry too much.

627
00:40:57,482 --> 00:41:00,060
Maybe, since he can't get your news,

628
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,330
your father doesn't want to think about this anymore.

629
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:03,810
No.

630
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,907
You don't know my father.

631
00:41:06,907 --> 00:41:09,308
He won't let go easily.

632
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:14,768
He finally revealed his true colors.

633
00:41:14,768 --> 00:41:18,100
When Tan Xuanlin was in Shanghai, he colluded with the Revolutionary Party.

634
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,760
It was a pity that he got through easily.

635
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,804
This time, Pei Xun is shooting himself in his own foot.

636
00:41:23,804 --> 00:41:25,650
The City Guard he had introduced

637
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,548
betrayed him right after he took office.

638
00:41:28,548 --> 00:41:31,526
Pei Xun is responsible for this.

639
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,457
Yes. Fortunately, we were fully prepared in Jiang City.

640
00:41:35,457 --> 00:41:39,683
Now we can just wait for Tan Xuanlin to walk into the trap.

641
00:41:39,683 --> 00:41:42,708
He thought that everything would be fine as long as Chen Shaowu was killed.

642
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:46,854
But he doesn't know that something more dangerous is waiting for him.

Send a telegram to the one in Jiang City.

645

Tell him to continue with our plan.
