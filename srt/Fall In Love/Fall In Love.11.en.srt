Commander.

There are several cotton yarn mill owners who want to see you.

29
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,140
Oh!

30
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,570
Boss Wang, Boss Guo, Boss Chen.

31
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,214
Please, have a seat.

32
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,864
Such rare guests.

33
00:02:29,864 --> 00:02:31,810
Tan Si, pour the tea.

34
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,481
Commander Tan, we have come to see you today because of something very important.

35
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:37,440
We are not in the mood for tea.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,115
What kind of difficulties have you all encountered?

37
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:43,303
Commander Tan, your army has two thousand soldiers.

38
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:46,800
And aside from Mu's cotton mill, the three of us took in most of them.

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,975
We settled down at least two hundred soldiers and four or five hundred at most.

40
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:53,010
Yes. I know all of that,

41
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,339
and I'm very grateful to you three bosses for solving my urgent problems.

42
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:58,550
Commander Tan, to be honest with you.

43
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,200
Those soldiers we took in have given us unspeakable hardships.

44
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:07,165
<i>Think about it. If your soldiers go to the cotton mills,</i>

45
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:10,826
<i>it's not them who will be miserable, but the owners of the mills.</i>

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,690
Boss Wang, why do you say that?

47
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,808
Your soldiers, they're great soldiers. But they really can't do any manual labor.

48
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:21,426
Even the work of five or six of them added up still can't compare to one skilled worker.

49
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:23,484
Their work efficiency is too low.

50
00:03:23,484 --> 00:03:26,365
But they still take up one of our looms with such a low work efficiency.

51
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:29,770
It has caused a sharp drop in the production rate at our cotton yarn mill.

52
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,921
I've done some calculations.

53
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:35,620
Now our output is half of what it was before we took in the soldiers.

54
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:37,960
<i>Asking a hand equipped for holding guns, to hold a spindle,</i>

55
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,243
<i>will first result in inefficiency.</i>

56
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:43,450
<i>And efficiency is the life of yarn mills.</i>

57
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,812
These soldiers, they're paid the same as skilled workers

58
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:49,840
even though they aren't doing a good job.

59
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,195
Even though we're subsidized by the Chamber of Commerce,

60
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:55,421
the skilled workers will inevitably be dissatisfied with it.

61
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:59,120
I'm not going to hide it. My mill was shut down for two days.

62
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,980
The workers are all asking for a pay raise.

63
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,730
We can't afford it.

64
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:08,798
<i>Inequality is a greater issue than scarcity. If working and not working are being paid the same, </i>
<i>(T/N: Wanqing is quoting The Analects)</i>

65
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:10,765
<i>then who would want to work?</i>

66
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:12,171
That's true, Commander Tan.

67
00:04:12,171 --> 00:04:15,601
The cotton yarn industry hasn't been prosperous in the past two years.

68
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:18,830
The Japanese muslin had a great impact on us.

69
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,930
Although the Chamber of Commerce will give us some subsidies,

70
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,730
we can barely make a living.

71
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:25,830
But the profit is already very low.

72
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,001
<i>Foreign muslin has been dumped these past few years. Local mills are already in a tough situation.</i>

73
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:33,628
<i>They would not be able to handle a pay raise.</i>

74
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:35,395
So, Commander Tan,

75
00:04:35,395 --> 00:04:39,432
the three of us come to see you today because we have a favor to ask you.

76
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:41,480
Please take back your men.

77
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,670
They're all tough men, firm and unyielding.

78
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,583
Spinning and weaving in our yarn mills, their skills are wasted.

79
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:53,934
Gentlemen, I'm so sorry.

80
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:57,173
Because when I took office as the Commander of Shanghai,

81
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,610
I made a pact with Provincial Military Governor Xu.

82
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,229
The first clause was to dismiss the Tan Army.

83
00:05:03,757 --> 00:05:07,180
Of course I know, sending these soldiers of mine to your mills

84
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,350
would be like Zhangfei embroidering.
<i>(T/N: Zhangfei was a famous general during the Three Kingdoms) </i>

85
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,885
But whoever started this issue should end it.

86
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:14,935
We have to wait for Military Governor Xu to give the orders.

87
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,343
- This…
- This…

88
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:24,651
<i>She really didn't miss anything.</i>

89
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,690
- Great.
- This way.

90
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,365
- Farewell.
- Goodbye. See you.

91
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:52,574
Connect me to the military governor's mansion in Yue City.

92
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,103
What's wrong?

93
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:03,160
Mu Zhiyuan just called me, saying he wishes me an early happy new year.

94
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,540
But in reality, he was lobbying for those mill owners.

95
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,028
He says that the textile mill industry is currently in recession,

96
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:13,350
and the soldiers being there is making it even worse.

97
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,125
If he isn't trying to gain pity, he is trying to brush off his responsibilities.

98
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,950
Didn't the Chinese Chamber of Commerce already give them resettlement subsidies?

99
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,837
Did these mill owners just take money but do nothing?

100
00:06:23,837 --> 00:06:26,625
In my opinion, this is Tan Xuanlin's doing.

101
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,775
He's causing these troubles on purpose.

102
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:31,093
Military Governor,

103
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:35,180
can't we just ignore these mill owners?

104
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,120
Tan Xuanlin has dismissed his army anyway,

105
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,295
and all his soldiers are scattered in the yarn mills.

106
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:43,381
There will definitely be some crime happening after a period of neglect.

107
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:46,740
Then we'll have a reason to deal with him.

108
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,501
Military Governor Xu gave my father a polite rebuff.

109
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:55,390
He still insists on settling the soldiers in the mill.

110
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,928
But he also disclosed that it won't be too long.

111
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:01,878
He won't make it too difficult for yarn mill owners.

112
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:06,392
Xu Bojun must have other plans.

113
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:10,217
He can't be that kind with my soldiers.

114
00:07:10,217 --> 00:07:14,233
Then you should now believe that I genuinely want to help you.

115
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:18,417
You've indeed foreseen every step.

116
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,059
If there's nothing else, I have to leave now.

117
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:55,821
I'm busy with official duties.

118
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:58,836
What has been wrong with you recently?

119
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:04,701
You're like a different person. You've stopped joking around.

120
00:08:05,993 --> 00:08:08,852
Don't you like a serious gentleman?

121
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:10,802
I don't.

122
00:08:17,435 --> 00:08:20,768
Do you like a man like me?

123
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,366
You're overthinking it.

124
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,770
Fine.

125
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,660

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,953
Cindy? Cindy.

127
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:35,952
Where are you, Cindy?

136
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,289
Yes, it was published by the Command. What's wrong with it?

137
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,413
Commander Tan, did it ever occur to you?

138
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:12,364
If you wrote that, the Revolutionary Army would regard me as their enemy.

Today, my cat was killed.

140
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:17,006
I'm sure the next one will be me.

141
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:19,543
I don't care. You published the newspaper,

142
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:22,183
so you have to keep me safe.

143
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:25,786
Then, Mr. Joseph, how do you want me to keep you safe?

144
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:30,608
You must send soldiers to guard my house and company.

145
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:35,712
Have some professionals follow me at all times.

146
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,120
Mr. Joseph,

147
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,320
I understand what you're going through, and I sympathize with you.

148
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,020
But there is nothing I can do.

149
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,420
The soldiers of the Command are not at my disposal.

150
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,800
Commander Tan, are you joking?

151
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,400
Take it easy, take it easy. Do I look like I'm joking with you?

152
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,860
Although I'm the Commander of Shanghai, it is in name only.

153
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,830
At the beginning of my tenure, I made a pact with the military governor's mansion.

154
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,980
Even if we mobilize a single soldier, it must be approved by the military governor's mansion.

155
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,440
This is ridiculous.

156
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,140
So according to what you are saying,

157
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,277
if I am attacked, I have to wait for instructions from the military governor's mansion

158
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:22,887
before the troops are sent?

159
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,784
Yes.

160
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,296
What kind of rubbish agreement is that?

161
00:11:27,296 --> 00:11:32,600
How can our personal safety be guaranteed like this?

162
00:11:34,785 --> 00:11:37,745
Commander Tan, you have your own army, right?

163
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:40,760
If you send your soldiers to protect me,

164
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,081
then you don't need the approval of the military governor's mansion. Right?

165
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,270
Mr. Joseph,

166
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,150
my army has been dismissed.

167
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,280
They handed over their guns. I have no soldiers now.

168
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:02,936
But, Mr. Joseph,

169
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:06,963
it's not like there is no solution to this.

170
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,200
- I'm sorry, Sir.
- My God, Joseph.

171
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,800
Look!

172
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,100
What's up, man?

173
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,600
What is it?

174
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,200
Come on.

175
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
Come on.

176
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll be back in ten minutes.

177
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,400
My God, what is it?

178
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,600
Cindy.

179
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
Cindy was killed.

180
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,600
Right at my house.

181
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,300
It's the Revolutionary Army.

182
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,800
And I'm their next target.

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,700
Damn it.

184
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,760
<i>[Provincial Military Governor's Mansion]</i>

185
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,800
Military Governor, Mr. Anton Fay is calling.

186
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,800
<i>[Defense Command of Shanghai]</i>

187
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,400
Commander,

188
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,000
I can't believe

189
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,700
that Xu Bojun will be soft in front of foreigners.

190
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,600
He even agreed to build a militia.

191
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Joseph went to see Anton Fay, with tears in his eyes,

192
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,800
and he insisted on forming a militia to protect the security of the concession.

193
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,500
For the sake of his old friend,

194
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,400
Anton Fay had a showdown with Xu Bojun.

195
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,100
Xu Bojun doesn't dare to reject him in public,

196
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,000
so he has to swallow his grievances in silence.

197
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,900
What do you know?

198
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,100
A cat succeeded in something that even Miss Gu failed to do.

199
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,800
You can't say this in front of Shuang'er.

200
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,900
I know, Miss Gu has self-respect.

201
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,800
And we'll give her the credit for it

202
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,600
as long as she's happy.

203
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,100
Commander, those foreigners are really strange.

204
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,400
There are so many wounded soldiers and refugees in Shanghai

205
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,500
who are being chased by patrolmen all day long.

206
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,300
They never said a thing.

207
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,400
But look how scared they are with a dead cat.

208
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,000
They immediately ask us to build the militia to defend the concession.

209
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,600
Do you know what this is called?

210
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,800
This is as the saying goes, you'll never feel the pain

211
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,400
if you aren't the one getting cut.

212
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,700
To me, Commander is the smarter one.

213
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:39,800
The military governor's mansion was caught off-guard this round.

214
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,200
It's just a pity for a certain big shot in our Command.

215
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,200
I bet he is being scolded by his father now.

216
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,700
The military governor says that your incompetence

217
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,100
was exploited by Tan Xuanlin again.

218
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,800
It's not your fault.

219
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,100
Who knew that Joseph would interfere at this time?

220
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,600
And that Joseph is the most successful Jewish businessman in the Far East.

221
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,400
He owns half of the Bund.

222
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,100
So how can we compete with him?

223
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,600
I used to think everything would be settled if Tan Xuanlin

224
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,700
handed in the guns and resettled his soldiers.

225
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,400
I didn't expect this. I was careless.

226
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,000
My father's reprimand is right.

227
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,200
We can't blame you for that.

228
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,900
It's Tan Xuanlin. He's so crafty.

229
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,700
You can't believe a word he says.

230
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,560
What did the military governor say?

231
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,900
We can't let him build up the militia, right?

232
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,700
The military governor won't let him get away with this.

233
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,900
He said it was put forth by Anton Fay himself.

234
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,700
He can't reject the Municipal Council, so he wants us to wait and see.

235
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,500
Don't act rashly.

236
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,000
I think Father hasn't come up with a good plan yet.

237
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Military Governor, here is the newspaper.

238
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,500
There are more and more articles about factory disturbances and strikes.

239
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,560
<i>[Spinners protest against inequality demanding labor-based distribution]</i>

240
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't need to look at it. I already know

241
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,200
it's that bandit bastard Tan Xuanlin who is causing trouble.

242
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,300
Mill owners want to get rid of their baggage.

243
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,500
The British want to ensure the protection of the concession.

244
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,200
Tan Xuanlin.

245
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,100
He wants to take advantage of this chaos.

246
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,000
This bandit bastard is really sly.

247
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,900
It's not easy to build up

248
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,800
a private army under my jurisdiction.

249
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,340
If he thinks he can use this tactic to make me admit the existence of the militia,

250
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,900
he's naive.

251
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,600
What do you mean?

252
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,000
If Tan Xuanlin's soldiers can't

253
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,500
protect the security of the concession,

254
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,600
and they disturb the public order, can his militia still exist?

255
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,200
Will the British still support him?

256
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,000
Military Governor, you're brilliant.

257
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,400
Mr. Mu wants to stand up for those mill owners

258
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,800
and get rid of the Tan Army.

259
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,600
Can those ruffians in the Tan Army willingly take this loss?

260
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,800
Understood, sir.

261
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,800
I'll send Min Dacheng to arrange it.

Please fix it for me.

268
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,800
Mrs. Mu, you can have some tea in the back.

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,900
You're quite carefree.

273

274

No way.

I've arranged everything as you asked.

But she's completely fine right now.

Anyway, she's just a girl.

Why do you have to be so ruthless?

that little bitch would never be presentable,

283
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,000
but I underestimated her.

and she stays next to him.

My Lord is beginning to value her as well.

287

And her temper is getting bigger.

288
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,100
She even hit Wanting.

289
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,900
What?

290
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,200
She dared to hit Wanting?

291
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,300
Not only did she hit Wanting,

292
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,200
she doesn't return home at night now,

293
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,800
and lives in Guangyao's lounge.

294
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,500
Before long,

295
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,200
Wanting won't be the one marrying him.

all of the Mu Family's property will fall into her hands.

All right.

they're over there having a lively family reunion dinner.

316

They leave me here alone,

317
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,900
cold, and cheerless.

318
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,100
Commander, don't say that.

319
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,800
We still have your fourth sister right?

320
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,910
I'll be thrilled if she doesn't piss me off.

321
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,900
But for real, you really have to discipline her more.

322
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,700
Since she met that Pei Shaojun,

323
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,500
the number of times she defied people is increasing.

324
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,800
Even I can't keep her under control.

325
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,800
That boy.

326
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,000
He's a nice guy.

327
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,600
It's just, these days,

328
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,900
wearing a uniform means leading a precarious life.

329
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,700
I really don't want to see Little Four

330
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,200
live in great suspense and agitation.

331
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,400
I'd rather she marry a scholar.

332
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Even a businessman.

333
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,600
I want her to live peacefully.

334
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,300
Fourth Young Miss is still young.

335
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,800
When she grows up,

336
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,700
she'll understand your good intentions.

337
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,100
She has grown up,

338
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,400
turning eighteen in a blink of an eye. How grown up should she be?

339
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,100
In the past,

340
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,100
I was out fighting with my troops.

341
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,300
I sent her to boarding school when she was eight years old.

342
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,900
Back then, when I sent her away,

343
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,300
she cried and shouted, not wanting me to leave.

344
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,800
I thought I could

345
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,400
spend more time with her when I had the time.

346
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,000
Then, she stopped crying and shouting.

347
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,800
The way she looked at me has also changed.

348
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,900
Now,

349
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,000
she doesn't need me at all.

350
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Fourth Young Miss used to be clingy and good-natured.

351
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,900
She's totally different now.

352
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,500
Yeah.

353
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,100
But I'm really afraid of keeping her by my side.

354
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Tan Si, do you know?

355
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,200
She's my biological sister.

356
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,000
I can't take the risk.

357
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,100
All I want is for her and Shuang'er

358
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,700
to grow up safely and peacefully.

359
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,900
Marry someone reliable.

360
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,700
Then, I'll be relieved.

361
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,200
What's that?

362
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,100
Someone put a lunch box near the door.

363
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,300
Dumplings.

364
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,900
Who else could it be?

365
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,800
It's Little Four.

366
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,100
Other than her, no one can make such an ugly dumpling.

367
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,600
Let's eat.

368
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,500
Little Four!

369
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,600
Slow down, Little Four.

370
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Little Four.

371
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,400
What's wrong? Are you all right?

372
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,500
Sister Shuang, I sprained my ankle.

373
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,200
Look at you.

374
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,400
Let's sit there. Walk slower.

375
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,300
Here. Slowly.

376
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,900
Does it hurt? Are you in pain?

377
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,200
Look at you.

378
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,100
Your second brother will have to worry again if he finds out.

379
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,800
In the future, you should listen to your second brother

380
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,500
and keep a distance from that Pei Shaojun.

381
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,400
Okay?

382
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,300
Miss Gu, what a coincidence!

383
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,800
<i>That boy, he's a nice guy.</i>

384
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,700
<i>It's just, these days,</i>

385
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,400
<i>wearing a uniform means leading a precarious life.</i>

386
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
<i>I really don't want to see Little Four</i>

387
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,400
<i>live in great suspense and agitation.</i>

388
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,700
Junior Marshal Su, Junior Marshal Pei.

389
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,000
You're here just in time. Little Four sprained her foot.

390
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,700
Can you guys help her home?

391
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,600
It's you again, you little liar.

392
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,800
What?

393
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,300
You want to play the same broken ankle trick again,

394
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,900
so our Old Pei can take you home, right?

395
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,800
I really twisted my foot this time.

396
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,700
You're a junior marshal, standing there talking sarcastically.

397
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,200
You don't have any sympathy.

398
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,800
You even choose to pick up old scores with me.

399
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,300
You're no gentleman.

400
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,400
You…

401
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,300
You're fine. It's nothing serious.

402
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,800
Take a rest for two days and try to walk less.

403
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,700
How do you feel?

404
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,200
It really doesn't seem to hurt anymore, Sister Shuang.

405
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,600
Old Pei, these two girls are on their feet on such a cold night.

406
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,100
Maybe we should give them a ride home?

407
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,000
Guys, look!

408
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,100
So pretty!

409
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,500
It's beautiful!

410
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,100
I wonder if I can have the honor

411
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,500
of enjoying the fireworks with Miss Gu.

412
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,700
Sister Shuang, I want to watch them.

413
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,700
Let's see it together.

414
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,300
Okay.

415
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,800
What are you doing?

416
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,400
Who taught you to meddle?

417
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,800
Let's create an opportunity for him.

418
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,200
<i>Second Brother, it's God who keeps making us meet.</i>

419
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
<i>You can't blame me.</i>

420
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,600
Junior Marshal Pei.

421
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,500
You said that I should move around less,

422
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,400
so shouldn't you help me a little?

423
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,300
How should I help?

424
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,000
I want to go there to see the fireworks.

425
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:54,900
<i>♫ If the rainbow is the reflection of the sky ♫</i>

426
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,900
<i>♫ Your smile is like sunshine after the rain ♫</i>

427
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,300
<i>♫ For you, I'll tramp over hill and dale ♫</i>

428
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:08,200
<i>♫ Run to the long-lost decision ♫</i>

429
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,300
<i>♫ that belongs to you ♫</i>

430
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:22,300
<i>♫ If love is the life of land ♫</i>

431
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,000
<i>♫ Your kisses are gentle breezes and light rain♫</i>

432
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,400
Look! It's more beautiful than before.

433
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,800
<i>♫ For you, I'll follow your path♫</i>

434
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,600
<i>♫ Even if I can only grasp ♫</i>

435
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,200
<i>♫ Grasp the dandelion of yours ♫</i>

436
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,100
<i>♫ Your promise makes my heart surge like a gathering storm ♫</i>

437
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:55,300
<i>♫ I'll give you a cloudless day of sunshine in your eyes ♫</i>

438
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:01,500
<i>♫ I spent my entire life wanting to be in yours ♫</i>

439
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,400
Although the fireworks are beautiful,

440
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,100
they're only dazzling at this moment,

441
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,800
they dissipate after the smoke.

442
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,200
Although the fireworks are short,

443
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,800
their beauty is enough for me to remember for a lifetime.

444
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,300
Since Sister Shuang likes fireworks,

445
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,100
you should let Junior Marshal Su set some off for you every day.

446
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,700
They are not talking about fireworks but life.

447
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,200
Tonight is New Year's Eve.

448
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,800
It's not easy for us to get together.

449
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,100
Let's talk about something happier.

450
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,400
Okay.

451
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,500
Something happier.

452
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,700
Fireworks are fickle.

453
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,200
May we all be like a river of spring water that never ends.

454
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,000
Yes, never ends!

455
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,300
<i>[Defense Command of Shanghai]</i>

456
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,800
<i>♫ I've tried my best to make a good story ♫</i>

457
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,700
<i>♫ when you suddenly stop for me ♫</i>

458
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,900
- Give me one.
- Brother Guangyao, look!

459
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,400
<i>♫ when you suddenly stop ♫</i>

460
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,000
Look at how good they look together!

461
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,500
So beautiful.

462
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,499
Brother Guangyao.

463
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:54,628
It's pretty.

464
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:09,235
Happy New Year.

465
00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:13,433
Happy New Year.

466
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:18,001
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

467
00:33:51,974 --> 00:33:53,507
Miss Wanqing.

468
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:55,481
Cleaning up?

469
00:33:58,501 --> 00:34:00,226
Had dumplings last night?

470
00:34:00,226 --> 00:34:01,370
Yes.

471
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,585
It was from Fourth Miss and Miss Gu.

472
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:04,920
Miss Gu came here as well?

473
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,670
Tan Si, you should put yesterday's…

474
00:34:12,662 --> 00:34:15,864
What brings you here? What's the matter?

475
00:34:18,796 --> 00:34:22,886
I wanted to give you some snacks for the holidays.

476
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:27,280
You don't have to.

477
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,467
Right, your idea was not bad.

478
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:33,660
As soon as the news of the decision from the Municipal Council comes back,

479
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,567
those mill owners won't wait to send my soldiers back.

480
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:40,005
Xu Bojun can't stop it if he wanted to.

481
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:43,005
Then it's great.

482
00:34:46,327 --> 00:34:48,166
Anything else?

483
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,848
I don't think you've been yourself lately. You've been very serious.

484
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:56,318
Are you in trouble?

485
00:34:56,318 --> 00:34:59,256
You women are so troublesome.

486
00:34:59,256 --> 00:35:01,159
If I'm not serious, you call me indecent.

487
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:04,181
When I'm serious, you think I'm having problems.

488
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:06,414
What can I do?

489
00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:08,646
All right, Military Governor Xu will be here soon.

490
00:35:08,646 --> 00:35:12,366
If he sees you at my place this early in the morning, he'll misunderstand the situation.

491
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,203
Commander.

492
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:17,788
Come in.

493
00:35:29,468 --> 00:35:34,501
Commander, the waiter who drugged Miss Mu has been caught.

494
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:35,608
What did you find out?

495
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:38,708
It was ordered by Min Dacheng, the boss of Baoli Pawnshop.

496
00:35:39,475 --> 00:35:41,745
Baoli Pawnshop…

497
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:45,965
Why would a businessman like him want to hurt Mu Wanqing?

498
00:35:45,965 --> 00:35:47,275
That's right.

499
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:48,600
A businessman offends the Mu Family.

500
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,742
That's a death wish!

501
00:35:51,921 --> 00:35:53,690
Okay.

502
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:56,240
Let's go meet him.

503
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:20,960
<i>[Baoli Pawnshop]</i>

504
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,130
Commander, there's no one here.

505
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,463
Go back for now.

506
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:38,948
Send someone to keep an eye on it.

507
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:42,198
Report to me as soon as Min Dacheng returns.

508
00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:43,810
Yes, Sir.

509
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,760
<i>Okay, haven't seen them in a while.</i>

510
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,820
<i>Let them come over.</i>

511
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,521
Xu Cheng, tomorrow is the inauguration of the Chamber of Commerce Militia.

512
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:01,080
I won't be attending.

513
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,982
If Commander Tan asks about me, just tell him I'm sick.

514
00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:06,032
Okay, Junior Marshal.

515
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,400
<i>[The Defense Command of Shanghai]</i>

516
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:19,600
Commander, look at your figure.

517
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,870
You were born a handsome man. How can we not win the war?

518
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,080
It is unjustifiable to lose the war!

519
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,100
Stop it. Warfare depends on brains, not all these garish things.

520
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,611
I'm just trying to flatter you.

521
00:37:32,611 --> 00:37:35,764
If you feel happy, you can increase my wages.

522
00:37:35,764 --> 00:37:38,840
Get over that. It's impossible.

523
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,510
Don't go. My shoulder patch is crooked.

524
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,383
Help me adjust it again.

525
00:37:47,424 --> 00:37:50,049
Didn't you say it's garish?

526
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:52,282
This is not a war, it's a ceremony.

527
00:37:52,282 --> 00:37:54,432
What is the saying?

528
00:37:54,432 --> 00:37:56,321
A man relies on his clothes and a horse with a saddle.

529
00:37:56,321 --> 00:37:58,821
Okay, the saddle is ready.

530
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:02,400
Right. Go see if Miss Mu and Military Governor Xu are here.

531
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,938
Yes.

532
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,050
- Mr. Zhou.
- My lady.

533
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,434
Mr. Zhou.

534
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:25,280
After dropping off My Lord, we'll go to the foreign firm on Jisifeier Road

535
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,072
to pick up some furs for Miss.

536
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,947
Yes, My Lady.

537
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,680
- Okay.
- Okay.

538
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,130
Father, are you going to speak at today's ceremony?

539
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,637
I'm not.

540
00:38:44,637 --> 00:38:47,430
Although the militia is the proposal of Executive Director Fay,

541
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:52,298
the military governor's mansion knows that this is Commander Tan's idea.

542
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:55,563
Guangyao has made it clear that he's not going to attend.

543
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:59,352
We can't take a stand when we attend. Just take part in it.

544
00:38:59,352 --> 00:39:01,905
Okay. Then we should go after breakfast.

545
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:03,504
Okay.

546
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:06,948
My Lord. My Lord.

547
00:39:06,948 --> 00:39:10,189
Wanting has a stomach ache. She's bedridden.

548
00:39:10,189 --> 00:39:12,855
How can it be this serious? Is she okay?

549
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:15,346
I can't tell. You must go check on her.

550
00:39:15,346 --> 00:39:18,096
Otherwise, we should call a doctor.

551
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:23,184
Wanqing, I'm going to check on Wanting.

552
00:39:23,184 --> 00:39:26,034
You go first. I'll be there soon.

553
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:30,390
- Okay. Then, if they want you to speak, I'll help you turn it down.
- Okay.

554
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,711
The car is here. Let the driver take you first.

555
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:34,328
Okay.

556
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:07,086
This alley is usually quite lively.

557
00:40:07,086 --> 00:40:10,630
It's really strange today. There is no one at all.

558
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,119
Back up!

559
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,493
Miss.

560
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,024
Don't move.

561
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,800
My Lord, oh, no!

562
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,291
Miss Wanqing has been kidnapped.

563
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:57,570
- What are you saying?
- What?

564
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,720
Where?

565
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,531
<i>[Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai]</i>
Ladies and Gentlemen.

566
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:03,113
Today is the day of the establishment of the Militia Bureau

567
00:41:03,113 --> 00:41:05,430
of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai.

568
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,950
We welcome everyone.

569
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:13,680
Next, let's welcome Commander Tan to the stage.

570
00:41:29,227 --> 00:41:32,370
Dear Brothers. Today, we're here to establish the Militia Bureau

571
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:36,280
of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai.

572
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,910
I'm humbled to be appointed by the Municipal Council…

573
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,670
Commander.

574
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,430
Okay, I got it.

575
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:49,220
I hope we can all work together to keep Shanghai peaceful.

576
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,790
Commander Tan! Commander Tan!

577
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,990
Old Fu, you stay here and keep an eye out. I'll take some soldiers to have a look.

578
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,180
- Okay.
- Come with me.

579
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,280
Let us all work together.

580
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,281
What are they doing?

581
00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:04,920
<i>All work together to keep the peace!</i>

582
00:42:08,244 --> 00:42:10,050
Bunch of losers!

583
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,924
The order was to kidnap Mu Zhiyuan.

584
00:42:12,924 --> 00:42:14,692
You've kidnapped a woman.

585
00:42:14,692 --> 00:42:16,700
We were clearly following Mu Zhiyuan's car

586
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,760
from Mu Mansion to Deqing Road, and we made a move.

587
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,120
- Who knew it was a woman in the car?
- Who is this woman?

588
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,313
She's the daughter of Mu Zhiyuan.
