Hurry up! It's already late.

- Fix it, now!
- Madam.

30
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,186
Miss Wanting requested that a car be sent to pick up her friend,

31
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:13,970
but every car in the house has been sent to the train station

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,848
to pick up the Provincial Military Governor and the Provincial Commander.

33

There's only one left, but it's to pick up Miss Wanqing at the pier.

34
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,089
Just borrow another car then.

35
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:24,280
But Miss Wanqing's ship will arrive too soon for that.

00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:09,205
I feel…

56
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:11,565
I feel...

57
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:13,544
like I've got an upset stomach.

58
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:16,309
Would it be all right if I leave you

59
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,442
and go back to lie down?

60
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:22,099
No, definitely not. I don't have an appetite without you.

61
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:24,060
But I'm really not feeling well.

62
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,311
Be good, all right?

63
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,085
Just stay.

64
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,820
I can't eat alone.

65
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:49,747
But I have a stomach ache.

66
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:51,489
All right,

67
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:53,209
feel it for yourself.

68
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:56,510
It really hurts.

69
00:05:57,143 --> 00:05:58,739
Go ahead.

70
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,028
Miss, your newspaper.

71
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:30,220
Thank you.

72
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:11,882
So your stomach ache is gone.

73
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:26,832
Why open my suitcase?

74
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:29,350
You'll get into trouble if you rush into action.

75
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,820
Provincial Military Governor Xu has strong connections in Shanghai.

76
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,450
Do you think you can turn Shanghai upside down

77
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,201
simply by buying off the Defense Commander of Shanghai?

78
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:37,450
It's not possible!

79
00:07:37,997 --> 00:07:39,720
So that's why

80
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,960
you want to steal my defense map

81
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,280
and hand it to Xu Bojun's men?

82
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,145
If your plan is leaked,

83
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:50,600
you'll call it off.

84
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:57,914

You betray me,

89
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:24,600
and say it's for my own good?

90
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,580
Junior Marshal, how can you say that?

91
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,656
Can you not feel

92
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:33,006

Okay?

102
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:09,760
Someone will pick me up at the pier.

103
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,550
If I don't show up, they will call the police.

104
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:18,540
Come with me.

105
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,070

Old Wu, how is everything going?

127
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:03,440
Xu Bojun has been watching me more closely these days.

128
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,940
He has me followed wherever I go.

129
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:10,760
I said I was picking up my nephew at the pier to remove their attention from me.

130

Old Wu, why do I feel like you're taking advantage of me?

It's the only way.

He's been trying to get something on me.

He wants to replace me with his confidant.

134

Whether I, Wu Xiangying, live or die

depends on your family, the Tans.

Well, don't worry. I have come to Shanghai alone.

00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:37,070
You have all my belongings. I consider you one of us.

138
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,832
You saved my life on the battlefield, so I know you are a righteous man.

By following me, you've shown your respect.

So, Junior Marshal, your forces... Have you arranged…?

00:14:51,468 --> 00:14:55,560
They are outside the city. Don't worry. They're reliable.

Ah, but… who was the girl you disembarked with?

144
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:01,420
Remember Xu Man?

145
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,690
She was a traitor.

146

While I was dealing with her body, that girl saw me.

147

Pei Xun will use it to move against us in the name of the government.

326
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,610
That would be very bad for us.

327
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,610
But with Pei Xun in Shanghai,

328
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:30,610
we can force him to take a stand with Xu Bojun to avoid trouble later on.

329
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,340
Old Wu, the Tan forces are just outside the city now.

330
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,353
And I've ordered them to move tonight.

331
00:31:42,353 --> 00:31:44,206
If you don't cooperate with me,

332
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:47,059
and your army here in the city hears the turmoil outside,

333
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:49,266
they'll likely be swayed to our cause.

334
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:52,234
By that time, there will be no chance of winning at all.

335
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,808
Why didn't you talk to me before you gave the order?

336
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,600
I'm saving you!

337
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,735
At this moment, you must burn your bridges

338
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:01,700
so that you can survive! Understand?

339
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,407
Saving me? That's ridiculous.

340
00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:08,798
Old Wu, this is your only chance to protect your position.

341
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:11,742
And the clock is ticking.

342
00:32:11,742 --> 00:32:14,760
You've got to risk it. Trust me for once.

343
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,728
Let's risk this together.

344
00:32:33,376 --> 00:32:36,258
Notify the camps. The mutiny will proceed.

345
00:32:42,265 --> 00:32:44,220
Get more sweet and sour spare ribs for Guangyao.

346
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,240
- Put the foie gras elsewhere.
- Madam!

347
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,770
- Go and tell the chef.
- Yes, Madam.

348
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,018
Madam, I can't find Miss Wanqing.

349
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:53,810
Should we not ask the police for help?

350
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,828
Mu Fang, I'm worried, too.

351
00:32:56,828 --> 00:32:59,120
But look at you. Is it necessary to make this fuss?

352
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,274
How will it look? It's better to send a few people to find her.

353
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:03,982
- Sir.
- Sir.

354
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:06,350
You're back!

355
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,959
My Lord, you don't look too good. Are you okay?

356
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,770
I'm exhausted.

357
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,926
The British are remaining neutral in the conflict.

358
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:19,310
They ask that I subsidize neither party in the war.

359
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,032
And yet the purpose of this marriage

360
00:33:22,032 --> 00:33:24,630
is because they want me to fund the military.

361
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,542
I'm in a dilemma.

362
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:30,682
Father, Provincial Military Governor Xu is to be my future father-in-law.

363
00:33:30,682 --> 00:33:32,260
You must help him.

364
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,360
I'm just a businessman.

365
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,960
Don't worry about your future father-in-law.

366
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,050
He has to listen to the British.

367
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,737
Sir, the municipal council is on the line.

368
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:44,225
Fine.

369
00:33:48,345 --> 00:33:52,408
Mother, I have told you before. It's been ten years.

370
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:55,170
Father didn't even mention Mu Wanqing.

371
00:33:56,198 --> 00:33:58,948
You need to keep a clear head.

372
00:33:58,948 --> 00:34:01,220
She's a member of the Mu family anyway.

373
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,470
We have to save face.

374
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:08,128
Besides, your father wants us to be a happy family.

375
00:34:08,128 --> 00:34:10,056
Do you understand?

376
00:34:10,056 --> 00:34:14,530
Don't worry. I know how to please Father.

377
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,710
Madam. Miss. Mr. Xu has arrived.

378
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,142
- Brother Guangyao is here?
- Hey, hey.

379
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:24,080
You're a lady. Compose yourself.

380
00:34:27,158 --> 00:34:29,021
Let's welcome him.

381
00:34:52,045 --> 00:34:53,992
Brother Guangyao…

382
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,120
Brother Guangyao is here.

383
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,919
Mrs. Mu.

384
00:35:01,845 --> 00:35:03,787
Who are you?

385
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,549
Guangyao.

386
00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:09,342
Miss Wanting.

387
00:35:10,798 --> 00:35:12,400
Lovely of you to receive us here.

388
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,202
I feel honored.

389
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:15,710
You're too kind.

390
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,221
You're a distinguished guest. Of course, we'll come out to greet you.

391
00:35:18,221 --> 00:35:19,950
But…

392
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:23,580
won't you introduce us?

393
00:35:24,974 --> 00:35:27,014
It's been a long time.

394
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,170
I'm Mu Wanqing.

395
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:34,756
You're…

396
00:35:37,956 --> 00:35:40,167
You're Wanqing?

397
00:35:43,743 --> 00:35:45,393
Is it really you?

398
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,411
Is it truly you, Wanqing?

399
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:49,548
You've finally come back!

400
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:52,530
After all this time! This is wonderful.

401
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,147
Our driver is so inept.

402
00:35:55,147 --> 00:35:58,441
I asked him to pick you up, but he couldn't find you!

403
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:01,970
Fortunately, Guangyao brought you home.

404
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,382
Thank the heavens! Thank you very much, Guangyao.

405
00:36:05,382 --> 00:36:08,128
It's all right. Thank you anyway, Ms. Cui.

406
00:36:08,128 --> 00:36:10,031
It's not Ms. Cui.

407
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:14,130
My mother is the Madam of the Mu house now. Call her Mrs. Mu!

408
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:18,040
It's all right. You can call me whatever you like.

409
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,727
We're family.

410
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:26,088
Oh, right!

411
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:30,253
How is it that you two came together, Guangyao?

412
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:33,532
It's a long story that would take much time.

413
00:36:33,532 --> 00:36:36,209
Would you please help Miss Wanqing rest after her long journey home?

414
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:38,720
- She must be tired.
- Of course! Of course!

415
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,308
Xu Cheng, give Miss Wanqing her suitcase.

416
00:36:41,308 --> 00:36:42,858
Yes.

417
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,308
Xiaocui, hurry and help Wanqing with her luggage.

418
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:05,938
It's fine. On second thought, I'll escort her upstairs.

419
00:37:05,938 --> 00:37:07,576
Will you tell me the way to her room?

420
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:09,808
I'll show you, Sir. This way, please.

421
00:37:09,808 --> 00:37:11,344
Thank you.

422
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,480
Brother Guangyao…

423
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,705
Mother!

424
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,716
Calm yourself. We'll figure it out.

425
00:37:23,716 --> 00:37:25,897
He's always been honorable ever since he was a child.

426
00:37:25,897 --> 00:37:28,011
And she's an old acquaintance.

427
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:32,928
He must have some sympathy for her, she being so alone and helpless.

428
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,862
If you please.

429
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,470
This way.

430
00:37:55,742 --> 00:37:57,142
<i>Come.</i>

431
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,814
Are you all right?

432
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,050
I'm fine.

433
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,659
You can give that to me now.

434
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:18,070
- No, allow me.
- I'll take it myself.

435
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,950
There are many eyes in here, people will get the wrong idea.

436
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,034
It's okay. I insist.

437
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,020
Why?

438
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,390
Because it's not yours.

439
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:31,950
Miss Wanqing, this is your room.

440
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:44,220
- You can go now.
- Yes, Miss.

441
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:54,661
It's been unlocked.

442
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,295
The suitcase belongs to that man.

443
00:39:03,953 --> 00:39:05,590
<i>Junior Marshal.</i>

444
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,083
The man who kidnapped you seems quite an unusual fellow.

445
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,262
There's a hidden panel.

446
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,680
Sister, these are the clothes and headwear my mother's prepared for you.

447
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,131
The party is about to begin. You need to get dressed.

448
00:39:29,131 --> 00:39:31,451
Brother Guangyao, Uncle Xu will be here soon.

449
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:33,342
Let's go welcome him.

450
00:39:33,344 --> 00:39:36,470
Wanqing needs to freshen up.

451
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:41,421
Okay. I'll go down with you first.

452
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,737
I need to change first.

453
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:06,830
Brother Guangyao, do I look pretty today?

454
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,726
The dress suits you well.

455
00:40:13,564 --> 00:40:17,212
Miss Wanting, I suddenly realized that I have something to do.

456
00:40:17,212 --> 00:40:19,492
I'll wait for you over there.

457
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:25,661
- Junior Marshal.
- Keep your eyes peeled tonight.

458
00:40:25,661 --> 00:40:28,772
Post some of your most observant men outside and wait for my order.

459
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:30,310
Is something wrong?

460
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:34,730
I feel like something is off. Something will happen tonight.

♫ <i> How would I put back together </i> ♫

485
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,780
♫ <i> The memories that revived me </i> ♫

486
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:32,320
♫ <i> Let’s embrace either during the sunrise of sunset </i> ♫

487
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,640
♫ <i> I have exhausted myself in this life </i> ♫

488
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,180
♫ <i> My whole life has become lonely </i> ♫

489
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:45,580
♫ <i> Even if my vision is blurred and I can’t clearly see </i> ♫

490
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:54,000
♫ <i> I’ll still sing with you on horseback </i> ♫
