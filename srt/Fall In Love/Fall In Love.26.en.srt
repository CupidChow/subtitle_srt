He didn't inform the family. I want to know why.

Because of that, Pei family's son was placed under house arrest by Pei Xun.

Okay.

If you want to play like this, then it's war!

39
00:03:49,057 --> 00:03:53,060
Governor, our army has been assembled, and they're awaiting your orders.

40
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,443
Good.

41

He should be there soon.

44
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,758
Go there personally, arrange the army supplies as soon as possible

45
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:07,180
and bring back Guangyao.

46

It's too dangerous out there and his job is complete.

Understood.

48

Governor, our men were ordered to incorporate Xu Bojun's army.

49

But his army refuses to cooperate!

50

Not only did they not surrender their guns, but they also beat up our officers and locked them up.

This Xu Bojun, he ignored the announcement ordering him to retire.

52

I think this time he's going to fight hard!

<i>Governor!</i>

56
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,820
I locked you up for so long.

57
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
Do you resent me?

58
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,040
As your son, I don't dare to complain.

59
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,300
Obstinate. Are you still stubborn?

60
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,708
Then show your old man some real skills.

61
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,502
What does Father want his son to do?

62
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,880
That old bird, Xu Bojun, refuses to accept the verdict.

63
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,075
He refuses to retire and hand over his power.

64
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:41,070
Instead, he assembled an army to provoke us in Hangu Pass.

65
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,677
But I, your father, had expected this from him.

66
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,919
I set up a sizeable force and laid traps there.

67
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,510
I'm waiting for this old bird to come.

68
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,502
Do we have to go to war?

69
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:57,240
Right time, right place, and the will of the people.

70
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,658
The advantages are all in my hands.

71
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:02,979
We have a good chance of winning, so why not fight the battle?

72
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:06,590
Listen. I intend to let you take an elite division

73
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,610
to the front line for maneuvering.

74
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:11,876
In front of you, some older fellow will charge and shatter the enemy position.

75
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:15,040
You will follow them closely and look for an opportunity

76
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,280
to rush forward and win the honor to show to your old man back home.

77
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,160
Father, your son is ignorant and shallow,

78
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,495
and can't be up to this important task.

79
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:27,850
He'll just add to the trouble,

80
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,560
so he prefers not to go.

81
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,304
You coward! You don't even want free honor?

82
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:37,736
You idiot!

83
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:40,000
Are you really a descendant of our family?

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,060
Father, I'm not a coward.

85
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,397
I just don't want to fight in this mess you call a war!

86
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:46,636
The war goes on and on.

87
00:06:46,636 --> 00:06:49,400
What's the point of it other than letting people suffer?

88
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,700
What's truly meaningless is not fighting and not getting promoted.

89
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,356
If you don't fight in the war, how can you take over my position in the future?

90
00:06:57,356 --> 00:07:00,698
If you don't fight in the war, how can you preside over the people?

91
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:02,706
An official who wrecks the country and ruins the people.

92
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:07,226
A position that is on a knife's edge. I would rather not have it.

93
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:12,772
Men.

94
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:14,423
Military Governor.

95
00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:18,540
Pei Shaojun...

96
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:21,908
disobeyed a direct military order

97
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,616
and disregarded an officer.

98
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:25,236
Take him away and whip him thirty times.

99
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,283
Thirty whips?

100
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:28,156
- The Junior Marshal can't take it.
- Carry out the order!

101
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,645
Yes.

102
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,140
I'm asking you again. This war…

103
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,518
Will you fight or not?

104
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:53,989
I won't.

105
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:56,455
- Hit him!
- Yes!

106
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,427
Stop!

107
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:24,265
Can't even endure just ten hits?

108
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,560
Then obey and listen to Father.

109
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,005
Go to the front line and save yourself from suffering here.

110
00:08:31,522 --> 00:08:32,887
I'm fine.

111
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,161
Military orders must be obeyed. How can it be changed?

112
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:39,508
Thirty whips are thirty whips

113
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:41,278
and not a whip less.

114
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:42,939
Good boy.

115
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,733
A man of real fiber. That's my son.

116
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,180
But why do you choose to suffer rather than

117
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,020
go to the front line and win honor for free?

118
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,700
Are you insane?

119
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,817
You can't go to the front line when you're insane.

120
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:04,560
You'll lose the war, Father.

121
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:08,639
Good point.

122
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,267
Okay.

123
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,987
Keep hitting him, hit him until his head clears.

124
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,456
Yes.

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,759
Military Governor, the Junior Marshal passed out.

126
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,580
- Hurry up and untie the Junior Marshal.
- Yes. Quickly.

127
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,500
- Junior Marshal!
- Junior Marshal, are you all right?

128
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,360
<i>[Still Waters Run Deep]</i>

129
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,140
My Lord, we didn't mean to deceive you.

130
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,600
It's Eldest Miss. She was afraid that you couldn't bear it.

131
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,580
So she asked us not to tell you.

132
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,580
It's not your fault.

133
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,200
I know Wanqing was worried about my health.

134
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,400
A child's filial piety is hard to come by.

135
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,333
Maybe we should call Eldest Miss and tell her to come back quickly.

136
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,800
No.

137
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:38,087
You can't tell Wanqing.

138
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:42,293
But, My Lord, you're so sick.

139
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:46,700
Wanqing… It's not easy for her.

140
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,240
In fact, she already knew the truth of the matter,

141
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,058
but she still acted with Xu Bojun

142
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,420
as if nothing had happened.

143
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,440
I almost married her to the Xu family.

144
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:09,647
Think about...

145
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,280
how much pain and suffering

146
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,920
the child must feel in her heart.

147
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,510
But she made it alone

148
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,713
and brought justice

149
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:29,460
for Yuanheng with Tan Xuanlin.

150
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,144
So, now she's out there alone,

151
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,620
hovering between life and death.

152
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,760
I can't help her,

153
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,400
so I won't cause her any more trouble.

154
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,496
The governor really overdid it.

155
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:00,700
Whipping you this hard.

156
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,920
We'll go out first, let's go.

157
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,020
Are you in pain?

158
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,944
It's nothing.

159
00:12:45,944 --> 00:12:48,097
I'm strong.

160
00:12:48,097 --> 00:12:50,330
I'll rest for two days and be fine.

161
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,638
They won the lawsuit.

162
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,719
You need to go back to Shanghai with Commander Tan, right?

163
00:12:55,719 --> 00:13:00,325
I'm not going, I'll stay here with you.

164
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:04,164
Come on, don't be stubborn.

165
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:06,260
With your nature,

166
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,752
you'll be aggrieved to death sooner or later.

167
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:11,396
If you can stay, then so can I.

168
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:13,354
Don't underestimate me.

169
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:16,208
Anyway, I won't go back.

170
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,160
Commander Tan won't let you stay either.

171
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,740
My brother can't control me.

172
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,260
As long as it's my decision, no one can stop me.

173
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,300
Why do you have to involve yourself in this mess?

174
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:33,772
As long as I can be with you,

175
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,060
I'm afraid of nothing.

176
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,300
Even if I have to be trapped in this cage,

177
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,640
I'm still willing to be with you.

178
00:13:48,802 --> 00:13:53,620
But the closer you are to me, the more I'm afraid I can't protect you.

179
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,400
I'm not afraid. What are you afraid of?

180
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,140
Why are you acting like an old lady? Talking nonsense.

181
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,460
Your brother can't control you.

182
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,260
And I can't either, right?

183
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,240
You mean you won't drive me out?

184
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,700
You won't ask me to leave?

185
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,920
You'll let me stay. You won't kick me out?

186
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,160
That hurts!

187
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,700
I-I'm so sorry.

188
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,242
Well, do you want to eat,

189
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:34,720
or do you want to drink something?

190
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,926
I want some soup.

191
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,520
What kind of soup?

192
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,810
Duck soup.

193
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,300
What kind of soup is duck soup?

194
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,909
Such a serious incident!

195
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:58,120
Why didn't anyone show me nor tell me?

196
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,700
Where were the newspapers?

197
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,220
If I hadn't come to Hangu Pass,

198
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,040
I wouldn't have known that my own family has been hanging by a thread!

199
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,640
Assistant Xu ordered me not to give you the newspaper.

200
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,220
I-I was just worried that you'd be sad again if you read the news

201
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,037
about Commander Tan and Miss Mu.

202
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:23,236
That's why I ordered them not to give you the newspaper anymore.

203
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:24,840
But it was a coincidence.

204
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,883
These days, we were at…

205
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:29,905
How many times have I told you,

206
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:32,278
petty tricks can lead to a huge mistake.

207
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:34,803
Why can't you learn to remember?

208
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,120
- Out!
- Yes.

209
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,542
Brother Xu Yuan.

210
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:52,278
Junior Marshal, the governor sent me to assist you in distributing army supplies.

211
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:55,400
After we're finished, please return to Yue City as soon as possible.

212
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,120
What does Father mean by this?

213
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,500
Time, place, and the will of the people. We have none of that in this war.

214
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,876
Why do we have to fight?

215
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:08,500
The military governor's order was that this tough battle must be won.

216
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:16,980
Father wants Pei Xun to suffer from a loss in order to make room for bargaining.

217
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,150
That's what he meant.

218
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,640
But people die in war!

219
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,900
All their lives are to become bargaining chips?

220
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,640
That's not something you should worry about.

221
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,800
The military governor's order is, after finishing the distribution of all the supplies,

222
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,960
I am to escort you back to Yue City.

223
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,305
It's not safe here.

224
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:36,565
Military Governor has been thinking about you.

225
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,660
Is my father asking me to run away from the battle?

226
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,364
Junior Marshal, you shouldn't be like this right now.

227
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,340
I'm telling you, if you go, we go together.

228
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,905
You stay, we stay together.

229
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,133
You're worried about the war between the Pei and Xu families.

230
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:15,454
If Xu Bojun wins, the situation will be detrimental to you.

231
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:17,400
I really didn't expect

232
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:21,695
Xu Bojun to go against the country,

233
00:17:21,695 --> 00:17:26,061
totally ignoring the verdict and starting a war.

234
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,403
I'm impressed.

235
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,069
Wanqing,

236
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,560
I have to go back to Shanghai in two days.

237
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,600
Yue City is too close to Shanghai. It makes me anxious.

238
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:44,890
But you...

239
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,770
You're going back to Shanghai with me.

240
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,500
Second Brother.

241
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,030
Shaojun got injured, so I have to stay and take care of him.

242
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,028
So maybe I shouldn't go back.

243
00:17:55,028 --> 00:17:58,320
You call him Uncle Pei all the time.

244
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,587
Did he treat you like you were part of his own family?

245
00:18:02,587 --> 00:18:05,079
One day, I might go to war with the Pei family,

246
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,820
and he will crush you like an ant. Do you know this?

247
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,261
Little Four, you're my only sister.

248
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:22,805
How can I leave you here?

249
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,583
Second Brother, he is the one for me in this life.

250
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:35,014
If you won't accept him as your brother-in-law,

251
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,601
I…

252
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,523
then you won't need me to be your sister!

253
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,920
How long have you known him?

254
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,047
And you think he's the one?

255
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,320
This is a joke.

256
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,740
- Second Brother, I'm not joking.
- Little Four.

257
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,720
If you have to take me away,

258
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,920
I will regret it for the rest of my life.

259
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,480
Regret for life? How old are you?

260
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,140
Watch your manners.

261
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,358
Little Four, what are you doing? Get up!

262
00:19:42,358 --> 00:19:44,947
Hurry, get up!

263
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,772
Second Brother...

264
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,060
A brother is like a father.

265
00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:56,912
You had lived up to it, Second Brother.

266
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,620
But now I've grown up!

267
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,633
I am no longer a kid who needs your protection.

268
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,960
I can protect myself.

269
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,209
I can take responsibility for my own choices.

270
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:17,554
So this time…

271
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:19,640
No matter what the future holds for me and Shaojun,

272
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,880
please let me make my own decision. Okay, Second Brother?

273
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:30,580
Sangyu, Mr. Pei will be implicated this time.

274
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,980
You'll definitely suffer if you stay with him.

275
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,470
Second Brother...

276
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:41,520
I'm more afraid to leave than to be in danger.

277
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,980
I'm afraid that if I leave, it'll be for the rest of my life.

278
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,815
You're only eighteen.

279
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,640
How can you say that?

280
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,187
Brother, you're just twenty-five.

281
00:21:06,187 --> 00:21:10,120
How can you outsmart Xu Bojun?

282
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,659
Brother, I'm not the kid who hid behind you

283
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:21,880
and didn't know anything anymore.

284
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,119
In the past ten years, you're not the only one who grew up.

285
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,390
I've grown up, too.

286
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,120
Can you stop underestimating me?

287
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Even if you don't believe me,

288
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,957
you have to believe in yourself. Right?

289
00:21:44,957 --> 00:21:47,501
I'm the sister of an old fox.

290
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:49,741
I'm a little fox.

291
00:22:02,302 --> 00:22:03,982
All grown up.

292
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,543
Hello?

293
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,720
Junior Marshal, our telephone line was cut off.

294
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,581
Rush to repair it!

295
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,787
Hello? Hello?

296
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:54,012
What can I do for you?

297
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,153
What do you think of my sister?

298
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,440
Is Commander Tan here to condemn me?

299
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,480
Do you like her?

300
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,842
I see.

301
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:27,015
I would never let her be with a man

302
00:23:27,015 --> 00:23:30,335
who even hesitates to say he likes her.

303
00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:32,414
I like her!

304
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,040
I hesitated...

305
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,380
but not because I don't like her.

306
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:53,440
It's because I know you don't want her to stay.

307
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,551
I'm afraid it'll be difficult for her.

308
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,934
But I know...

309
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:03,721
I'll do my best to take care of her.

310
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,040
You can't even take care of yourself.

311
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:12,574
In this family right now,

312
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,247
there are many things I can't control.

313
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,548
But I swear to you,

314
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:23,385
I will protect her.

315
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,700
She has no idea how bad things in the Pei family are.

316
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,100
No matter how mature she is, she is only an eighteen-year-old child.

317
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,600
If you're like this after being whipped thirty times, how can you protect her?

318
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,760
With my life!

319
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,620
I really don't want her to stay in Beijing,

320
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,280
but she insists on staying because of you.

321
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,160
So I wanted to see the man who makes her risk her life.

322
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,520
Is he worth it to her?

323
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,060
But my biggest worry

324
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:15,316
is that the relationship with your father will implicate my sister.

325
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:20,420
She is my only sister. I could never let her live like this.

326
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,760
If you want to give my sister a secure future,

327
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,300
you have to change the relationship between you and your father.

328
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,894
Change my relationship with my father.

329
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,422
I heard...

330
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,860
that you were the top student of Baoding Military Academy, right?

331
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,600
I'm sure you had studied many examples of battles.

332
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,383
Let me teach you something.

333
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:52,660
Think of your father as an opponent.

334
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,623
Study him throughly.

335
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,820
Boy,

336
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,840
don't let me down.

337
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,100
Don't anger your brother again, you know? He's here.

338
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,601
Brother. Brother.

339
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,926
Brother.

340
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:43,421
How was it?

341
00:26:48,383 --> 00:26:52,603
Brother, say something.

342
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:56,861
Wanqing, ready your bags.

343
00:26:56,861 --> 00:26:59,323
We'll go back to Shanghai in a few days.

344
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,026
Brother! You agreed to let me stay?

345
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:07,720
Thank you, Brother! You're so nice.

346
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,720
You're really the best, best, and best brother in the whole world.

347
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,481
Ingrate.

348
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,709
Brother.

349
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:24,917
You're jealous.

350
00:27:27,835 --> 00:27:29,415
Brother.

351
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,760
In fact, the thought of leaving you

352
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,960
makes me really, really sad.

353
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,537
It's like…

354
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:39,350
Brother!

355
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:43,936
I wish you would stay far, far away and save me the troubles.

356
00:27:43,936 --> 00:27:45,584
Brother!

357
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:48,526
Deceitful!

358
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,501
Sister-in-Law, my brother finally agreed to let me stay!

359
00:27:53,501 --> 00:27:55,956
You can relax now. You don't need to worry anymore.

360
00:27:55,956 --> 00:27:57,840
I can finally be with Pei Shaojun.

361
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,740
Happy?

362
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,020
Hello? Hello?

363
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,980
Where is the runner?

364
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,586
- Junior Marshal, it's dangerous outside!
- Junior Marshal.

365
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:40,040
- Junior Marshal! Hurry.
- Junior Marshal!

366
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,016
It's too dangerous.

367
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:43,830
- Junior Marshal.
- Junior Marshal.

368
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,464
Junior Marshal.

369
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,860
Here, come in!

370
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,720
Watch out, Junior Marshal.

371
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,320
Be careful. Look out!

372
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,500
- Junior Marshal.
- Watch it, Junior Marshal. Look out!

373
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,880
Is the telephone line connected?

374
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,026
What are you doing here?

375
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,050
Junior Marshal.

376
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,980
Junior Marshal, he died. He's dead.

377
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,926
Why are you crying over the death of an enemy?

378
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:43,980
He's my own brother!

379
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,340
He served under Military Governor Pei.

380
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,280
We haven't seen each other for three years.

381
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,834
I never thought we'd see each other like this.

382
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,160
Junior Marshal! Junior Marshal.

383
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,760
My father died young, and my mother was widowed all her life.

384
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,113
She only had us, her two children.

385
00:30:09,113 --> 00:30:11,520
Now my brother is dead. I'm the only one left.

386
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,760
If anything happens to me,

387
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,340
then nobody will take care of my mother, Junior Marshal.

388
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,500
Please show some mercy. Let me go home, Junior Marshal.

389
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,180
I'm begging you, Junior Marshal.

390
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,180
The enemy is right here. If we let you go, it will shake the army's morale.

391
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,361
Junior Marshal, never be merciful to soldiers.

392
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:34,860
You can't show pity.

393
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,060
Junior Marshal…

394
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,590
Without an index finger, your right hand can't pull the trigger.

395
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,431
It's useless to keep a soldier who can't shoot. Get out!

396
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:57,240
Thank you, Junior Marshal.

397
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,150
Brother Yuan.

398
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,040
If we let you go, the army will be in turmoil.

399
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,965
Junior Marshal, I'm helping you to share the burden.

400
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,660
What a burden!

401
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,230
Do you know, because of you, the world lost a son?

402
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,590
A mother will have no one to count on.

403
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,900
You're concerned about other people's mothers,

404
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,739
but forgot his own responsibilities as a son?

405
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:32,640
If we lose this battle, Military Governor will be completely replaced by Pei Xun.

406
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,669
It'll be the end of the Xu family.

407
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:38,180
A family business built on dead bodies and blood, I don't want it!

408
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,165
Junior Marshal!

409
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:42,326
This cannot be said again.

410
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:46,784
Junior Marshal!

411
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,419
I'll now order all the troops to retreat.

412
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:56,940
This war is meaningless.

413
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,020
I don't want soldiers of the Xu Army to make unnecessary sacrifices.

414
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,920
I want to get them out.

415
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,606
Junior Marshal.

416
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:09,590
<i>[Military Governor Xu's Orders]</i>
We have orders from the military governor.

417
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,260
Unless he gives the order personally,

418
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,720
no one has the right to let the men retreat.

419
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,594
Pei Xun wants us dead.

420
00:32:15,594 --> 00:32:18,309
<i>[Military Governor Xu's Orders]</i>
We can only live by fighting to the death.

421
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:30,699
Guangyao, that kid.

422
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:35,172
At this point, why is he being rash?

423
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:38,490
Now, Pei Xun has taken the rear,

424
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,060
and we can't retreat even if we want to.

425
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,648
Should we send troops to reinforce them?

426
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,803
If we move the troops further north, the Revolutionary Army will cross the Yangtze River.

427
00:32:49,387 --> 00:32:53,247
Send a task force to Hangu Pass and bring me Guangyao.

428
00:32:53,247 --> 00:32:56,060
But Junior Marshal himself refuses to come back.

429
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,020
Even Adjutant Xu wasn't able to persuade him to return.

430
00:33:03,405 --> 00:33:05,969
Then go get Su Hongchen.

431
00:33:05,969 --> 00:33:08,940
Tell him that Guangyao is in danger,

432
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,789
Ask him to go with them and persuade Guangyao to come back.

433
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,556
He… Junior Marshal Su, can he persuade the Junior Marshal?

434
00:33:15,556 --> 00:33:19,336
No, no, no. It's not so much that he can persuade,

435
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:21,900
but Guangyao won't put his friends in danger.

436
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,820
He'll definitely send Su Hongchen back to a safe place.

437
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,850
Then, you'll hold him and keep him from going back to the front line.

438
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,381
Understood!

439
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,320
<i>[Pei army has occupied most of Henan. Our army is in a difficult position.]</i>

440
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,060
<i>[Can't persuade Junior Marshall to leave. Hoping Military Governor has another method to keep him safe.]</i>

441
00:33:42,302 --> 00:33:43,937
Thank you, Principal Chen.

442
00:33:43,937 --> 00:33:47,536
Sorry to trouble you with this.

443
00:33:47,536 --> 00:33:50,220
- What's the issue?
- Don't worry.

444
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,135
Sister-in-Law, this time, it's all because of your presence.

445
00:33:53,135 --> 00:33:55,180
My brother is stubborn.

446
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,198
He played nice this time and agreed to let me stay, all because of you.

447
00:33:59,198 --> 00:34:01,140
Actually, it's because your brother loves you.

448
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,200
He knows you love Junior Marshal Pei. Of course, he won't give you a hard time.

449
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,940
He just won't say it.

450
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,623
Sister-in-Law,

451
00:34:09,623 --> 00:34:13,580
I think my brother is annoying, and I always quarrel with him.

452
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,239
But when I think about it, we'll see each other less and less in the future.

453
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,700
I'll really miss him.

454
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,140
If you miss your brother, just call him more often.

455
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,617
You take care of yourself.

456
00:34:27,617 --> 00:34:28,630
Brother!

457
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,140
This is an application for admission to the Pei's Girls' High School.

458
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,070
I went to the school and got it done for you.
<i>[Certificate of admission to Pei Girl's High School]</i>

459
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,690
<i>[Personal Profile of Pei Girl's High Schoo]</i>

460
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,267
- You just need to report on time.
- Brother…

461
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:39,780
- How did he do all this so quickly?
- Have a look.

462
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,406
Little Four,

463
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,614
there are a few things I need to make clear to you.

464
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:47,480
First, you must be extra careful in what you say and do.

465
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,960
When you encounter a problem you can't solve, immediately send me a telegram.

466
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,060
Don't act recklessly.

467
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,547
Second, watch yourself when you're with that boy.

468
00:34:55,547 --> 00:34:57,200
Don't enter his room alone.

469
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,126
Third, don't spend the night at the military governor's mansion.

470
00:35:00,126 --> 00:35:03,811
After I get back to Shanghai, I'll call your school right away to check your situation.

471
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:08,667
Brother, why are you like a father nagging all the time?

472
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:11,120
Besides, this is not a prison.

473
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,400
Do you need to watch me like a prisoner?

474
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,465
Do I have any freedom at all?

475
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:18,145
You have.

476
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,436
You can do whatever you want with my permission.

477
00:35:22,436 --> 00:35:25,234
Sister-in-Law.

478
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,484
Little Four,

479
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:34,184
since you've chosen him, the road ahead will never be smooth.

480
00:35:34,184 --> 00:35:37,240
Worth it or not, you know the best answer.

481
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,130
What I want to say is,

482
00:35:40,395 --> 00:35:44,305
if anyone bullies you in the future, come back to my side.

483
00:35:44,305 --> 00:35:46,051
With me here,

I won't let you suffer.

00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,467
Brother!

486
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,173
Brother.

487
00:36:03,213 --> 00:36:04,993
Thank you.

488
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,180
- Thank you, Miss Gu.
- You're welcome.

489
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,260
Miss Gu, Junior Marshal Su is here.

490
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,974
Asking me out for dinner again? Tell him I don't have an appetite.

491
00:36:47,808 --> 00:36:50,948
He says he comes to say goodbye to you.

What are you up to again?

494
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,117
I'm off to the front line.

495
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,500
To the front line…

496
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,580
Are you kidding?

497
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,755
I'm not.

498
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:34,700
Guangyao and his men are under siege at Hangu Pass.

499
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,770
Military Governor Xu can't persuade him to return.

500
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,512
He has asked me to go there and persuade him to come back.

501
00:37:38,512 --> 00:37:41,731
It was Xu Bojun's own wickedness that got his son into trouble.

502
00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:44,597
Why do you want to get into this mess?

503
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,460
Didn't you used to call me

504
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,420
a romantic on the outside and a playboy on the inside?

505
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,754
This time, I want to prove to you that I'm a soldier, too,

506
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:59,200
and not a drunkard.

507
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,826
I…

508
00:38:00,826 --> 00:38:04,787
I was talking in anger. What do you have to prove at this point?

509
00:38:04,787 --> 00:38:07,094
Going to the front is not a joke.

510
00:38:07,094 --> 00:38:09,454
I'm not joking.

511
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,613
Guangyao is my best friend.

512
00:38:11,613 --> 00:38:15,760
I can't just stand by and watch him remain in danger.

513
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,151
No matter what Xu Bojun did in the past

514
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:20,840
or what the fate of the Xu family is in the future,

515
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,080
Guangyao is innocent.

516
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,180
He shouldn't have to suffer all this.

517
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,648
But...

518
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,065
What about you?

519
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,840
On the battlefield, bullets don't have eyes.

Then can you keep it for me?
