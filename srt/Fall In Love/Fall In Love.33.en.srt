I'm sorry.

16
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:50,710
That day when you told me at the Command

17
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,510
that your father's death had something to do with my family,

23

24
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:21,560
Junichi Yamashita would try to get you involved.

32

35
00:02:50,882 --> 00:02:54,302

57
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:06,537
I understand.

58
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:16,208
What is it?

59
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,867
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:20,207 --> 00:04:22,497
I caused trouble to your father

61
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:25,043
and Shuang'er.

62
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:29,996
I almost couldn't protect you.

63
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:34,619
You had to risk your life to help me.

64
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:39,833
It's not your fault.

65
00:04:41,884 --> 00:04:43,890
After my father died,

66
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,335
in order to keep the Tan Army alive,

67
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:53,186
I had to live a life of deceit and intrigue.

68
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:57,938
That time, I thought, "Winner takes all."

69
00:04:57,938 --> 00:05:00,210
As long as I win, everything is fine.

70
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,402
But every experience

71
00:05:03,046 --> 00:05:04,716
resulted in close victories.

72
00:05:04,716 --> 00:05:06,654
And I realized...

73
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:09,913
that I really couldn't live like that.

74
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:12,069
I really got scared.

75
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:18,908
I was afraid to live such a dangerous life.

76
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:22,925
I was afraid of watching people around me get caught up in it.

77
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:30,341
I remember when I was in Beijing,

78
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,783
Mr. Liao said,

79
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:37,193
"The world engages everyone.

80
00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:40,035
No one can detach themselves from the world."

81
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,451
You're right.

82
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:43,729
Pei Xun and Xu Bojun

83
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:47,800
fought against the Qing Dynasty and overthrew those in charge.

84
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,502
But afterward, they became the tyrants.

85
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,350
I was afraid that I would be the next Pei Xun

86
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:03,260
or the next Xu Bojun, trying to protect my power.

87
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:11,216
I'm sure you that would never happen.

88
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:14,207
Whatever our outcome is,

89
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,988
it is our own choice.

90
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:21,097
Just like I chose you.

91
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:24,722
And this is a choice I made for the rest of my life,

92
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:27,116
I will never waver from it.

93
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:47,769
You couldn't even handle a woman.

94
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:49,656
What else can you do?

95
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:54,090
I really didn't expect... Gu Yueshuang would rather kill herself

96
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,771
than give Tan Xuanlin away.

97
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:58,999
It's too late to say anything.

98
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,641
Pei Xun has pronounced that Tan Xuanlin is innocent.

99
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:05,740
Such a good opportunity, but it didn't hurt him one bit.

100
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:08,135
Governor.

101
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,201
I'm okay.

102
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:12,525
It's an old sickness.

103
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:16,177
The past two days I've been having trouble breathing.

104
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:21,038
Governor, please give me one more chance.

105
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:22,827
I'll make it right.

106
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:24,720
It's okay.

107
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,145
You don't have to blame yourself.

108
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:31,715
The Xu family still has a bargaining chip.

109
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:36,225
It's now… or never!

110
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,230
The Risheng Chang will dock at Quanzhou.

111
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,176
And you have that place under control.

112
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:43,588
I'm sure it won't be a problem if you guys pick it up in time.

113
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,019
Miss Mu, thank you for your help this time.

114
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:49,221
On behalf of the soldiers on the front lines, I thank you.

115
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:52,160
It's nothing serious. Xuanlin's matter is also mine.

116
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,180
Yes, Uncle Liao. No need to be polite.

117
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,800
We are friends who can trust each other with our lives.

118
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,102
This time they found nothing.

119
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:05,824
But I'm sure Pei Xun must be upset.

120
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:09,658
What are you going to do in the future?

121
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:14,249
The King of Shanghai sounds noble and dignified.

122
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:16,724
But I can't even protect myself.

123
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:20,243
I used to have to defend against Xu Bojun, but now I have to also add Pei Xun.

124
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:23,319
When you cross over the Yangtze River,

125
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,913
Shanghai must be the first place you want to get to.

126
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:29,818
Oh, come on. You're beginning to be wary of me, too?

127
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:31,564
Of course not.

128
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:35,127
But the Communist Party is brave and will fight hard in the war.

129
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:38,016
Oh, and the Independence Regiment known as the Iron Army.

130
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:40,872
Since the Northern Expedition, they haven't been defeated.

131
00:08:40,872 --> 00:08:43,738
Putting aside our friendship, if we fight,

132
00:08:43,738 --> 00:08:46,607
I don't have confidence in beating your men.

133
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:50,283
Furthermore, I brought my men to Shanghai to give them a good life,

134
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:52,724
not to let them be cannon fodder.

135
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:56,886
If they are cannon fodder for Pei Xun, it would be even less worthwhile.

136
00:08:56,886 --> 00:09:00,597
I see you've got something on your mind.

137
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:17,935
Uncle Liao, I want to take a new path.

138
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:21,668
A new path?

139
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,051
This matter… you have to think about it carefully.

140
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:37,136
This new path means giving up what you have,

141
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:43,180
including your position, power, and wealth.

142
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:47,069
Uncle Liao,

143
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:52,136
what we have today, we could lose tomorrow.

144
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:54,647
You're right.

145
00:09:55,662 --> 00:10:00,021
In this chaotic world, no one will win.

146
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:02,142
Rather than fighting for fame and wealth,

147
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:06,503
it's better to fight for a good world for the people.

148
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:10,252
So, Uncle Liao,

149
00:10:10,252 --> 00:10:12,513
I would prefer to work with you

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,300
Hongchen.

163
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,100
Is he all right?

164
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,700
He didn't say a word.

165
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,700
It's not your fault.

166
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,600
Junior Marshal Su won't blame you for that.

167
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,100
As you requested,

168
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,400
I put the silver pendant in the urn and buried it with her.

169
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,700
Before she was cremated,

170
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,900
I kept some of her hair.

171
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,300
Now, I'll leave it to you.

172
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,100
You can keep it.

173
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,300
I think...

174
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,100
she would want you to be by her side.

175
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,200
Are you okay?

176
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,100
I won't hold your father's sins against you,

177
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,800
but...

178
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,700
I won't let him get away just because he is your father.

179
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,800
Since the beginning, loyalty and filial piety have been at odds.

180
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,300
It's either loyalty to your country

181
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,600
or filial piety to your father.

182
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,000
The choice is up to you.

183
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,600
Xu Guangyao,

184
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,700
I don't want to be your enemy.

185
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,900
But if one day we meet on the battlefield,

186
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,800
I won't show mercy.

187
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,100
I hope that day will never come.

188
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,700
Brother Guangyao,

189
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,200
don't take what he said too seriously.

190
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,800
You may leave.

191
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,000
I think I need time alone.

192
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,200
<i>[New Movie]</i>
<i>[Dreamer in the Spring Boudoir]</i>

193
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,100
Your words were very harsh.

194
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,900
Guangyao is sad enough,

195
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,500
and you still hit him when he was down.

196
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,800
I know he's upset.

197
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,100
But he has to make his choice.

198
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
So you don't blame him.

199
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,100
You did it on purpose.

200
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
This world doesn't deserve him.

201
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,000
If he wasn't Xu Bojun's son,

202
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,500
we could've been good friends.

203
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,100
You're forcing him to make a choice.

204
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
A man like him…

205
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,600
If he went down with the Xu family, it would be a pity.

206
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,000
Come with me to She Mountain.

207
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,700
Tan Si, drive to She Mountain.

208

<i>[Cathay Theater]</i>

209
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
Does it still hurt?

210
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,300
A few days ago,

211
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,200
my uncle, Tan Zijie, died in Jiang City.

212
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,900
He ignored military affairs all year.

213
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,000
And the military power...

214
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,600
was held by several of his division commanders.

215
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,000
The Revolutionary Army attacked Jiang City

216
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
on the other side of the Yangtze River.

217
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,300
If war breaks out,

218
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,100
the people of Jiang City will suffer.

219
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,200
It sounds like you've got a plan.

220
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,000
I've talked to my men.

221
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,600
They are all from Jiang City.

222
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,500
Although they haven't been home for over ten years,

223
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,400
Jiang City is the place where they were born.

224
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,200
So they don't want to see the city destroyed by war.

225
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,200
They also don't want to see their folks suffer.

226
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
I'm from the Tan family,

227
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,200
so I always have to take responsibility.

228
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,100
I'd like to ask Pei Xun

229
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,700
for the post of City Guard of Jiang City.

230
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,600
I'll bring the Tan Army back to Jiang City

231
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,400
and get out of the Beiyang government

232
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
to join the revolution.

233
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,700
This will keep Jiang City safe from war.

234
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,800
Does the Revolutionary Army

235
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,100
know what you're going to do?

236
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,800
They know about it.

237
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,000
I sent a telegram to Mr. Liao.

238
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,900
He convinced the headquarters

239
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,100
to order a ceasefire for the Revolutionary Army on the other side of the city

240
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,100
and to cooperate with me.

241
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,300
Now that everything is ready,

242
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,600
why are you still hesitating?

243
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,800
Wanqing,

244
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,500
my biggest concern is you.

245
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,000
I will ask Wu Xiangying

246
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,900
to keep you and the Mu family safe.

247
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Do you remember what I shouted

248
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,100
when you first came here with me?

249
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,000
I do.

250
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,900
Back then, you yelled, "Shanghai, I'm back."

251
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,300
That's right.

252
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,200
At that time, I was arrogant and ignorant.

253
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,000
I thought you were protecting Shanghai,

254
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,600
and I was watching over the Mu family,

255
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,800
so I thought we could get by every day.

256
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,600
But now, Shanghai can't be held.

257
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,000
And how long will I keep the Mu family?

258
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
Why are you sorry?

260
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,500
Could it be because you, the City Guard of Jiang City,

261
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,800
can't bring your family?

262
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,300
Shanghai, I'm leaving!

263
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:52,800
Shanghai, we're going to leave!

264
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,200
You...

265
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,400
You're going back to Jiang City with me?

266
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,300
Yes.

267
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,500
After Mr. Liao left that day,

268
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,100
I had a lot on my mind to consider.

269
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,900
Although the Mu family is very rich,

270
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,300
we are, in fact, very weak

271
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,700
and still under the control of the military governors.

272
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,400
Now that the Revolutionary Army keeps pressing on,

273
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,900
and military governors everywhere are getting worse,

274
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,300
many places are collecting taxes after fifty years.

275
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,300
People can't have a good life at all.

276
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,700
So how long do you think I can keep the Mu family?

277
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,500
But the Mu family

278
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,100
has been doing business in Shanghai for many years.

279
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,400
Businessmen are not like the men who fight in wars.

280
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Although Shanghai has changed its owner

281
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,100
and business may be difficult,

282
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,000
at least they can survive.

283
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
So you don't have to make your decision like I did.

284
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,000
True.

285
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,600
The Mu family are businessmen.

286
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,800
Whether it's Xu Bojun, Pei Xun, or the Revolutionary Army who come,

287
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,200
I can live.

288
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,000
As long as Shanghai is still there,

289
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,400
the Mu family's business will certainly be able to keep going on.

290
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,300
But that was before I knew you.

291
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,400
If I hadn't met you,

292
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,800
I'm sure I'd have continued business like this all my life.

293
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,200
But now that I have met you,

294
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,300
my ambition has also grown.

295
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,300
The world is a big chessboard.

296
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
Inside it,

297
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,700
only players can make a decision,

298
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,500
and the chess pieces can only listen.

299
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,400
So... you want to be a player.

300
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,600
If you are not a player,

301
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,900
no matter how exciting the game is, it's someone else's.

302
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,800
I won't be satisfied.

303
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,900
I didn't realize it.

304
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,300
Sure enough, you are my lady.

305
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,400
I'll take my chances anyway.

306
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,300
And I still have you to protect me.

307
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,000
Wanqing, I assure you

308
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,470
that we won't lose this game.

309
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,400
I believe you.

310
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,200
After we make it,

311
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,100
let's get married in Jiang City.

312
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,800
I'll let my father, my mother,

313
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,600
my older brother,

314
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,600
and the ancestors of the Tan family come and see,

315
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,600
that I have a great wife.

316
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,300
Okay. Then you have to tell them,

317
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,000
not to worry about leaving this man to me.

318
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,600
I will love him forever.

319
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,700
I'll give him a home so that he's not alone anymore.

320
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,790
Okay.

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,600
It's bad for your health.

328
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,700
It will be the last time I'll get drunk in my life.

329
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,500
I will…

330
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,100
never drink anymore.

331
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,100
Starting tomorrow,

332
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,900
I'm not going to live my life like this, ignorantly chasing after a dream.

333
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,800
Or…

334
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,800
I'll never be able to face her in the next life.

335
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,400
Hongchen!

336
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,300
I also want to change myself.

337
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,500
I really tried hard.

338
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,000
But I still couldn't protect her.

339
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,300
From today onward,

340
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,400
I'm going to live again.

341
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,400
Live as she liked

342
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,100
before I meet her in my next life.

343
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,200
What is your next plan?

344
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,600
I'm going to Guangzhou

345
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,000
to join the revolution.

346
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,000
Military Governor Su won't allow it.

347
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,200
Go their way,

348
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,700
and we can only live like them.

349
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,500
Do you want to live like them?

350
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,800
Guangyao,

351
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,800
come with me.

352
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,100
Put aside your status as Junior Marshal

353
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,000
and live for yourself once.

354
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,300
I also want to live for myself once.

355
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,100
But...

356
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,300
am I qualified?

357
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
In life,

358
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,700
the toughest thing

359
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,900
is when you do something involuntarily.

360
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,500
<i>- Don't worry. You can go back.
- Take it easy.</i>

361
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,100
After you arrive in Guangzhou,

362
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,600
you should go to the headquarters to find Mr. Liao

363
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,900
and give him the letter.

364
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,300
He'll make arrangements for you.

365
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,500
Thank you, Commander Tan.

366
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,200
I didn't think you'd be willing to help me.

367
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,700
Shuang'er will be glad to see that you have cheered up.

368
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,400
Oh, also…

369
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,900
Give my regards to Mr. Liao.

370
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,500
I will. But...

371
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,800
please keep my trip to Guangzhou a secret.

372
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,300
Rest assured. I won't tell anyone.

373
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,700
We will meet again.

374
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,200
Take care.

375
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,300
Guangyao.

376
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,100
Take care.

377
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,000
Take good care of yourself over there.

378
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,000
Guangyao,

379
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,400
are you sure you're not coming with me?

380
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,600
All right. Let's go.

381
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,400
Don't stay here. Move along.

382
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,000
- Please have some mercy!
- Go away. Go.

383
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,600
- Hurry.
- Go. You've made a mess here.

384
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,800
- Get out of here.
- Please have some mercy!

385
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Tan Si, go and check it out.

386
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,700
Don't sit here. Move.

387
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,700
What are you doing?

388
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,800
- Hello, sir.
- Sir.

389
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,300
- Do you have commands for us?
- Who said they can't beg at the train station?

390
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,200
Our headquarters hasn't made such a rule.

391
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,800
So did you make it yourself?

392
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,300
This is the train station.

393
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,600
They're begging here. Isn't it shameful?

394
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,100
You think it's shameful, so you're kicking them out of here?

395
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,000
- If you did, would they get food?
- We are almost starving to death.

396
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,200
If anyone here today

397
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,600
dies of starvation because of being driven out,

398
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,000
would you be responsible for that?

399
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
<i>Please have mercy! Help us!</i>

400
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,600
I was being thoughtless.

401
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,500
I was thoughtless.

402
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,600
Thank you, sir.

403
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,400
- Go get some food and distribute it.
- Yes, sir.

404
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,600
Take this as well.

405
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,800
- <i>Thank you.
- Thank you. Sir.</i>

406
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
All right! Come over here with me!

407
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,400
<i>Thank you, sir. Thank you.</i>

408
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,500
After years of war,

409
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,700
they are the ones without a choice.

410
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
- Step aside! Please.
- Come here.

411
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,500
- It's coming.
- Don't worry!

412
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,400
- There's plenty for everyone!
- Don't grab!

413
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,900
Take it easy! Don't grab!

414
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,000
Junior Marshal Xu bought these. Everyone will get some!

415
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,800
There's plenty for everyone.

416
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,300
Take it easy.

417
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,000
Is he Xu Bojun's son?

418
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,700
Yes. But why do you call our marshal by name?

419
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,200
Xu Bojun. He is the killer!

420
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,800
<i>- Yes!
- He is the killer!</i>

421
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,300
<i>- Xu Bojun started the war.
- Stop pretending to be a good man.</i>

422
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,000
<i>Stop acting like a good man!</i>

423
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
<i>We don't want your food!</i>

424
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,400
Calm down, everyone!

425
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,000
Calm down!

426
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Stop. Calm down.

427
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,500
- Calm down. Everyone!
<i>- Oh, come on.</i>

428
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,200
- Stop! Stop!
- Relax! Relax!

429
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,800
<i>You can only be her brother in your life.</i>

430
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,600
<i>Because the Xu family owes her a brother.</i>

431
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,400
<i>Why did he do this to her?</i>

432
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
<i>What did she do to you?</i>

433
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,800
<i>I've been looking for her all night.</i>

434
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,700
<i>I was about to find her!</i>

435
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,100
<i>I was just one step away!</i>

436
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:13,300
<i> For me, brothers are a big deal.</i>

437
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,500
<i>Do you know that your father is using the Japanese Chamber of Commerce to kill me?</i>

438
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,720
<i>And I bet you didn't know </i>

439
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,800
<i>how he defeated Luo Bingwen ten years ago.</i>

440
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,600
<i>It was all because of this Junichi Yamashita.</i>

441
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,500
<i>[Mr. Yamashita]</i>
<i>Mr. Yamashita. A Japanese?</i>

442
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,200
Stop! Stop!

443
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,500
<i>Brother Guangyao!</i>

444
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,600
<i>Xu Guangyao, you're not qualified to judge me.</i>

445
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,000
<i>Mu Wanqing's greatest misfortune is being related to your family.</i>

446
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,800
<i>Don't you know that?</i>

447
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
<i>Mu Zhiyuan got killed at the train station.</i>

448
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,600
<i>Don't you know who did it?</i>

449
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,700
<i>Haven't you ever had doubts?</i>

450
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,600
Bring my son back to life!

451
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,400
Guys, stop!

452
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,900
- Jerk.
- It's a sin.

453
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
Stop. Relax!

454
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,000
Calm down! Listen to me. Everyone!

455
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,800
- Calm down.
<i>- I knew he was not a good man.</i>

456
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,600
I am Tan Xuanlin.

457
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,800
I must say something for him.

458
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,100
Supervisor Xu has been working in Shanghai.

459
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,800
He had nothing to do with what the Military Governor's Mansion of Yue City did.

460
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,400
Just calm down, okay?

461
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,900
<i>- How come it has nothing to do with him?
- Exactly!</i>

462
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,400
- Who says it has nothing to do with him?
- Calm down!

463
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,000
Calm down! Everyone!

464
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,900
Calm down! Everyone!

465
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,200
How come it has nothing to do with him?

466
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
I have two sons.

467
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,600
The younger son was a soldier under Military Governor Pei.

468
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,300
The older son was under Xu Bojun.

469
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,200
My younger one was killed on the battlefield.

470
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,600
The older one missed me and wanted to come back to see me.

471
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Unexpectedly, you caught him

472
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,600
and shot him dead.

473
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,600
<i>A soldier who can't pull the trigger, can't shoot.</i>

474
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,000
<i>It's useless to keep him.</i>

475
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,200
<i>Thank you, Junior Marshal.</i>

476
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:32,107
- Calm down, everybody!
- Calm down! Stop!

477
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:37,137
<i>I want my son.</i>

478
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,760
<i>Give me back my son!</i>

479
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,930
I want my son.

480
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,280
Give me back my son.

481
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,160
<i>- Killer!
- Murderer!</i>

482
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,018
You're a kid, too.

483
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,907
Let's go. Leave.

484
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:34,776
Come on. Leave. Leave.

485
00:35:34,776 --> 00:35:36,801
- Let's go.
- Leave.

486
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,113
You finally figured it out.

487
00:36:45,113 --> 00:36:47,054
Brother Guangyao!

488
00:36:50,215 --> 00:36:53,600
We will meet again.

489
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:01,243
- Take care.
- Take care.

490
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:38,707
Although you don't talk too much,

491
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:42,188
you have a lot on your mind.

492
00:37:55,997 --> 00:37:59,649
Has Military Governor Pei agreed to my brother's request?

493
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,040
Now that Jiang City is on the frontline,

494
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,040
and my father is worried about a replacement,

495
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,773
Commander Tan volunteered for the post.

496
00:38:06,773 --> 00:38:09,420
My father went along with his wishes.

497
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,960
He not only agreed to his appointment as City Guard of Jiang City,

498
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,760
but also accepted his recommendation.

499
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,800
Wu Xiangying will take over as Commander of Shanghai.

500
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,816
I don't get it.

501
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:25,800
My brother went through all this trouble for a little profit?

502
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,890
And the post will go back to Wu Xiangying.

503
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,183
Wu Xiangying betrayed Xu Bojun.

504
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:34,997
At least he will not collude with Xu Bojun.

505
00:38:34,997 --> 00:38:38,335
It's better than Xu Bojun's choice of taking up the post.

506
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:40,387
It's just…

507
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:44,260
Why would Commander Tan give up his nice position as Commander of Shanghai...

508
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,415
and go to Jiang City, which is a mess,

509
00:38:47,415 --> 00:38:49,699
to take up office?

510
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:52,724
Actually, I don't quite understand.

511
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:55,290
My brother doesn't play by the rules.

512
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:59,313
Maybe it's because Jiang City is our hometown,

513
00:38:59,313 --> 00:39:02,575
and my brother has been away for years.

514
00:39:02,575 --> 00:39:05,082
He's probably homesick.

515
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:12,988
You found out after all.

516
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:14,372
You...

517
00:39:14,372 --> 00:39:16,652
Who is the girl in this picture?

518
00:39:16,652 --> 00:39:18,485
Who else have you seen the fireworks with?

519
00:39:18,485 --> 00:39:20,742
It... It's you.

520
00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:23,410
You're the only one I've seen the fireworks with.

521
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,101
- Really?
- Yes.

522
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:28,904
Well, why were you hiding it?

523
00:39:28,904 --> 00:39:31,200
I wasn't.

524
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,934
I don't know which little naughty girl went into my room and stole it.

525
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:51,459
This whole time, I've never given you anything.

526
00:39:52,383 --> 00:39:55,027
You've painted so many portraits for me,

527
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:57,291
so I wanted to paint one for you.

528
00:39:57,291 --> 00:40:01,425
As for this portrait, let's pretend we painted it together.

529
00:40:01,425 --> 00:40:03,524
I was going to surprise you

530
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:06,877
and consider it good luck for a perfect pair.

531
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,532
Perfect pair? I like it.

532
00:40:11,532 --> 00:40:13,340
But I'm not that fat.

533
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,940
Look. The legs are so fat. It's not like me.

534
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,738
I know I'm not good at drawing.

535
00:40:21,738 --> 00:40:23,957
Let's say it's a first attempt.

536
00:40:23,957 --> 00:40:25,755
If you ever draw again,

537
00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:28,004
you must draw the two of us.

538
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,401
Okay.

539
00:40:31,397 --> 00:40:33,533
In the future,

540
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:35,860
I will definitely draw both of us.

541
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,140
<i>[File]</i>

542
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,315
It seems you've decided to leave.

543
00:40:53,926 --> 00:40:55,187
Old Wu,

544
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:57,517
has the letter of appointment from Beijing arrived yet?

545
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,000
<i>[Letter of Appointment]</i>
The Defense Commander of Shanghai starts work immediately.

546
00:41:03,412 --> 00:41:07,211
Pei Xun handled things so quickly this time.

547
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,661
Commander, I'm really confused.

548
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:13,768
Why are you doing this?

549
00:41:13,768 --> 00:41:15,384
Why not?

550
00:41:15,384 --> 00:41:16,969
This position was originally yours.

551
00:41:16,969 --> 00:41:18,467
I just gave it back to its owner.

552
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:20,438
If it hadn't been for your military coup,

553
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:24,677
I, Wu Xiangying, might have been struck down by Xu Bojun long ago.

554
00:41:24,677 --> 00:41:26,663
Xu Bojun suspected me for so long.

555
00:41:26,663 --> 00:41:30,476
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be able to live till now.

556
00:41:30,476 --> 00:41:33,952
Don't say that. You don't have anything to fear now.

557
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:37,615
Xu Bojun stepped down, so he can no longer control Shanghai.

558
00:41:37,615 --> 00:41:40,101
You can be at ease as Commander.

559
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:41,810
I just don't understand.

560
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:45,647
You've been working hard to get Shanghai out of Xu Bojun's control.

561
00:41:45,647 --> 00:41:49,924
Why are you going to Jiang City now to clean up the mess?

562
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,336
Jiang City is my hometown.

563
00:41:52,336 --> 00:41:55,413
My hometown is now in trouble, so I must go back to help.

564
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:59,176
Furthermore, I'm retiring after winning merit and you're reinstated.

565
00:41:59,176 --> 00:42:00,481
Everyone's happy.

566
00:42:00,481 --> 00:42:02,311
Come on. Why do you look so sad?

567
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,121
I'm happy to be your deputy commander.

568
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:06,527
I'm not thinking of getting my position back.

569
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,861
Old Wu, I'm happy to have you as a friend

570
00:42:16,861 --> 00:42:19,380
that I can pass the title to.

571
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,580
Take care of yourself when you arrive in Jiang City.

572
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,330
Okay. Don't worry.

573
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,801
Also, Old Wu. Although it is now free from Xu Bojun's control,

574
00:42:34,801 --> 00:42:37,125
the situation is changing rapidly.

575
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,727
Once the Revolutionary Army crosses the Yangtze River

576
00:42:38,727 --> 00:42:43,029
and they come to Shanghai, you should make plans early. Okay?

577
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:44,701
I understand.

578
00:42:45,278 --> 00:42:47,239
Commander,

579
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,511
do let me know if you have any ideas.

580
00:42:52,578 --> 00:42:54,539
We are friends.

581
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,541
Okay.
