Mr. Liao,

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,535
the medicines have been prepared.

17
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:10,441
There are ten cases each of aspirin and quinine.

18
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:12,716
They can be shipped out tomorrow.

19
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,720
- Are the goods safe?
- Yes. Don't worry.

20
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,439
The Commander went to check the goods himself.

21
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,318
There will be no problem.

00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,920
You check it first.

25
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,536
All the goods will arrive tomorrow.

26
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:11,660
Give me the cash and I'll hand you the goods.

27

Don't worry.

28
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:16,995
As long as the goods are fine, Commander Tan will pay at full price.

29
00:03:25,118 --> 00:03:28,385
Junior Marshal, here's a top-secret telegram from the governor.

30
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,580
<i>[Tan Xuanlin's collaboration with the Revolutionary Party.]</i>

31
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,908
<i>[He helped the Revolutionary Army buy controlled substances.]</i>

32
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:38,451
<i>[They will hand over at the Shanghai Shiliupu Pier tomorrow.]</i>

33
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,800
<i>[Take the gendarmes and catch them.]</i>

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,932
Junior Marshal, what happened?

35
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:49,745
My father said Tan Xuanlin collaborated with our enemies.

36
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:52,024
Not only did he have dealings with the Revolutionary Army,

37
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,799
he also helped them buy controlled substances.

38
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,704
So...

39
00:04:01,726 --> 00:04:04,087
So, on the night of the Command celebration,

40
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:06,655
those two revolutionary assassins might really

41
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,599
have something to do with Commander Tan.

42
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,520
The Governor has been asking us to get something on Commander Tan.

43
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:15,279
This is the perfect moment.

44
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:18,580
My father said that his scouts have found out that

45
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,526
there will be a hand off at the pier tomorrow,

46
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:24,419
and he wants me to take the gendarmes to catch them.

47
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,014
The Governor wants to leave you the credit.

48
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:29,526
Once Tan Xuanlin gets caught,

49
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:31,295
he won't be the Commander of Shanghai anymore.

50
00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:33,990
The seat will be yours by then.

51
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,520
It seems that my father doesn't trust me.

52
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,820
He has had his scouts monitoring Tan Xuanlin.

53
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,165
Junior Marshal, Tan Xuanlin has always been cunning.

54
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:47,622
The governor did this as a precaution.

<i>- Yes.</i>

64
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,375
My old house has been repaired.

65
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,116
Just now, I was busy checking the guests' list with Xu Cheng,

66
00:05:54,116 --> 00:05:55,931
so I forgot the time.

67
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,800
Commander Tan, it's so late, you still haven't gotten any rest yet?

68
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,343
You're so busy with official business.

69
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:04,600
This isn't about my job.

70
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,640
I don't have a home, so I both live and eat in the Command center.

71
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,519
I'm not that rich like you.

72
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,960
I heard that your old house covers over ten acres

73
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,639
and even diverted water from the Huangpu River to build a lotus pond.

74
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,300
Do invite me when the house is done being renovated.

75
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:22,798
Of course.

76
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,886
By the way.

77
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,209
Commander Tan, are you free tomorrow?

78
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:32,556
Tomorrow... I'm going out tomorrow.

79
00:06:32,556 --> 00:06:34,525
What's the matter?

80
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,765
Nothing.

81
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,786

No. I can't do this.

I can't give you advice on the governor's mansion.

Well, I hope you won't miss the inauguration ceremony of the house.

00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:17,653
Nothing.

90
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,927
Commander, Supervisor Xu came to you so late.

91
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:40,299
What is he up to?

92
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,739
He has relented.

93
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,835
If he wasn't Xu Bojun's son,

94
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:52,872
we could've been good brothers.

Let's go back to the Chamber of Commerce.

110
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,982
Junior Marshal, it's not drugs,

111
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,624
but guns.

112
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,700
<i>[Tianjin Machinery Bureau]</i>

113
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,299
Tianjin Machinery Bureau is a subordinate to Governor Pei

114
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:25,440
and exclusively for the Pei Army.

115
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,539
Why do you have their guns?

116
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,780
Since you know it's the property of the Pei family,

117
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,380
aren't you overreaching?

118
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You're from the Pei family.

119
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,939
Did Governor Pei ask you to smuggle arms?

120
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:55,820
Who are you going to sell them to?

121
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,420
If it's sold to the Revolutionary Army,

122
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:01,677
that means you're collaborating with the enemies.

123
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,543
Junior Marshal, I went through all their wallets. There was no identification cards.

124
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,396
There are only a few notes of Cantonese and Shanghai currencies.

125
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,860
<i>You created a fake identity and a fake resume.</i>

126
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,479
<i>Also, you exchanged your Cantonese checks for silver dollars and Shanghai checks</i>

127
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:24,419
<i>so that you could easily use them in Shanghai.</i>

128
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:27,136
<i>But the reason why you left a few Cantonese banknotes</i>

129
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:31,319
<i>is so you could take the train back to Guangzhou after the assassination.</i>

130
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,208
<i>You would need Cantonese banknotes and change for the rickshaw.</i>

131
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:39,095
<i>You wouldn't be able to exchange silver dollars and use Shanghai banknotes there.</i>

132
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:48,910
You travel between Shanghai and Tianjin. Why do you have Cantonese money?

133
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,819
I have reason to suspect that you have been to Guangzhou.

134
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:58,000
If you do not explain the reason,

135
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,340
then I will have to put you guys in jail and slowly check myself.

136
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,330
If I find something, something that might get your Governor Pei involved,

137
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,532
what will you do then?

138
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:12,266
Junior Marshal Xu, can I talk to you alone?

139
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,899
You mean Commander Tan ordered these goods?

140
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:27,366
Yes.

141
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:31,940
Commander Tan said that the governor's mansion was always unable to pay military wages in full.

142
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,204
That meant that the men in the militia did not all have guns.

143
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:40,655
So he ordered a batch of guns from us privately.

144
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:45,203
So, you are from the Tianjin Machinery Bureau?

145
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:47,064
Yes.

146
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:48,315
Junior Marshal Xu,

147
00:12:48,315 --> 00:12:50,819
you and our Junior Marshal Pei are close friends.

148
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,240
You should know about Governor Xu's private withholding of military wages.

149
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,796
In order to make up for the shortfall, Governor Pei asked our machinery bureau to sell weapons.

150
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:02,127
Nowadays, governments are spending a lot everywhere.

151
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:05,524
We deal in secret in order to avoid high taxes.

152
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:10,095
But we did business only with the armies under the jurisdiction of the respective governor's mansions

153
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:12,700
and never with the Revolutionary Army.

154
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,379
Then, why do you have Cantonese money?

155
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:21,519
It's just a cover.

156
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,845
The business of selling weapons is not above board, after all.

157
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,450
We all carry Cantonese money.

158
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,700
That way, even if we get caught,

159
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,470
no one would think that it was related to the machinery bureau.

160
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,304
Why are you telling me all of this?

161
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:37,159
Governor Xu and Governor Pei now share the power together.

162
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,420
Moreover, Junior Marshal Pei and you are also good friends.

163
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:45,159
I'm telling you this to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.

164
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,427
So carrying Cantonese money was your idea?

165
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,840
I'm not that smart. It was ordered by the governor's mansion.

166
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,126
Governor.

167
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:23,455
How's your investigation going?

168
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:27,196
Junior Marshal said Tan Xuanlin bought guns from the Tianjin Machinery Bureau privately.

169
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,440
Because it involved the Pei Family Arms, he put things down.

170
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,159
Tan Xuanlin is buying guns now.

171
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,708
There must be something strange going on.

172
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,860
He's trying to confuse things.

173
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,959
I'll keep my men on this.

174
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,819
I believe he will show his real intentions.

175
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:48,744
And you have to hurry up to prepare for the inauguration of the old house.

176
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:51,819
The marriage between Guangyao and the Mu family must be settled at once.

177
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:53,380
Yes.

178
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,820
Commander,

179
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,380
this is from Supervisor Xu.
<i>[To Commander Tan]</i>

180
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,756
Did he say anything else?

181
00:15:14,756 --> 00:15:18,210
He didn't say anything. He just invited you to attend the inauguration of Xu family's old house.

182
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,460
<i>[From Xu Guangyao, Please open]</i>

183
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,320
By the way, did Mr. Liao leave safely?

184
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,482
Don't worry. Miss Mu arranged it herself.

185
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,400
Commander.

186
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,059
You went to buy smuggled arms on purpose to cover that batch of medicine.

187
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:34,725
Aren't you afraid of being implicated?

188
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,379
I did it on purpose.

189
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:48,216
<i>A while ago, a person introduced me to a group of arms smugglers.</i>

190
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:51,725
<i>When I went to talk business with them, I happened to notice that</i>

191
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:55,000
<i>these guys were also carrying Cantonese money.</i>

192
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,999
<i>Then I got to know one of them. He told me.</i>

193
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,760
<i>These days,</i>

194
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,959
<i>each governor's mansion is afraid of talking to the Revolutionary Party.</i>

195
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:08,300
<i>If they get caught for smuggling, they would blame it directly on the Revolutionary Party.</i>

196
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,488
<i>I asked him how he came up with the idea.</i>

197
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:16,607
<i>He told me that two months ago, someone tried it.</i>

198
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:19,880
<i>So their boss told everyone to emulate him.</i>

199
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,480
<i>And I figured the time.</i>

200
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,920
<i>Two months ago.</i>

201
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,760
<i>It's when Xu Guangyao got shot at the celebration.</i>

202
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,080
<i>Where are they from?</i>

203
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,400
<i>I asked around.</i>

204
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,639
<i>These people are related to the Tianjin Machinery Bureau.</i>

205
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,999
<i>And from the way they act, it seems they're from the military.</i>

206
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:46,011
<i>So I guessed that</i>

207
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,400
<i>they must be related to Pei Xun.</i>

208
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:52,600
<i>Pei Xun?</i>

209
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,839
<i>If he sent men to kill Xu Guangyao,</i>

210
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,579
<i>that would make things interesting.</i>

211
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:08,540
This Xu Guangyao is a real gentleman.

212
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,207
It's just a pity that he was born at the wrong time.

213
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:15,472
The world doesn't deserve him.

214
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,066
Governor.

215
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:28,484
Good.

216
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:32,139
How come you're standing here? Aren't you afraid of catching a cold?

217
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:33,360
Father, you must be tired from the journey.

218
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,600
Of course, I should come out to meet you.

219
00:17:35,602 --> 00:17:37,701
I know you're filial.

220
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:40,700
You don't need to look into the case of whether Tan Xuanlin collaborated with the enemy.

221
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,050
I'll send someone else to do it.

222
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,979
It's my fault I didn't do my job well. Please punish me.

223
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:46,487
Don't bother with the punishment.

224
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:51,279
But I got something more important to ask for your permission.

225
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,551
What is it that you need to ask for my permission for?

226
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,509
Let me take a look around first.

227
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,179
These Taihu stones were all transported from Yixing.
<i>(A porous limestone from Lake Tai used as garden features)</i>

228
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,939
The pond has also been dredged. It draws in freshwater from the Huangpu River.
<i>(A tributary of the Yangtze river that flows through Shanghai)</i>

229
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:10,019
And I also raised your favorite lotuses and brocade carp.

230
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:13,815
The fish playing among the lotuses is also a nice scene.

231
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:17,979
It looks like you make a lot of effort. It looks great.

232
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:19,920
I'm glad you like it.

233
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,860
Well, Father.

234
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,780
Is there anything you need to discuss with me?

235
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,839
Come on, let's sit down and talk.

236
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,498
Okay.

237
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,624
Son, you're old enough.

238
00:18:39,624 --> 00:18:43,179
We don't have many children. You are the only son.

239
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:46,280
It's time to think about your marriage.

240
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,440
How come you are suddenly thinking of my marriage?

241
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,759
The battle in the south is still uncertain yet. I'm not in the mood to think about it.

242
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:58,039
- If you're not in the mood, then I'll do it for you.
- Father.

243
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:02,032
What do you think of Wanqing?

244
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:06,560
Father, are you trying to propose a marriage alliance with the Mu family?

245
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,860
Mr. Mu and I wanted to establish a marriage alliance long ago.

246
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,259
Now that Mr. Mu gave his property to Wanqing,

247
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:14,520
it won't be easy for Wanqing to support the family business on her own.

248
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,299
If she has the governor's family supporting her, it would be good for both of our families.

249
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,000
But I don't know if you're fond of her,

250
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,180
so I came to ask for your opinion.

251
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,439
Wanqing is a gorgeous and intelligent girl,

252
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:30,639
and we've known each other since we were very young. Of course, I like her.

253
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:32,470
But...

254
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,619
But what?

255
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:40,595
But I expressed my feelings to her in private and she didn't respond.

256
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:42,419
Son.

257
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:46,080
Parents have always arranged their children's marriage and asked matchmakers to match them.

258
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,300
There is no reason for two young people to decide their marriage themselves.

259
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,681
Besides, Wanqing is a noble lady, not a wild girl from an ordinary family.

260
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:55,800
It was frivolous of you to express your feelings in private.

261
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,800
It's supposed to be a family proposal.

262
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,856
Was that why she's been a little distant from me the last few days?

263
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:07,760
She blamed me for offending her.

264
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,523
Relax.

265
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,340
I will invite everyone in the Mu family to the inauguration.

266
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,740
I'll propose your marriage to Mr. Mu.

267
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,140
You risked your life to take a bullet for Wanqing.

268
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,790
I believe that Mr. Mu will agree to this marriage.

269
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,053
Thank you, Father.

270
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,306
Perfect.

271
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,511
The environment is quite good.

272
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:40,640
Thank you. Great.

273
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,616
- Supervisor Xu, congratulations.
- Welcome.

274
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,390
- Welcome.
- Please go inside.

275
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,520
Mr. Mu, I heard that you weren't feeling well and are recuperating at Fayuan Temple.

276
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,330
I wonder if you are feeling better.

277
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,070
I'm fine physically, but I'm looking for peace of mind.

278
00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:04,256
It's just I left such a heavy burden on Wanqing.

279
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:06,330
She is very stressed out.

280
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:11,106
Exactly. I saw her just now, she did seem a bit sullen.

281
00:21:11,106 --> 00:21:16,100
Such a heavy burden for a little girl, it's really hard for her.

282
00:21:21,603 --> 00:21:23,467
Brother Guangyao.

283
00:21:24,428 --> 00:21:26,310
Congratulations on your new home.

284
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,117
- Thank you, Commander Tan.
- Commander Tan.

285
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,000
Today is an extra lucky day for our Guangyao.

286
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,200
What's the other lucky event? Tell me. I want to get lucky, too.

287
00:21:38,691 --> 00:21:40,895
Well then, let me break the news.

288
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:44,635
My father is going to propose marriage with the Mu family.

289
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:49,423
It's-It's really all so sudden.

290
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:54,080
Commander Tan, you must come to drink our wedding wine.

291
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,950
Okay. Well. Let me greet Governor Xu first.

292
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,149
- Go inside.
- Okay.

293
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,823
Guangyao.

294
00:22:09,823 --> 00:22:11,500
I already told you

295
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,798
Commander Tan had other intentions for Miss Wanqing.

296
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:18,040
Be quiet.

297
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,176
Mr. Mu.

298
00:22:36,176 --> 00:22:37,470
I've heard

299
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,460
- you love Chinese opera.
- Thank you.

300
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,087
How about singing "In Extremely Good Fortune"

301
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:45,710
with Boss Lan in a minute?

302
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,130
Listen to my voice.

303
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,360
I don't want to embarrass myself here today.

304
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,730
Boss Lan's "In Extremely Good Fortune" is very unique.

305
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,570
Singing it today is for good luck, too.

306
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,990
Guangyao is 25 years old this year.

307
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,660
He spent a year as a staff officer at the Army Headquarters.

308
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,300
Now, he is working in Shanghai.

309
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,760
I guess he can take on things.

310
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,210
But it's not good for him to live alone all the time.

311
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,120
So I think it's time to arrange a wedding for him.

312
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,290
As the saying goes, "Family comes before a career."

313
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,000
To become a man, he should have a family,

314
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,430
he would then have motivation.

315
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,610
Listening to what you said,

316
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:30,730
Guangyao is fond of my Wanqing.

317
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,030
Wanqing is gentle and graceful,

318
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,380
and she used to be Guangyao's secretary.

319
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,080
The two seem to love each other.

320
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,403
They are well-matched.

321
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:43,889
Yes.

322
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,825
Wanqing and Guangyao knew each other

323
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,500
since they were young, so they are very close.

324
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,016
Guangyao has a great personality and talent.

325
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:55,417
If she can get Guangyao's help,

326
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:57,703
I will be relieved.

327
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,652
That's great.

328
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:03,914
Father,

329
00:24:03,914 --> 00:24:06,169
I just took over the family business,

330
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:07,510
so there are a lot of things I have to do first.

331
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,470
Besides, the yarn factory is still in a dangerous position.

332
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,440
I really don't want to think about marriage right now.

333
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,452
Wanqing, I offended you before.

334
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:21,520
I shouldn't have expressed my feelings to you in private.

335
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,200
Father has already scolded me for that.

336
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,910
I want to apologize to you.

337
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,895
So, Wanqing.

338
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:32,170
has Guangyao already talked to you about it?

339
00:24:32,778 --> 00:24:33,845
Wanqing,

340
00:24:33,845 --> 00:24:37,480
why didn't you tell me about such an important thing?

341
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,736
Wanqing.

342
00:24:40,736 --> 00:24:42,990
We all know her.

343
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,040
She knew that it was unreasonable.

344
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,958
Wanqing, you were right to reject Guangyao.

345
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,980
This boy. He's got no rules.

346
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,710
Don't make it easy for him to get you.

347
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,670
Uncle Xu. Father.

348
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,400
I turned down Brother Guangyao before

349
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,280
not because he was offensive.

350
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,070
At the Mu family ball,

351
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,960
we put the marriage on hold for the time being.

352
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,690
That was because the war was urgent at the time.

353
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,890
We were afraid of damaging the governor's reputation.

354
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,000
But now, the war in the south is more intense.

355
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,370
If we bring up marriage again, I'm afraid there will be gossip.

356
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,556
No, no. I don't think so.

357
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:22,080
I think now is a perfect time.

358
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,880
If the marriage had happened then,

359
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,950
Guangyao would have missed you, the real lady of the Mu family.

360
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,726
This is destiny. It was meant to be.

361
00:25:29,726 --> 00:25:33,210
You two should get married.

362
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,660
I'm afraid someone will gossip,

363
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,210
and say that the governor's mansion can't handle military affairs.

364
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,552
Why is that?

365
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:39,520
The world is not at peace.

366
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,885
Our two families should help each other.

367
00:25:42,885 --> 00:25:44,641
Mr. Mu, look.

368
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:48,006
These two are really a match for each other.

369
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,447
You're right.

370
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:53,660
Governor, I only have one daughter.

371
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,561
And she can win your favor.

372
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:59,230
It's my daughter's great honor.

373
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,280
Don't worry, Mr. Mu.

374
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,200
From now on, Wanqing will be the young mistress of the governor's family.

375
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,630
She has the governor's family supporting her.

376
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,980
Mr. Mu, I suppose it's time to pick the perfect day.

377
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,460
How about the engagement ceremony on the eighth day of next month?

378
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,330
It's a good day for marriage.

379
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,617
Okay.

380
00:26:19,617 --> 00:26:21,940
She can get the favor of the governor,

381
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,911
which will be her glory, too.

382
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:27,860
We'll be at your disposal.

383
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,541
Great.

384
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:32,220
Come on. Have a cup of tea.

385
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,375
Father,

386
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:45,530
I just realized that I have to sign some contracts in the company,

387
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,636
I'll leave first.

388
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,695
Wanqing,

389
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:52,980
didn't you want to listen to Boss Lan's "In Extremely Good Fortune"?

390
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,500
I don't understand operas anyways. You all enjoy it. I'll be off first.

391
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:01,185
Wanqing.

392
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,564
Governor Xu,

393
00:27:05,564 --> 00:27:07,810
the company has gotten a lot of business lately.

394
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,725
Wanqing is not in the mood either.

395
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:10,908
I'll apologize for her leaving.

396
00:27:10,908 --> 00:27:13,827
I hope you forgive her.

397
00:27:13,827 --> 00:27:17,120
I quite like Wanqing's straightforward nature.

398
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,927
She has the competence to do great things.

399
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:22,680
Guangyao, you will marry such a capable woman,

400
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,947
you must do better than her.

401
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:29,113
Yes, Father. I will work harder.

402
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:31,162
- Good. Let's go watch the opera.
- Okay.

403
00:27:31,162 --> 00:27:33,440
Okay. Go ahead.

404
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:47,156
Wanqing.

405
00:27:47,156 --> 00:27:48,326
Did you hear all that?

406
00:27:48,326 --> 00:27:51,100
I have to go talk to Father.

407
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,223
Don't worry.

408
00:27:56,223 --> 00:27:58,022
I have an idea.

409
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,510
What's the name of that reporter?

410
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,150
Which one?

411
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,730
The one who published the photos of

412
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,106
Xu Guangyao and Pei Shaojun.

413
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,722
Oh. It's The Spark.

414
00:28:11,722 --> 00:28:13,708
The Spark, right?

415
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,131
Ask a man you don't know to send this.

416
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,630
What is this for?

417
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,004
Go.

418
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:25,934
Okay.

419
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,307
Hello?

420
00:28:51,307 --> 00:28:53,320
<i>See you tomorrow at 10:00 at the usual place.</i>

421
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,535
Have you figured out a way?

422
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:56,717
<i>Let's talk after we meet.</i>

423
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,113
Xuanlin!

424
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:08,016
What's your plan?

425
00:29:08,016 --> 00:29:10,886
It's an emergency. I don't think it's a good idea to argue with them.

426
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:13,216
How about you agree on it first, just as a temporary measure.

427
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:15,890
I can't agree with that.

428
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,300
Your father and Xu Bojun have set a wedding date already.

429
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,680
If you go against them now,

430
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,820
you will not only embarrass yourself but also get me into trouble.

431
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,050
You said you wanted to accompany me forever, and not a day less.

432
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,390
So you want to watch Xu Bojun and me fight each other? Will you be happy then?

433
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,170
I do like you, but if I have to risk my life for this.

434
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,670
- I have to think about it.
- You...

435
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,994
You asshole.

436
00:29:35,994 --> 00:29:37,760
Wanqing!

437
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,288
- Listen to me.
- I know. Someone is watching us.

438
00:29:43,288 --> 00:29:45,066
You knew? Then, why did you hit me so hard?

439
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,570
I enjoyed it.

440
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,576
Besides, acting has to be realistic.

441
00:29:48,576 --> 00:29:50,330
How dare you make fun of your man.

442
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,576
I'll deal with you later.

443
00:29:51,576 --> 00:29:53,433
Wait for my news.

444
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,590
Tan Xuanlin, you better remember!

445
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,415
Wanqing!

446
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,477
Guangyao.

447
00:30:22,477 --> 00:30:24,280
How come you drank so much?

448
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,510
Yesterday, Wanqing left without watching the opera.

449
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,630
I don't think she wants to marry me.

450
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,226
Since Mr. Mu has already made a promise,

451
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:37,622
I don't think he'll break his word.

452
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,971
In fact, when I expressed my feelings to her

453
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:46,832
when I was in the hospital,

454
00:30:46,832 --> 00:30:49,214
she didn't respond.

455
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,232
She even started drifting from me.

456
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,809
I can't figure out what she's thinking.

457
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,100
I think it's better to ask her directly.

458
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,090
I'd like to ask.

459
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,313
But I'm also afraid.

460
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,920
I'm afraid she'll turn me down.

461
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:19,526
I'm afraid... that she does not like me.

462
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,742
Tell me.

463
00:31:25,742 --> 00:31:28,772
If I pretend I don't know about it and marry her,

464
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:32,040
then spend my whole life protecting her,

465
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,413
will she love me?

466
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,595
It's selfish of you to do that.

467
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,990
I'll just be selfish just this once.

468
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,150
I'll spend my whole life loving her

469
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,317
and protecting her.

470
00:31:50,317 --> 00:31:52,103
Isn't that enough?

471
00:31:52,103 --> 00:31:55,560
I wonder what true love in this world is.

472
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,527
He who promises his life

473
00:31:57,527 --> 00:32:00,200
to only one other person.

474
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,466
Guangyao,

475
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:06,550
cheer up.

476
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,690
You can at least make Mu Wanqing stay.

477
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,606
I... pursued Gu Yueshuang

478
00:32:14,606 --> 00:32:17,683
and gave her my whole heart,

479
00:32:17,683 --> 00:32:20,730
and she didn't take me seriously.

480
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,910
Come on, Brothers.

481
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,705
Let's have a toast.

482
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:32,806

Old Pei.

What are you doing?

485
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,203
I toasted to Guangyao,

486
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:42,090
because we both have annoyances.

487
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,200
Your Tan Sangyu loves you so much.

488
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,192
- You just stay out of it.
- Don't make fun of me.

489
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,095
Look!

490
00:32:56,095 --> 00:32:58,611
Doesn't she look like Tan Sangyu?

I still hope you enjoyed it.

501

In fact, I'm not a professional singer

I'd like to tell him.

She deeply expressed her feelings for you, yet you left her there alone.

534
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,640
That's not cool.

535
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,895
I really didn't expect her to do that in public.

536
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,980
Not to mention,

537
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,760
Tan Sangyu's courage is indeed admirable.

538
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,380
She is a lady, and for you,

539
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,560
she takes the initiative every time and gives up her face.

540
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,170
Even if you are a stone monkey, you should be moved by her sincerity.

541
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,710
You can at least give her a kind face, okay?

542
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:57,600
Do you know how tough it is for someone like us to pursue others actively?

543
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:03,160
If everyone is like you and can't be moved, we'd rather die.

544
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,990
If you don't like her,

545
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:11,390
you should directly tell her and make it clear.

546
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,690
It's not nice for you to keep her there like that.

547
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,777
Actually, I...

548
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,918
don't dislike her.

549
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,323
Old Pei, you said you don't dislike her.

550
00:39:25,323 --> 00:39:27,760
That means you like her.

551
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,947
Shaojun, if you like her,

552
00:39:34,947 --> 00:39:37,030
why are you avoiding her?

553
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:42,540
If you let her down, and she really leaves you,

554
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,860
you'll regret this forever.

555
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,377
Exactly.

556
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,300
Maybe it's safer for her to stay away from me.

557
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,920
All my life, what I wanted to do,

558

who I wanted to protect,

559

the opposite always happens.

560
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,860
No, it shouldn't be.

561
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,400
I remembered what Tan Sangyu said before.

562
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,230
She said you saved a lot of lives during the student demonstrations in Beijing.

563
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,030
You saved her life, too.

564
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,720
Then she has no idea what happened next.

565
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,510

Right. It's not your fault.

You did a bad thing but with good intentions.

You lose more and try more.

Then, you'll be braver.
