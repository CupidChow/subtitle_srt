00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,100
Guangyao, it is so nice

16
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,500
that you agreed to stay with us.

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,000
I couldn't be happier.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,300
Thank you, Madam. It's my pleasure.

19
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,700
Guangyao,

20
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,000
if you find anything to be unsatisfactory here, please tell me.

21
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,500
Brother Guangyao, please eat more.

22
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,800
We are a family. We've known each other well.

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
That's right.

24
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,600
Thank you, Uncle, Madam, and Miss Wanting.

25
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,200
It's fixed.

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,500
Thank you so much, Sir. You are very skilled.

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Sister Mu.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's really you!

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,600
Are you… Miss Tan Si?

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,800
What are you doing here?

31
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,400
Coincidentally, I'm getting a photo album revised in the store next door.

32
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,500
You like drawing, Miss Si?

33
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,200
I like drawing portraits.

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
But just as a hobby.

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,000
Sister Mu, are you familiar with Mr. Pei Shaojun?

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No, I don't know him.

37
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,800
What about his friends?

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,700
No, I'm not familiar with them either.

39
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,100
So how do you know Mr. Xu?

40
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,590
Sister Mu, tell me how to get close to

41
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,800
a junior marshal like him from the provincial military governor's mansion?

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,100
Why don't you ask me for help then?

43
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,700
I, your brother, am very experienced, you know.

44
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,900
Why are you here? Did you follow me?

45
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,100
You…

46
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,600
"You" what?

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,800
Look at you.

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,500
You look so fierce. Like a demon.

49
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,800
When girls see you, they have to run…

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,020
run the other way.

51
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,900
I am very popular with girls, okay?

52
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,600
Tan Si told me you secretly escaped again.

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Do you think I won't lock you up?

54
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,000
What gives you the right to lock me up?

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
I didn't break the law.

56
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,100
Listen! Don't think that because you are Commander of Shanghai,

57
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,400
you can bully the weak and helpless.

58
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,600
If you dare lock me up,

59
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,200
I will…

60
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
I will release a report tomorrow.

61
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
I will cut ties with you.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,700
I will break your leg!

63
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
- Stop!
- Sister Mu, help!

64
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,900
Miss Si is still a child.

65
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,200
Why do you treat her like this?

66
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,700
You don't know. She lacks discipline.

67
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,900
I was busy leading troops so I couldn't take care of her.

68
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,600
There are people in the world who Commander Tan can't control?

69
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,000
Sir, did you pack my drawing?

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,400
Yes, it's ready.

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,500
I'll get it for you.

72
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,100
Right. Here you are.

73
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,900
Thank you!

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

75
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,500
I'm so hungry.

76
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,800
- Brother Guangyao.
- I just moved here today.

77
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,400
I've come to say hello to you.

78
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,600
Madam said you left for business

79
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
and didn't even have a bite to eat.

80
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,800
I've brought a late snack for you.

81
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,700
Have a glass of milk first.

82
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,400
Thank you.

83
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,200
I'm sorry. I was too busy to welcome you today.

84
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,600
It doesn't matter.

85
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
How is it going?

86
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
My mother's funeral will be in two days.

87
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,400
I went to the funeral parlor today and got everything ready.

88
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,900
Don't tire yourself out.

89
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,200
If you need help, feel free to tell me.

90
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
Oh right, Brother Guangyao.

91
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,500
From now on, don't come to my room alone at night.

92
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,000
Why?

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,500
Wanting doesn't like it when we are alone.

94
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,200
We'd better avoid suspicion.

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,400
We grew up together.

96
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,100
Is it necessary to avoid suspicion?

97
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,900
But last time after you came back from the Command,

98
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,600
Wanting had a fit.

99
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,700
We'd better stop it.

100
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,800
I have nothing to do with her.

101
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,300
What is there to have a fit about?

102
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,000
But Wanting thinks she is your fiancée.

103
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,300
That's her own thinking.

104
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,600
Brother Guangyao,

105
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,500
in this family, Aunt Cui is the madam.

106
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,300
Wanting is the eldest daughter.

107
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,700
I don't want to cause any trouble.

108
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,200
All right. Please go back now. Quick.

109
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,700
- D-Don't forget to have food.
- Okay, I will.

110
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,200
Good night. Bye-bye.

111
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,100
- What about this?
- Try it.

112
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,500
- The coffee is good.
- It looks good.

113
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,100
Wanqing.

114
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,100
This is the new order from the foreign trading company.

115
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,200
- Brother Guangyao.
- Have a look.

116
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,500
What do you like?

117
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,800
Brother Guangyao,

118
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,100
does this look nice?

119
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,000
Come and have a look.

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,800
There are many new goods that arrived today.

121
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Look for what you want.

122
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,900
Thank you, Aunt Cui.

123
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,400
- Madam.
- Yes?

124
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,100
Baoli Pawnshop called

125
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,300
saying there is a mistake and that they gave you Miss Wanqing's receipt.

126
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,000
Please keep it safe, and they will change it tomorrow morning.

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,300
How is that possible?

128
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Let me have a look.

129
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,100
It wasn't the wrong one.

130
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,700
It's really the wrong receipt.

131
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Wanqing.

132
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,900
You went to have jewelry repaired?

133
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,400
Brother's jade pendant was broken,

134
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,600
and I went to have it repaired.

135
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,800
Payer, Tan Xuanlin.

136
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,200
Wait! Why is Commander Tan's name on here?

137
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Wanqing, did you ask…

138
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,900
Commander Tan to pay for it?

139
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,600
Mother, let me have a look.

140
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,700
- Why are you so troublesome?
- Let me have a look.

141
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,500
It really is the signature of Commander Tan.

142
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,200
Father, look.

143
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,200
I'd say Sister and Commander Tan

144
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,800
must have a good relationship.

145
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,200
Otherwise, she could have asked us

146
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,800
to help with Brother Yuanhang's heirloom.

147
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,500
Wanting!

148
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Wanqing,

149
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,900
can you explain this?

150
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,300
- Hello?
- <i>Commander Tan, if you have time</i>

151
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,100
<i>please come to our house for lunch at noon.</i>

152
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,400
That sounds good. It'll be my honor.

153
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,200
I will go over now.

154
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,900
All right.

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,800
Tan Si, get the car ready.

156
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,700
Mr. Mu invited us to lunch.

157
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,700
Why does Mr. Mu always surprise us like this?

158
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,500
The pork was stewed in soy sauce for two hours.

159
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,900
Don't complain.

160
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,600
The timing is perfect.

161
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
The lunch will be very pleasant for both hosts and guests.

162
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,300
Let's go.

163
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,400
This way, please.

164
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,000
My Lord, the guest has arrived.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,900
Commander Tan, welcome to our home.

166
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,500
Commander Tan, welcome.

167
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,400
Mr. Mu, thank you for your hospitality.

168
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,700
I came in a hurry, so I did not bring a gift

169
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,100
other than a bottle of Jiangcheng wine.

170
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,000
Today, let's enjoy a drink together with Brother Guangyao.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Good. Come. Please take a seat.

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,300
- Please.
- Come.

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Today, I invited you to our house.

174
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,800
First, is to perform my duties as a host.

175
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,400
Second, is to thank you for looking after our daughter.

176
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,100
Yes, Commander Tan.

177
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,300
Wanqing's jade pendant was broken

178
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,200
and you paid to get it repaired.

179
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,000
We are very ashamed.

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,600
As her mother… I've been careless.

181
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,600
Mrs. Mu, it wasn't a problem.

182
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,500
Please do not worry.

183
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,400
In fact...

184
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,200
<i>Based on our friendship,</i>

185
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
<i>even if I wasn't the one who broke it,</i>

186
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,600
<i>I really didn't have to pay it for you.</i>

187
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,800
I broke the jade pendant,

188
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,000
so I had it repaired.

189
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,800
This is only natural.

190
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,300
Miss Mu didn't blame me for it, which I am very thankful for.

191
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,500
So please don't thank me for looking after her.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,700
You were even able to break such a small jade pendant.

193
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,600
What a coincidence!

194
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,300
It was indeed a coincidence.

195
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,100
I was accompanying Miss Shuang'er shopping at Seven Treasure Alley,

196
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,800
when I came across Miss Mu.

197
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,300
<i>Where did you meet?</i>

198
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,900
<i>I met him at Seven Treasure Alley.</i>

199
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,600
<i>He pulled me to him as soon as he saw me.</i>

200
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,000
<i>And it accidentally broke.</i>

201
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,300
Wanqing.

202
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,300
I think you must not have been watching your steps on the street,

203
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,200
and you knocked into Commander Tan. Isn't that right?

204
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,300
That's not true.

205
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,200
I pulled Miss Mu to me,

206
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
perhaps a bit too aggressively

207
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,900
and broke the jade pendant as a result.

208
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
<i>The jade pendant was broken because of Commander Tan,</i>

209
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,800
<i>so he paid for its repairs.</i>

210
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,600
I don't mean to be rude, Commander Tan.

211
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,300
So you said you walked down the street with this Miss Shuang.

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,300
Our Wanqing...

213
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,000
still counts as a lady from a noble family.

214
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,500
It's not good, right?

215
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,200
Well…

216
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,800
Oh, by the way…

217
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,400
What happened on that day?

218
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,400
<i>He was afraid that Brother Guangyao would know that he went shopping.</i>

219
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,100
Well…

220
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,800
<i>He'll talk official business with me. I don't want to talk about that.</i>

221
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,300
<i>Please don't tell him you met me here.</i>

222
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,200
In fact…

223
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,400
In fact, I didn't want Miss Mu

224
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,900
to tell Brother Guangyao that she had met me at Seven Treasure Alley.

225
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,900
Brother Guangyao, I'm sorry.

226
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,300
I lied to you.

227
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,800
That time, I didn't drink with Fei Andun.

228
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,600
I had to go shopping with Miss Shuang'er.

229
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,800
So…

230
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Looks like Commander Tan, you went through so much trouble

231
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,100
just to avoid talking business with me.

232
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,800
Brother Guangyao, I will punish myself with a glass of wine.

233
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,600
- What a story! Really.
- Yes.

234
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,800
In any case, we should thank Commander Tan

235
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,900
for looking after our daughter.

236
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,400
Come! Let's drink a couple more glasses.

237
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,600
With pleasure, Mr. Mu.

238
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,100
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

239
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
<i>[Baoli Pawnshop, 200 silver dollars]</i>

240
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,500
<i>[Tan Xuanlin]</i>
<i>The pawnshop receipt</i>

241
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,900
<i>actually received a stamp from the Command.</i>

242
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,200
<i>Were you afraid nobody would know you'd pay for it?</i>

243
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,400
<i>It's no wonder you dealt with it perfectly.</i>

244
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,000
<i>It was your plan all along.</i>

245
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,600
<i>I will confront you about the receipt right now</i>

246
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,200
<i>and see what your explanation will be.</i>

247
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,200
<i>Mother! Tan Xuanlin covered for her today.</i>

248
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,400
<i>I was the one who broke the jade pendant.</i>

249
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,700
Today, we suddenly created trouble

250
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,300
so Mu Wanqing would have no time

251
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,800
to discuss with Tan Xuanlin.

252
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,200
But Tan Xuanlin's words were the same as hers.

253
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,700
<i>Because their answers were the same,</i>

254
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,100
<i>this whole matter seems suspicious.</i>

255
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,300
They must have some secrets.

256
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,800
That brat is so scheming.

257
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Luckily, you secretly transferred her mother's dowry

258
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,600
and hid it from her.

259
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,300
<i>Otherwise, she would have used the money to bribe Tan Xuanlin</i>

260
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,000
<i>and deal with us.</i>

261
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,800
<i>What should we do then?</i>

262
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,600
If we had known, we shouldn't have even given her the jewelry.

263
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,200
The valuable ones

264
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,400
were put in my mother's house long ago.

265
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,200
<i>Now Brother Guangyao is living in our house,</i>

266
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,400
this bitch must be wanting to lure him to her in any way she can.

267
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,000
She's also fawning over Tan Xuanlin.

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
<i>What should we do now?</i>

269
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,700
<i>She has two purposes.</i>

270
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
The first is money.

271
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,800
The second is career.

272
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,000
Then should we let her be?

273
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,200
This time, she was lucky and succeeded.

274
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
To prevent your father from getting suspicious,

275
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,700
we should wait.

276
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,800
Mother,

277
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,800
we should just remove her.

278
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,000
<i>We will get another chance.</i>

279
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,300
<i>Next time, she won't be so lucky.</i>

280
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,000
Hello?

281
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,600
<i>Thank you for today.</i>

282
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,000
<i>Let's meet somewhere.</i>

283
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,700
Miss Mu, this place is so nice.

284
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,400
I would have never expected

285
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,500
that the lively Shanghai Bund

286
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,800
would have such a quiet place.

287
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,300
Commander Tan, you are used to lively places.

288
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,200
Thank you for accompanying me.

289
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,000
It doesn't matter.

290
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,000
As long as you, the eldest daughter of the Mu family, like it,

291
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,400
I'm willing to come.

292
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,600
Thank you for explaining everything today during lunch.

293
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,200
And so perfectly at that.

294
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,400
I just lifted my finger.

295
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Lifted your finger?

296
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,100
I think you prepared for it.

297
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,200
Listening to your words, it seems like you aren't here to thank me.

298
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,100
It was just a small receipt,

299
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,300
but you personally signed as the commander

300
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,100
with the stamp of the Command.

301
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,200
I am extremely flattered.

302
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,700
I'm sure you did this for today's act.

303
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,400
Even if it was an act,

304
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
I'd say I was a good actor.

305
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,200
Yes, you were.

306
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,400
You made Cui Lianfeng and Mu Wanting terrified of me.

307
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,600
They'll try again.

308
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,590
You can't get rid of them.

309
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,200
If Cui Lianfeng didn't try to attack you,

310
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,200
how could she have gotten this receipt?

311
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,400
Do you think you can survive in the Mu family

312
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,900
if you just try to just avoid troubles?

313
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,700
You are right.

314
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,000
I won't be passive anymore.

315
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,900
Do you mean you agree to cooperate with me?

316
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,300
Yes.

317
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I don't remember who said that they

318
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,800
looked down upon my schemes of infighting.

319
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,400
A good horse never turns around to graze on an old pasture.

320
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,700
I should think it over.

321
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,400
Commander Tan,

322
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,500
why are you playing this game of letting me go after controlling me before?

323
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,300
Haven't you worked so hard

324
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,000
to get me to cooperate with you?

325
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,400
You are a lonely commander

326
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
who needs the support of the Mu family.

327
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,000
So at the party,

328
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,200
when you knew I was Mu Zhiyuan's daughter,

329

<i>when you knew I couldn't afford it.</i>

335
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,600

<i>and appeared to rescue me from embarrassment.</i>

You even left behind the receipt

338
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,800
to make Cui Lianfeng doubt our relationship

339
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,400
and to have my own father question me.

340
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,900
Everything you did

341
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,900
was to make me lose my standing in the Mu family

342
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,400
and to force me to work with you.

343

From now on, don't play your tricks on me.

354

Second. Partners should benefit each other.

If you treat me well, I will return the favor.

356

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,007
I believe God is fair.

491
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:51,130
He will make up for

492
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,590
the pains we suffer.

Cousin.

495
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:12,530
Who are you?

496
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,890
I am Cui Jie.

00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,636
The madam at the Mu mansion,

498
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,340
Cui Lianfeng, is my aunt by blood.

499
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,103
She said you were alone,

500
00:34:20,103 --> 00:34:23,683
so she asked me to keep your company.

501
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,983
Mr. Cui, thank you. You may go.

502
00:34:31,983 --> 00:34:33,146
Look.

503
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:37,396
Now that we are alone, a boy and girl can make love.

504
00:34:37,396 --> 00:34:40,230
Cousin, come here.

<i>[Hall of Bhaisajyaguru]</i>

506
00:34:48,474 --> 00:34:50,136
Stop!

507
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,680
Who are you?

508
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,076
What happened?

509
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,589
Who are you?

510
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:02,536
How dare you ruin my perfect opportunity!

511
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:04,003
Go away!

512
00:35:04,003 --> 00:35:07,721
I will teach you a lesson for protecting the beautiful girl.

513
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:20,015
What are you going to do?

514
00:35:20,973 --> 00:35:22,015
What are you doing?

515
00:35:22,015 --> 00:35:24,330
There must be a misunderstanding. You must have made a mistake.

516
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,209
Get on.

517
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:29,886
Go. Report to the Command. Miss Mu is safe.

518
00:35:37,463 --> 00:35:42,210
- Hello?
- <i>Sir, there is only one here. Miss Wanqing is safe.</i>

519
00:35:43,323 --> 00:35:46,583
Only one? All right. I got it.

520
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:48,040
She should be safe.

521
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,869
Xu Guangyao has caught onto the bait.

522
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:53,200
You can go.

523
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,733
<i>Yes.</i>

524
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:07,100
A boy and girl in the wild…

525
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,280
It's none of my business.

526
00:36:15,322 --> 00:36:17,050
Tan Si, get the car ready.

527
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,552
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

528
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,359
Did you know

529
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:26,350
when I was young, Mother always told me

530
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:30,370
after a person died, he or she would become a star in the sky.

531
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,440
Do you think my mother and brother became stars and are looking at me from above?

532
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,760
<i>[The memorial tablet of Xiao Bingqing]</i>

533
00:36:40,983 --> 00:36:44,383
I believe they are not only looking at you,

534
00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:47,506
but also staying by your side.

535
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:51,070
I always think…

536
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,220
how nice it would be if they were still alive.

537
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,840
I'd be together with them and stay by their side.

538
00:37:02,758 --> 00:37:04,591
Wanqing,

539
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:06,810
you still have me.

540
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,210
I will stay by your side.

541
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,800
It doesn't matter.

542
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,680
After so many years, I've gotten used to it.

543
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:28,799
Commander, you can't see them.

544
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:33,240
You wouldn't be able to see them even if you pushed your eyes into the binoculars.

545
00:37:35,803 --> 00:37:39,843
Xu Guangyao may look like a gentleman.

546
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:43,080
But in the temple, he's alone with her.

547
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,736
Well…

548
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,780
Supervisor Xu and Miss Mu are probably having a good time.

549
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,510
Why did we hurry just to freeze out here in the wild?

550
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,910
Nonsense!

551
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:59,636
Commander. Well… if you indeed want to go in,

552
00:37:59,636 --> 00:38:01,914
let's get off and go straight there.

553
00:38:01,914 --> 00:38:03,190
How about it?

554
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,440
Do you take me for a fool?

555
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,550
Wouldn't that be ridiculous?

556
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,328
Fine.

557
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,055
Let's stay.

558
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:16,093
Stay here.

559
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,563
It's you.

<i>A single day apart seems like three days.</i>

561
00:39:04,157 --> 00:39:05,699
<i>Shut up.</i>

562
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:08,929
<i>I've come to talk with you about something.</i>

563
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:12,956
<i>As expected. You always have a reason for coming.</i>

564
00:39:12,956 --> 00:39:14,656
<i>Tell me.</i>

565
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:18,300
<i>Today, when I went outside, I saw Mu Wanting acting strangely.</i>

566
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,230
<i>I found an excuse to follow her.</i>

567
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,854
<i>She went to secretly see a man in a gambling house.</i>

568
00:39:22,854 --> 00:39:27,976
<i>It was Cui Lianfeng's nephew, a typical hooligan who behaves irrationally.</i>

569
00:39:27,976 --> 00:39:30,683
<i>I guess they were planning to hurt me.</i>

570
00:39:30,683 --> 00:39:32,839
<i>They are in such a hurry.</i>

571
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:36,469
<i>Relax. I will send people to watch out for the hooligan</i>

572
00:39:36,469 --> 00:39:38,760
<i>and protect you from harm.</i>

573
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,370
<i>Thank you.</i>

574
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,770
<i>Forget it. It's nothing.</i>

575
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,423
<i>I am also doing it for myself.</i>

576

578
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,002
<i>Just put it on.</i>
