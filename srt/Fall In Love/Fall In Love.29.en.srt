Miss Mu, Young Uncle drank a bit too much.

Miss Gu, sorry to bother you.

You can go back and get some rest. I'll take care of him.

- Tan Si.
- Yes, sir.

24
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:34,297
- Send her back.
-Yes, sir.

25
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:36,191
I'm not going back.

26
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,560
Are you hiding something from me?

27
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,360
Otherwise, you wouldn't be treating me like this.

28
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,758
There's nothing. You are thinking too much.

29
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,420
That day, you suddenly left my house.

30
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,240
Then, you didn't show up as planned to try on the wedding attire.

31
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,769
Now you got drunk like this. And you have Miss Gu stay and take care of you.

32
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:00,294
Shuang'er is my family!

34
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:08,743
to take care of your childhood sweetheart, Xu Guangyao?

35
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:12,240
Shuang'er is someone I raised up myself. So why can't she take care of me?

36
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:21,767
So are you raking up the past with me now?

37
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:27,419
No, no, Miss Mu. Young Uncle's drunk. He saying nonsense.

38
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,419
I'm not raking up the past.

39
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:35,367
That was just a fact.

40
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:42,655
Do you still remember what the first of our three agreements were?

41
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:48,175
Fine. If you don't want to say them, I will.

42
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:56,433
The first is since we are partners we must trust each other.

43
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:58,438
To hell with trust!

44
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,880
You come to my office like this in the middle of the night. Isn't that because of distrust?

45
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,240
I don't distrust you. I really want to stay and take care of you.

46
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,440
If you must have Miss Gu here, it's fine. I can leave.

47
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,830
But you should give me a reason.

48
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,336
So you're not going to tell me anything, are you?

49
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,194
You told me once that

50
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:39,088
true trust is when you cannot see each other,

51
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:42,110
but still choose to believe one another.

52
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,328
So even now, I still believe you.

53
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:50,431
I believe there is a reason for your sudden cold behavior.

54
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:55,362
But if we still have a chance to become husband and wife,

55
00:04:55,997 --> 00:04:58,957
I hope you can let me see everything about you.

56
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,267
Miss Gu,

57
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,350
I'm sorry we have to bother you for a bit longer.

58
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,642
I…

59
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,231
Young Uncle, what are you doing?

60
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:01,840
What's going on between you two? What on earth happened?

61
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,004
Why did you say that?

62
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:06,440
Don't torture yourself like that anymore.

63
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,083

64

65
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,065
Before,

66
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,537
I didn't believe in fate.

67
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,990
I thought whatever I do,

68
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,649
there would be no problem.

69
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,858
Nothing could be too difficult for me.

70
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,697
But now…

71
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:35,475
You can leave now. I'm going to sleep.

72
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:39,461

I'm afraid she doesn't have time to see you.

Tan Xuanlin has not gotten married to you yet.

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,190
Yet he dares to take another at the same time!

81
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:28,920
And you are letting him get away with this?

82
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,050
Miss Gu is Commander Tan's family.

83
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,550
You have no right to talk about them like this.

84
00:07:37,298 --> 00:07:41,764
Well, well! Have you totally been brainwashed by Tan Xuanlin?

What kind of person is Tan Xuanlin?

88
00:07:51,314 --> 00:07:53,709
He is a bandit and a country bumpkin!

89
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:57,139
Being a powerless girl, how can you handle him?

90
00:07:57,907 --> 00:08:01,247
You turned Guangyao down just for him.

91
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,241
Now he's shown who he really is.

92
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:06,815
You're not only suffering yourself, but also implicating me.

93
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,400
If Miss Gu really has you in her mind, do I have any chance to implicate you?

94
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,664
You… Unreasonable!

95
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,880
He certainly has his reasons to act this way.

96
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,860
Don't worry. There is nothing going on between them.

Self-confidence… Of course, I do.

Did Commander Tan say anything that day?

Commander Tan didn't say anything special. He was looking at the photos.

113
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:19,118
But he asked a few questions about them.

114
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:25,698
Please show me all the albums he looked at that day.

115
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,114
Which album did Commander Tan look at?

116
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:32,879
It was this one.

117
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,722
Which photo did he look at?

118
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:44,060
It was the photo taken when the lord was young, and he was helping with the escort of some goods.

119
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,806
It was taken with some foreigners.

120
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:53,146
This is the one.

121
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:26,934
What's the matter?

122

You're awake, Military Governor.

123
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,671
It's a telegram from Mr. Yamashita.

124
00:11:34,671 --> 00:11:37,791
He says Tan Xuanlin has been in close contact with the Revolutionary Party.

125
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:41,916
Recently, he decided to help them with the transit of some weapons to Guangzhou.

126

<i>[Recently Tan Xuanlin has had close contact with the Revolutionary Party.]</i>

Is this message reliable?

129
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,120
It was from the spy Mr. Yamashita planted in the Licha Hotel.

130
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,480
The information is absolutely true.

Miss Gu. Please come here.

137
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:24,643
Miss Mu, I went to see Young Uncle today.

138
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,786
When I saw him, he was in a bad mood. I had a few drinks with him.

139
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:29,049
Please don't blame me.

140
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:32,050
How can I blame you? I can't thank you enough.

141
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,390
If you weren't there with him,

142
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,609
he would have drunk alone, and I would be more worried.

143
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:40,099
Really? Thank you for not blaming me.

144
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:42,556
Oh, right. I just asked Tan Si,

145
00:12:42,556 --> 00:12:47,300
and he said these days, Young Uncle met often with a Mr. Liao.

146
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,237
Do you think the fact that he's been so unusual these days,

147
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,425
has to do with this Mr. Liao?

148
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:54,974
Mr. Liao?

Do you know him?

155
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,336
Miss Gu, the real identity of Mr. Liao is unusual.

156
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,100
You must not involve yourself in matters related to him. Don't ask about it either.

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,840
How is it going?

161
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,271
I found the photo and also placed it in an obvious position.

162
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:55,934
I believe Tan Xuanlin should have seen it.

163
00:13:55,934 --> 00:14:00,574
What we want is exact information, not a guess.

164
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,320
They don't allow me to go back to the Mu Family Mansion.

165
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,380
How can I keep an eye there all the time?

166
00:14:06,307 --> 00:14:09,807
Just find an excuse and go in there to try and find out.

167
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,561
It's best for you to find a way to stay by Mu Wanqing.

168
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,800
If Tan Xuanlin did see the photo,

169
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,434
his attitude to Mu Wanqing won't be so calm and peaceful.

170
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:22,789
I can help you.

171
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:24,607
But can you really

172
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:27,230
help me bring down Tan Xuanlin and Mu Wanqing,

173
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,400
and give the Mu family property back to me?

174
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:32,694
You can't doubt our ability.

175
00:14:32,694 --> 00:14:36,454
If you do exactly what I ask you to do,

176
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:40,811
you will be the head of the Mu Family in the future.

177
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:15,956
Mother,

178
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,678
I don't know why, but today Xuanlin

179
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:21,809
suddenly changed his attitude towards me.

180
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:25,486
Can you tell me if a man is always so fickle

181
00:15:25,486 --> 00:15:28,726
and so difficult to understand?

182
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,080
<i>You told me once that true trust</i>

183
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,097
<i>is when you cannot see each other but still choose to believe one another.</i>

184
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:53,270
<i>So even now, I still believe you.</i>

185
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:59,742
Commander, Mr. Liao is here.

186
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,643
Mr. Liao.

187
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,809
Xuanlin, the shipment has passed Tsingtao

188
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:14,618
and should arrive in Shanghai in three days.

189
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:17,733
I'll deal with it.

190
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:24,545
How about you and Miss Mu then?

191
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:32,955
I don't know how to face her.

192
00:16:34,008 --> 00:16:36,768
The girl was just a child at the time.

193
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:40,735
Even if Mu Zhiyuan did anything wrong, it has nothing to do with her.

194
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:42,492
Since you love each other so much,

195
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:46,400
why don't you let the resentment from the earlier generation just stop there?

196
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,481
I did consider that as well.

197
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:53,532
But a lifetime is so long.

198
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:58,133
If I do marry her without caring about anything,

199
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,980
this thorn will always be there between us.

200
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,980
I'm afraid I'll hurt her.

201
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,364
I promised her

202
00:17:19,316 --> 00:17:21,890
in my whole life...

203
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,750
I would love her...

204
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:26,390
and protect her.

205
00:17:27,188 --> 00:17:29,417
If I can't keep my word,

206
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,421
I can't marry her.

207
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:43,196
Mr. Liao,

208
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,274
can you do me a favor?

209
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:47,984
Tell me.

210
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,984
I hope you can help me to find the former team members

211
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:54,824
of Sergey's Foreign Gun Brigade, because it's very important to me.

212
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,723
I can't believe his words alone.

213
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:01,717
Don't worry.

214
00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:04,506
As long as these people are still alive,

215
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:07,106
I'll get every single one of them back to you.

216
00:18:22,673 --> 00:18:25,333
- Hello, Wanting.
- Wanqing.

217
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,973
Sit down.

218
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:34,896
How is it? Are you all settled?

219
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:36,376
Everything is fine.

220
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,580
The apartment Commander Tan found for me is very nice.

221
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,256
It is also very convenient.

222
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:44,256
That's good. Let me know if you need any help.

223
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,781
Oh, yes. These are almond cakes I bought for you from Hong Kong.

224
00:18:49,781 --> 00:18:51,120
I forgot last time.

225
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,660
This time, I brought them here so you and Commander Tan can try them.

226
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,487
Thank you, Wanting. Thank you for your concern.

227
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:03,706
Where's Commander Tan? Hasn't he moved in yet?

228
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:06,576
We're not married yet.

229
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:09,896
If he moves in now, there will surely be some gossip.

230
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:12,676
Well, do you have a reason to see him?

231
00:19:12,676 --> 00:19:16,140
No, I don't. Just because he has done me such a great favor,

232
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,657
I want to thank him personally.

233
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:24,060
Is your wedding date set?

234
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,236
I can prepare a gift in advance then.

235
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:29,810
It will be soon. But he's been busy lately.

236
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,820
We'll decide the date when he has more time.

237
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,860
You're right.

238
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,236
Now that all of Shanghai is under his control, he would naturally be very busy.

239
00:19:37,236 --> 00:19:39,312
Well, don't just talk about us.

240
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,516
Tell me something about you then. When will you go back to Hong Kong?

241
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,096
For me, life in Hong Kong is not quite suitable.

242
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:50,320
So I still want to come back to Shanghai.

243
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,193
Come back to Shanghai? Do you have any plans then?

244
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,562
Wanqing, if you think it's fine,

245
00:19:57,562 --> 00:20:00,940
can you look into the Mu Chamber of Commerce or the Mu Wharf

246
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,556
and find me a job?

247
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:05,092
I don't mind if it's hard or tiring,

248
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:08,052
as long as I can earn my own living.

249
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:11,140
I do need a secretary in the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.

250
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,967
You know the Mu Family well. It's also a decent job.

251
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:16,128
Do you want to consider it?

252
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:18,859
Really? That's great.

253
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:20,560
But I must make it clear in advance.

254
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,727
I can only give you a market standard salary.

255
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:26,436
And you will only do secretary work. Other things will not be your business.

256
00:20:26,436 --> 00:20:29,632
Of course, if you don't like it, you don't have to do it.

257
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:32,254
I like it. I do like it.

258
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:39,895
Wanqing, thank you very much.

259
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:43,251
It's fine.

260
00:21:06,677 --> 00:21:08,406
What are you doing here?

261
00:21:08,406 --> 00:21:12,160
Please forgive me for saying things without thinking. Please?

262
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:21,623
Last night, did it hurt when I beat you?

263
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:24,945
It didn't hurt my face,

264
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,250
but it did hurt my heart.

265
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:35,053
I… When I saw you two in the car,

266
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:38,929
you… kiss… kiss…

267
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:41,396
- I felt…
- Kiss?

268
00:21:41,396 --> 00:21:44,540
That's right. Just…

269
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,320
What are you talking about? How could it be possible?

270
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,600
Young Uncle drank too much last night. He leaned on me.

271
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,040
I just took care of him.

272
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,240
What are you talking about?

273
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,000
You didn't kiss?

274
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,700
I'm sorry.

275
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,500
I saw it wrong…

276
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,200
Let's make a promise.

277
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,300
You must not make trouble like this without any reason again.

278
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,100
I will see how you behave.

279
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,000
Or else…

280
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,600
I was just too concerned yesterday at that moment.

281
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,700
It was all because I care about you, you know?

282
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,400
Do you really need to say so?

283
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,700
I mean, or else,

284
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,800
we can only continue to be friends then.

285
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,000
Or else…

286
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,100
Do you mean,

287
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,200
if I behave well enough,

288
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,500
we can go a step closer?

289
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,400
That's great!

290
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,000
I finally see hope!

291
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
How about we go celebrate it tonight?

292
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,200
Moreover, the silver pendant I gave you…

293
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,300
Shouldn't you begin to wear it as well?

294
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,900
I haven't said yes to you yet.

295
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,400
I need to see how you behave.

296
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Besides, I don't have time today.

297
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,900
I'm going to the Commander's office to deliver soup.

298
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,200
Are you giving it to Tan Xuanlin again?

299
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,600
Yes, you should.

300
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,800
He, Commander Tan,

301
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,800
is your young uncle.

302
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,100
You're family.

303
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,800
Taking care of him is also something you should do.

304
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
Go then.

305
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,600
Say hello to Commander Tan for me.

306
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
All right.

307
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,600
When can we go to a Western-style restaurant then?

308
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,600
If you behave, I'll treat you.

309
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,900
Drive safely.

310
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,760
<i>[Defense Command of Shanghai]</i>

311
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,900
Mr. Joseph called

312
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,000
and said he has booked a private room at the Licha Hotel.

313
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,900
After Xu Bojun was removed from his position,

314
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,600
those foreigners in the Concession have begun showing respect to us.

315
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,800
Even those bosses in Shanghai have started to fawn over us.

316
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,800
That's nothing to be proud of. They are just fence-sitters.

317
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,500
- Young Uncle.
- Why did you come?

318
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,100
Where are you going? Has your head stopped hurting?

319
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,400
It doesn't hurt anymore.

320
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,300
I'm going to the Concession to talk with a foreigner.

321
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,400
I made soup for you.

322
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,900
Just leave it here. I'll have it when I come back.

323
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,800
Are you going to see that Anton Fay again?

324
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,000
It's not Anton Fay this time.

325
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,700
It's the Jewish businessman, Joseph.

326
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
I know Joseph.

327
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,500
My upcoming movie "Dreamer in the Spring Boudoir" was also part of his investment.

328
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,800
How about I go there with you?

329
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,100
Don't you hate business talk with foreigners?

330
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,300
But I have you this time, don't I? They can't take advantage of me.

331

This has nothing to do with you.

Don't involve yourself.

334
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,400
How does it have nothing to do with me?

335
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,400
I hope he can invest some money in my next movie, too.

336
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,100
The situation is not stable now.

337
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,200
The boss of our company might take his family to Hong Kong.

338
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,000
He doesn't care much about movies now.

339
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I don't think I can rely on him in the future.

340
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,500
Fine. You can come with me.

341
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,400
If anyone asks, you can just say

342
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,900
I made an appointment for you with Joseph to talk about movie investment.

343
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,900

344

Commander Tan took Miss Gu to the Licha Hotel.

347
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,400
Licha Hotel.

348
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,000
Has he gone there to meet Anton Fay?

349
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,800
I sent someone there to ask.

350
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,500
The room was booked by Joseph.

351
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,300
Joseph?

352
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,200
All of you go out first.

353
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,300
How is it going with Mu Wanqing?

354
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,400
Mu Wanting went to the Mu Mansion to probe about it.

355
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,800
The past few days, Tan Xuanlin did not show up.

356
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,700
Their wedding date has not been decided on either.

357
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,300
And just a few days ago,

358
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,400
on the seventh day after Mu Zhiyuan's death,

359
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Tan Xuanlin, right in front of Mu Wanting,

360
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,000
said they would get married as soon as possible.

361
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,500
This shows that, towards Mu Wanqing, Tan Xuanlin

362
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,600
has begun to express doubt.

363
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600
With Sergey's testimony,

364
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,100
he has to believe it.

365
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,600
Fortunately, you found Sergey one step in advance

366
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,300
and bribed him with a lot of money.

367
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,000
With just a few fabricated words,

368
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,600
we can make Tan Xuanlin and Mu Wanqing enemies.

369
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,000
It's really a great achievement with such little effort.

370
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,300
Sergey and I

371
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,100
fought once a long time ago.

372
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,300
We can be regarded as old enemies.

373
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,000
Back then when we met in Jiangpu,

374
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,600
he recognized me.

375
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,200
If it weren't because I was in a hurry to kill Tan Ziyao,

376
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,100
he would have been a dead man.

377
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,300
Now with his life I spared,

378
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,800
I didn't expect it to be so useful.

379
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,400
But Sergey is very greedy.

380
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm afraid when this is over,

381
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,400
he'll use this to blackmail us.

382
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,100
When this is over,

383
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,200
is his life still necessary for us to spare?

384
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,500
I see.

385
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,800
Oh, yes. Today, Tan Xuanlin

386
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,600
brought Gu Yueshuang with him

387
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,800
to meet with the Jewish businessman, Joseph.

388
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,500
It was said that the meeting was for seeking financial support for her movie.

389
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,600
But I think it was more likely for asking Joseph

390
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,900
to provide a wharf and warehouse to them

391
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,200
for the transit of those weapons.

392
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,100
Very good.

393
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,600
Tan Xuanlin would rather take the risk

394
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
by using a wharf that is part of the Concession,

395
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,300
than let Mu Wanqing get involved.

396
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,600
It looks like

397
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,500
they are together, but in actuality, they separated.

398
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,800
A wharf in the Concession

399
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,700
is not a place where Tan Xuanlin can decide everything himself.

400
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,800
He can't hide everything there.

401
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,200
Bring your men with you and check

402
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,100
the exact time when those weapons will arrive at the wharf,

403
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,700
as well as the location of the warehouse.

404
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,500
Then we can take action.

405
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,000
Yes, sir.

406
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,100
Joseph is also such a cheapskate.

Sports equipment is not a big deal. I can take all of them.

to borrow his wharf and warehouse?

00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,600
lured out so many spies.

487
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,000
How many of our men have been caught?

488
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:10,100
Almost all of those we sent to watch Tan Xuanlin were caught.

489
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,900
None of them are important.

490
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,800
If this can make them relax their guard,

491
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,100
it will be worth it.

492
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,100
Tan Xuanlin made this deliberate movement

493
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,000
to try to get us in the trap.

494
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,200
But he never expected that

495
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,500
you had already considered his move.

496
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,100
When I fought my first battles,

497
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,200
he was only a baby in his diaper.

498
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,600
Fighting with me…

499
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,000
He's a little too young.

500
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,200
Miss Gu.

501
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,700
- Miss Gu.
- What's going on here?

502
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,100
The boss and his whole family ran away.

503
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
And all the money in the company account is gone as well.

504
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,800
All the debt collectors are here now,

505
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,600
and we haven't gotten our payment for the movie either.

506
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,400
What did you say? How can it be like this?

507
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,490
I have a share in this company, too.

508
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,900
How could he just leave without saying anything?

509
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,600
- She's over there.
- Miss Gu! Let's go, let's go.

510
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,100
Miss Gu.

511
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,100
- The boss of Dahua Film Company owes us money for several movies.
- That's right.

512
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,400
He ran away, but you are a shareholder.

513
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,900
Your boss borrowed some money from me the other day.

514
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,700
He hasn't paid me back yet. He said he needed it for the turnover.

515
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,200
He ran away so you should be the one who pays them back then.

516
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,300
Sirs, please. I'm only a shareholder in name.

517
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,900
I've never been involved in running the company.

518
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,300
All the debts have nothing to do with me either.

519
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,100
Just like you, I'm also a victim.

520
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,400
I also have not been paid my salary.

521
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Miss Gu,

522
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,000
you can't talk like this.

523
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,800
You are the symbol of the Dahua Film Company.

524
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,100
Just because of you,

525
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,200
although we haven't gotten any payment,

526
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,700
- we still played your movies.
- <i>That's right.</i>

527
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,100
- How can you say that this has nothing to do with you?
- <i>That's right.</i>

528
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,200
- I…
- Now you can't just pretend you don't know us anymore.

529
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,100
<i>Yes, that's right. You can't just deny these debts.</i>

530
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,300
Everyone, please calm down.

531
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,000
<i>How can we calm down? Pay back our money right now!</i>

532
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,500
<i>Pay back our money right now!</i>

533
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,800
Please calm down.

534
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,020
- If she won't pay back the money today...
- What are you going to do?

535
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,100
Everyone, every cinema,

536
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
will boycott showing your movie!

537
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,400
Why would you take down my movie?

538
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,000
Aren't you being unreasonable?

539
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,300
The money you owe us you must pay back!

540
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,000
<i>Pay us back!</i>

541
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,200
Hello? Please call the Commander's office for me.

542
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,600
<i>Pay us back today! Pay us back!</i>

543
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,600
The ship will arrive in Shanghai at 12:00 noon the day after tomorrow.

544
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,700
Have you settled everything?

545
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,000
Which wharf shall we use to dock the ship?

546
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,300
From a security point of view,

547
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,300
your militia is stationed at the Mu Wharf.

548
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,400
It will definitely be safe there.

549
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,400
No, we can't use the Mu Wharf.

550
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,800
Since it's a British cargo ship,

551
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,100
we'll use the Bund then.

552
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,800
The Bund belongs to the Concession.

553
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,000
Your soldiers can't get in there.

554
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,400
Is it safe?

555
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,200
Joseph is the most important businessman in the Far East,

556
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,400
and he has more than a dozen berths at the Bund.

557
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,300
And last time,

558
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,600
he was involved in the assassination during the celebration feast.

559
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,900
I sent soldiers from my militia to protect him.

560
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,400
He should be able to do me this favor.

561
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,600
I understand what you're thinking.

562
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
But now, all of Shanghai believes

563
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,100
you're going to marry Miss Mu.

564
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,000
If you don't use the Mu Wharf,

565
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,300
it will inevitably cause suspicion.

566
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,700
Joseph has agreed to lend the wharf to me.

567
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,200
I have my arrangements.

568
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,600
But…

569
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,500
- Hello?
- <i>Commander, Miss Gu is in trouble.</i>

570
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,800
- I'm telling you. Pay the money back.
<i>- Pay the money back now!</i>

571
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,600
I'll say it again, this has nothing to do with me.

572
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Are you trying to deny the debt?

573
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Don't think being a superstar is a big deal.

574
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,700
After all, you're just a mere actress.

575
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,600
Don't regard yourself as a madam!

576
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,800
An actress can be related to Commander Tan?!

577
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,000
Isn't it because of that unspoken relationship between a man and a woman?

578
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,200
Yes, indeed.

579
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,200
<i>How can you be short of money?</i>

580
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,800
I'd like to see who dares to be the bully here.

581
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,900
In Shanghai, all of you have decent social positions.

582
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,300
Why are you acting tough on a powerless girl?

583
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,000
- Aren't you all ashamed?
- Commander Tan.

584
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,200
What about the money the Dahua Film Company owes us?

585
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,700
As a cinema owner, we have our staff to pay.

586
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,900
We also need money for our meals, too.

587
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,900
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

588
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,700
The Dahua Film Company owes us money, and the boss ran away.

589
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,100
She is the shareholder of the company.

590
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,800
- If we don't come to her, who can we come to?
- That's right.

591
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,700
Anyway, if she can't settle the account with us today,

592
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,600
we're not going to play her new movie.

593
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,800
<i>- That's right.</i>
- All right.

594
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,700
<i>- We have to get the money back today.
- They have to pay back.</i>

595
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,400
You just need the money, right?

596
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,100
As long as your debts are paid,

597
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,600
there will be no more problem, is that right?

598
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,400
I, Tan Xuanlin,

599
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,100
in the name of being Commander of Shanghai,

600
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
guarantee that

601
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,900
the money the Dahua Film Company owes you

602
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,700
will be paid by the Mu Chamber of Commerce.

603
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,600
But you have to agree on one term with me.

604
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,100
You must show her movie.

605
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Well, can we trust your word, Commander Tan?

606
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,200
If you don't believe it,

607
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,300
you can go to the Mu Chamber of Commerce to verify it.

608
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Commander Tan.

609
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,300
What's going on?

610
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,400
Xuan Lin.

611
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,300
This is…

612
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,400
I'm here to tell you one thing.

613
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,800
The boss of the Dahua Film Company ran away,

614
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,000
and he owes some money to all the cinemas.

615
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Shuang'er's new movie is also going to be released.

616
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
All the money must be paid off.

617
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,300
I've brought all of them here.

618
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,000
You can settle it.

619
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,000
What shall I settle?

620
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,800
This thing doesn't seem to have anything to do with the Mu Chamber of Commerce.

621
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,400
Yes.

622
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,800
Earlier, it had nothing to do with you.

623
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,900
But I promised all the bosses here that

624
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,600
the money owed by the Dahua Film Company

625
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,200
would be paid by the Mu Chamber of Commerce.

626
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,000
Why?

627
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,600
No need to ask why.

628
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,500
I'm here just to inform you about this.

629
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,500
Even if we have money, we can't spend it like this.

630
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,700
I'm asking why I should pay the money back.

631
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,600
Because Shuang'er's new movie will be released soon.

632
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,100
They won't show it if the money is not paid back.

633
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,100
Do you understand?

634
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,500
I'm not saying I won't support Miss Gu's movie.

635
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,900
But this matter is really not as simple as you think.

636
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,700
I don't care about anything else.

637
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,200
I'm just asking if you can do it soon.

638
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,500
If I pay this time, have you ever thought about

639
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,900
the other debts of the Dahua Film Company?

640
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,200
Should all their staff come to me?

641
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,700
Will all the debt collectors come to me as well?

642
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,400
I really can't set an example like this.

643
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,100
I get it.

644
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,400
In the Mu family,

645
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,800
my words mean nothing. Am I right?

646
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,900
Can you be reasonable?

647
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,700
Reasonable?

648
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,200
Being the Commander of all Shanghai,

649
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,700
can't I make a decision for the Mu family?

650
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,200
Do you really think I rely on you for a living?
