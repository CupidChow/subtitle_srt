Commander Tan, what do you want to do?

16
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,460
If I hadn't sent someone to keep an eye on you, you would have drowned by now.

17
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:19,220
Don't you want to know who did this to you?

18
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,691
Come with me. Let's go meet someone.

19
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:29,375
You should meet him.

20
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,812
Close the door.

00:02:39,946 --> 00:02:41,401
Thank you.

25
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,676

- Newspapers!

Newspapers!

Newspapers, selling newspapers!

29
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:23,716
Are you trying to starve to death?

30
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,080
I'm dying for food though.

31
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,070
Such great devotion.

32
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,086
You're willing to give your life for your daughter's future.

33
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:43,869
It's just that Cui Lianfeng committed suicide.

34
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:48,285
Your precious daughter, who has little skill but a big temper,

35
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:50,913
was kicked out of the Mu Mansion by Mr. Mu.

36
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,716
Why? You don't believe me?

37
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,694
By now,

38
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:06,933
Mu Wanting should be on a steamer going from Shanghai to Hong Kong.

39
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:10,890
But when she was getting on board the ship, she was deliberately pushed into the sea.

40
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,976
In your opinion, who would do this?

41
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,390
How is Wanting?

42
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,169
Don't worry. Calm down. She's pretty lucky.

43
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,099
She was saved by my brothers in the militia.

44
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:31,650
The Mu Family also announced that Cui Lianfeng died of a sudden illness.

45
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,020
As for Mu Wanting's family background, they did not mention it.

46
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,949
Aside from the Mu Family, only Xu Bojun and I,

47
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,010
who participated in the trial, know about this.

48
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:45,469
Who do you think would attack a girl who was already in trouble?

49
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,640
Xu Bojun.

50
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,620
He promised that he would let Wanting marry into the military governor's mansion.

51
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,620
That he would personally see to the proposal, too.

52
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,885
That's true. That's because back then, Mu Wanting's identity was not exposed yet.

53
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,270
Xu Bojun needed the support of the Mu family to deal with the Revolutionary Army.

54
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,570
He would have proposed to the Mu family, with or without you.

55
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,750
But the situation has changed, and now,

56
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,660
Mu Wanting's true identity has become a huge problem.

57
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,186
If someone follows the clues and discovers the truth,

58
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:39,316
to him, that would be a huge threat.

59
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,716
So, he'll surely get rid of her before it's too late.

60
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,320
He fooled me.

61
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:52,279
You should have known that he was like this ten years ago.

62
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,223
He fooled Mu Zhiyuan, and he fooled Governor Luo.

63
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,963
Do you honestly think that you, a gang leader, would matter to him?

64
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,860
Okay.

65
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,339
Mu Wanting was frightened when she fell into the water.

66
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:20,253
I've asked a female in the army to change her into dry clothes.

67
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:21,813
Besides, I can promise you this.

68
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:25,954
As long as you tell me the truth of Mu Yuanheng's death,

69
00:06:25,954 --> 00:06:30,370
Mu Wanting will be sent to Hong Kong safely.

70
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,020
I can agree to your request.

71
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,710
But I have one demand.

72
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,447
I want to see Wanting.

73
00:06:56,186 --> 00:06:58,066
I need to see her.

74
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,257
As you wish.

75
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:02,161
Thank you.

76
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,470
Thank you.

77
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:24,310
Wanqing, Hongshen and Shaojun asked me to play pool later.

78
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,890
Do you want to come along with us?

79
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,566
A lot has happened in your family during this time.

80
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:31,243
You can come with us and relax.

81
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,740
I don't know how to play pool, so I'll pass.

82
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,430
The Command center still has some documents that need to be reviewed. I'll go there.

83
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,011
Okay. Take care of yourself.

84
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:41,536
Go home early and take some rest.

85
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:43,494
I'll get going.

86
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:34,662
Commander Tan, can you leave me alone with Wanting for a while?

87
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,494
Wanting,

88
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:08,303
I heard

89
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,230
that Commander Tan will send you to Hong Kong.

90
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,250
It will be your first time there.

91
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,960
You'll be a stranger to the area.

92
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,940
You must stay safe.

93
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,332
Oh right.

94
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,439
I have some friends there.

95
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,410
I wrote them a letter.

96
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,067
You can go to them. They'll take care of you.

97
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:43,129
There's no need.

98
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:47,769
I have no interest in getting help from your gang.

99
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,862
Wanting,

100
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,940
do you still blame me?

101
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,620
Blame you?

102
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,246
I don't blame you. I hate you.

103
00:10:10,246 --> 00:10:11,926
Why did you suddenly show up?

104
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:14,960
Why did you get my mother killed? Why did you take everything from me?

105
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,586
I might as well go drown. At least the troubles will all end!

106
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,480
How dare you hit me! Who are you to hit me?

107
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,636
You have to stay alive!

108
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:31,533
Yes, I shouldn't have hit you.

109
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:35,790
This slap was for your mother.

110
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,550
You could care less about my life but not your mother's life!

111
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,810
She sacrificed her life to give you a chance to live!

112
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:50,342
Then...

113
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:00,046
Then what do I do?

114
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:03,200
I've lost everything

115
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:06,872
because of you.

116
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:18,985
Wanting.

117
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,661
Wanting. I know...

118
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:31,213
I'm not a good father.

119
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,960
But I'm able to see you today.

120
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:38,006
I just wanted to tell you that

121
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:43,373
everything in my life, everything that I did

122
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:46,866
was for you. For you.

123
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,115
Did you know?

124
00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:51,676
I respected Governor Xu,

125
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,690
and I did so many bad things for him.

126
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,520
All because I wanted you to live a good life.

127
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,430
I wanted you to marry into the governor's mansion.

128
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:06,503
But now,

129
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,650
it's all meaningless.

130
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:21,456
I know that nothing I can say

131
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:24,200
can change things.

132
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,420
Wanting, all I wish for

133
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,260
is for you to live well.

134
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,150
For your mother.

135
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,532
For me.

136
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:38,840
You must live on.

137
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,930
Don't worry.

138
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,540
I'll live well.

139
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:48,917
Only by living

140
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:52,440
can I regain everything that belongs to me.

141
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,112
Yes.

142
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,409
Wanting. Stand up.

143
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:01,836
Come on, get up.

144
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:04,559
The floor is cold. Stand up.

145
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,046
Wanting,

146
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,300
you may be leaving soon.

147
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,620
Can you...

148
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,300
Can you call me father?

149
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,055
No,

150
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,650
you don't deserve to be my father.

151
00:13:42,143 --> 00:13:44,263
Wanting!

152
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,480
Such loyalty

153
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,040
but entrusted to the wrong people.

154
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,576
Do you regret it?

155
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,350
Is this how life is?

156
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,550
Living in this world,

157
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:29,619
you pay the price if you choose to bet.

158
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:32,596
At least you're not dead yet.

159
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:34,810
You should consider yourself lucky.

160
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,325
All of this,

161
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,860
I admit it.

162
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:46,906
You still have a chance to fight back.

163
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,443
Tell me!

164
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:51,836
Do you promise to send

165
00:14:51,836 --> 00:14:53,455
Wanting to Hong Kong?

166
00:14:53,455 --> 00:14:55,421
I am a man of my word.

167
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:58,172
Okay.

168
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:03,732
What you want...

169
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:05,896
is in the United Overseas Bank.

170
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,600
Safe 57.

171
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,720
<i>[United Overseas Bank]</i>

172
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,569
Commander Tan, this is what you want.

173
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,360
<i>[The Supervisor's Office]</i>

174
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,300
<i>[The Commander's Office]</i>

175
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,286
Wanqing,

176
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:05,850
it's late. What are you still doing here?

177
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,240
What have you been doing this afternoon?

178
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,697
I…

179
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:16,652
What's wrong?

180
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:19,776
I saw Mu Wanting in your car this afternoon.

181
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,940
You said before that there was something important

182
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,850
so you couldn't tell me.

183
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,230
It can't be related to her, right?

184
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:35,246
You're not hiding a mistress, are you?

185
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,450
What are you laughing at?

186
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,349
I'm not stupid.

187
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:46,890
If I'm going to hide anyone, it definitely wouldn't be her.

188
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,689
Who else do you want to hide?

189
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:51,132
No one.

190
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,897
Use your brain.

191
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:55,537
I already have you. How could I fall for another woman?

192
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:57,530
What are you jealous of?

193
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,826
I'm a woman. It's natural to be jealous.

194
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:02,553
At least tell me

195
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:05,210
if there's something you're hiding from me.

196
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:14,293
Is everything okay?

197
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,000
Come.

198
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,796
I plan on waiting

199
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:38,433
until things are more certain.

200
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,500
But now that you saw it,

201
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,029
if I don't tell you,

202
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,933
you might get paranoid.

203
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:46,962
What happened?

204
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,020
Your brother was murdered

205
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,805
by someone else.

206
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,166
Ten years ago,

207
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:06,176
Xu Bojun and Governor Luo were competing for control of Shanghai.

208
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,780
Governor Luo's equipment was robbed

209
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,850
so he wanted to retreat to the Mu Wharf to deliver ammunition.

210
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,526
But the Mu family has always been friendly with Xu Bojun,

211
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:19,396
so they refused to lend him the dock.

212
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:25,190
Governor Luo sent someone to pose as a kidnapper.

213
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,783
They kidnapped Mu Yuanheng

214
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:30,940
and locked him up in a warehouse at the dock.

215
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,196
Governor Luo sent troops to occupy the Wharf
<i>[Warehouse]</i>

216
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,690
in order to rescue the young master.

217
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,406
At that time, Mu Zhiyuan was out of town.

218
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:44,190
Ms. Xiao was eager to save her son so she agreed to his demand.

219
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,940
<i>[Mu Wharf]</i>
He used it to transport ammunitions.

220
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,270
<i>Enclose the entire dock.</i>

221
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,760
That's when

222
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,340
Cui Lianfeng came to me.

223
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,580
She said she was pregnant with my child.

224
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,100
If I helped to kill Young Master Mu,

225
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,050
Mu Wanting could return to the Mu family.

226
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,966
If she gave birth to a boy,

227
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:18,036
he would become the sole heir to the Mu family's property.

228
00:19:18,036 --> 00:19:19,620
At the time, although I agreed,

229
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,290
I was really hesitant.

230
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,270
<i>[No Open Flames]</i>

231
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,746
Who knew before I made the move,

232
00:19:34,746 --> 00:19:36,850
Xu Bojun started bombing

233
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,430
the dock with artillery.

234
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,476
Then, the dock where Young Master Mu was hidden was blown to pieces.

235
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,870
Young Master Mu died on the spot.

236
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,710
Xu Bojun's assistant, Xu Yuan, came to me.

237
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:24,608
He said after this battle, Governor Luo had lost his forces.

238
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,790
<i>[No Open Flames]</i>

239
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,160
<i>Governor Luo's situation is hopeless.</i>

240
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,480
<i>As long as you insist that Mu Yuanheng's death</i>

241
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,817
<i>was caused by Governor Luo,</i>

242
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,790
<i>our Governor Xu will ensure your prosperity.</i>

243
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,450
<i>You have to think it through.</i>

244
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,790
I was out of my mind

245
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,396
and there was no other way, so I agreed to his demand.

246
00:20:58,396 --> 00:21:00,550
At Xu Bojun's command,

247
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,810
I entered the bombed-out warehouse during the chaos

248
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,040
and found Mu Yuanheng's body.

249
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:13,230
Then, I shot his chest twice

250
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,350
and I adjusted his watch by two hours.

251
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:40,009
Governor Luo...

252
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,780
retreated after the defeat.

253
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,895
Xu Bojun had finally taken over Shanghai.

254
00:21:45,895 --> 00:21:50,389
The two parties were tangled up in court over the death of Young Master Mu.

255
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:53,826
Young Master Mu's body was blown up beyond recognition,

256
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:56,446
and there were no witnesses.

257
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:58,770
The case was closed.

258
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:03,500
Then, the Capital Police Department found the two bullet holes in Young Master Mu's body.

259
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,890
The forensic identification showed

260
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,000
that the time of death was 1:00 p.m.

261
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,080
Young Master Mu's watch stopped at 3:00 p.m because of the bombing.

262
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,113
<i>[Investigation Report from Mu Yuanheng's Autopsy]</i>

263
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:15,997
Therefore, the Police Department decided
<i>[The Time of Death is around 1:00 p.m.]</i>

264
00:22:15,997 --> 00:22:19,720
the bombing happened two hours after Young Master Mu's death.

265
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,810
In the end, the case was adjudicated as Governor Luo killed the hostage

266
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,540
before Xu Bojun bombed up the dock.

267
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,910
Governor Luo's murder charge was implemented

268
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,570
because of the killing of a hostage.

269
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,286
He lost all his titles in the Beijing government.

270
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:37,280
And his official position

271
00:22:38,586 --> 00:22:40,916
was replaced by Xu Bojun.

272
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,389
Xu Bojun knew

273
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:46,246
that if your mother helped Governor Luo ship in ammunition,

274
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:49,562
the outcome would be uncertain.

275
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,603
Winner-take-all, in a slip of thought.

276
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:57,480
So he seized the opportunity when Governor Luo was running out of ammunition

277
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,490
and chose to give up your brother's life.

278
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,957
Wanqing,

279
00:23:03,526 --> 00:23:05,966
I have another piece of evidence here,

280
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:08,120
but we won't see it today.

281
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:11,930
Show me.

282
00:23:12,493 --> 00:23:15,373
I want to see all the evidence about my brother's death.

283
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,317
The film you are seeing was left

284
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:21,450
by a foreign reporter when he was filming the Huangpu River

285
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,370
opposite the warehouse.

286
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,226
He happened to record the scene when Xu Bojun bombed the warehouse.

287
00:23:27,226 --> 00:23:29,010
I was afraid of issues

288
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,922
at that time, so I bought this film.

289
00:23:31,922 --> 00:23:35,753
This allowed me to inadvertently save an important piece of evidence.

290
00:23:35,753 --> 00:23:39,638
Mu Yuanheng's time of death was around 1:00 p.m.

291
00:23:39,638 --> 00:23:43,076
But his watch stopped at 3:00 p.m.

292
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:44,900
It was adjusted by two hours by me.

293
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,763
Based on that, the court decided

294
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:53,140
that Mu Yuanheng was killed before Xu Bojun attacked the dock.

295
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,096
But this film happened

296
00:23:56,096 --> 00:23:58,946
to record when Xu Bojun attacked the warehouse.

297
00:23:58,946 --> 00:24:02,410
The Japanese tourist boat Shandong Maru just arrived at the dock.

298
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,650
I've looked into it.

299
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,000
The Shandong Maru had a fixed route from Qingdao to Shanghai

300
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,090
that hasn't changed for over ten years.

301
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,517
It arrives in Shanghai at around 1:00 p.m.

302
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:15,970
This can fully prove that Xu Bojun

303
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,210
was bombing the warehouse

304
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,160
when Mu Yuanheng died.

305
00:24:29,826 --> 00:24:35,710
You kept this film in the safe of the concession bank for ten years.

306
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,530
So you knew how important it was.

307
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,700
Why would you rather die

308
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,290
than take this out to threaten Xu Bojun to save your own life?

309
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:47,260
That leads to what I want to tell you.

310
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,100
Do you think that you can take down

311
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,340
Xu Bojun with this evidence?

312
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,681
I'm telling you.

313
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:57,990
As a mere Commander of Shanghai, you cannot.

314
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,090
What if I say I can do it?

315
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,140
Do you dare to testify against Xu Bojun?

316
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,160
Xuanlin.

317
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,130
It's fine.

318
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,479
What's the hesitation?

319
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,780
Xu Bojun doesn't know that Mu Wanting isn't dead yet.

320
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,710
As long as Xu Bojun is in power,

321
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,653
Mu Wanting can only drift around.

322
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,890
If we take down Xu Bojun,

323
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,850
this will be my territory.

324
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,620
Then Mu Wanting may still come back.

325
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,216
Don't you want to see her again?

326
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,423
Okay,

327
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:58,047
I can promise you that.

328
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:04,766
I have already died once anyway.

329
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,310
I'll testify in court.

330
00:26:37,682 --> 00:26:39,252
For the past ten years,

331
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:42,400
he had my brother's blood on his hands.

332
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:46,589
How could he be friends with my father?

333
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:01,628
Wanqing,

334
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:05,297
in Xu Bojun's eyes,

335
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,150
everyone is a pawn who can be used.

336
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,703
He befriended your father only because

337
00:27:10,703 --> 00:27:13,536
he was greedy for the Mu family's finances.

338
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,330
He's just a bastard.

339
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,310
I know this incident has had a great impact on you,

340
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,190
so I've been hesitant in telling you.

341
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,194
Thank you.

342
00:27:28,194 --> 00:27:32,169
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have even known the truth.

343
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,051
Silly,

344
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:40,612
not only will I let you know the truth.

345
00:27:40,612 --> 00:27:42,880
I will seek justice for you as well.

346
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,000
But he's Xu Bojun.

347
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,470
You are hitting a rock with an egg.

348
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:54,813
Which of my battles was not a close victory?

349
00:27:54,813 --> 00:27:58,380
We're not sure who will win or lose this time, right?

350
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:03,319
But if you're so sure,

351
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:06,526
why don't you tell him about our relationship?

352
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:09,373
I'm afraid that Xu Bojun will get suspicious.

353
00:28:09,373 --> 00:28:11,802
You're even more afraid about being unable to beat Xu Bojun.

354
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:15,603
It'll implicate me and the Mu family.

355
00:28:15,603 --> 00:28:19,520
If you win, you will formally propose to my family.

356
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,294
If you lose,

357
00:28:21,294 --> 00:28:24,530
you will bear the burden alone and let me get away in one piece.

358
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,455
Wanqing,

359
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:34,426
there will be a war between me and him.

360
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:36,353
So even without your brother's incident,

361
00:28:36,353 --> 00:28:38,760
none of us will be able to get out unscathed.

362
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,810
So whether I conspire against him or not,

363
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,110
he's going to come after me sooner or later.

364
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,680
So when you said "forever,"

365
00:28:49,473 --> 00:28:52,263
you were talking about if you win.

366
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,640
If you lose, then it'll be all over.

367
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,287
Right?

368
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,275
I...

369
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,270
If this battle is going to cost your life,

370
00:29:16,993 --> 00:29:19,193
I'd rather not want it.

371
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,762
Silly,

372
00:29:31,913 --> 00:29:33,669
don't worry.

373
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:35,900
I'll definitely take down Xu Bojun.

374
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:42,166
I'll propose marriage to the Mu family.

375
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:45,440
We promised for "forever." That's not a day less.

376
00:29:58,783 --> 00:30:00,546
Cheers.

377
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:08,136
I'm not surprised that Hongchen asked me out to play pool.

378
00:30:08,136 --> 00:30:10,980
But Shaojun, you've never been a fan of this.

379
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,322
This time, why did you follow him here?

380
00:30:13,322 --> 00:30:16,723
Beijing was in turmoil when you were in the hospital.

381
00:30:16,723 --> 00:30:20,330
Originally, our fathers had agreed to establish the United Five Provinces Army.

382
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,522
But...

383
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:24,402
Uncle Xu won't let go of the Mu family's military salary.

384
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:27,880
The United Five Provinces Army is seemingly in harmony now.

385
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,510
The Revolutionary Army is about to cross the Yangtze River.

386
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,906
We're still not united.

387
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:37,462
Do you want me to persuade my father?

388
00:30:38,108 --> 00:30:39,788
Can you?

389
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,210
Are you sure you can't persuade your old man as well?

390
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,716
Never mind. Today,

391
00:30:57,716 --> 00:31:00,183
we won't talk about politics.

392
00:31:00,183 --> 00:31:01,626
I asked you guys out

393
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,290
to celebrate your discharge.

394
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,630
Let those old men worry about the military salary.

395
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,017
Cheers.

396
00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:36,826
Wanqing!

397
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,735
You're back.

398
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:49,212
What happened to you?

399
00:31:49,212 --> 00:31:52,289
I'm fine. I'm a little tired today.

400
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:56,742
You came back so late. I was a little worried.

401
00:31:56,742 --> 00:31:58,597
I will accompany you if you need to work overtime.

402
00:31:58,597 --> 00:32:00,208
There's no need.

403
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,060
You don't have to wait for me to go to work tomorrow morning.

404
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,158
I'll go by myself.

405
00:32:04,158 --> 00:32:06,163
I'm going upstairs to sleep now.

406
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,806
<i>Brother Guangyao, please forgive me.</i>

407
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:42,720
<i> I really don't know how to face you.</i>

408
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,936
Newspapers, selling newspapers!

409
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,076
<i>[Commercial Press Services Ltd.]</i>
Newspapers!

410
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:55,370
<i>[Municipal Council of the Concession] </i>
Newspapers, selling newspapers!

411
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,060
My Lord.

412
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,680
Has Fu Sheng's ship arrived yet?

413
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,217
No, their berth was canceled, too.

414
00:33:11,217 --> 00:33:13,140
I just called to ask.

415
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,690
The owner of Fu Sheng told me that someone

416
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,606
is willing to supply them at 70% of our price.

417
00:33:18,606 --> 00:33:22,529
So that's why they canceled their order.

418
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:29,040
And at noon, two of our mills went to pick up cotton from the suppliers.

419
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,046
But they were told that the cotton had already been bought at a high price.

420
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:35,630
The buyer offered them 30% more than we did.

421
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,156
Now, unless we also raise the purchase price,

422
00:33:38,156 --> 00:33:41,450
those suppliers would rather pay us liquidated damages

423
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,310
than sell us the supplies.

424
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,520
Buy high, sell low.

425
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,380
Who would conduct business this way?

426
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,929
My Lord, I heard that it was arranged by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce.

427
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:57,040
The Japanese Chamber of Commerce?

428
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,256
Aren't the Japanese doing business in Qingdao? They came to Shanghai as well?

429
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:03,640
They want to do business in Shanghai, but they haven't even notified us.

430
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,280
And they're buying high and selling low. Aren't they breaking the rules?

431
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,660
I'm afraid they're not just breaking the rules.

432
00:34:15,072 --> 00:34:19,982
They want to take all the profit and destroy their opponents.

433
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,760
Father.

434
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,054
Wanqing.

435
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:51,063
I heard from the steward.

436
00:34:51,063 --> 00:34:54,110
I have an idea that I think we can try.

437
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,572
Okay. Tell me about your idea.

438
00:34:56,572 --> 00:35:00,360
The Japanese want to steal our business by buying high and selling low.

439
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,272
In my opinion, why not give up the cotton trade

440
00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:05,612
and give them everything?

441
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:11,030
Do you mean, retreat in order to advance?

442
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:14,089
Yes. If we give up the cotton trade,

443
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:17,720
then our customers will naturally look for the cheapest cotton.

444
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,330
If they all buy yarn from the Japanese,

445
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,616
then how much longer can they keep playing this trick of buying high and selling low?

446
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:27,400
Even if it's a mountain of gold, it'll be all spent.

447
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,900
The problem is that our factories will have to shut down.

448
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,190
The loss due to a shutdown is going to be huge.

449
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,800
We don't have to shut down,

450
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,100
We'll just stockpile the cotton that we produced.

451
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,830
When their money runs out and can't supply the cotton,

452
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,580
we'll take over the market immediately. We'll turn the tables.

453
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,030
Good thinking.

454
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:52,760
The only risk is that we don't know how long the Japanese can hold on.

455
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,690
I believe they won't last long. If they burn their money to occupy the market like this,

456
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:01,430
they'll certainly save all the internal expenses, which means deducting workers' wages.

457
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:06,220
In Tianjin, this happened before, and the workers went on strike.

458
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,389
Tianjin is a Japanese concession, so the Japanese army had put them down.

459
00:36:10,389 --> 00:36:12,470
But it's different in Shanghai.

460
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,731
In Shanghai, there is nothing they can do.

461
00:36:19,453 --> 00:36:22,140
Wanqing, I never expected

462
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,356
you to be so gifted in business.

463
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,540
Pay day! Pay day! Come get your paycheck!

464
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,786
We all get it! Stop grabbing!

465
00:36:40,786 --> 00:36:42,851
We all get paid!

466
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:45,690
- It's not right. Why is it ten short?
- Yeah, yeah.

467
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,036
Why is it twenty? It should be thirty. Why do you only give us twenty?

468
00:36:49,036 --> 00:36:51,050
Steward Liu, how do we have less money?

469
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,236
We agreed that the salary was thirty yuan in the contract.

470
00:36:53,236 --> 00:36:55,000
How can we just get twenty yuan?

471
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,686
Just take it. What's with all this nonsense?

472
00:36:58,686 --> 00:37:02,076
Every yuan has its own use. You gave us ten yuan less.

473
00:37:02,076 --> 00:37:04,496
This ten yuan, are you taking it away from us?

474
00:37:04,496 --> 00:37:07,980
Stop it. If you think the salary is low, you can quit.

475
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,270
Steward Liu, that is not how things work. The salary is as much as we negotiated.

476
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,336
You can't just pay us as much as you want.

477
00:37:14,336 --> 00:37:17,120
Shut up and get back to work! Don't want to get paid?

478
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,660
You have to give us a good explanation.

479
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,076
What do you want? What the hell do you want?

480
00:37:20,076 --> 00:37:23,266
Tell us. Did you take our ten yuan?

481
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,550
How can you hit us?

482
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,260
Why do you hit us?

483
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,430
How dare you hit us!

484
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,100
Murderer!

485
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,436

00:37:51,216 --> 00:37:54,100
<i> Life for life!</i>

489
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,030
<i>Apologize and recompense, life for life!</i>

490
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:06,006
President, the workers have been on strike for three days.

491
00:38:06,006 --> 00:38:08,656
Even the warehouse was locked by the workers.

492
00:38:08,656 --> 00:38:11,586
This business can't be carried out at all.

493
00:38:11,586 --> 00:38:14,276
Previously, due to the shutdown of Mu's cotton mill,

494
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:18,110
we took a lot of orders on short notice so we couldn't deliver them at all.

495
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,829
Now, many buyers are calling us to expedite their purchases.

496
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:25,735
Some buyers want us to compensate for their loss.

497
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,740
The Mu family is retreating

498
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,520
to hurt our business.

499
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,911
President, what should we do now?

500
00:38:43,176 --> 00:38:45,216
Make an appointment with Mu Zhiyuan for me.

501
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:48,336
What he did was force us to give in.

502
00:38:48,336 --> 00:38:53,380
- In that case, I want to see what his terms are.
- Yes.

503
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,440
<i>[Murder at Japanese Invested Cotton Factory. Angry workers Surround the Cotton Exchange]</i>

504
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,626
- Wanqing.
- Father, did you want to see me?

505
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:08,577
Have a seat, Wanqing.

506
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,910
Sit.

507
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,489
Wanqing, you made a wonderful judgment.

508
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:18,620
It seems the Japanese hurt themselves.

509
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,900
<i>[Murder at Japanese Invested Cotton Factory. Angry workers Surround the Cotton Exchange]</i>

510
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,780
They collapsed faster than I thought.

511
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,650
This shows how far their exploitation of workers has gone.

512
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,289
Injustice is doomed to failure.

513
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:35,795
Wanqing, how did you know without even running a business before?

514
00:39:35,795 --> 00:39:38,500
I studied economics in Japan before.

515
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,146
Then I worked as an intern at the futures exchange in Tokyo.

516
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:45,070
I've seen too many situations like seeking quick success.

517
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:49,090
No matter what kind of business, if you forget that the essence of business is to make money

518
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,030
and are unwilling to keep your businesses steady,

519
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,800
then failure is only a matter of time.

520
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,020
You finished your studies when you were only twenty years old.

521
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,470
I enrolled in my university when I was sixteen years old.

522
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:06,929
Wanqing, why didn't you tell me this information?

523
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:12,423
I used to feel that I was living under your roof, so I didn't have the nerve to speak up.

524
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:22,353
Come over, Wanqing. Sit here.

525
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,318
Wanqing, you're my daughter.

526
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:31,673
How could that be considered as living under my roof?

527
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,736
I know,

528
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:37,740
I owe you and your mother so much over these years,

529
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,720
and I don't want to ignore this fact.

530
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,866
My health is getting worse day by day.

531
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:47,560
You're my only family member.

532
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,483
I hope you can run the business for this family.

533
00:40:50,483 --> 00:40:55,083
The future of the Mu family depends on you.

534
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,987
Father, you've worried for most of your life.

535
00:40:59,987 --> 00:41:03,500
It's time for me to share your burden as your daughter.

536
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,440
I know you're a good kid.

537
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,980
But if you're going to help me,

538
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,720
shouldn't we tell this to Guangyao first?

539
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,123
You're Guangyao's personal secretary after all.

540
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:18,806
I think if I'm going to take over the family business,

541
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:21,940
I'd better resign.

542
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,808
Why?

543
00:41:23,808 --> 00:41:26,690
Now, Commander Tan is in charge in Shanghai.

544
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,623
Father, you know as well as me that Governor Xu has always been defensive of Commander Tan.

545
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:33,636
He sent Brother Guangyao to the Command to keep an eye on him.

546
00:41:33,636 --> 00:41:38,410
If I take over the family business, I have to inevitably deal with Commander Tan.

547
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,080
I'm afraid of causing trouble.

548
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,850
In that case, it'll be difficult for you on both sides.

549
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:49,770
So, why don't I resign and stay out of their dispute?

550
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,776
In business, we must be impartial.

551
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,510
That's my good girl.

552
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,410
Even I didn't think of this.

553
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:02,766
I have your blood running in my veins. Of course, I learned it from you.

554
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,582
So, Father, what do you plan to do next?

555
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:12,620
Presumably, Yamashita, the President of Japan's Chamber of Commerce

556
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:16,700
will call my office at the Municipal Council.

557
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,536
I will stay at home to avoid answering his call.

558
00:42:20,536 --> 00:42:23,256
Looks like you have a plan already.

559
00:42:24,353 --> 00:42:28,087
Wanqing, if it's up to you,

560
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,151
what would you do?
