Commander Tan,

30

this office is next to yours.

31

But it's far from mine.

Miss Mu is my secretary.

33
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:48,070
I don't think this is convenient.

34
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,540
Supervisor Xu, the room next to your office is the archives.

35

There were no suitable rooms.

Miss Mu, can you make do with this for now?

38
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,112
- It's not a problem. I can make do.
- I knew it.

39
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,128
Wanting didn't even have an office when she was working here.

40
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:10,853
So I don't want to make it special.

41
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:12,599
I can work in Supervisor Xu's office.

42

It also makes my work much more convenient.

I have told you before. Putting the room here was not an appropriate choice.

She is Supervisor Xu's secretary.

52

You can tell them to take a break. Send them home to rest.

We, the Adjutant Office, are the busiest ones.

Just send them home to get some rest.

My coming to work today was part of your plan, right?

83
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:03,350
So, why did you keep it from me?

84
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,428
Your younger sister gave me free money. Why would I not want it?

85
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:09,628
I am helping you ease the burden, too.

86
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:12,150
You're such a schemer.

87
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,665
You took money from me and my sister.

88
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:15,780
Do you really think our Mu family is your cash cow?

You are the one I carefully selected.

And she can only be considered a complimentary gift.

92
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:26,320
But Miss Wanting gave me fifty thousand silver dollars for a day and I had her switched out.

93
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,821
I treat you quite well.

94
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:30,373
Do you want me to thank you for that?

95
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:33,300
What do you want from me?

96
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,350

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,679
Commander Tan still needs me to translate documents?

99
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,788
The translation office is on leave.

100
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,544
And I need those documents.

Hurry.

102
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,760
You are the private secretary of Xu Guangyao.

103
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,200
As the saying goes, even those servants who work for prime ministers hold some power.

104
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,330
You must be so popular among those who want to

105
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,880
fawn in the military governor's mansion.

106
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,800
Yet you're bossing me around, even though I'm popular.

We're different.

I have to bring in some new blood and greet the local authorities.

00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:19,850
And I have to settle some debt. I need money for these.

111
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,980
But the military governor's mansion didn't give me money.

112
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,550
I'm still worried about money.

113
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,130
You can spend Wanting's money.

114
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,790
She's been so generous to you.

115
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,423
What's the matter?

116
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:34,401
Are you jealous of your sister?

117
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:37,150
Stop being so glib.

00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:45,260
I did not.

122
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,541
I just don't want you to stay at Xu Guangyao's office.

123
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,730
You really are boring.

124

Wait.

125
00:09:58,756 --> 00:10:00,152
This is for you.

126
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:03,974
Didn't you say I cast a curse on it? Just throw it away.

127
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:07,180
It's not a curse. It's a lucky amulet from Fayuan Temple.

128
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,550
The monk told me you had asked for two.

129
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,256
Just one.

130
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:25,960
Who is this for?

131
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:30,557
That's none of your business.

132
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,700
If it were for Xu Guangyao, you would have already given it to him.

133
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,120
Maybe it was for me?

136
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,010
Then, why did you throw it away after fighting with me?

Commander, what's going on with Miss Mu?

140
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,090
Don't you see? She was charmed by my charisma.

141
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,019
She must be shy.

142

164
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:42,738
Wanqing, have you gotten used to your job at the Command?

165
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:46,610
Yes, I am settling in well. Brother Guangyao and Commander Tan both look out for me.

166
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,843
Wanqing, you're a smart girl.

167
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:52,690
The relationship between Guangyao and Commander Tan is very delicate.

168
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,947
Now that you're in the middle of it, you have to be sure to think things through.

169
00:12:57,947 --> 00:13:01,035
I know. We're old family friends with the Xu family.

170
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:03,380
I'll give priority to Brother Guangyao.

171
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:08,850
You weren't sent to the Command just to be Guangyao's little assistant.

172
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,350
So I ask you to think of our family first, no matter what happens.

173
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,480
The military governor's mansion always looks after our family's business.

174
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,197
To think about the Xu family is to help the Mu family. Isn't it?

175
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,300
As good as our relationship is, we are still two different families after all.

176
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,511
Wanqing, why is Commander Tan asking you to raise money?

177
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,220
You're the first daughter of our family.

178
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,220
The most profitable businesses in Shanghai belong to our family.

179
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,480
But you are asking small business owners.

180
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,165
If this was heard by Commander Tan,

181
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:51,030
he'll think that our family is trying to make things difficult for him.

182
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,290
It's my fault. I wasn't thinking things through carefully. I was simply thinking of our relationship with the Xu family.

183
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,763
I wasn't thinking about anything else.

184
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:59,889
I don't blame you.

185
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:01,900
You'll get better with experience.

186
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,148
Then, Father, should I call up the other bosses?

187
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,830
You ask Commander Tan how much he needs.

188
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,170
I'll set up a private account for him.

189
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,000
But don't tell Guangyao about this.

190
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:21,342
Okay. Thank you, Father.

191
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:25,037
<i>Don't worry. You can open an account.</i>

192
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:28,380
<i>My father agreed to give you some money.</i>

193
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:31,265
Okay, I understand.

194
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:36,877
It seems Miss Wanqing has pulled it off.

195
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:40,295
Have I ever misjudged someone?

196
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:44,557
Go and tell everyone in the army that they'll be getting paid tomorrow.

197
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,200
How about me? Do I get paid?

198
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,448
Don't you know the color of your own uniform?

199
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:01,750
You can wait to get paid by the military governor's mansion.

200
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,488
I don't have any money.

201
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,300
So after all of that, I don't get anything.

202
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,920
Suck it up. I'm in the same boat as you.

203
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,830
You're the commander. You're being taken care of.

204
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,890
You don't need any money.

205
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,430
What are you saying?

206
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:27,887
I said I'll serve you even if I don't get paid.

207
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,046
<i>Move this one?</i>

208
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,720
<i>Take it.</i>

209
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:47,940
If I had known I would get paid here, I would have joined the army.

210
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,290
The Command hasn't paid me yet.

211
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,691
We haven't been a legitimate army in years.

212
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:57,411
And we all depend on the commander. But now you're different from us.

213
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,440
You're staff in the Command. You're an adjutant of the king of Shanghai.

214
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,846
We're all envious of you.

215
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:08,956
It doesn't matter who I'm working for or that I'm an adjutant.

216
00:16:08,956 --> 00:16:11,213
The most important thing is that as long as I can work for the commander,

217
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:13,381
I'm content.

218
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,150
Speaking of him, why didn't the commander come today?

219
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,390
He has a date with the god of wealth.

220
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,084
- The god of wealth?
- The god is a woman.

221
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,110
Nice. That was a lot of money.

222
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,430
How did you convince your father?

223
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,026
This money wasn't free.

224
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,103
I have another condition.

225
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:37,918
Tell me.

226
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,820
I've heard that the Japanese Chamber of Commerce had purchased

227
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,974
many Chinese cotton mills in Qingdao and Tianjin.

228
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:48,725
And now they're trying to dump muslin in Shanghai.

229
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:52,150
If they enter the market of Shanghai one day,

230
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,030
I hope you can help the Mu family.

231
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,670
Look at that.

232
00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:00,170
The poor thing has become a boss. You are shrewd now.

233
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,380
You're not going to start your own business

234
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,294
and share your wealth with the Mu family.

235
00:17:04,294 --> 00:17:09,930
If one day your army has to purchase clothes and bandages from the Japanese,

236
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,490
would you still think of me as shrewd?

237
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,250
I was right about you. You're smarter than I thought.

238
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,890
However, you're not as honest as I thought you were.

239
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,219
Don't believe what a man says, but observe what he does.

240
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:40,630
But you can make things clear by just saying things out loud.

241
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,477
Why do you want me to guess?

242
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:44,685
What do you mean?

243
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:47,090
You kept the truth from me and tried to provoke me.

244
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,300
In fact, you're testing me right now.

245
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,357
If I told Brother Guangyao about your deal with Mu Wanting,

246
00:17:52,357 --> 00:17:55,700
you wouldn't trust me anymore. Am I right?

247
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,930
You gave Brother Guangyao movie tickets. It was also a test.

248
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,950
If he found out you received money from the Mu family,

249
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,400
he wouldn't play with you, given who he is.

250
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,220
Just to be sure, you sent the translation staff home

251
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,189
and asked me to help you to translate.

252
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:15,490
If he knew what you were up to,

253
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,200
he would never allow you to get close to me.

254
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,110
You confirmed that I didn't betray you after these two tests.

255
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,130
So you told me that you were worried about money.

256
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:31,620
If I offered to help you raise money, you would trust me for a moment.

257
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,780
If I did not volunteer, you would do it on your own.

258
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,590
On the outside you smile and laugh, acting like you don't care about anything.

259
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,710
In truth, in your heart, you don't trust anyone.

260
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,275
You're not being completely honest with me either. For instance, the lucky amulet...

261
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:50,560
The lucky amulet is…

262
00:19:13,222 --> 00:19:15,322
We're partners.

263
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,834
I pray for you and hope that you are safe.

264
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:20,050
Isn't that expected?

265
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,947
I'm not used to the way you speak.

266
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:37,955
Well, you'd better start getting used to it today.

267
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,600
Don't look at me like that.

268
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,898
I'm not playing any tricks.

269
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,898
I believe you.

270
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,020
<i>[Defense Command of Shanghai]</i>

271
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,260
<i>[The Commander's Office]</i>

272
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,400
Ahem.

273
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,148
Commander Tan.

274
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,754
Good morning, Commander Tan.

275
00:20:30,754 --> 00:20:32,829
Good morning, Supervisor Xu.

276
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,558
You've had a good rest at Mu Mansion these past few days.

277
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,240
You're glowing.

278
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,500
I can have a good rest anywhere.

279
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,351
As for you, you're early today.

280
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:48,380
I didn't sleep well.

281
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,810
I have a lot of problems that need to be solved as a new officer.

282
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,330
And I don't have a personal assistant like Miss Mu.

283
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,240
I have to handle everything on my own. It's so tiring.

284
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:06,454
Commander Tan, it seems to me that you are quite lighthearted.

285
00:21:06,454 --> 00:21:10,040
I still don't see any evidence regarding the settlement plan for the Tan Army.

286
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,982
It seems that doesn't bother you.

287
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,160
Give me a few more days to think about the plan.

288
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,170
And you know that my army is hard to dismiss.

289
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:25,688
They have a lot of opinions about how to settle. That troubles me.

290
00:21:25,688 --> 00:21:29,852
And… this plan is very difficult to pull off.

291
00:21:29,852 --> 00:21:32,824
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been tied down like this for ten years.

292
00:21:33,336 --> 00:21:35,127
Tied down?

293
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,830
It seems to me that you're enjoying it.

294
00:21:39,895 --> 00:21:43,645
Enough of that. I have something else I want to discuss with you today.

295
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:46,630
What is it that Commander Tan needs to speak with me about?

296
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,580
How can I put it…

297
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,300
I'm a newcomer here.

298
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,470
But I know the rules of Shanghai.

299
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,860
It doesn't matter if you have money or power.

300
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,580
You have to greet the local authorities.

301
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,080
You have to pay homage to all local authorities.

302
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,650
Then you'd be able to get established around here. Is that right?

303
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,430
Commander Tan.

304
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:12,085
How will you greet the local authorities?

305
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,300
There is a way.

306
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,331
First of all, I'm the commander now.

307
00:22:17,331 --> 00:22:19,020
If I meet them one by one,

308
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,497
I'll lose face. I'm thinking about

309
00:22:21,497 --> 00:22:24,820
holding a party at the headquarters.

310
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,517
I'll invite all local authorities to gather here and have a party.

311
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:31,321
If something happens later on, we can ask them for help

312
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:33,310
and make things easier.

313
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,737
Commander Tan,

314
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:38,675
you can decide on your own about social engagements.

315
00:22:38,675 --> 00:22:39,903
You don't have to discuss it with me.

316
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:42,908
No. Your reputation is bigger than mine.

317
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:44,954
Besides, we're colleagues now.

318
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:47,199
You have to come to my party.

319
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,894
- I…
- The most important is…

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,400

488
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,000

Please.

510
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,100
You see over there?

511
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,500
Let's go there and have a look.

512
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I did my own makeup today.

513
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,400
If I knew that Mr. Xu would come,

514
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,000
I would have asked a makeup artist to do my makeup.

515
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,800
No matter how good your makeup is,

516
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,000
Brother Guangyao won't look at you at all.

517
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,500
I'm the only fiancée of Brother Guangyao.

518
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,800
I'm the only one in his heart.

519
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,100
Keep your voice down.

520
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,400
Thank you.

521
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,800
What are you doing here alone?

522
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,700
Why don't you go and talk with the other women here?

523
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,300
I don't know them well enough.

524
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,900
And they love to talk about jewelry.

525
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,700
I don't know anything about it.

526
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,700
It's not necessary to talk

527
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,000
if you don't have much to say.

528
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's quite nice to listen to the music.

529
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
Mother, come here.

530
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,500
Look at her!

531
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,200
- Cheers.
- Look at her. She's intent on pissing me off.

532
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,000
Are you out of your mind?

533
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,400
Don't talk nonsense.

534
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,000
Keep calm.

535
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,100
Wanting keeps looking this way.

536
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,800
If she can kill with her eyes,

537
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,900
I would have died 800 times.

538
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,300
You're my secretary.

539
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,700
Of course, I have to stay with you.

540
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,400
You... You can talk to her at least.

541
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,200
Otherwise, she'll hold a grudge.

542
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,600
She's surrounded by women.

543
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,200
It's not appropriate for me to go there.

544
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Why don't you stay with Junior Marshal Pei and Junior Marshal Su?

545
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,400
You stood by me the whole time.

546
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,100
That makes me a public enemy.

547
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,000
A public enemy? Stop exaggerating.

548
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,600
Should I ask them to come here?

549
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,000
Don't.

550
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,100
If all three of you come here and surround me,

551
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,800
the situation will get worse.

552
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,400
You have no idea how scary a woman's jealousy can be.

553
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,800
Why do I feel like you do not get jealous like them?

554
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,600
You're always pushing me away.

555
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,800
You're an elder brother of mine. Why should I be jealous?

556
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,100
I'm not like them.

557
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,900
What are you doing here?

558
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,400
I'm warning you, Mu Wanqing.

559
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,300
You'd better stay away from Brother Guangyao.

560
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,000
You may not need respect, but Guangyao does.

561
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,800
What am I supposed to do to stay away from him?

562
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,800
I'm his secretary. I can't just ignore him.

563
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,000
Don't assume you are something just because you work as a mere secretary for Brother Guangyao.

564
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,900
Those people are nice to you because they're showing respect to him.

565
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,300
If you put it that way,

566
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,000
you couldn't even be a secretary.

567
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
What is up with that?

568
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,900
I suggest you keep your mouth shut

569
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,900
to avoid accidentally cursing yourself.

570
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,500
Mu…

571
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,800
I'm so happy about this.

572
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,000
Give me that.

573
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,300
Young Uncle,

574
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,300
you asked me to keep you company at the party.

575
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,600
Aren't you afraid of gossip?

576
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,000
I wish it were so.

577
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,100
Since I became the commander,

578
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,900
many bigwigs in Shanghai

579
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,800
have asked me to marry their daughters.

580
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,100
I invited you here today to put all of that to rest.

581
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
To turn them away.

582
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,600
Are you saying that

583
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,100
I'm just a puppet for you?

584
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
I didn't mean that.

585
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,600
When I find my footing here and bring stability,

586
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,500
I'll find you a good husband.

587
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,600
I'll hold a perfect wedding for you.

588
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,100
I don't want to get married. I haven't had enough fun yet.

589
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,800
Beautiful.

590
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,400
So beautiful.

591
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,100
It's just that the man next to her really is an eyesore.

592
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,000
Miss Gu and Commander Tan are old friends.

593
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
They were childhood sweethearts.

594
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,200
You wouldn't stand a chance. I'm warning you.

595
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,100
Even childhood sweethearts don't work out sometimes.

596
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,300
Aren't you and Miss Mu also childhood sweethearts?

597
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,600
In the end, you're just brother and sister.

598
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,800
Mind your words.

599
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,700
What do you mean by brother and sister?

600
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,700
Why are you losing your temper?

601
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,300
Fine.

602
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,700
I'm sorry.

603
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,500
What I meant to say is

604
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,780
maybe I still have a chance.

605
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,500
I think you're wasting your breath.

606
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,500
- Mr. Mu.
- That's not true.

607
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,200
Please forgive me for the inconvenience.

608
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,000
Let's go.

609
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,600
Don't forget our business tonight.

610
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,300
I won't.

611
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,800
<i>Miss Gu, nice to finally meet you.</i>

612
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,000
<i>You damn fool!</i>

613
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,100
<i>I can't believe you're trying to flirt with someone.</i>

614
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,300
Miss.

615
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,800
Why is it you again?

616
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,800
Isn't it boring just to drink by yourself?

617
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,600
Let me stay with you.

618
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,700
This wine tastes so good

619
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,600
after toasting with you.

620
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,900
This wine is overly sweet.

621
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,300
It does not suit my taste.

622
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,100
You keep a good distance from me.

623
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,900
It seems that we can't be friends.

624
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,100
How about...

625
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,600
we be lovers instead?

626
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Junior Marshal Su.

627
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,800
Do you know what you need?

628
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,500
What?

629
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,000
A beating.

♫ <i> We went back to when we first met </i> ♫

646
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,300
<i>♫ I immediately saw your charming face♫</i>

647
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,900
♫ <i> To the endless sky and ocean </i> ♫

648
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,300
<i>♫ I made a promise ♫</i>

649

♫ <i> Let’s let the mortals fall down with us </i> ♫

654
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,800
♫ <i> I have exhausted myself in this life </i> ♫

655

♫ <i> My whole life has become lonely </i> ♫

656
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,800
♫ <i> Even if my vision is blurred and I can’t clearly see </i> ♫

657
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,800
♫ <i> I’ll still sing with you on horseback </i> ♫
