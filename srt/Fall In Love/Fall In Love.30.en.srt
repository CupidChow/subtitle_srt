As long as the munitions go ashore, he will be held accountable.

69
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:13,925
It is hard to imagine. Tan Xuanlin and Mu Wanqing used to love each other so much.

Now they had a falling out and are enemies so quickly.

Tan Xuanlin and Gu Yueshuang have always had a suspicious relationship.

00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,755
I just wanted to ask you in person.

162
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:12,576
Why did you withdraw the militia and even the guards at the Mu Family Mansion?

163
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:14,341
Get out.

164
00:13:23,162 --> 00:13:25,842
You have no right to ask about military affairs.

165
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:28,120
No right to ask?

166
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,240
You can withdraw the soldiers at the Mu Family Mansion,

167
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,551
but the militia belongs to the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.

168
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:35,427
It is their duty to protect the wharf.

169
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:38,274
Do you dare to give me a reason?

170
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:40,474
Compared with the Mu family,

171
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,819
I can gain more profit by working with Joseph.

172
00:13:49,314 --> 00:13:52,174
He let me transport goods through his wharf,

173
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:56,600
and I sent my militia to protect Shanghai Bund.

174
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,356
Was that wrong?

175
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:05,599
I don't believe it.

176
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:08,220
You are not a man who forsakes principle for the sake of gold.

177
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:11,617
You don't know me.

178
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:15,373
I can feel just like a fish in the water during these troubled times.

179
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,900
Can a man of moral integrity do that?

180
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,420
If I don't forsake principle for the sake of gold,

181
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,580
I would be dead already.

182
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,887
Xuanlin,

183
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:52,927
it's just us here.

184
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,340
You don't need to pretend.

185
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:58,044
Are you...

186
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,976
keeping things from me?

187
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:03,310
Just tell me.

188
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,448
I will keep your secret.

189
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,480
These days,

190
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,516
I have been thinking about the things happening between us.

191
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:20,240
I just can't figure out

192
00:15:20,907 --> 00:15:25,375
why you are behaving like this. You suddenly changed.

193
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,460
You can just...

194
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,120
see me as an unpredictable asshole.

195
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:36,337
But truly you are not.

196
00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:38,840
Just give me a reason, okay?

197
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,689
I can't stand it anymore.

198
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:54,287
I don't even know

199
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,747
what happened between us.

200
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,840
Yes, you don't know.

201
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,698
I really feel tired.

202
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,809
I don't think I can go on.

203
00:16:39,683 --> 00:16:41,663
Then don't.

204
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:07,504
I will not give up our relationship for no reason.

205
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,384
Fine.

206
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,060
Since you want to know,

207
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,967
I will tell you.

208
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,960
Do you know how my father died?

209
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,047
Ten years ago,

210
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:53,911
my father escorted munitions by way of Jiangpu.

211
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:55,990
He was ambushed by a group of men.

212
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,563
He was completely defeated.

213
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,630
The group used explosive bullets

214
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,240
that could deal serious damage.

215
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,110
This kind of bullet is forbidden in regular armies.

216
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:13,103
My father died...

217
00:18:15,075 --> 00:18:17,815
with half his chest blown open.

218
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:21,543
Who were these men?

219
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:31,465
Ten years ago,

220
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:37,046
your father escorted supplies for Xu Bojun by way of Jiangpu.

221
00:18:38,186 --> 00:18:42,306
He hired a group of men from the Belarusian Foreign Gun Brigade.

222
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:45,574
They used these explosive bullets.

223
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:50,039
The reason for hiring these men

224
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,900
was that they were effective.

225
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,479
I don't believe it.

226
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,200
- You don't?
- It can't be true.

227
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,339
Can't be true?

228
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,420
You should go home and check the photo albums.

229
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,760
You will see the photo of your father and the foreign brigade.

230
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,836
And I also found a member of that brigade.

231
00:19:05,836 --> 00:19:08,947
He told me your father

232
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,580
killed my father.

233
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,399
I can only… only…

234
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:35,572
only try not to hate you.

235
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,700
From now on,

236
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,446
you stay out of my way and I'll stay out of yours.

237
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,076
My Lady, what-what are you doing?

238
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,920
Was this photo...

239
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,411
taken in Jiangpu?

240
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:06,902
Yes.

241
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:10,416
Ten years ago, My Lord escorted goods by way of Jiangpu and took this photo.

242
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:15,200
Why do you ask? You and Commander Tan both seem to be interested in this photo.

243
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,783
- Miss, what's wrong?
- Miss Wanting.

244
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:21,200
Eldest Miss is not available now.

245
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,720
About the Chamber of Commerce, you can talk about it tomorrow.

246
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,060
- What's wrong?
- My Lady.

247
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,980
What happened?

248
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,579
After coming back from the headquarters, My Lady was eager to see the photo albums.

249
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:33,297
- Who knew she would suddenly begin crying while looking at them?
- <i> Please don't frighten me.</i>

250
00:21:33,297 --> 00:21:35,812
We can do nothing about it.

251
00:21:35,812 --> 00:21:39,562
Eldest Miss, please say something.

252
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,820
<i>[Army Headquarters of Beijing]</i>

253
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,480
Father.

254
00:22:04,302 --> 00:22:06,420
Can't you see we are in a meeting?

255
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,040
Get out.

256
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:12,867
Father, I didn't want to disturb your meeting.

257
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:14,940
But I have some new information about the report

258
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,760
regarding Tan Xuanlin aiding the enemy.

259
00:22:16,762 --> 00:22:19,180
I hope you can use it as a reference.

260
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,570
<i>[The Shanghai Concession's Gendarmerie Record of Attendance]</i>
Here are the attendance records

261
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,540
of the Shanghai Concession Gendarmerie that I copied by hand.

262
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,646
It includes one

263
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:33,857
that reports Tan Xuanlin was transporting banned goods.

264
00:22:33,857 --> 00:22:35,434
But it turns out that he was transporting

265
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:37,666
<i>[Investigation Result: Sports Equipment]</i>
normal sports equipment.

266
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,067
So, these reports...

267
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,263
may not be true.

268
00:22:44,207 --> 00:22:45,705
After Xu Bojun fell out of power,

269
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:48,098
Shanghai has been under the control of Tan Xuanlin alone.

270
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:50,654
Commander Tan is so young and in a powerful position.

271
00:22:50,654 --> 00:22:52,535
Of course, it would make others jealous.

272
00:22:52,535 --> 00:22:54,902
Reporting and lodging a false accusation is normal.

273
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:57,360
I see what you mean.

274
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,256
But, look.

275
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,700
This report lists

276
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,377
the time and place of his meeting

277
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:09,064
with the Revolutionary Party in detail,

278
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:11,940
including the number and type of

279
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,504
munitions transported.

280
00:23:14,504 --> 00:23:16,082
If we don't investigate,

281
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:18,637
and it turns out to be true,

282
00:23:18,637 --> 00:23:21,244
we cannot go back and undo everything.

283
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,289
Father,

284
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:25,731
how will the investigation proceed?

285
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:27,891
Staff Officer Zuo.

286
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:29,146
Yes.

287
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:30,686
Go to Shanghai tonight

288
00:23:30,686 --> 00:23:32,760
and ask Anton Fay, the director of the Municipal Council,

289
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,500
to investigate together,

290
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,060
in order to show fairness and justice.

291
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,180
The truth will speak for itself.

292
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,880
If Tan Xuanlin didn't aid the enemy,

293
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,770
we can give him justice.

294
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,383
Yes.

295
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:00,430
<i>[Army Headquarters of Beijing]</i>

296
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,040
Did you show Military Governor Pei the attendance records?

297
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,464
I did.

298
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:08,302
What did he say?

299
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,131
Father said

300
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:11,317
it is better to believe something is real

301
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,069
than to believe it is false.

302
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:15,773
So he sent someone to Shanghai to investigate.

303
00:24:15,773 --> 00:24:17,101
He also said that

304
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:18,684
if this is a false accusation,

305
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:21,357
he will give him justice.

306
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:23,384
That's good to hear.

307
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:26,076
The Marshal ordered Miss Tan to stay here for 24 hours

308
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:28,300
in order to investigate her relationship with Commander Tan.

309
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,660
Miss Tan can leave after the investigation is over.

310
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,127
But…

311
00:24:32,127 --> 00:24:34,081
No need.

312
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:36,320
Please be cooperative, Miss Tan.

313
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,166
It doesn't matter.

314
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,263
Junior Marshal, you should go too.

315
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:55,035
Me?

316
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,462
The Military Governor cares about Miss Tan

317
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:59,733
and has commanded Junior Marshal to keep her company.

318
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:14,975
Junior Marshal Xu, you wanted to see my miss?

319
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:16,230
Where is Miss Wanqing?

320
00:25:17,164 --> 00:25:19,500
After coming back from seeing Commander Tan,

321
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,258
My Lady cried and went outside.

322
00:25:23,258 --> 00:25:24,796
She… She ordered us not to follow her.

323
00:25:24,796 --> 00:25:26,503
What?

324
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,220
Tan Xuanlin truly sees Mu Wanqing

325
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,153
as the daughter of his enemy.

326
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:49,320
Mu Wanqing believes it, too.

327
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,287
This afternoon, she looked at the photo

328
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:53,140
and cried for so long.

329
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,080
As long as they remain separated,

330
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,946
we can defeat them one by one.

331
00:25:57,946 --> 00:25:59,339
At noon tomorrow,

332
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:01,694
when the munitions arrive at the Shanghai Bund,

333
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:04,680
Tan Xuanlin's death will be inevitable.

334
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,200
The foreigner, Joseph,

335
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,836
will not cover up for him.

336
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,836
You made me play them against each other,

337
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:16,480
so when Tan Xuanlin trades the munitions at the Shanghai Bund,

338
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,420
the Mu family can't cover up for him.

339
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,767
But...

340
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:24,140
the Mu family shouldn't think they can run away from it.

341
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,446
Tomorrow, I will find some contraband

342
00:26:27,446 --> 00:26:30,430
to put in your Mu Family Wharf's warehouse.

343
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,014
Try to find the keys to the warehouse.

344
00:26:34,014 --> 00:26:38,515
Concealing banned medicine will make them

345
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,641
suffer greatly.

346
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:43,180
Contraband?

347
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,840
Will it get me involved?

348
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,457
Don't worry.

349
00:26:46,457 --> 00:26:49,220
We will make sure everything is under control.

350
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,212
When we take down Mu Wanqing,

351
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:53,435
then everything in the Mu family

352
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:55,580
will all be yours.

353
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,900
Fine. Okay.

354
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,020
You can trust me.

355
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,410
Tomorrow,

356
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,040
I will find someone to watch Mu Wanqing

357
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,729
in case she makes a move.

358
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:08,195
At the Chamber of Commerce,

359
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:11,880
you would also need to keep an eye on her.

360
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,797
If she leaves the Chamber of Commerce,

361
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:16,300
tell me immediately.

362
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:18,770
I understand.

363
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,663
<i>Look.</i>

364
00:27:38,663 --> 00:27:41,860
<i>All of Shanghai is my territory.</i>

<i>you will be safe and sound.</i>

367
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,920
What you said that day

368
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,360
does it not matter anymore?

369

00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,940
<i>Good. Good. Great!</i>

375
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:45,576
Supervisor Xu, you can't go inside.

376
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,616
Supervisor Xu! Supervisor Xu.

377
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:52,861
Supervisor Xu, you can't go inside.

378
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:54,643
Supervisor Xu!

379
00:29:00,783 --> 00:29:01,836
Commander.

380
00:29:01,836 --> 00:29:04,440
Supervisor Xu said he wanted to go to his office to get something.

381
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,720
I couldn't stop him.

382
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,126
Why stop me?

383
00:29:08,126 --> 00:29:09,735
Did you do something wrong

384
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:11,863
and you're now afraid to see me?

385
00:29:13,156 --> 00:29:16,018
You can leave now. I will talk to him alone.

386
00:29:16,018 --> 00:29:17,643
Yes.

387
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:25,489
You and Wanqing.

388
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:28,122
What happened between you two?

389
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,656
Good news never goes beyond the gate,

390
00:29:30,656 --> 00:29:32,920
while bad news spreads far and wide.

391
00:29:35,592 --> 00:29:37,452
<i>[The Spark]</i>

392
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
<i>[Tan Army withdraws from the Mu Family Wharf. Mr. Tan and Ms. Mu are at odds because of celebrity Gu Yueshuang]</i>

393
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,840
I didn't know...

394
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,440
Supervisor Xu would read such tabloids.

395
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,736
I just came from the Mu Mansion.

396
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:07,522
They told me that

397
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:11,321
you have been indifferent to Wanqing these days.

398
00:30:11,806 --> 00:30:15,546
You let her make arrangements for the wedding alone.

399
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:17,920
You didn't even try on the suit.

400
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,214
Now you created

401
00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:23,040
a scandal for Gu Yueshuang.

402
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,523
Don't you feel sorry for Wanqing?

403
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,900
Don't you feel sorry for her dead father?

404
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,801
Xu Guangyao,

405
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:33,437
you have no right to involve yourself

406
00:30:33,437 --> 00:30:35,460
in matters between me and Mu Wanqing.

407
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,660
I am her brother.

408
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:40,909
I won't allow anyone to make her upset.

409
00:30:41,504 --> 00:30:43,168
So?

410
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,460
If that's the case,

411
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,566
should I call you brother-in-law?

412
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:54,000
It doesn't matter what you call me.

413
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,010
I just want you to remember

414
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,526
what you said.

415
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:03,293
You promised to protect her from all darkness

416
00:31:03,293 --> 00:31:06,084
and to give her brightness.

417
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,440
You don't dare die.

418
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,413
You don't dare lose.

419
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:12,797
You are afraid she would be sad.

420
00:31:12,797 --> 00:31:15,260
You promised to give her happiness.

421
00:31:15,803 --> 00:31:17,518
Did you keep your promise?

422
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:19,820
You ate your own words.

423
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,893
Xu Guangyao, who gave you the right to say that to me?

424
00:31:23,893 --> 00:31:25,520
Mu Wanqing's biggest tragedy

425
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,140
was caused by your family.

426
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,060
Didn't you know?

427
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,952
The Xu family

428
00:31:30,952 --> 00:31:33,255
did do something terrible to Wanqing a long time ago.

429
00:31:33,255 --> 00:31:34,620
Just a long time ago?

430
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,521
Mu Zhiyuan was assassinated at the railway station.

431
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:38,496
Who did it? Do you not know?

432
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,660
Didn't you suspect anything?

433
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,467
<i>Is Xu Yuan here?</i>

434
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:45,759
<i>I haven't seen him for several days.</i>

435
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,860
I said that I will protect her forever.

436
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,234
I will do what I promised.

437
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:57,234
Protect her forever as her brother, right?

438
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:59,260
Didn't you love her before?

439
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,773
Don't you love her now?

440
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,920
I gave up...

441
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,160
not because I didn't love her,

442
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,714
but because I respected her choice.

443
00:32:10,714 --> 00:32:13,092
But if she chose the wrong man,

444
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:15,620
if she chose an asshole,

445
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,940
I will not make it easy for him.

446
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,123
That's none of your business.

447
00:32:23,123 --> 00:32:25,527
Even if I am an asshole and I don't want her anymore,

448
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:29,151
she will beg to be with me and not you.

449
00:32:29,151 --> 00:32:33,456
Also, from now on leave me alone!

450
00:32:43,484 --> 00:32:45,084
You listen!

451
00:32:45,084 --> 00:32:47,540
If you are really an asshole,

452
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,020
I will never let you off!

453
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,620
Junior Marshal, look!

454
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,963
Junior Marshal.

455
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,049
- Mr. Xu.
- Staff Officer Zuo.

456
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:27,724
Mr. Xu, we fought for different military governors on the battlefield.

457
00:33:27,724 --> 00:33:31,200
I will apologize if I offended you.

458
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,380
There's no need.

459
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,750
You are skilled in military tactics.

460
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,387
I've learned much from you.

461
00:33:35,387 --> 00:33:39,420
Mr. Xu, Staff Officer Zuo took a plane to come here overnight.

462
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,131
He is authorized by Military Governor Pei

463
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:45,333
to investigate the Commander of Shangai,

464
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:49,088
Tan Xuanlin, aiding the enemy.

465
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,340
Tan Xuanlin aiding the enemy?

466
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,140
Military Governor Pei told me again and again

467
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,790
that this issue is vital to the situation in Shanghai.

468
00:33:57,793 --> 00:34:00,380
Of you two, one is the Executive Director of the Municipal Council,

469
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,910
and the other is the Supervisor of the Defense Command.

470
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,183
To show fairness and justice,

471
00:34:03,183 --> 00:34:06,477
you two should investigate together with me.

472
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:09,362
Do you have evidence?

473
00:34:09,362 --> 00:34:14,118
The reporter provided details on the time and place.

474
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,540
If we can catch both the men and the goods,

475
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,730
the case will be closed.

476
00:34:47,097 --> 00:34:50,160
Commander, you didn't sleep well last night?

477
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,796
It is Supervisor Xu's fault. He just broke in without a greeting.

478
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,447
Don't blame him.

479
00:34:58,447 --> 00:35:00,820
He was just defending Wanqing.

480
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,880
By the way,

481
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,267
are the people waiting at the wharf ready for noon?

482
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:06,640
Have them put on casual clothes.

483
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,440
Don't worry. Old Fu chose them, so they're very reliable.

484
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:23,807
Commander, why are there so many soldiers here this early?

485
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:37,114
Look. Supervisor Xu is here.

486
00:35:37,114 --> 00:35:39,002
And Anton Fay. And Staff Officer Zuo.

487
00:35:39,002 --> 00:35:40,838
This… This…

488
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:44,296
Let's go. Let's meet them.

489
00:35:47,093 --> 00:35:52,161
Supervisor Xu, it looks like I am not welcome at the Command.

490
00:35:52,161 --> 00:35:53,715
We are all old friends!

491
00:35:53,715 --> 00:35:58,040
<i>[Loyalty and justice get rid of enemies and give people peace]</i>

492
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,700
Brothers, put your guns down.

493
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,840
These are all old friends. Let's be polite.

494
00:36:07,914 --> 00:36:10,474
It is not right and proper to use guns here.

495
00:36:10,474 --> 00:36:13,546
Isn't that right, Brother Guangyao?

496
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:17,476
Due to family affairs, I haven't been fulfilling my duties for a while.

497
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:19,490
Sorry for the trouble, Commander Tan.

498
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,385
It is nothing.

499
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,888
Executive Director Fay. We are old friends, too.

500
00:36:25,888 --> 00:36:27,968
That's right.

501
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:30,469
Staff Officer Zuo, welcome to Shanghai.

502
00:36:30,469 --> 00:36:33,278
All of you must stay for a meal.

503
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:35,160
Let me fulfill my duties as host.

504
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,376
No need. I am authorized by Military Governor Pei to do this.

505
00:36:39,376 --> 00:36:43,269
In case I may offend you, please be cooperative.

506
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,315
How can I be cooperative?

507
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,216
Put your guns down. Guns down.

508
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,318
Staff Officer Zuo, what do you mean?

509
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:02,904
Commander Tan, let's go to the office and have a talk.

510
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:09,689
Don't move! Go back!

511
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:12,205
Go upstairs! Hurry up!

512
00:37:12,205 --> 00:37:13,500
Go back!

513
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,960
Hurry up! Down!

514
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,368
Staff Officer Zuo, isn't this too much?

515
00:37:27,006 --> 00:37:29,506
There is an emergency. Sorry for offending you.

516
00:37:29,506 --> 00:37:32,454
Commander Tan, please.

517
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,680
It is a mess here. I will ask someone to tidy up.

518
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,243
Staff Officer Zuo, what do you mean?

519
00:38:09,243 --> 00:38:12,425
Commander Tan, someone reported you for colluding with the Revolutionary Party.

520
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:13,840
Today at noon,

521
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,403
munitions trade will happen at your warehouse at the Shanghai Bund.

522
00:38:16,403 --> 00:38:18,077
We, as the investigation team,

523
00:38:18,077 --> 00:38:21,882
came here to investigate the report.

524
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,400
Staff Officer Zuo, you suspect me of colluding with the Revolutionary Party?

525
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,240
In this file, there are specific times and places.

526
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,428
<i>[Shanghai Commander Tan Xuanlin is colluding with the Revolutionary Party]</i>
I have no choice. It is my duty to investigate strictly.

527
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:37,580
<i>[On February 6th at noon, he is to transit munitions at the Shanghai Bund Pier]</i>

528
00:38:39,396 --> 00:38:42,576
Someone reported it, and you automatically believed it? Where is the proof?

529
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:44,910
Several days ago, someone reported me

530
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,083
for concealing contraband.

531
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:51,580
The British gendarmerie was totally fooled.

532
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,477
Executive Director Fay, is this true?

533
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,160
The gendarmerie was indeed

534
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,646
too rash.

535
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,843
Commander Tan, the government in Beijing sent an investigation team here.

536
00:39:09,843 --> 00:39:11,905
This is your responsibility.

537
00:39:11,905 --> 00:39:15,177
If it turns out that you didn't aid the enemy, you won't have to worry.

538
00:39:15,177 --> 00:39:16,486
We will give you justice.

539
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:18,332
How will you prove that?

540
00:39:19,406 --> 00:39:23,286
If someone else smuggles munitions at the wharf,

541
00:39:23,286 --> 00:39:25,835
will that be my fault?

542
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:27,534
Commander Tan, you don't have to worry about that.

543
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:29,390
After 12.00 noon,

544
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:32,760
as long as the people show up, and we get both the men and the goods,

545
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,102
we will interrogate them to find out

546
00:39:36,102 --> 00:39:38,735
if it was related to you.

547
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:44,530
Besides, this is top-secret.

548
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:49,418
Other than my soldiers and the people in this office, nobody knows.

549
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:51,091
It can't be let out.

550
00:39:51,091 --> 00:39:54,176
After several hours, when we catch the men,

551
00:39:54,176 --> 00:39:58,547
it will be very clear whether you are guilty or not.

552
00:39:59,205 --> 00:40:00,638
I see.

553
00:40:00,638 --> 00:40:03,865
That is to say, if the men don't show up,

554
00:40:03,865 --> 00:40:06,472
it means that I let out the secret. Right?

555
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:08,037
You can think that.

556
00:40:08,037 --> 00:40:10,990
So please be cooperative, Commander Tan.

557
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,772
What if the Revolutionary Party changes their plan

558
00:40:14,772 --> 00:40:18,367
or your information is not correct?

559
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:21,716
Will it be me who let out the secret?

560
00:40:24,485 --> 00:40:27,502
What Commander Tan says makes sense.

561
00:40:27,502 --> 00:40:32,024
From now on, why don't we have the Shanghai Telephone Exchange

562
00:40:32,024 --> 00:40:36,640
turn off all telephones in the headquarters until 1:00,

563
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,476
including Commander Tan's phone?

564
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:43,620
Meanwhile, the three of us will stay

565
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,600
in the office with Commander Tan.

566
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:49,785
So what do you think?

567
00:40:49,785 --> 00:40:51,860
I think Supervisor Xu found a good way.

568
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,027
Commander Tan, what do you think?

569
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,836
What? You don't want to?

570
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,420
It's not that.

571
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,360
I think Brother Guangyao's suggestion is very fair.

572
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,100
I was just thinking that it would be so boring for us four men

573
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,011
to stay here doing nothing.

574
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:15,160
Why don't we play Mahjong?

575
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,947
Tan Si, go assist Staff Officer Zuo's men to keep order.

576
00:41:18,947 --> 00:41:20,546
Yes.

577
00:41:24,502 --> 00:41:27,864
Gentlemen, after you.
