Now, it is all over.

16
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't have to plot anything anymore.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,200
And I don't have to lead a better-off life in fear.

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,600
But I only ask you for one thing.

19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,600
For the sake of Wanting living with you

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,300
and bringing much happiness to you these ten years,

21
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,500
can you be kind to her?

22
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,400
Living with me and bringing much happiness?

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,400
You're not qualified to say this.

24
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,300
I don't expect you to love her.

25
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,000
Please let her go.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,600
Give her a way out.

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,000
She is innocent.

28
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,100
What about my son, Yuanheng?

29
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Wasn't he innocent?

30
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,900
But I really didn't kill Young Master Yuanheng.

31
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,500
I admit I once thought about hurting him.

32
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,200
But I'm also a mother.

33
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,700
I know the pain of losing a child.

34
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,300
My Lord, I tried to save him. But it was too late.

35
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,300
Min Dacheng killed him.

36
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,000
My Lord.

37
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
I beg you.

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,600
You can kill me if you want.

39
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,000
I deserve it.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,900
But please…

41
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,700
Let Wanting go.

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,600
I'll send her to Hong Kong to study.

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,900
But she can't come back to Shanghai ever again.

44
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,900
She has nothing more to do...

45
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,900
with the Mu family.

46
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,800
Nothing to do with the Mu family.

47
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,400
Returning to Shanghai will only reveal her identity.

48
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,900
Starting a new life in a place where no one knows her,

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
it's her best choice.

50
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,000
My Lord,

51
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,900
you're so tolerant.

52
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,800
On behalf of Wanting, thank you.

53
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,300
But my tolerance is conditional.

54
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,700
Your daughter can live.

55
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,400
You cannot.

00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,300
The Mu family suffered a lot this time.

83
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,700
You stay in Shanghai.

84
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,100
You should comfort Mr. Mu more.

85
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,800
I understand.

86
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,100
Father.

87
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,300
Have you identified the two assassins who tried to assassinate Min Dacheng

88
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,400
the other day?

89
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,200
Why do you ask that?

90
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,900
I'm just thinking it's a little strange.

91
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,300
They didn't want to hurt me when they held me hostage.

92
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,100
Tan Xuanlin has confirmed that

93
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,200
the two assassins were sent by Cui Lianfeng.

94
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,000
She has always wanted Wanting to marry you.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,800
How could she want to hurt you?

96
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,600
It turns out Cui Lianfeng did it.

97
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,600
Who do you think did it?

98
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,200
No.

99
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,600
I just think it's a little strange.

100
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,200
Min Dacheng and Cui Lianfeng are dead now.

101
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,400
This can be regarded as revenge for the Mu family.

102
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,600
You should get some rest and recuperate.

103
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,200
Now Wanqing is the only daughter left in the Mu family.

104
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,600
She'll have a hard time.

105
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,300
You should help her.

106
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,100
Yes. I understand.

107
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,000
Military Governor.

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,800
Tan Xuanlin can really act.

109
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,900
He pretended to be respectful to us

110
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,100
but secretly threatened us with our weakness.

111
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,600
He is so shameless.

112
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,700
I have to say it was a nice move.

113
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,000
He not only proved the innocence of the militia,

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,500
but also showed his respect to Mu Zhiyuan.

115
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,800
This little bandit. I really underestimated him.

116
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
I don't understand one thing.

117
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,400
Why did Min Dacheng firmly say

118
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,900
he was ordered by Cui Lianfeng

119
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,400
to kill the young master of the Mu family?

120
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,000
The young master of Mu family was…

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,300
Min Dacheng.

122
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,000
He was clever.

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,700
He knew that Cui Lianfeng would

124
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,100
lose her position in the Mu family after this.

125
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,200
So he stopped defending her.

126
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,300
He testified against Cui Lianfeng to dispel my concerns

127
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,600
and make me feel grateful to him.

128
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,400
This Min Dacheng.

129
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,600
Even though he was going to die, he still hoped that his daughter

130
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,030
could marry into the military governor's mansion.

131
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,500
If it weren't for this,

132
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,300
he wouldn't have risked his life for me again and again.

133
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,700
What a pity! His wish will never come true.

134
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,400
After all these years,

135
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,900
I dared not walk into this room.

136
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,000
I was afraid to think of Yuanheng...

137
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,500
and the happy times...

138
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,400
we had in this house

139
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,200
when you were children.

140
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,000
Now this family...

141
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,400
is broken.

142
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,300
I thought I was wise during my life.

143
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,100
But I did such a stupid thing this time.

144
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,800
Wanqing,

145
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,930
I...

146
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,400
wronged your mother.

147
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,100
Wanqing,

148
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
I...

149
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,700
wronged you.

150
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,200
Father.

151
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,460
<i>[Defense Command of Shanghai]</i>

152
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,200
Commander.

153
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,600
Miss Mu called.

154
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,900
What did she say?

155
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,600
She said her brother's murderer is dead.

156
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,500
She wants to invite you to go to Fayuan Temple to redeem the vow.

157
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,500
Should I tell her that you don't have the time?

158
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,300
No.

159
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,800
That place is so remote.

160
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
I'll accompany her.

161
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,800
Commander Tan, thank you.

162
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,900
Without you,

163
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,200
we wouldn't have found a lead to my brother's murder.

164
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,100
My mother would be happy about this.

165
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,700
Oh right!

166
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,900
You must have a lot to say to your mother.

167
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,620
I'll stay here.

168
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,400
Okay.

169
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,100
Wait for me here.

170
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,300
Don't worry. You can see me as soon as you come out.

171
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,100
I'll tell my mother what you have done for me.

177
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,700
Mother,

178
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,000
how are you doing on the other side?

179
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,700
Have you seen my brother?

180
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,300
I have good news for you.

181
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,500
Cui Lianfeng.

182
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,500
We caught her and those who killed my brother.

183
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,000
You must have blessed me

184
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,200
so that I could meet Commander Tan

185
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,000
and know the truth after ten years.

186
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I even caught the bad guys.

187
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,600
They all said it's good luck.

188
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
Mother,

189

are you happy about this?

Mother,

191
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,100
Commander Tan...

192
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,900
I can't tell what's good about him.

193
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,800
But with him, I am at ease.

194
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
I like him.

195
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,900
But sometimes we're close, sometimes we're not.

196
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,800
I don't know if he likes me.

Are you okay?

00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,900
- Do you know what just happened?
- What?

200
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
When I told my mother about Cui Lianfeng,

201
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,000
the wick suddenly burst.

202
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,900
Does this mean that my mother is happy?

203
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,000
Is it a good omen?

204
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Of course, it is.

205
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,200
I also told her that

206
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,700
with you here, I'm having a good time.

207

She doesn't need to worry about me.

208
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,500
Let's go.

209
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,900
I have to do something when I go back.

You helped me so much.

I'll treat you to dinner this evening.

212
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,000
6:00. At the pan-fried bun restaurant on Seven Treasure Ally.

213
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'll see you there.

214
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,300
Don't look at me like this.

215
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,000
I am not the god of death.

216
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You're not dead.

217
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,500
I know you want to die.

218
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,100
But the bullet that hit you was a tranquilizer.

219
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,900
So, that Min Dacheng is "dead."

220
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,400
Do you want to know why I didn't kill you?

221
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,600
Easy. If I kill you, you'll get what you want.

222
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,700
I don't know what are you talking about.

223
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,000
You concealed the truth about Mu Yuanhang's death.

224
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,200
You even gave your life to show your loyalty.

225
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,100
You must want something from Xu Bojun.

226
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,700
Oh right.

227
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,600
The flying phoenix handkerchief from Cui Lianfeng

228
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
was not for Cui Jie.

229
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,900
It was for you.

230
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,000
It means that she wants you to take care of Mu Wanting's future.

231
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,900
Mu Wanting is your daughter, right?

232
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
- Here you are.

- Thank you.
- Here. Enjoy yourself.

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,800
Don't let anyone approach. And don't let anyone know.

- Okay, I know.
- Commander.

It's almost 7:00.

244
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,900
Have you forgotten that Miss Mu invited you out for dinner?

245
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,200
- Let's go!
- Okay.

246
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,900
Hurry up!

247
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,000
This seat is taken.

248
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:54,090
It's me. Tan Xuanlin. You invited me here.

It's really you!

250

I thought you were not coming.

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,100
How can that be?

252
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,200
Why did you drink so much?

253
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,400
Because I'm happy today.

00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,000
If you weren't here,

255

I don't know if I could have avenged my mother and brother.

Thank you.

257

Here. To you!

258

Let's go. You're drunk.

259
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,600
Let's go home.

260
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,700

Do you know why I asked you to come here to eat?

263
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,000
Why?

264
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Because this is my favorite pan-fried bun restaurant.

265
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,500
My mother always brought me and my brother here when I was a child.

266
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,400
This was a secret place for the three of us.

But now, they're gone.

268

I'm alone.

Don't think that way. It's okay.

I will stay with you in the future.

Liar! You were late!

272
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,400
I'm sorry. I had something to do.

It won't happen again. I'm sorry.

274

00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:33,236
How?

276
00:21:33,236 --> 00:21:37,729
You will accompany me to see the most beautiful night view of Shanghai.

277

Now?

278
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,680
It's too late. I'll take you home, okay?

279
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,470
Tan Si, drive us to She Mountain!

Why are we going to She Mountain now?

We're going to see the most beautiful night view of Shanghai!

It's cold there. Let's go home, okay?

283
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,680
No.

284
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,420
Wanqing, stop messing around! Listen to me!

It's my car. You have to listen to me.

Friend? I don't want to be your friend.

00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,126
Okay. I'll go with you.

Commander, the road is bumpy. It's not my fault.

298
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:44,626
You… If you really are worried that she will get hurt,

299
00:23:44,626 --> 00:23:47,676
you'd better let her lean on the seat herself.

300
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,243
You!

301
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,160
Okay then. Just drive slowly.

00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,330
You can see all of Shanghai here.

That's the Customs House!

That's HSBC.
<i>(Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation)</i>

For what?

329

I was drunk twice, and you always accompanied me.

00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:52,303
When did I mistake you for Xu Guangyao?

334
00:26:52,303 --> 00:26:55,370
You seem to have forgotten it. Last time you were drugged and got drunk,

335
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,330
you were so confused that you didn't know what you had done.

339

You were like this the last time, too.

340

<i>♫ Looking back ♫</i>

342
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:43,316
I knew it. I knew you knew it.

343
00:27:43,316 --> 00:27:44,680
You're mine.

344

I couldn't sleep.

362

What if I fell asleep and you took advantage of me?

363
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,260
You want to leave after taking advantage of me?

370
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:02,999
So we are in that kind of relationship now?

371
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:04,700
What kind of relationship?

372
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,856
Just… Just like…

373
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:08,870
- Just like…
- Just like where we

374
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,446
eat together and sleep together.

375
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:13,340
Who would want to sleep with you?

376
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,126
What? You kissed me.

377
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:17,350
You don't want to admit it?

378
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:21,640
Can you go to my house and propose marriage to me in front of my father?

379
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,090
If he says yes, we can be together.

380
00:30:27,276 --> 00:30:30,896
Don't worry. I will definitely get my father's permission.

381
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,912
Wanqing... I can't propose to you yet.

382
00:30:39,912 --> 00:30:41,815
Why?

383
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,950
Are you mad at me?

384
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,668
No.

385
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,760
Then, why won't you talk to me?

386
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,993
I don't want to embarrass myself.

387
00:31:19,993 --> 00:31:21,890
What do you mean?

388
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,170
As a girl, I asked you to propose in front of my family.

389
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:28,220
You said you wouldn't and couldn't do this. You don't even tell me why.

390
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,946
Even if we are partners, we should be honest with each other.

391
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:36,760
True. If the time comes, I'll definitely tell you.

392
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,143
Give me some time.

393
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,274
Stop the car.

394
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:47,404
Wanqing! Wanqing!

395
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:48,932
Wanqing!

396
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:50,720
Go back to the car. You're wearing heels.

397

Leave me alone.

- I can explain.
- I'm listening.

399
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,536
What do you mean "if the time comes"?

400
00:31:57,536 --> 00:31:59,651
Can't you be honest with me?

401
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,426
We have this kind of relationship.

402
00:32:01,426 --> 00:32:04,173
- I didn't mean that.
- Then, what do you mean?

403
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:06,656
Is there anyone you can trust in this world?

404
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:10,410
If you don't trust me, who do you trust?

405
00:32:11,155 --> 00:32:13,702
- Wanqing!
- Let go of me!

406
00:32:13,702 --> 00:32:16,855
Wanqing! Listen to me!

407
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,864
Let go of me!

408
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,160
Let go of me!

409
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,287
Get back in the car.

410
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,350
Wanqing!

411
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,510
Please listen to me.

412
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,216
Think about it carefully.

413
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:40,676
Everything I kept from you was all for your own good.

414
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,534
Think about it. I asked Mu Wanting to be Xu Guangyao's secretary.

415
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:56,213
I kept it from you, too. But in the end, you won.

416
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,553
I admit that I didn't tell you everything.

417
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:03,760
But I did it for a reason.

418
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:07,340
I hope you can believe me and trust me.

419
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,353
The real trust is not to bind each other, but to ensure that we don't doubt each other.

420
00:33:11,353 --> 00:33:16,400
Even if you can't see me, you would be willing to believe me.

421
00:33:19,136 --> 00:33:22,711
Now, I still have something important to do.

422
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:25,350
It's not a good time to propose for now.

423
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:33,652
But deep inside, I just want to be with you.

424
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:38,030
We wandered for ten years before we met each other.

425
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,680
I really cherish it. So can you give me more time?

426
00:33:50,746 --> 00:33:52,628
I can wait for you.

427

Thank you.

428

When it's all over, I will tell you.

But until then, you can't tell anyone about us. Okay?

430
00:34:07,927 --> 00:34:10,995
Okay. I believe you.

431
00:34:13,476 --> 00:34:19,580
Since you still have stuff to do, why were you so eager?

432
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:22,505
You kissed me first.

433
00:34:22,505 --> 00:34:25,955
I was drunk. And I had no experience.

434

I had no experience either.

I don't believe you.

436
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:37,560
I'm just kidding. Otherwise, I couldn't let you take advantage of me twice.

437
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,860
When did I do that?
