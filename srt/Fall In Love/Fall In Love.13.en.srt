Miss Mu,

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,700
who are they?

20
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,000
Miss Mu, you can't just rely on guessing.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Of course not. They said two sentences when they kidnapped me that day.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,400
Those two sentences alone are enough for me to know who they are.

<i>We should just do as he says.</i>

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,200
Did they speak some kind of jargon?

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,500
Yes. "Taking a look" means checking the goods.

29
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
It's commonly used in pawnshops.

30
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,600
And they said their boss deals with gullible people.

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,700
By gullible, they are talking about others giving them money, then handing over the goods.

32
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,100
So they must be related to a pawnshop.

Executive Director.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,000
I suggest checking all pawnshops in Shanghai immediately

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,300
to find out who was behind it all.

36
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,800
- Okay.
- No.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
Miss Mu, did you come here specifically

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,900
to get Commander Tan out of trouble?

39
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,800
I was there at the scene.

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,700
I'm just here to provide valuable clues.

41
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,500
I'm not trying to exonerate anyone.

42
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,400
And maybe it was Commander Tan

43
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,000
ordering someone else to kidnap me.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,200
So the priority...

45
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,100
is to find the mastermind behind it,

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,400
so that the truth can be revealed.

47
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:11,900
What Miss Mu said is a solution.

48
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,200
Moreover, we can focus on checking

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,400
the pawnshops that were closed for two days.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,900
We might be able to get some clues.

51
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,400
Then we'll wait until then

52
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,800
before we draw any conclusions.

53
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,600
But, Commander Tan,

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,800
before the truth comes out, you're still a suspect.

55
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,400
I'll let your men go first.

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,540
But I hope you'll keep them in check.

57
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,000
Of course. Don't worry, Mr. Executive Director.

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Military Governor Xu, only time will tell.

165
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,800
I'm not afraid of these kinds of tricks.

166
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,700
Commander Tan, do you think

167
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,700
the Municipal Council will keep you after all of these complaints?

168
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,400
Commander Tan,

169
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,100
I was trying to do a good thing for the British Concession,

170
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,000
but now you've made the situation worse.

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How can I explain this to everyone?

172
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,800
Don't worry, Executive Director.

173
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Here come the people who will explain it to you.

174
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,400
Excuse us. Let us through.

175
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,900
Everyone. How disciplined is the Tan Army?

176
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,500
You can ask them yourself.

177
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,300
Who… Who are you?

178
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,900
We are all scattered soldiers who have lost battles before.

179
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,800
No one cares about our livelihood.

180
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,300
Only Commander Tan treats us as human beings.

181
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,000
With Commander Tan here, we are willing to be good citizens

182
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
even if we are aggrieved.

183
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm a refugee from Hunan.

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,200
Both of my sons died in the war.

185
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,300
If Commander Tan hadn't taken us in,

186
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,700
given us food and clothes,

187
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,100
we would have died outside of Shanghai.

188
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,000
How can such an army disturb the peace?

189
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,700
That's right. I'm from the town of Luodian.

190
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,300
Commander Tan's army stayed there for a few months

191
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,900
and paid their rent on time.

192
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,000
They never took advantage of us.

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,500
There were so many Commanders in Shanghai.

194
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,200
But only the Tan Army paid their rent on time.

195
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
I believe them!

196
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,200
<i>We believe them! We believe them!</i>

197
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,600
<i>We believe them! We believe them! We believe them!</i>

198
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,000
<i>We believe them! We believe them!</i>

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,900
If Commander Tan is willing to restrain his men, then we will…

200
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,400
- Then we will leave.
- Let's leave.

201
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,000
Let's go. Let's go. Go.

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,900
<i>Let's go. Come on. Let's go.</i>

203
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,900
- <i>So we'll leave?</i>
- <i>Yeah. Let's go.</i>

204
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,200
<i>Go. Let's go.</i>

205
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,300
<i>Let's go. Let's leave.</i>

206
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,600
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

207
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,100
- <i>Let's go. Go.</i>
- <i>What the hell?</i>

208
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,500
<i>Go.</i>

209
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,200
Thank you for your hard work. Please come with me.

210
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,550
Come.

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,500
<i>Go.</i>

212
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,100
Commander Tan, you are good at buying people.

213
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Please. I just did what I had to do.

214
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,000
The whole concession

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,800
will greatly appreciate your kindness.

216
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,400
As for Miss Mu's kidnapping case,

217
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,200
we still have to find the culprit

218
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,500
to keep everyone calm.

219
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,000
Executive Director, rest assured.

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,300
Within three days, we will catch the criminal.

221
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,500
Governor Xu,

222
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,400
what do you think?

223
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,700
Since you are so confident,

224
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,800
I'll wait for your result.

225
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,400
I am your student.

226
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,500
Of course, I'm confident.

227
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,200
What? Tan Xuanlin is going to check the pawnshop?

228
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,900
How did he know that?

229
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,800
I heard that someone leaked the news

230
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,200
so Miss Mu knew it was someone from a pawnshop.

231
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,800
But she didn't know which pawnshop it was.

232
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,600
Idiots.

233
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,100
Aren't they just giving themselves away?

234
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,900
Fortunately, we didn't leave anyone alive.

235
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,600
Tan Xuanlin won't find us so soon.

236
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,300
About the stuff…

237
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,000
Did you clean everything up?

238
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,200
All uniforms and guns have been destroyed.

239
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,600
There's nothing in the pawnshop.

240
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,800
Even if they come to check, they wouldn't be able to find anything.

241
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,100
Good. You may leave.

The militia caught a thief at Baoli Pawnshop.

250
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,800
But I didn't expect to catch the boss.

251
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,600
Mr. Min, are you stealing from yourself?

252
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,300
Or do you have other motives?

253
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,900
Commander Tan,

254
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:44,400
I'm sure this must be a mistake.

255
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,000
This is my own store.

256
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,700
Is it illegal... if I go through the window or the door?

257
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,100
Of course not.

258
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,700
Well. Tell me.

259
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,300
Why haven't you been open for two days?

260
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,000
I've not been in the mood these days,

261
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,700
and don't want to run a business.

262
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,100
Is it because your business is failing?

263
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,800
Or was there a heavy price to pay for kidnapping someone?

264
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,400
Mr. Min, it seems you had a bad year.

265
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,200
Commander Tan, what are you talking about?

266
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,500
I don't understand.

267
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:36,500
You brought me in for stealing,

268
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,000
and now I've made everything clear to you.

269
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,700
I think I can leave now.

270
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,600
Not yet, I'm afraid.

271
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,800
That man of yours has confessed.

272
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,100
You're a businessman.

273
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,800
Why would you drug Miss Mu?

274
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,100
Do you have a feud with the Mu Family?

275
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,800
Commander Tan,

276
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,400
words from a Shanghai street punk…

277
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,100
Do you believe the slander

278
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,200
a hooligan says?

279
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,200
Of course not.

280
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,900
Mr. Min, then tell me.

281
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,800
Why did you sneak into the pawnshop that night?

282
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,700
Commander Tan,

283
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,300
I'm not your criminal.

284
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,300
I prefer not to answer your question.

285
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,000
Of course.

286
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,100
Then tell me.

287
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,200
Why did you burn this picture?

288
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,500
And who is this child?

289
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,800
It seems this child means a lot to you.

290
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,200
All right.

291
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,300
Since you don't want to tell me,

292
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,100
I'll use another method to get you to talk.

293
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,600
A gun is part of being a soldier.

294
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,500
I advise you to load the bullet when you can.

297
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,600
You won't let go of me.

298
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,800
I'm also not in the mood to conduct business either.

299
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,500

I want you to look into his family situation...

00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,800
and see if the child is his.

306
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Family situation?

307

I think he's a bit unique.

311
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,100
He really isn't afraid of death.

312
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,000
Have his men been interrogated yet?

313
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,600
Yes. A few of them.

314
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,100
They all said the military governor's mansion ordered Min Dacheng

315
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
to catch Mr. Mu and frame us.

316
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,900
The purpose was to arouse discontent in the concession

317
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,600
and to disband our militia.

318
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,100
Sure enough, it's the old guy who did it.

319
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,500
But why did he want to kill Wanqing?

320
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,950
They said it was an accident. They got the wrong person.

321
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,863
Impossible!

322
00:21:48,663 --> 00:21:50,243
Take the kidnappers at the dock,

323
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:51,800
they were clearly aiming at Wanqing.

324
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,305
What accident?

325
00:21:53,305 --> 00:21:54,780
You're right.

326
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,070
If they did kidnap the wrong person,

327
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,450
why would they want to kill her?

328
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,450
By the way, I searched Baoli Pawnshop and found nothing.

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,070
I think they destroyed everything.

330
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,110
But I discovered this.

331
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,550
- What's this?
- I found it in the Buddhist shrine.

332
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:16,390
I think it's a little weird. It's like some kind of scripture, so I brought it back.

333
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,170
It's a little old.

334
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,980
<i>[Shanghai St. John Hospital]</i>

335
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,089
Father, I'm fine now.

336
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:29,980
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

337
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,330
It's easy for you to say that.

338
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,800
You got lucky this time and survived.

339
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,098
I'm sorry that I worried you.

340
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,210
Look at you, son.

341
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,080
You were a senior graduate at the Baoding Military Academy,

342
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,230
and you have also fought in many battles.

343
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,640
How did a few gangsters get a hit on you?

344
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,390
Don't you feel ashamed?

345
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,210
I was careless.

346
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,880
At that time, I heard a gunshot on Commander Tan's side

347
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,980
and ignored my back.

348
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,720
My son. You should be careful of everything in the future.

349
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,410
If anything happened to you,

350
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,410
I really won't be able to live.

351
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,280
Forget it.

352
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,100
You've just had surgery and need rest.

353
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,760
How about going back home with me?

354
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,220
I think I'd better stay in Shanghai.

355
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,570
There's a lot of work to be done at the Command.

356
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,020
Provincial Military Governor, the doctor said the journey wouldn't be good for him.

357
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,340
You'd better let him rest in the hospital. And you have me here.

358
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,270
About the kidnapping… The Tan Army is still suspect.

359
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,930
Now Tan Xuanlin concluded there was another criminal,

360
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,780
and he also promised the Municipal Council to find the truth in three days.

361
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,560
Maybe it's good if you stay here, and see if he keeps his promise.

362
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,120
If he fails to do it, it won't be over.

363
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,610
Fine, you can stay.

364
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,341
I have an appointment with the Vice Transportation Secretary

365
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:08,010
and will go back to Yue City soon.

366
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,570
I won't be able to stay here with you.

367
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,200
Xu Cheng, take good care of your friend.

368
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,580
Of course. Please leave him to me.

369
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,040
<i>[Be quiet]</i>

370
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:25,838
Provincial Military Governor.

371
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:28,360
Commander Tan, I have to go back to Yue City.

372
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,400
You'll handle the kidnapping case.

373
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,622
Remember, you promised me. Find the truth within three days.

374
00:24:34,622 --> 00:24:38,352
I'm telling you. I want evidence.

375
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,270
Governor, please do not worry. I'll give you a satisfactory result.

376
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,660
Guangyao is concerned about his business and refuses to go back to Yue City with me.

377
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,200
You have to send more men to keep him safe.

378
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,340
Don't worry. As long as I am here, Brother Guangyao will not have any problems.

379
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,776
Okay.

380
00:24:51,776 --> 00:24:55,158
Remember. Don't forget what you said to me.

381
00:24:55,158 --> 00:24:56,695
Yes.

382
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,250
Your promise was too hastily made.

383
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,273
Are you sure you can keep it?

384
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,810
I'm confident but... not entirely sure.

385
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,613
If you fail, what are you going to do?

386
00:25:10,613 --> 00:25:15,183
I call this fearlessness and daring to face danger.

387
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,610
Come on, Junior Marshal.

388
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,390
You clearly took the bullet for Miss Mu.

389
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,220
Why didn't you tell him?

390
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,220
It's obvious you were sacrificing yourself to protect her,

391
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,790
but instead, it became that you are incompetent.

392
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,030
I feel bad for you.

393
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,930
I can't let my father know

394
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,920
that I took the bullet for Miss Mu,

395
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,200
and you can't tell anyone.

396
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,900
Why?

397
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,700
If my father finds out that

398
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,710
his son took a bullet

399
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,130
for a woman and almost died,

400
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,360
how do you think he will react?

401
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:10,545
Provincial Military Governor, why did you send Tan Xuanlin to investigate the pawnshops?

402
00:26:10,545 --> 00:26:13,020
What if Min Dacheng exposes this matter?

403
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,880
What should we do, then?

404
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,090
I believe Min Dacheng would rather die than say a word.

405
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,600
Even if he doesn't think for himself, he must think for his family.

406
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,940
Family? His family is also in Yue City?

407
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,100
Why don't I remember?

408
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,390
Are we almost at the railway station?

409
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,070
Yes, we're almost there.

410
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,080
Are you still uncomfortable?

411
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,880
I feel better.

412
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,680
Did you know?

413
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,650
When I was in surgery,

414
00:26:54,650 --> 00:27:00,510
in my dream, you told me... not to leave you.

415
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,828
So...

416
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,930
it's you who saved me.

417
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,590
If Miss Wanqing had that competence,

418
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,460
we wouldn't have had to worry last night.

419
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,910
Commander Tan, we got Miss Mu here.

420
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,430
You are busy with military affairs, so you can go back to the Command.

421
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:31,030
No way. I promised your military governor that I would ensure the safety of his son.

422
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,565
Miss Mu is weak.

423
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:36,110
If I'm not here, you'll all just wait for death to come.

424
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:40,160
In that case, are the soldiers outside just for show?

425
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,558
Only at critical moments should Commander Tan involve himself.

426
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:45,260
What nonsense.

427
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,403
Supervisor Xu and I are good brothers. I will only feel at ease when I'm here.

428
00:27:48,403 --> 00:27:50,745
Fetch the water and stop complaining.

429
00:27:50,745 --> 00:27:55,783
During this time, the family should always stay with the patient and take care of him.

430
00:27:55,783 --> 00:27:58,610
I'm family. You can tell me.

431
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,602
I'm family. Tell me what to do.

432
00:28:01,602 --> 00:28:05,220
You should keep an eye out and notify us if there are any changes to his condition.

433
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,290
Okay. I understand.

434
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:10,669
I'm a member of his family.

435
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:12,308
Here.

436
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:16,652
Don't move. Wait!

437
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,280
Come on. Step aside.

438
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,190
Let me take care of it.

439
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,940
It's hot. How would you be able to feed him?

440
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,620
Brother Guangyao, open your mouth. Here you go.

441
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,411
Commander Tan, the deadline is tight for this case.

442
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:37,130
You'd better go first.

443
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,200
I asked Tan Si and Old Fu to look into it.

444
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,330
Taking care of Brother Guangyao is more important.

445
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,280
I can't leave him to you.

446
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,540
Come on. Here.

447
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,660
Commander Tan, I can do it myself.

448
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,205
Thank you. I'll do it myself.

449
00:28:51,205 --> 00:28:52,965
Okay.

450
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:55,190
Did you see that? Supervisor Xu said he could do it.

451
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,070
You do not need to feed him.

452
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,880
Commander Tan, if you have something else to do, you can leave now.

453
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,320
No way.

454
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,380
I don't feel good leaving you with her.

455
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,840
I'll only feel better if I can take care of you myself.

456
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,682
Come on. You can lean on it.

457
00:29:13,682 --> 00:29:15,280
Get up.

458
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,850

Boss said this guy once insulted Miss Mu

471

and was sent to jail for it.

472
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,730
So he held a grudge and kidnapped Miss Mu

with a few men from the militia for ransom.

474

Good. Let's find a warehouse

and burn this guy with the militia's uniforms and guns together.

476

Let's make it seem like he killed himself by accident while destroying the stolen goods.

I made some soup for him. It's good for the blood.

- You lost so much blood.
- Okay.

I didn't run out of blood. I'm afraid you'll get a nosebleed later.

533
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,600
That's right, Miss Mu. Normal people can't have my soup.

534
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Try it and tell me how it is.

- Open your mouth.
- Commander.

That Mr. Cui said someone tried to kill him?

Yes. He escaped from the place where he was being held.

543
00:34:34,738 --> 00:34:36,420
He happened to run into our patrol.

544
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,620
He said he knew what you were interested in,

545
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,720
so he wanted to see you in person.

546

How's your investigation with Min Dacheng going?

549
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,480
Commander, you're right. He was indeed a soldier.

550
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,100
And he was also Provincial Military Governor Luo's assistant.

551
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,450
Ten years ago, he suddenly quit and came to Shanghai to open a pawnshop.

552
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,560
Many of his men have criminal records.

553
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,760
But somehow the police station let him go.

554
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,280
He used to be an assistant to Military Governor Luo?

555
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,220
He was also somebody back then.

Go ahead, Commander Tan. I have Wanqing here.

So I don't need to trouble you.

561
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,910
Well. Doesn't Miss Mu need to get back to her business or something?

562
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,030
I've got a desk job so there's nothing to do.

563
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,870
Moreover, it's good to have Wanqing here.

564
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,450
She can keep me company.

565
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,360

569
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:04,663
Wonderful. I wanted you to come out to ask you to stay here.

570
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,490
Why would I stay and be the third wheel?

That's right, be the third wheel.

So you have to keep an eye on them for me.

Miss Mu is the personal secretary of Supervisor Xu.

575
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Of course, she should stay and take care of him.

What are you worried about?

577

I think you're overreacting.

Of course not.

How about this?

582
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,370
If Supervisor Xu has any requests, you should help him.

583
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,310
If you can't, you can ask the nurse to help.

You can't leave them alone anyway. Do you understand?

585

- What do you smell?
- What is that smell? It stinks.

Well? What's that smell?

587
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,680
A smell of jealousy.

That's who he is.

And the car was parked outside the door, not in the parking lot.

That meant he'd be out soon.
