After everything is over, if she is reluctant to return to Shanghai, please help me persuade her.

16
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:41,240
In short, she can't stay here.

17
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,790
She also asked me to persuade you.

18
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,451
You are at odds with each other, placing me, an outsider, in a dilemma.

19
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:49,050
You aren't an outsider.

20
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,096
You are my future wife, my fiancée.

21
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:55,027
You're not an outsider.

22
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:57,187
Do you want to go back on your word?

23
00:01:57,187 --> 00:02:00,437
I'm going to put a stamp on you, and tell everybody that you're mine.

24
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:03,536
Stop it. There are so many people here. It's not good to be seen.

25
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:05,660
It's for them.

26
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,740
You tickled me! You! Don't run!

27
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,210
This Tan Xuanlin is really shameless.

28
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,350
He's trying to tell us, he has already made a

29
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:29,696
clean break with the Xu family because of Mu Wanqing.

30
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:34,330
In dealing with Xu Bojun, he's our perfect ally.

31
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,506
But he's full of cunning tricks and a schemer.

32
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:39,334
He's not someone to be friends with.

33
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:43,400
We're sitting together for the same interest, and we'll separate after we get what we want.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,694
I'm going to make good use of his advantage.

35
00:02:45,694 --> 00:02:49,334
I want to actually win at least once.

36
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,935
You said Tan Xuanlin took Pei Xun to the embassy district in the Legation Quarter?

37
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:05,888
Yes. Besides, Pei Xun personally took Tan there.

38
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:10,170
But they were stopped at the door of the embassy. So he left with Tan.

39
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,091
In Beijing, the only place that Pei Xun can't get into is the embassy.

40
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:16,250
What were they doing there?

41
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,480
Pei Xun spoke to the people of the embassy.

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,123
But our men were too far away to listen clearly.

43
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,730
If Tan Xuanlin came to Pei Xun, they must want to do something bad to me.

44
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,463
Tan Xuanlin always takes one step and thinks three steps ahead.

45
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:34,629
He seems to do things on the spur of the moment, but he actually plans things out before acting.

46
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,408
So this time, he must be well-prepared.

47
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:42,577
Send someone to find out what Tan Xuanlin's plan is.

48
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,980
Maybe he's hiding Min Dacheng in the embassy.

49
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,988
Governor, even Pei Xun's men can't get into the embassy district.

50
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:55,381
We have just a few people. I'm afraid...

51
00:03:56,393 --> 00:04:00,257
Over the past two years, we had resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

52
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:02,641
There are more and more people doing business on the border.

53
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:07,812
It's not difficult to get a visa from the embassy and run a business.

54
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,840
I understand.

55
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,910
I'm on it.

<i>[Witness: Min Dacheng]</i>

61
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,112
Governor Pei,

62
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,850
this case is very important.

63
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,600
If we're uncertain about this,

64
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,130
the lives of all the people in our court,

65
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,284
including judges and secretaries, will be in jeopardy.

66
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,960
Don't be ridiculous. We're in our Pei territory.

67
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,230
Why are you so afraid of Xu Bojun?

68
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,840
You're a Grand Justice, too.

69
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,357
Governor, you... you're making this difficult for us.

70
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,563
There are all kinds of evidence in here.

71
00:05:18,563 --> 00:05:21,170
Why are you making this so difficult for yourself?

72
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,820
I can make it harder for you now

73
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,120
if you can't order a retrial of this case.

74
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,150
The wives and children of the staff in your court

75
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,080
all live under me.

76
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,612
Grand Justice Liu.

77
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,610
Am I usually too merciful to you?

78
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,637
Are you only afraid of Xu Bojun but not me?

79
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,426
Governor, we'll never dare to do that. Never!

80
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,490
Then just order a retrial for this case.

81
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,560
I'll make sure that all your families are safe.

82
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,746
Okay. As you command. We'll try this case again.

83
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:22,210
We'll try this case again.

84
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,618
Summon Xu Bojun right away.

85
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:27,277
Tell him to come to Beijing,

86
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:29,463
to cooperate with the trial.

87
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:43,902
Why do you look so upset when things went smoothly?

88
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,802
Things went smoothly.

89
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,350
I just wanted to use his power to take down Xu Bojun.

90
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,624
I didn't expect the justices to kneel down before him.

91
00:06:55,624 --> 00:07:00,195
And I can't believe that he has the justices wrapped around his fingers.

92
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:01,690
You're right.

93
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,670
This Pei Xun is no better than Xu Bojun.

94
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,651
They are brigands of the same stripe.

95
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,380
But you can't change things in one night.

96
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,165
Relax. Take your time. Okay?

97
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,232
You're right. Let's win this battle first.

This is actually your excuse, right?

I can feel that

112
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,350
you like me, too.

113
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:56,129
You should go back to Shanghai with Commander Tan.

114
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,287
Then just tell me that you don't like me at all.

115
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,850
That you hate me.

116
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,560
And you think that I'm

117
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,401
the most annoying person in the world.

118
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,460
You hesitated!

119
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,600
That means you don't hate me.

120
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,617
Stop messing with me. You won't be happy if you're with me.

121
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,340
I think I'm happy when I'm with you.

122
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,198
You don't understand.

123
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,076
The governor's mansion is just like a cage.

124
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:44,110
I'm unable to make use of my abilities here.

125
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,777
If you stay, you'll just get trapped in here with me.

126
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:52,115
Who said you can't make use of your abilities?

127
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:57,067
If you weren't the Junior Marshal, you wouldn't have been able to save all those students.

128
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,631
You don't know what happened after that.

129
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:04,691
I know. Your father arrested those students.

130
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:11,046
I've been asking around about you ever since I met you.

131
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:15,971
So I read all the newspapers in Beijing. I know what happened.

132
00:10:15,971 --> 00:10:17,990
Now that you know,

133
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,038
then you should understand that I saved those students from danger.

134
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:24,717
And I was also the fool who asked them

135
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:27,977
to fall into a trap, because I was tricked by my father. That was me, too!

136
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,651
Do you still want to be with me now?

137
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:33,788
You're not a fool.

138
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:36,314
No one could have done it better than you.

139
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:38,780
If you hadn't stopped those students from fighting the police,

140
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,094
if you hadn't saved those students,

141
00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:45,209
then so many students would have died that day.

142
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,190
So in my heart,

143
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,580
you're a hero.

144
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,566
So...

145
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:06,819

You're the son of Governor Pei.

You clearly could have risen in rank with the help of your father's power.

You were trying your best to help all those students.

154

Just tell me, if you're not a hero,

But not all heroes are perfect.

160
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,440
They'll have times when they feel helpless.

161
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,770
If heroes just can be those who aren't afraid of anything

162
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,850
and can do everything,

163
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,830
then there won't be any heroes in the world.

<i>[To Xu Bojun]</i>

179
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,717
Governor, our spy at the court sent a message saying that

180
00:13:07,717 --> 00:13:10,450
in the indictment, Mu Wanqing has written that

181
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,560
they have witnesses and physical evidence.

182
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,220
Pei Xun personally took Tan Xuanlin and Mu Wanqing

183
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,015
to see Grand Justice Liu.

184
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:19,445
Grand Justice Liu had to agree.

185
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:21,400
That's what I expected.

186
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,470
Min Dacheng didn't die.

187
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,937
Tan Xuanlin hid him at the embassy.

188
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,203
He's afraid that Pei Xun will not share his profit with him.

189
00:13:28,203 --> 00:13:29,770
So, he left some room to maneuver.

190
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,060
It's my fault for failing to kill Min Dacheng to shut him up.

191
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,690
But this embassy is heavily guarded.

192
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,366
I sent people in there multiple times,

193
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:40,490
but they couldn't find out anything.

194
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,489
I don't blame you for this.

195
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,448
We can't hurt Min Dacheng

196
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:48,350
even if we find out something.

197
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,810
So what is the evidence?

198
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,720
Has Min Dacheng been disloyal to us all along?

199
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,112
Does he have something against us?

200
00:13:57,112 --> 00:14:02,320
We didn't sign any documents with Min Dacheng

201
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,278
in regards to what happened to Master Mu at that time.

202
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,509
What evidence would he have?

203
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,493
As of right now,

204
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:11,290
we just have immediate responses.

205
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,360
I really can't believe that

206
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,540
Tan managed to pressure Pei Xun to have this case reopened.

207
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,657
I think that he offered something to Pei Xun.

208
00:14:19,657 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm not surprised by that.

209
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,050
Pei Xun has wanted to take my place for a long time now.

210
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,220
This is a good chance he'll definitely seize.

211
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,470
But I didn't expect

212
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,070
the son of a horse bandit like Tan Xuanlin to have relationships with foreigners.

213
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,603
That's true.

214
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:34,540
He can hide people at the embassy.

215
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,240
He really knows somebody.

216
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:39,543
The Japanese Minister, Mr. Watanabe,

217
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:41,190
is in Beijing right now.

218
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,851
He's an old friend of mine.

219
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:44,306
You can ask him to spy for you.

220
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:47,180
Find out what the relationship between Tan Xuanlin and the embassy is.

221
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,675
Yes.

222
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:50,439
By the way, Governor,

223
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,318
what are we going to do with this ticket?

224
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,280
Send a telegraph to the court now.

225
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,200
Tell them I'm too sick to travel a long distance.

226
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,280
And that I sent you in my stead.

227
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,992
Me?

228
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,807
Xu Bojun is fooling us

229
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:21,705
by malingering just as we expected.

230
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:23,994
It seems that he's afraid.

231
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,900
He knows he can't win

232
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,524
and is afraid that he won't be able to come back.

233
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:30,590
So he sent an adjutant to represent him.

234
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,440
Governor,

235
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,489
I don't think it's that simple.

236
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:37,680
If Xu Bojun didn't have any hope for the trial,

237
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,330
he could just ignore the ticket.

238
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,212
Why send his henchman, Xu Yuan, to court?

239
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:48,365
I believe that Xu Yuan has other intentions this time.

240
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:53,258
What do you think he is doing?

241
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:55,926
I can't be sure about that right now.

242
00:15:55,926 --> 00:15:59,300
But Xu Bojun is not going to sit passively.

243
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,094
Governor,

244
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,540
I suggest you open the court session as soon as possible.

245
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,900
Otherwise, the delay may cause us trouble.

246
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,574
Thank you.

247
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,711
Why are you still up?

248
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:48,712
You have been sitting here for over half an hour.

249
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:50,681
What are you thinking about?

250
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,977
I'm thinking about why

251
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,429
Xu Bojun is sending Xu Yuan to court.

252
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,894
I just feel like there's something wrong with that.

253
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:07,538
The Supreme Court had decided to order a retrial for the case.

254
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:09,048
If he refuses to show up,

255
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:11,224
it would mean he confessed without being pressed.

256
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:13,736
He sent an adjutant here instead of coming himself.

257
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:16,912
He won't put himself in danger even if he loses the case.

258
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:19,856
Yes. You're right.

259
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:21,770
But the question is...

260
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,390
Why is he sending Xu Yuan?

261
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,683
Be careful.

262
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,284
It's okay.

263
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,225
Just think about it.

264
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:37,990
We already have all the evidence.

265
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,870
But Xu Bojun certainly knows

266
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:46,525
Pei Xun and I joined hands to bring him down this time.

267
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:50,610
He'll definitely lose if he does nothing.

268
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,735
But if he delays the court session

269
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:55,230
by saying that he's ill,

270
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,020
he can get more time for himself to turn the scale.

271
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,670
But now, he's not doing anything.

272
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,428
That means he's putting himself in a passive situation.

273
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:08,594
That makes sense, too.

274
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,286
Actually,

275
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:18,870
I have already prepared for the scenario where Xu Bojun refuses to show up.

276
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,840
The spies working for the Xu family follow us all over the place.

277
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,595
I deliberately let them see us when I took Pei Xun to meet with

278
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:26,761
Min Dacheng at the embassy.

279
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:32,190
I originally thought Xu Bojun would try to kill Min Dacheng first.

280
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,630
We could have caught him right away

281
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,927
in the embassy district.

282
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,220
We could have started a court session

283
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,878
regarding the case of murdering of witnesses,

284
00:18:41,878 --> 00:18:43,702
even if Xu Bojun refused to show up in court.

285
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:46,786
That could have brought up the case that happened ten years ago.

286
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:49,360
But I didn't expect him

287
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,520
to send his henchman, Xu Yuan, to court.

288
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,913
That doesn't make any sense.

289
00:18:55,913 --> 00:19:01,156
Unless he's sending Xu Yuan to save the situation.

Our Governor Pei has arranged a room for you at the Liuguo Hotel.

Thank you, Officer Zuo.

I hope Governor Pei doesn't blame him.

What are you talking about, Old Xu?

299
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,970
You are the personal bodyguard of Governor Xu.

300
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,460
You are the right person to attend the court for him.

301
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,020
Our Governor is a clean man, and he doesn't need to explain anything.

Besides, Governor Pei is here too.

That they will.

322
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:46,670
compared to my standard troops, is far superior.

323
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,850
You're joking.

324
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,550
Your army is not a standard troop anymore.

325
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,127
You have gained power in Shanghai.

326
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,494
And you're going to be the son-in-law of the Mu family.

327
00:20:57,494 --> 00:20:59,904
You're far richer than me now.

328
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:01,355
You're making fun of me, Governor.

329
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:02,780
My army only has 2,000 soldiers.

330
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,480
How can we compare to your hundreds of thousands?

331
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,620
We all have our troubles.

332
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,910
You don't know my difficulties.

333
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,402
100,000 people.

334
00:21:12,402 --> 00:21:13,606
I have to feed all my men and horses.

335
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,050
That's a lot of money to spend in a year.

336
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:20,026
Xu Bojun's territory is an abundant place in Jiangnan.

337
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:21,236
As for Su Jingshan,

338
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:23,700
he owns a large coal mine in the northwest of Shanxi.

339
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,290
I can't compare to them.

340
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,556
In addition, floods, droughts,

341
00:21:28,556 --> 00:21:31,630
and locusts keep repeating these years.

342
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,340
Farmers are suffering due to poor harvest, and the soldier's pay is critical.

343
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,640
That's you being merciful.

344
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,640
You don't collect taxes for the coming decades

345
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,770
like the other governors.

346
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,850
I want to do that, too.

347
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,632
If I also had an abundant territory like Yue City

348
00:21:47,632 --> 00:21:49,802
as Xu Bojun has,

349
00:21:49,802 --> 00:21:54,330
I wish I could force those rich people to subsidize my army.

350
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,660
But I can't.

351
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,130
Ordinary people don't have extra money to subsidize the army.

352
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,210
If I pushed them around too hard,

353
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,950
I wouldn't be able to pay my soldiers anymore.

354
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,727
You're right.

355
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,090
Governor,

356
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:12,180
when can we open the court session for Xu Bojun's case?

357
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,586
I know you're afraid that

358
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,820
there will be trouble if we delay it for too long,

359
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,050
but we can't rush this situation.

360
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,380
This case is very complicated.

361
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,740
We have to give some time to the court.

362
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,290
Give them time to prepare

363
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,490
so we won't be abused by the public,

364
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,960
and get accused of making this premeditated,

365
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,790
- Governor.
- ...to charge Xu Bojun.

366
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,110
Officer Zuo is waiting for you in the reading room.

367
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,258
He said he has something urgent.

368
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:43,659
Commander Tan, I have an emergency.

369
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:44,706
Would you excuse me?

370
00:22:44,706 --> 00:22:46,510
Please. Go ahead.

371
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,003
Okay.

372
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,178
Xu Yuan has arrived.

373
00:23:01,178 --> 00:23:02,590
Officer Zuo is picking him up.

374
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,070
And he is sending them personally to Liuguo Hotel.

375
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,749
This Officer Zuo was the adjutant of Pei Xun.

376
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:13,786
He should be an old friend of Xu Yuan.

377
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:16,450
Why is Pei Xun being so nice to Xu Yuan

378
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,560
as we're about to go to court?

379
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,447
It seems like there will be trouble

380
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,633
if we don't get the court opened earlier.

381
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,000
Trouble?

382
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,625
Pei Xun is the trouble.

383
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,584
Tan Si, keep an eye on Xu Yuan.

384
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:39,288
Report to me immediately if something happens.

385
00:23:39,288 --> 00:23:40,972
Yes.

386
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,710
The adjutant of Xu Bojun really said that?

387
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,884
Yes.

388
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,510
He said Xu Bojun is in bad health lately.

389
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,140
And he is too far away to deal with the affairs in Shanghai.

390
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,650
This Tan Xuanlin is also someone who loves to cause trouble.

391
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:59,010
Ever since he took this position, Xu Bojun has felt uncomfortable with him.

392
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,906
He has suddenly brought up this old case from ten years ago,

393
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,500
just to frame the Xu family.

394
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,836
Governor, if you can help the Xu family

395
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:09,141
in charging Tan Xuanlin with slander of a superior, then

396
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:13,674
Xu Bojun said you can pick someone to be the Commander of Shanghai.

397
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,640
He can't send me away by just

398
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,025
offering me a Commander of Shanghai.

399
00:24:24,025 --> 00:24:27,030
Well, do you think we should negotiate with him?

400
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,481
Which one is better for us?

401
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:32,438
To take Xu Bojun down or to take Tan Xuanlin down?

402
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:33,714
Naturally, it would be Xu Bojun.

403
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:34,736
No.

404
00:24:34,736 --> 00:24:37,530
We have to take Xu Bojun down

405
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,290
as well as gain profits from Tan Xuanlin.

406
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,505
Do you mean that

407
00:24:41,505 --> 00:24:44,500
it's time to take advantage of Tan Xuanlin?

408
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,797
This afternoon,

409
00:24:45,797 --> 00:24:47,810
I already gave him a hint.

410
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,610
If he's smart enough, he'll understand.

411
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,547
He must show me his sincerity,

412
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:55,086
so that I can hasten the procedures of opening a court session.

413
00:24:55,086 --> 00:24:56,586
How about Adjutant Xu?

414
00:24:56,586 --> 00:24:57,925
You promise him first.

415
00:24:57,925 --> 00:25:00,940
If Xu Bojun pushes us to deal with Tan Xuanlin,

416
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,957
you can tell him I have to pick

417
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:04,924
the right person to be the Commander of Shanghai.

418
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:06,800
There's no need to rush.

419
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,028
I understand.

420
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:09,836
You can go bring me Pei Yong.

421
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:10,870
Yes.

422
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,186
Junior Marshal, here are the books you asked for.

423
00:25:13,186 --> 00:25:17,570
I know I'm late today, but I'm really busy during the day.

424
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,553
Where have you been today?

425
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:21,610
I haven't seen you all day.

426
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,500
I don't want to talk about it.

427
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,780
The representative of

428
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,620
Governor Xu has arrived.

429
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,666
Officer Zuo had to pick him up and help him get settled.

430
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:33,740
Besides, he had to send messages to the governor.

431
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,990
He's really busy.

432
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,650
So, he asked me to help him.

433
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,840
The representative of Xu Bojun is here to attend court.

434
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,799
Why does my father have to talk to them?

435
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,150
It's nothing. It's just small talk before the trial.

436
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,356
Sure. I'm good now.

437
00:25:50,356 --> 00:25:52,530
You can go.

438
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,890
Got it.

439
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,594
By the way,

440
00:25:57,325 --> 00:25:59,225
ask Miss Tan to come here.

441
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,453
I have some books that she wants.

442
00:26:01,453 --> 00:26:03,072
Understood.

443
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,909
Are you saying...

444
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:20,484
Officer Zuo went to Liuguo Hotel after he

445
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:22,620
finished everything in Pei Xun's office?

446
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,167
Yes.

447
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,130
And he stayed there for a long time before coming back out.

448
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,402
How about Xu Yuan?

449
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:29,510
I already sent some people to stay at the Liuguo Hotel.

450
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,302
They'll report to me immediately if anything happens.

451
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,036
No wonder Pei Xun kept telling me that

452
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,210
he's out of funds this afternoon in the yard.

453
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:47,826
But he suddenly changed his attitude when I asked him about the time of the trial.

454
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,130
So he's going to take advantage of both sides.

455
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,627
What shall we do then?

456
00:26:53,627 --> 00:26:55,530
This is Pei Xun's territory.

457
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,653
We can't do anything if he's trying to cheat on us.

458
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:03,867
That's simple.

459
00:27:04,697 --> 00:27:06,386
Let's push him a little.

460
00:27:06,386 --> 00:27:08,589
Put him in a dilemma.

461
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:18,689
Sister-in-Law,

462
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:21,486
can you imagine staying at your own home

463
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:24,230
and having the same feeling of staying in jail?

464
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,538
Are you saying your brother is being hard on you?

465
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:29,078
Not my brother.

466
00:27:29,078 --> 00:27:30,880
I'm wondering why

467
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,918
Pei Shaojun stays in the governor's mansion alone,

468
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,713
just like he's staying in jail.

469
00:27:37,713 --> 00:27:40,150
Are you worrying for him?

470
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,999
Miss Tan.

471
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,853
Miss Mu.

472
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:49,513
Our junior marshal asks you to see him.

473
00:27:49,513 --> 00:27:51,500
Pei... Pei Shaojun asked me to go visit him?

474
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,190
Yes.

475
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,446
Junior Marshal said he has some books he wants to show you.

476
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:02,366
Tell him to wait for me.

477
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:04,226
Okay. I'll be leaving now.

478
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:06,069
Please hurry.

479
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,031
Sister-in-Law,

480
00:28:13,031 --> 00:28:16,886
I didn't mention that I wanted to read with him before.

481
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,920
I know!

482
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,773
He must be touched by me.

483
00:28:22,773 --> 00:28:24,573
The old saying is true.

484
00:28:24,573 --> 00:28:26,877
"Not meeting for one day is like not seeing you for a whole season."

485
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:30,780
Sister-in-Law, do you think Pei Shaojun

486
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,760
is making an excuse to see me?

487
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,310
But I don't think that's a thing Mr. Pei would do.

488
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:44,231
I'd better go with you.

489
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:46,710
It's not for you to go alone so late at night.

490
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,265
Really?

491
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:49,660
You're my sister-in-law, for sure.

492
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,118
You...

493
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,099
<i>Mr. Pei, we're here to pick up the books.</i>

494
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:01,320
<i>Can we come in?</i>

495
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:05,153
Come in, please.

496
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,082
Mr. Pei. Mr. Pei.

497
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,630
Please don't mind me.

498
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,026
It's really too late for Sangyu

499
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:17,770
to come here alone.

500
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,249
It's really inconvenient.

501
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:21,407
I just want to keep people from gossiping about that.

502
00:29:21,407 --> 00:29:23,321
Miss Mu, you're right.

503
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:26,282
It's my fault for being inconsiderate.

504
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,762
Mr. Pei, did you miss me?

505
00:29:32,762 --> 00:29:36,170
You can say that you wanted to see me.

506
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,766
Don't need to find excuses.

507
00:29:37,766 --> 00:29:39,065
Miss Tan,

508
00:29:39,065 --> 00:29:42,182
I asked you to come because I think there's

509
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:44,373
something you should know.

510
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:53,432
Where are you going at this late hour?

511
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,800
Tan Si, stay here and keep an eye out.

512
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:08,696
What's the big deal of being the King of Shanghai?

513
00:30:08,696 --> 00:30:10,749
You still have to listen to your wife.

514
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:12,890
- What's wrong?
- I just came from Junior Marshal Pei's room.

515
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,288
He said Pei Xun is privately in contact with Xu Yuan.

516
00:30:18,888 --> 00:30:20,591
What were you doing

517
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:22,651
in his room this late?

518
00:30:22,651 --> 00:30:23,960
Did you hear me?

519
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,420
This is not the time for being jealous.

520
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,055
What if Pei Xun sold you out?

521
00:30:28,055 --> 00:30:29,969
Because Pei Shaojun is

522
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:33,305
under house arrest, and even he knew that.

523
00:30:33,305 --> 00:30:35,510
How could your boyfriend not know that?

524
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,890
So did you figure out how to solve it?

525
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:40,936
What if they cooperate with each other in private and turn against you?

526
00:30:40,936 --> 00:30:44,156
Come here. You don't have to worry about this.

527
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,590
No matter what terms Xu Bojun offers to Pei Xun,

528
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,795
there is no better term than his downfall for the Pei family.

529
00:30:52,795 --> 00:30:54,879
Pei Xun just wants to pressure me

530
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:56,810
so he was communicating in private.

531
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,760
He pushed me to offer more interesting things to him.

532
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,097
Are you so sure about that?

533
00:31:01,097 --> 00:31:02,516
Think about it.

534
00:31:02,516 --> 00:31:04,790
Pei Shaojun can't even get out of the house now.

535
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,744
If Pei Xun doesn't want him to know,

536
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:10,200
he can't even hear about that.

537
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,090
Also, Xu Bojun went to the party with Pei Xun wanting to obtain

538
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,380
sponsorship from your family.

539
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,021
You're right.

540
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:20,396
So what are you planning to do then?

541
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,811
I'm going to find Mr. Liao,

542
00:31:28,811 --> 00:31:30,064
and use the power of the embassy to publish

543
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:31,365
an article in the overseas newspaper,

544
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:33,372
about the retrial of Xu Bojun's case.

545
00:31:33,372 --> 00:31:36,161
We will get the word out to create public pressure

546
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:37,305
to force Pei Xun to open a court session.

547
00:31:37,305 --> 00:31:39,296
No. You're being so tough on him.

548
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:40,496
What if you are pushing him too hard?

549
00:31:40,496 --> 00:31:43,720
He'll turn against you after he's finished with Xu Bojun.

550
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,680
We will pay for his army as he wants.

551
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,520
He'll let us go back to Shanghai if we give him money.

552
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,857
Wanqing, that's a lot of money.

553
00:31:53,857 --> 00:31:56,686
Don't worry about that. I can afford that.

554
00:31:56,686 --> 00:31:58,511
You can pay for that?

555
00:32:01,426 --> 00:32:03,256
Did you forget what you said at the Paramount?

556
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:05,096
You said that you're my man henceforward.

557
00:32:05,096 --> 00:32:07,297
I'll take care of you.

558
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,600
I'd really be homeless if you do that.

559
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,040
Besides, would Uncle Mu agree to that?

560
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,268
I'm in charge of the Mu family now.

561
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:18,890
And after this case, we'll definitely turn against Xu Bojun.

562
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,330
If we can pay for Pei Xun to have him on our side,

563
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,394
that would not be a bad deal after all.

564
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,739
Okay.

565
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:31,841
Let me find out what Pei Xun thinks tomorrow.

566
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:34,420
You don't have to go. I'll go.

567
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,228
You?

568
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,110
With Governor Pei's male chauvinism,

569
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,430
he would argue about little details if you go to find him.

570
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,924
But it'll be different if I go.

571
00:32:42,924 --> 00:32:43,990
I'm just a girl.

572
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,870
He won't quibble with a little girl.

573
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,746
He'll look bad if he does.

574
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:49,850
And have you seen the way he treats your sister?

575
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,070
He's soft with girls.

576
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,320
No. I don't mind if he argues about little details with me.

577
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,055
I don't agree with that.

578
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,250
Why? You can play cards and dance with rich madams to please them,

579
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,850
and you're not allowing me to help you with your business?

580
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,327
I...

581
00:33:07,206 --> 00:33:08,972
I was just joking.

582
00:33:08,972 --> 00:33:10,885
I don't want you to go.

583
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,270
You're not my husband yet.

584
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,706
If you go talk to him, that will be you being generous at the expense of others.

585
00:33:16,706 --> 00:33:19,450
However, I, Mu Wanqing, am in charge of the Mu family.

586
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,996
I can't always hide behind you like a little wife

587
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:23,020
when I encounter problems.

588
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,540
- That makes me look like a loser.
- But...

589
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,740
Enough. I know what to do.

590
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,640
<i>[Guild Hall of Yue City]</i>

591
00:33:48,975 --> 00:33:50,638
Open the door.

592
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,646
Xu Yuan went to the guild hall?

593
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:04,050
Yes.

594
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,600
He was also in casual wear and put on a hat.

595
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,440
He was vigilant all the way there.

596
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,400
We had to follow him from afar so that he wouldn't find us.

597
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:17,720
Where else did he go after he finished

598
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,130
talking to Officer Zuo?

599
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,510
Our man just stayed there and watched.

600
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:23,530
He didn't go out after Officer Zuo left.

601
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,027
He didn't go to the Guild Hall of Yue City until it was dark.

602
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,990
Why did he go to the Guild Hall of Yue City

603
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,461
instead of sending telegraphs to Xu Bojun?

604
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,606
Xu Bojun has come to Beijing.

605
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,940
<i>[Passport]</i>

606
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,950
Did anyone see you when you came here?

607
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,140
Don't worry, Governor. I took a few detours on the way here.

608
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,030
I'm certain that I wasn't being trailed when I came in.

609
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,850
What did Pei Xun say?

610
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:18,480
Officer Zuo said Governor Pei was very interested in our terms,

611
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,400
and he'll think about our cooperation.

612
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,990
So did he say anything about when he's dealing with Tan Xuanlin?

613
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,710
They said they still need time to think about that.

614
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,490
He asked us not to worry about choosing a suitable person for the Commander of Shanghai.

615
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,539
Those are just empty words.

616
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:33,215
Pei Xun is tricky.

617
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:35,266
He must be using a delay tactic with us.

618
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,920
He wants to see which side offers the highest price.

619
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,190
Governor, you already thought about that?

620
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,960
I just wanted to make sure about it.

621
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:48,910
If he truly wants to work with me, he'll set the price up high.

622
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,780
He can't be satisfied with just a Commander of Shanghai.

623
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,530
This time, he answered us so quickly this time.

624
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,370
He just wants to use us to push Tan Xuanlin.

625
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:01,170
He wants to get more from Tan.

626
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,500
Stop! What are you doing?

627
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,026
I just wanted to bring the guest a pot of hot water.

628
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,770
Leave the pot.

629
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,246
You, leave.

630
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,860
Okay, sure.

631
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,416
Governor, what are we going to do next?

632
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,290
If Tan Xuanlin can't satisfy Pei Xun,

633
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,770
Pei Xun won't open the court session with the way he is.

634
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,540
We still have the chance to draw him over to our side.

635
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,980
If Pei Xun and Tan Xuanlin have reached an agreement,

636
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,240
then we just have to kill Min Dacheng.

637
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,330
He can't make an ironclad case without the witness.

638
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,010
We will still have the chance to save the situation.

639
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:22,090
But the embassy is guarded.

640
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,300
We sent people to look around for Min Dacheng's whereabouts,

641
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,050
but we have nothing.

642
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,206
It's not easy for us to kill Min Dacheng.

643
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:31,640
Any news from Watanabe?

644
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,911
And what about the relationship between

645
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:36,710
Tan Xuanlin and the embassy?

646
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,920
Mr. Watanabe said

647
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,400
the Soviet Russian minister doesn't know Tan Xuanlin.

648
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,100
A friend of theirs just arrived recently.

649
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,920
It seems that he's from Guangzhou.

650
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,750
From Guangzhou?

651
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,330
Is he part of the Revolutionary Party?

652
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:56,330
If so, then Tan Xuanlin doesn't have a wide relationship.

653
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,870
He's colluded with the enemy.

654
00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:01,270
Probably not.

655
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,740
Tan Xuanlin hasn't made contracts with the Revolutionary Party before.

656
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,050
Where did this relationship come from?

657
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,150
I remember it now.

658
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,290
Guangyao was almost killed by the Revolutionary Party

659
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,090
at the celebration party held by the Command of Shanghai.

660
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,480
At the time, I ordered Tan Xuanlin to arrest people

661
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,340
from the Revolutionary Party throughout the city.

662
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,880
Maybe he was just showing mercy to the Revolutionary Party.

663
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,585
If that's true,

664
00:38:25,585 --> 00:38:28,290
Tan Xuanlin has colluded with the enemy.

665
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,570
No.

666
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,440
It doesn't matter if he is working with the enemy or not.

667
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,810
Our priority now is to kill Min Dacheng.

668
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,670
If we can't do that in the embassy district,

669
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,810
then we should kill him enroute to the court

670
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,290
before the trial.

671
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,330
Understood. I'll arrange it now.

672
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,062
And I'll make sure that it'll happen this time.

673
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,400
<i>[Tribute]</i>

674
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,990
This is the Tribute cigarette from the governor's mansion

675
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,810
that Xu Guangyao smokes.

676
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,330
As I expected,

677
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,457
Xu Bojun has come to Beijing.

678
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,530
And he is staying in the Guild Hall of Yue City.

679
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,680
Commander,

680
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,581
how about we take action before they do?

681
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:23,756
Don't wake up a sleeping dog.

682
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,584
He won't get away with this.

683
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,570
The trade on the border has been interrupted for several years.

684
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,810
Shops of Mu's Chamber of Commerce in Beijing have always been closed.

685
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,290
We just left several people there to guard the place.

686
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,588
But now, the border has opened.

687
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:50,820
I want to reopen these shops.

688
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,013
And I heard that the volume of trade grew recently in Heihe.

689
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:55,183
The profit is high.

690
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:57,911
I'm just thinking why not do business in the peaceful North

691
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:01,111
since the South is in the flames of wars.

692
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:07,850
I really didn't know your family had a big industry in Beijing.

693
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,746
Miss Mu, you said you have something to discuss with me.

694
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:16,143
Is it because you want to open shops in Beijing?

695
00:40:16,143 --> 00:40:18,720
Our family is famous in the South.

696
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,570
But I'm afraid that foreigners won't recognize us if we

697
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,490
want to trade with Russia in the north.

698
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,239
But you're different.

699
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:27,835
They know your name because of your prestige.

700
00:40:27,835 --> 00:40:29,110
With all due respect, I want to invite you

701
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,230
to be a shareholder of our shops in Beijing.

702
00:40:34,506 --> 00:40:36,640
You little girl.

703
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,950
Are you trying to use my reputation to protect yourself?

704
00:40:40,632 --> 00:40:42,640
Then tell me,

705
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,636
why I should keep helping you.

706
00:40:46,636 --> 00:40:49,980
You don't have to pay me anything,

707
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,580
I'll only take twenty percent of the profit of the shops in Beijing.

708
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:56,950
The rest is yours.

709
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,290
What do you want from this?

710
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,950
I just want you to help with my brother's case

711
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,610
and bring justice for my family.

712
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,470
I understand.

713
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,739
But you don't have to go all the way around.

714
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:15,270
Others will think I bribed you

715
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,430
if I just gave you the money.

716
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,695
I don't care about the gossip, because I'm just a businesswoman.

717
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:22,720
But I'll feel sorry

718
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,447
if your reputation was damaged.

719
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:26,440
However, it's right and proper for you to take profits

720
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,926
if you're a shareholder in my shops.

721
00:41:28,926 --> 00:41:31,886
And others can't gossip about that.

722
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,736
Miss Mu, you're so thoughtful about that.

723
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:40,770
Women around Commander Tan are

724
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:43,530
each smarter than the last one.

725
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,260
Then I'll take that as a yes.

726
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,525
Don't rush. Miss Mu,

727
00:41:47,525 --> 00:41:50,687
I saw you just had a few people left in your shops in Beijing.

728
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:55,570
How about I give you ten percent of the profit?

729
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,958
That's no problem. As you wish.

730
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:05,770
Miss Mu, you're clever and righteous.

731
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,010
Okay.

732
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:11,020
It would be disrespectful to refuse your invitation.

733
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,700
It would be the Mu family's pleasure to cooperate with you.
