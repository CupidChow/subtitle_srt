He's okay. He just missed me.

Mr. Su, could you please get away from me?

I just wanted to tell you something.

Men like Tan Xuanlin who say that they miss you,

31
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,970
but never take real actions, are very unreliable.

But I am different.

Why don't you go over and chat with him?

I...

38
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,730
My waist was injured in the past so I can't sit on a hard chair.

Old Su hurt his waist when we were still in school.

He can't sit for long periods of time.

42

I got injured before. I did.

45

Junior Marshal Su, I thought you hurt your waist. Why don't you take a seat?

46
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,770
Yes, my waist hurts, but I can't keep sitting.

47
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,285
I need to stand up and walk around more.

54
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,330
You killed someone in front of me.

55
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,690
You're quite brave.

56
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,270
Let me tell you.

57
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,795
You cannot get anything out of me.

58
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:26,944
If you want, just kill me now.

59
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,910
Anyways, I'm useless to you.

60
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,950
When he was arrested, Cui Jie said

61
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,360
that he harassed Miss Mu because you threatened him,

62
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,200
so he could be the scapegoat while you escaped.

63
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,812
Is that right?

64
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,270
I'm not guilty.

65
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,370
Why would I need a scapegoat?

66
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,840
Who would I want to escape from?

67
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,330
That's true.

68
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,210
I don't have evidence that you did that.

69
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,520
You don't have to make excuses at all.

70
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,720
But you framed Cui Jie

71
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,800
because you wanted to escape from your boss.

72
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,450
Am I right?

73
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,100
It seems that I'm right.

74
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,700
Actually,

75
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,140
your boss

76
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,180
only asked you to kidnap Miss Mu to frame me.

77
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,140
He didn't ask you to kill her.

78
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,740
But you wanted to use the occasion to kill Miss Mu.

79
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,740
I can tell you the truth.

80
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,710
I already have evidence of who your boss is.

81
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,840
But I don't want to make it public.

82
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,120
I will make a deal with him.

83
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,660
You will be the only one to be blamed for the kidnapping.

84
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,530
This way, the militia will be removed from suspicion.

85
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,070
Your boss will also owe me.

86
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,610

87
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,472

From the moment you came in, you said nothing.

94

Then you killed the witness in front of me.

95

you are definitely not protecting your boss but you're using him.

00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:03,690
You're full of lies, too. I'm leaving.

166
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,020
- Are you going home? I'll take you.
- No need.

167
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,780
Old Su!

168
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,670
How improper.

169
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,080
Right. So improper!

170
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,600
They're going too far! Girls before brothers!

171
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,560
Shameless!

172
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,643
Miss Tan, there's nothing to do for me here. I'm leaving now.

173
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:30,763
You... Wait.

174
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:34,010
I lost my bag in the theater.

175
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,864
Did you see it?

176
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,631
No.

177
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,930
That's the gift I prepared for you.

178
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,520
From the first time I saw you in Beijing,

179
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,330
I have been preparing for it.

180
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,450
I've been preparing for a long, long time.

181
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,280
What a pity!

182
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,880
I lost it before I can give it to you.

183
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,500
Maybe I wasn't sincere enough.

184
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,790
So God punished me.

185
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,718
No. You did a very good job already.

186
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,600
You haven't seen it yet.

187
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,980
How would you know that I did a good job?

188
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,110
You've been preparing it since last year.

189
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,680
It took so long.

190
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,810
You must have done a good job.

191
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,951
Forget it. I appreciate the thought.

192
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,770
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

193
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,640
You liar.

194
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,980
I know you saw it!

195
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,240
<i>[Shanghai St. John Hospital]</i>

196
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,896
Hey.

197
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,545
The car is gone already. You can let me go now.

198
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,640
I... I...

199
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,540
Am I hurt?

200
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,123
Otherwise, why would my heart beat so fast?

201
00:14:48,673 --> 00:14:50,700
I wish you could behave yourself.

202
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,252
Get up!

203
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:01,243
This is the second time I saved you.

204
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:05,442
It seems that you need me a lot.

205
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:08,180
I think you need a beating!

206
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:17,012
Come on.

207
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,664
<i>You…</i>

208
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,375
What are you thinking?

209
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:49,070
Are you enjoying my handsome face?

210
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,180
Don't be naive.

211
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,293
Do you think I wouldn't hit you?

212
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:59,190
Since you saved me, I'll go easy on you this time.

213
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,015
I'm leaving.

214
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,390
She didn't want to hit me.

215
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,030
It seems like I'm really in a drama.

216
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,680
Brother Guangyao, I'll go get the list.

217
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,250
You can rest early after the infusion.

218
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,850
Just leave it to me.

219
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,740
There is a document in the Municipal Council.

220
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,591
It's for Supervisor Xu. Please go and get it.

221
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,430
But someone needs to take care of Brother Guangyao.

222
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,620
You can ask someone else to go.

223
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:10,108
Yes, I can ask anyone to do it.

224
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:13,670
But the Municipal Council made it clear that it should be handed to Supervisor Xu.

225
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,710
If others peek at the document, it will be bad.

226
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,020
You are Brother Guangyao's personal secretary.

227
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,850
You'll be perfect for this.

228
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,680
Wanqing,

229
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:24,930
just go.

230
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,830
What Commander Tan said makes sense.

231
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,920
I'll come back soon.

232
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,549
Miss Mu.

233
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,770
It will be too late.

234
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,810
You don't have to come back after you get the document.

235
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,370
But shouldn't I give it to Guangyao to have a look?

236
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,570
Miss Mu, you are so naive.

237
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,600
You are Supervisor Xu's personal secretary.

238
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,580
He just got out of surgery and is still recovering.

239
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,080
How can he work now? It's not a big deal after all.

240
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,040
You don't have to rush back.

241
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,260
If it's not urgent, why should I go get it now?

242
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,494
Wanqing,

243
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:08,145
what about going back and getting some rest after you get the document?

244
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:09,870
You must be tired after a day's work.

245
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,190
There is nothing to do here.

246
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,075
Yes.

247
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:16,530
I'll see you tomorrow.

248
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,140
I'll go and find the doctor.

249
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,400
<i>[Shanghai St. John Hospital]</i>

250
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,800
Didn't you want to make me leave?

251
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,030
Must you spend the night in Xu Guangyao's ward?

252
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,500
I was trying to help you out.

253
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,490
Why are you being so shameless?

254
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,490
But I'm better than someone else

255
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,590
who called here and said he missed Miss Gu

256
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,810
after being away for about two minutes.

257
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,180
What two minutes?

258
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:58,422
What call?

259
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,690
<i>Is she jealous of Shuang'er?</i>

260
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,660
<i>I couldn't tell that she was the jealous type.</i>

261
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,590
I'll sit here.

262
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,000
Brother Guangyao, here's the thing.

263
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,380
It's not proper for Wanqing to be here all the time.

264
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,800
Taking care of you is inconvenient.

265
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,320
But I'm different.

266
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,580
We are both men. It's quite convenient.

267
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,620
Commander Tan, you don't have to do so.

268
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,890
I…

269
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,020
I called Xu Cheng here.

270
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,690
Xu Cheng can help me.

271
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,760
I'm fine here.

272
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,990
I won't bother you.

273
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,391
That won't work.

274
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,240
I promised Governor Xu.

275
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,780
I must personally take care of you.

276
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,900
<i>[Shanghai St. John Hospital]</i>
Come on. Hurry up.

277
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,140
Don't rush.

278
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,290
Hurry up. It's your turn.

279
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,750
King!

280
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,570
- Hit it.
- Hurry up!

281
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,380
- Hurry!
- Show your cards. Hurry!

282
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,790
- Who else?
- You.

283
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,170
King!

284
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,058
- You have none left.
- Whose turn is it now?

285
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,495
You've lost your military wage.

286
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:41,090
Fine.

287
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,240
No, don't.

288
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,220
- Six.
- Steal. Are you hiding something?

289
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,280
I'm not.

290
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,396
Xu Cheng, get your Junior Marshal Xu some water.

291
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:52,140
Buy him some porridge, too.

292
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,690
Get me some fried buns as well.

293
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,610
Right. And... the bottle.

294
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,110
If that thing's empty, call the nurse.

295
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,500
- What's the card?
- Are you going to hit or not?

296
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,550
- Two.
- Get him!

297
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,900
- Get him!
- I have no cards.

298
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,110
No more?

299
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,830
Okay. Here it is!

300
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,710
I got no cards and that's game.

301
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,330
Game's over.

302
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,847
Junior Marshal, what are they here for?

303
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:16,460
He said he would take care of you.

304
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,300
But he asked me to buy water and food for them.

305
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,120
You can't rest well when they're playing cards.

306
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,170
Should I ask them to leave?

307
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,720
- Don't complain.
<i>- It's your turn. Hurry up!</i>

308
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,040
He's the commander.

309
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,850
It's nice of him to be here with me.

310
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,960
Don't expect too much from him.

311
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,060
He asks me to do things all the time.

312
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,280
<i>No!</i>

313
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,000
- Just go.
<i>- It's my turn.</i>

314
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,470
<i>Two sevens.</i>

315
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,300
I have nothing left.

316
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,070
- Steal.
- I'll steal too.

317
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,680
Xu Cheng, don't forget.

318
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,560
- Hurry up!
- Thank you.

319
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,430
- You're not throwing?
- Two fours. I'm finished.

320
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,280
My cards suck. I have no pairs.

321
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,330
You two are over.

322
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,190
- Hurry up. Hurry! Shuffle the cards.
- Hurry up.

323
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,640
Shuffle the cards. Another round.

324
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,190
Come on.

325
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,060
5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

326
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,840
- Why do you always get good cards?
- I was.. I was the first loser and I lost my wage.

327
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,560
But you can't be in front of me.

328
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,060

492
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,000
On that day, I had a cup of Moutai.

493
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,800
And suddenly, I felt really dizzy.

494
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,100
Correct.

495
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,400
He drugged you.

496
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,700
He drugged me?

497
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,200
Do you remember how you left that day?

498
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,000
Didn't you pick me up?

499
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,200
I did.

500
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,800
But we came out from Anton Fay's luxury room.

501
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,200
But don't worry.

502
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,100
I got there in time.

503
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,200
And Anton Fay was totally drunk at that time.

504
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Nothing happened.

505

<i>My Lord, Wanting has a stomach ache.</i>

517
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
So that's how it was.

518
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,000
What did you think of?

519
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,400
It was Cui Lianfeng.

520
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,300
She arranged everything.

521
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,300
But why would Min Dacheng take such risks and help her?

522
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,200
Do you know who Min Dacheng used to be?

523
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,000
Ten years ago, he was Governor Luo's assistant.

524
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
When your brother died,

525
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,900
he was also on the docks.

526
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,500
I have an idea.

527
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,800
I know what you are thinking about.

528
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,500
And I agree.

529
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,300
I thought Cui Lianfeng just wanted to drive my mother away.

530
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,600
I didn't expect her to have something to do with my brother's death.

531
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,600
If she really plotted all these,

532
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,400
then I've been living with the murderer who killed my brother!

533
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,400
She not only forced my mother away,

534
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,000
but she kept ensnaring me over and over again.

535
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,500
What does she want from me?

536
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,300
I thought if I could get back my mother's dowry,

537
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,500
I could live in peace with her.

538

This isn't your fault.

539

You can never imagine how evil a person can be.

540
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,600
If she really killed my brother,

541
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:57,400
she owes me not only a home but also a life.

542
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,600
She took away everything I cherished.

543
