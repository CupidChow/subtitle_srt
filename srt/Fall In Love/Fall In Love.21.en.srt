16
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:44,934
Miss Gu, you've worked so hard.

17
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:49,082
And you've been acting for more than 20 hours. Your eyes have turned red.

18
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:53,220
And you had to attend the closing ceremony right after that. The director is so inconsiderate.

19
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,900
It's okay. I'm used to it.

20
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,997
You can go home now. And put this in your house.

21
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,920
Okay, I'll get going.

22
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:38,400
Before, you said, "Fireworks are beautiful, but it's fleeting."

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,846
Only half of that sentence is correct. There is a perfect way to make it last.

24
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:48,919
The beauty of the fireworks can be captured by the camera,

25
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,311
and it'll last forever.

26

You really have some strange ideas.

27
00:02:58,907 --> 00:03:01,206
It's kind of strange.

28
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:03,506
But honestly,

29
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:06,425
do you like this present?

30
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,890
I'll take it. Thank you.

31
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:48,923
I don't know if I have the honor to be your camera.

32
00:03:48,923 --> 00:03:51,152
To record your beauty forever.

33
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:53,582
Do you think...

34
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:57,063
I'm beautiful?

35
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:07,833
Of course. You're beautiful.

36
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:11,196
You walk lightly like a startled swan. And you're so graceful, like a swimming dragon.

37
00:04:11,196 --> 00:04:15,789
You make the fish sink and wild geese fall. And outshine the moon and put the flowers to shame.

38
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:22,110
I think they are not as beautiful as you think.

39
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:27,440
You gave me the cold shoulder so many times,

40

I am about to freeze to death.

41
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:32,705
Can't you have some sympathy for me?

42
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,670
Fine.

43
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,150
The present you gave me today is special.

44
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:44,397
I really like it.

<i>[Tianjin Machinery Bureau]</i>

46
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,290
These guns were made by my family's machinery bureau. Why are they here?

47
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,113
It seems that you didn't know your father was smuggling firearms.

48
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:25,420
Smuggling firearms?

49
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:29,588
Look at this.

50
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,070
People in charge of smuggling firearms are from Tianjin Machinery Bureau.

51
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,500
They told me themselves.

52
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,970
To avoid exposing themselves, they carry Cantonese money.

53
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,480
If they get caught, they can say they are from the Revolutionary Army

54
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,630
in order to avoid implicating the military governor's mansion.

55
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:53,271
Don't you think this situation is a bit familiar?

56
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,094
That's impossible.

57
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,170
Think about it carefully.

58
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,100
If that assassin was believed to be one of Commander Tan's people,

59
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,800
my father would want to kill Tan Xuanlin.

60
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,230
And he will not be in the mood for contending with the power in Beijing.

61
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,395
Your father would be able to seize the chance to hold the real power in his hand.

62
00:06:10,395 --> 00:06:12,650
If the assassin was believed to be a member of the Revolutionary Army,

63
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,200
then my father would assemble his army

64
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,050
to fight against the Revolutionary Army.

65
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,930
The pressure to mobilize men will be drastically reduced for your family.

66
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,270
It's good for your father either way.

67
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,918
He just didn't expect that I'd live.

68
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,550
I'll go back to Beijing and figure it out.

69
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,200
If my father really did this, I'll offer a humble apology to you.

70
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,743
Shaojun. Shaojun!

71
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,026
This is just between you and me. I won't tell my father.

72
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:46,178
And I won't tell anyone.

73
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,917
It's still too early to draw conclusions based on this Cantonese money.

74
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:55,486
If we don't investigate it, and if by any chance my father didn't do this,

75
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:59,820
my family will take the blame for another person.

76
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,062
If you want to investigate, I won't stop you.

77
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:07,690
I just hope this issue can end with just you and me.

78
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,930
Do you seriously not know who you are?

79
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:21,246
You're my younger sister, and you go to the Paramount to be... a singer!

80
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,136
And you publicly expressed your love. Do you know anything about being reserved?

81
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:28,807
I… I didn't go there to be a singer.

82
00:07:28,807 --> 00:07:32,920
I just went there to have fun. I'm not a singer.

83
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,120
Second Brother, I know that I'm wrong, and I've humiliated you.

84
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,190
Why don't you send me away from Shanghai?

85
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,102
You can send me to Beijing. Out of sight, out of mind.

86
00:07:46,102 --> 00:07:48,170
Do you take me for an idiot?

87
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,070
You want me to send you to Beijing so that you can fool around with Pei Shaojun.

88
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,587
Nice try!

89
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:56,730
I'll send you back to our hometown and ask all the uncles there to keep you in school.

90
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,287
I… Second Brother, I'm used to staying in Shanghai.

91
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:05,710
I'm not used to staying in little places like Jiang City.

92
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,840
You're not used to it?

93
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,090
Starting today, you can't see Pei Shaojun anymore.

94
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,500
If you won't let me see Pei Shaojun, I…

95
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,885
I'll hit myself to death.

96
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,140
Don't stop me. Don't stop me. Let me do it.

97
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,170
Let me do it! Don't stop me. Let me do it!

98
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,440
If you don't hit yourself to death here today, then you won't see him again.

99
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,041
Do it!

100
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:54,116
Second Brother, I just want to get a little closer to the person I love.

101
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:57,524
If he can love me back, then it's worth it.

102
00:08:57,524 --> 00:08:59,540
There is no shame in doing it.

103
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,240
It's nothing, you know. It's not a capital crime.

104
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,286
You're not embarrassing yourself. You're embarrassing me.

105
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:16,760
If I…

106
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,840
If you feel embarrassed because I love someone, then how about you?

107
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,850
The way you look at the elder daughter of the Mu family is very clear.

108
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,520
Don't think I can't tell.

109
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,550
Then I think you're the one embarrassing me.

110
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,216
Tan Si, take her back to school.

111
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:45,636
Don't let her out of school. Send her to our hometown for the holidays.

112
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:48,650
- Yes.
- You… I...

113
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,805
Second Brother, you're the best brother in the world.

114
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:58,371
- You're not embarrassing me. You're not embarrassing me at all.
- Tan Si!

115

There are some things I have to figure out for myself.

Give Guangyao my regards.

134

The front-page headline, as I expected.

139
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:39,487
But the reporter of The Spark is not good at taking pictures.

140
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:42,210
Why did he pick this angle?

141
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,896
Of course, you look handsome in every angle.

142
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,071
All right. Go and invite reporters from all major newspapers.

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,543
Father, we can't trust this tabloid.

159
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,600
Where there is smoke, there is fire.

160
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,470
Tan Xuanlin stepped in to help the Mu family before. He dared to offend the Japanese.

161
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,140
He would never take the risk

162
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,850
if he does not have a close relationship with Mu Wanqing.

163
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,500
You're their supervisor.

164
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,240
And you didn't notice that they were in cahoots with each other?

165
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,540
If Mu Wanqing really likes Tan Xuanlin,

166
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,840
that will embarrass our family!

167
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,300
They met only a few months ago.

168
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,510
Yet, they're already having a private relationship.

169
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,210
You can't even handle your childhood sweetheart.

170
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,021
Military Governor. Junior Marshal.

171
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:41,846
We just got the latest news. Tan Xuanlin is going to hold a press conference in the Command.

172
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:44,550
He's going to clarify the false report in The Spark.

173
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,643
Father, Tan Xuanlin is putting on a show to clarify it.

174
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:52,500
It means that the report is a rumor.

175
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,912
Tan Xuanlin is full of cunning tricks.

176
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,921
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

177
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,040
- <i> I'll wait for you in the classroom. </i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

178
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,420
- <i>Let's go together.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

179
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,400
<i>- Just you.
- Alone.</i>

180
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,266
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

181
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,740
Only a few people will run after a man like I do

182
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,210
in all of Shanghai.

183
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,040
Special coverage! The daughter of the Mu family, whose wedding is coming,

184
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,400
is having an affair with the Commander of Shanghai.

185
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,930
Special coverage! The daughter of the Mu family, whose wedding is coming,

186
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,970
- is having an affair with the Commander.
- Hey.

187
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,260
- <i> Do you need a ride? </i>
- Special coverage!

188
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,380
- <i> Get out of the way. </i>
- What did you just say?

189
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,970
The daughter of the Mu family, whose wedding is coming,

190
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,890
is having an affair with the Commander of Shanghai.

191
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,961
You need to pay for this.

192
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:33,303
Good for you, Tan—

193
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,908
Good for you, Tan Xuanlin! You were so hard on me.

194
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:44,110
You must be elated now. Bah!

195
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:51,620
<i>[Miss Mu is getting married, but has an affair with Commander Tan]</i>

196
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,140
<i>[Defense Command of Shanghai]</i>

197
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,780
<i>[Defense Command of Shanghai]</i>

198
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,200
Folks, I believe you all have read the report

199
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,920
from The Spark.
<i>[Miss Mu is getting married, but has an affair with Commander Tan]</i>

200
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,260
This report said that
<i>[Miss Mu is getting married, but has an affair with Commander Tan]</i>

201
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,390
I have an unusual relationship with Miss Mu Wanqing.

202
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,927
As we all know, the engagement party of

203
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:26,830
Miss Mu Wanqing and Mr. Xu Guangyao will be held on the 8th of next month.

204
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,190
Marriage is not child's play.

205
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,710
I feel like I owe an explanation to the new couple.

206
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,124
So I decided to make a clarification

207
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:39,540
about this report before Miss Mu Wanqing gets married.

208
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,218
Firstly, this report describes my relationship

209
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:45,270
with Miss Mu Wanqing as an adulterous one.

210
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,170
The more this newspaper conceals it, the more conspicuous it is.

211
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,870
So today, I decided to announce that Miss Mu Wanqing

212
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,170
is the person I want to woo.

213
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,610
Although she didn't accept me,

214
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,030
I believe faith will move mountains.

215
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,380
Secondly, I understand that even if Miss Mu Wanqing

216
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,850
has made a promise of marriage with Mr. Xu Guangyao,

217
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,384
I still have the right

218
00:18:09,384 --> 00:18:12,760
to court Miss Mu Wanqing before her engagement.

219
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,816
So, I pronounce that starting now

220
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:18,750
till their engagement in eight days,

221
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:24,010
if I can win Miss Mu Wanqing's heart in these eight days,

222
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,530
then Mr. Xu Guangyao, please give your blessing to us.

223
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,002
If I fail, then I'll give my blessing to them.

224
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:38,300
- <i>Commander Tan!</i>
- <i>Commander Tan! Say something more. </i>

225
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,400
- <i>Commander Tan, say something more!</i>
- <i>Commander Tan!</i>

226
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,480
- <i>Don't go!</i>
- <i>Commander Tan! Commander Tan!</i>

227
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,840
<i>[The Spark]</i>
What? Pei Shaojun went back to Beijing?

228
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,990
Why didn't he tell me?

229
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,914
Miss Tan,

230
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:54,240
you really don't regard yourself as an outsider.

231
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,700
What is your relationship with Shaojun?

232
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,480
Why should he tell you when he goes back to Beijing?

233
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,114
What is the relationship between him and me?

234
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:05,670
I'm pursuing him.

235
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:10,950
And he'll definitely accept my love.

236
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,910
I've never seen such a proactive girl like you.

237
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:20,399
Actually, some people are like bandages and are trying to stick to Sister Shuang.

238
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:22,869
Who are you talking about?

239
00:19:24,586 --> 00:19:26,711
A gentleman never argues with a lady.

240
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:28,608
I don't want to talk with you.

241
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:30,085
Stop!

242
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,700
Give me his address in Beijing.

243
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,627
I'll go badger him and I'll leave you alone. How about that?

244
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:41,420
How are there such shameless people like you in this world?

245
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,530
You're so in the right and self-confident about courting him.

246
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,516
Listen, Junior Marshal Su.

247
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:48,860
How about you give me Pei Shaojun's address in Beijing,

248
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,620
and I'll tell you where Sister Shuang

249
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,030
loves to go and have drinks.

250
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,614
Deal.

251
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,918
What did Tan Xuanlin say?

252
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:07,400
Our family's reputation

253
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,530
has been badly damaged no matter what he said!

254
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,930
Father, we can't believe the rumors.

255
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,230
Otherwise, those people who love gossip will have a good laugh at us.

256
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:22,254
Tell me. What did he say?

257
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,570
Tan Xuanlin didn't make a clarification. Instead…

258
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,320
He said publicly that he'll be pursuing Miss Mu.

259
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,619
He also said that if he can win Miss Mu's heart

260
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:34,530
in eight days before the engagement,

261
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,260
then you…

262
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:40,138
you would have to let her go.

263
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,680
Did you hear that? I told you before.

264
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,625
Where there is smoke, there is fire.

265
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:52,410
They have been having an illicit affair with each other for a long time, and only you were kept in the dark.

266
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,442
<i>[Miss Mu is getting married, but has an affair with Commander Tan]</i>

267
00:20:56,442 --> 00:20:58,500
- Junior Marshal.
- Let him go!

268
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,490
He never experienced anything ugly before, so he'll keep trusting people easily.

269
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,040
<i>[Miss Mu is getting married, but has an affair with Commander Tan]</i>

270
00:21:11,996 --> 00:21:13,660
Please come in.

271
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,550
Miss Mu, someone's here to see you.

272
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,330
I believe it's the movie star, Gu Yueshuang.

273
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,742
- Please let her in.
-Yes.

274
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:23,341
Please.

275
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,270
Miss Mu.

276
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,656
- Please sit.
- Thank you.

277
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,850
I'm not filming today. I was just around your place. I decided to drop in and have a cup of tea.

278
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,765
I don't believe this is a coincidence.

279
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:08,070
Miss Gu, we can speak freely.

280
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,150
You caught me. I'll get straight to it.

281
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,211
I've read the newspaper.

282
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,615
I've been by Young Uncle's side for many years.

283
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:24,030
He had his entire attention on military affairs.

284
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,000
I've never seen him cause such a big scandal because of these things.

285
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,469
And I don't understand.

286
00:22:29,469 --> 00:22:33,116
Pursuing Xu Guangyao's fiancée publicly in such a situation,

287
00:22:33,116 --> 00:22:34,990
what's the benefit for him?

288
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,880
He's so good at calculating.

289
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,260
Why did he do something like this?

290
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,789
Are you trying to ask whether he and I are together?

291
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,250
He's really good at war.

292
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,120
But for women, he's inexperienced.

293
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,330
So, Miss Mu, I wanted to ask you.

294
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:06,230
Are you using my young uncle because you don't want to marry Xu Guangyao?

295
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,620
You've been by his side for many years. You know him well.

296
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,290
Would he let any women use him like a fool?

297
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:28,430
He's my family and my savior.

298
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:34,700
I just don't think that it's his style to handle things in such a high-profile manner.

299
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,810
It's not your style to have a cup of tea at my home.

300
00:23:41,024 --> 00:23:44,584
Miss Gu, sometimes caring is not an advantage.

301
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:47,010
So you're saying...

302
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,311
he can throw everything away...

303
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,380
for you.

304
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,832
Is that right?

305
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:59,327
I can do the same for him.

306
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:12,932
Have some tea.

307
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,244
Supervisor Xu! Supervisor Xu!

308
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:16,500
- Commander.
- Brother Guangyao, what are you doing here?

309
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,050
Why do you do this to me?

310
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,660
I'm so honest with you.

311
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,960
Why did you play such a dirty trick on me?

312
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,342
Fine. You're being honest with me.

313
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,600
So I'll be honest with you.

314
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,700
Wanqing doesn't love you.

315
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,660
She loves me.

316
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,986
- That's impossible.
- Impossible?

317
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,790
See this?

318
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,330
You and Wanqing spent day and night in the office together.

319
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,020
You must remember the amulet she is wearing.

320
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,036
The amulets are from the Fayuan Temple.

321
00:26:14,036 --> 00:26:15,960
She asked for two amulets.

322
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:21,415
Who do you think you are?

323
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:25,027
I've known her for many years.

324
00:26:25,027 --> 00:26:28,130
I can die for her.

325
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,686
Who do you think you are to think that you deserve her?

326
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:31,580
I understand her.

327
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:39,660
Yes. You're God's favored one, and everybody follows you around.

328
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,930
But you don't understand her.

329
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,640
All grievances she had suffered for these past ten years.

330
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,600
And you don't understand her situation now in the Mu family.

331
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,850
When she was set up by Mu Wanting

332
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,560
and nearly raped by that scumbag Cui Jie,

333
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,380
how did you handle that?

334
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,970
All you did was keep her around you to be your personal secretary.

335
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,540
Has it ever occurred to you... that Wanqing is innocent?

336
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,960
Why make a concession? Why compromise?

337
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,980
What did I do for her?

338
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,310
I was willing to take down the people who hurt her.

339
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,050
So I deserve her.

340
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,750
So…

341
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,144
- So you've…
- Yes.

342
00:27:20,144 --> 00:27:22,657
I have had feelings for her a long time ago.

343
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,780
She can only be my woman for the rest of her life.

344
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,454
Let her go.

345
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,960
She and I are going to have a formal wedding,

346
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,170
an arranged marriage.

347
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,350
Do you think Mr. Mu will accept you to

348
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,700
be his son-in-law only by this amulet?

349
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,228
But she doesn't love you.

350
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:50,230
She'll love me!

351
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,212
Because I'll treat her really well after she marries me.

352
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,750
And she'll love me.

353
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,730
You are not this type of person.

354
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,430
Yes.

355
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:06,670
I've been gentle and humble since I was a child.

356
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,710
But this time,

357
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,864
I'm not going to let you have her.

358
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,850
It's not wrong for me to pursue the happiness I want.

359
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,300
What makes you think that I can't make her happy?

360
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,830
I can give her whatever you gave her.

361
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,850
I can also give her whatever you can't give her.

362
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,650
Why should I let her go?

363
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,201
Why?

364
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,200
Because she'll never love you!

365
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,994
I won't hit you back.

366
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,214
It's not because I'm in the wrong,

367
00:29:01,315 --> 00:29:03,733
it's because you don't know.

368
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:05,822
But I'm telling you.

369
00:29:05,822 --> 00:29:08,670
In this lifetime, you can only be her elder brother.

370
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,900
Because your family...

371
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,750
owes her an elder brother.

372
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:18,360
What do you mean?

373
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,070
Follow me and you'll find out.

374
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,600
The time of Mu Yuanheng's death

375
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,430
is when Xu Bojun started the bombing.

376
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:31,390
Brother Guangyao, you still won't let go?

377
00:30:32,668 --> 00:30:38,230
Do you think I'll believe you for something a gangster said?

378
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,029
What he said is not enough to prove anything.

379
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:43,920
I believe you know fairly well

380
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,626
of the consequence of framing my father.

381
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:48,054
Framing?

382
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,700
Fine.

383
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,884
Words are but wind, but seeing is believing.

384
00:31:29,691 --> 00:31:31,254
Father.

385
00:31:35,303 --> 00:31:39,165
Wanqing, you have provoked much discussion outside.

386
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:43,390
What's the story between you and Tan Xuanlin?

387
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,880
He said he'll compete with Guangyao.

388
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,688
Compete on what?

389
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,930
Tell me the truth.

390
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,830
What exactly is your relationship with him?

391
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,770
Is he badgering you?

392
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:00,803
If so, I'll find him. And make him apologize to you.

393
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:04,900
He didn't do that.

394
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:09,241
I like him.

395
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,100
He likes me, too.

396
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:18,070
You like him?

397
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,510
I always thought you liked Guangyao.

398
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,101
I always took Guangyao as my elder brother.

399
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:28,518
The person I like is Xuanlin.

400
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:34,050
Father.

401
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:37,520
Wanqing,

402
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,970
why didn't you tell me such an important thing?

403
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,400
You're soon going to be engaged with Guangyao.

404
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,550
Now you make it hard for me.

405
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,928
The military governor's mansion is losing face.

406
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:55,090
And the reputation of our family has been damaged.

407
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,610
I've been thinking of excuses to refuse this marriage.

408
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,100
But Military Governor Xu kept insisting.

409
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,860
So I wanted to tell you privately.

410
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,925
Wanqing, look.

411
00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:10,230
You're so smart in doing business

412
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:14,530
but so muddled when it comes to marriage.

413
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,246
He has offended the military governor's mansion.

414
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,980
So Military Governor Xu certainly will not let him go.

415
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,380
That's why Tan Xuanlin held the press conference immediately.

416
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,476
He was trying to protect me. To protect our family.

417
00:33:27,415 --> 00:33:30,070
He's a righteous man.

418
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,484
Wanqing,

419
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:41,350
I advise you not to be carried away by emotions.

420
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,530
If you choose Tan Xuanlin,

421
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:47,140
it won't be good for both of you.

422
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,680
You're taking care of our family business,

423
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,450
and you need the military governor's mansion to help you.

424
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,590
As for him,

425
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,300
he is only a newly inaugurated Commander of Shanghai.

426
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,850
And he offended the military governor's mansion. Now his position is precarious.

427
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,800
You refusing Guangyao to be with him,

428
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,616
will hurt him.

429
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,760
But Xuanlin said he won't lose.

430
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,526
I trust him.

431
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:31,378
Father.

432
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,810
You don't have to say anything. I know.

433
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,089
He is your father after all.

434
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:25,296
But he tried to assassinate Min Dacheng many times.

435
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:27,900
He even tried to kill Mu Wanting...

436
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,709
to cover up his crime.

437
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:35,068
Also,

438
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:36,930
you must have felt that

439
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:41,730
those assassins were going easy on you in the hospital.

440
00:35:52,304 --> 00:35:56,363
I believe you know what your father's like.

441
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,090
If you want to keep Wanqing alive,

442
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:03,190
don't tell anyone about what you saw or heard,

443
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,870
especially your father.

444
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,668
Commander Tan.

445
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:25,405
I have a question.

446
00:36:26,188 --> 00:36:27,954
I'm listening.

447
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:29,812
Do you really love her?

448
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,526
Yes.

449
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:34,251
How much?

450
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:48,270
I wasn't afraid of anything... until I met her.

451
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,420
Now, I know.

452
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,220
I'm afraid I'll die and she'll be heartbroken.

453
00:36:56,973 --> 00:36:59,504
And I'm afraid I'll lose.

454
00:36:59,504 --> 00:37:01,668
And I'm afraid that I can't make her happy.

455
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,029
Remember what you said today.

456
00:37:10,306 --> 00:37:12,136
Treat her well.

457
00:37:19,993 --> 00:37:22,959
Brother Guangyao, don't worry.

458
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:27,410
I'll keep her out of the darkness.

459
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,260
And find the light from

460
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,500
the darkness for her.

461
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,580
<i>♫ I immediately saw your charming face ♫</i>

462

00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,640

<i>♫ Let's embrace either during sunrise or sunset ♫</i>

480
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,200
<i>♫ In this world of chaos and confusion ♫</i>

481
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,800
<i>♫ I have exhausted my desolate life ♫</i>

482
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,353
<i>See you at the same place.</i>

483
00:38:56,353 --> 00:39:04,480
<i>♫ I'll sing with you on horseback ♫</i>

484
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:27,634
Go.

485
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:43,818
Brother Guangyao.

486
00:39:52,135 --> 00:39:53,802
I…

487
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,190
Commander Tan told me everything.

488
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,662
I know that...

489
00:40:05,799 --> 00:40:08,291
an apology is insignificant compared to...

490
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,590
the suffering you received.

491
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,267
But I still want to tell you that...

492
00:40:19,118 --> 00:40:21,438
I'm sorry, Wanqing.

493
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:24,268
Brother Guangyao,

494
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:28,456
you have nothing to do with what your father did.

495
00:40:28,456 --> 00:40:32,580
You shouldn't apologize to me.

496
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:41,320
I'm so happy that you are still willing to call me "brother."

497
00:40:42,364 --> 00:40:44,380
Don't say that.

498
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,642
You're really good.

499
00:40:45,642 --> 00:40:48,420
And you deserve admiration and love from others.

500
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:53,560
I'm so lucky that you can love me as your little sister.

501
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,239
Thank you very much.

502
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,387
You love him, right?

503
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,943
Then,

504
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,256
I'll give my blessing to you.

505
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,878
I'm going back to Yue City.

506
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,300
Can I hug you?
