Father.

16
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Don't worry yet.

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,700
Tan Xuanlin betraying us,

18
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,600
might not be a bad thing for us.

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,900
How could it not be bad?

20
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,200
I just appointed him as the City Guard of Jiang City.

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
And this is what he did.

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
What will others think of me?

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,200
People who don't know the truth will think I asked him to do so.

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
If the public opinion is really so,

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,300
why don't we just guide it according to the situation?

26
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,300
In fact, against the Revolutionary Army,

27
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,400
we don't have much experience in direct crossfires.

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,600
After all, the Pei Family lives in the north most of the time.

29
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,500
And the area along Yangtze River is Xu Bojun's territory.

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,000
Actually,

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,500
we don't have a profound hatred for them.

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,400
Now Xu Bojun has retired from his position,

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,600
and if the Revolutionary Army crosses the Yangtze River,

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,100
the Pei family will be their greatest opponent.

35
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,000
If we lose, we'll become their prisoners.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,700
Even we win, we'll also be further weakened.

37
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,200
If we seize the opportunity of Tan Xuanlin's betrayal,

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,500
we can show our goodwill to the Revolutionary Army

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,000
and negotiate with them.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,200
If we can reach an agreement, that would be good for everyone.

41
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
If we can't, it won't be too late for us

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,000
to go to war with them either.

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,100
Old Fu.

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,700
Commander. Commander.

45
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,500
You came here in such a hurry. Is there anything urgent?

46
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,000
Nothing is urgent.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
In our warehouse, we received a batch of new guns made in Germany.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,700
I noticed that the riflings on the ones our men use now are almost worn out.

49
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,400
- I want to replace them.
- That's definitely nice.

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
It's really different coming back home.

51
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Our equipment has been greatly upgraded.

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,900
Why did it take you so long to inspect the barracks?

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,100
- Is everything fine?
- Everything is fine.

54
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,500
But our stations are too scattered.

55
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,600
If I want to inspect each barrack, it'll take me two hours.

56
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,900
Are the barracks assigned to us by Liu Fu far away?

57
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,200
Don't mention it.

58
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,300
They are in all directions,

59
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,400
and none of them are close to each other.

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
I just think it's not easy for Liu Fu either.

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,900
It's good as far as he can arrange them for us.

62
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,300
Besides, the Tan Army has always been able to endure hardships,

63
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,700
so I don't worry about it.

64
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,800
Old Fu.

65
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,300
Please mark out all the locations of our army's barracks.

66
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,000
All right.

67
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
They are all here.

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Something is not right.

69
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,600
There are more than ten barracks with less than 200 people in each one.

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,000
The communication, transportation, and drill,

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,200
none of them are conveniently placed.

72
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,700
Liu Fu has been a leader in the army for more than ten years.

73
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,000
He shouldn't have arranged it like this.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,500
At first, we also felt it strange.

75
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
However,

76
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,600
Division Commander Liu took good care of us in all other things.

77
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,000
When our army just arrived in the city and he saw we didn't have new uniforms,

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,200
all 2,000 sets of newly-made uniforms were given to us by his order.

79
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,300
- Is this uniform of yours new?
- Yes, it is.

80
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,600
The soldiers just put them on today.

81
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,500
This uniform of yours, why is the color different from theirs?

82
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,200
He told me that they had used up the cloth they had before,

83
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,600
and the new cloth could not be shipped in yet.

84
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
That is why the color is different.

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,900
According to Division Commander Liu, when they get the new cloth,

86
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,800
they will change them for us.

87
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,300
This black spot here, which army does it represent?

88
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,600
This is a regiment of Division Commander Liu.

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
What about this?

90
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,700
This should be his guard camp.

91
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,500
Then this is his transport division.

92
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,300
Liu Fu has positioned his 20,000 men

93
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,000
to surround our 2,000.

94
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,600
It looks like the uniforms were made in order to

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,200
make it easy to distinguish us when he launches a mutiny.

96
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,400
Commander, you mean Liu Fu—

97
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,500
What about the weapons? Where are our weapons?

98
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,900
We have all the guns with us.

99
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,600
But the ammunition and heavy weapons are all in the warehouse.

100
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Hurry! Take me to the warehouse now!

101
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,100
- Don't let the others notice us.
- All right.

102
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,600
Let's go.

103
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,200
<i>[Jiang City Military Map]</i>

104
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,700
The keyhole has been filled with lead.

105
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,000
The problem will be noticed once someone comes to check it tomorrow.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,500
Damn. They plan on doing this.

107
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,400
So they will act tonight.

108
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,200
Tan Si. Old Fu. Get ready to fight!

109
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
Hold on!

111
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,000
No. It can't be tonight.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,900
I must take Wanqing out of the city.

113
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,500
I have to hold Liu Fu and buy some time.

114
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,600
Commander,

115
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,000
you should escort Miss Wanqing out of the city. You two leave together.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,100
Yes, Commander. Tan Si is right.

117
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,600
We'll escort you out of the city first.

118
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,400
No way!

119
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,600
Ever since I became a soldier,

120
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,900
I've never considered deserting.

121
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll find a way to get her out of the city

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,200
to Xu Guangyao.

123
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,700
Commander.

124
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,100
I have no other choice.

125
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,400
I know what you want to say.

126
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,300
Although I don't know if I can still be alive tomorrow,

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,200
she must survive.

128
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,300
By Marshal Xu's instruction,

129
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,500
we should take the final action tonight.

130
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,100
Tan Xuanlin's army

131
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,300
has been divided into twelve barracks

132
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,600
with less than 200 people each.

133
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,000
And the distance between any two barracks

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,400
is more than three miles.

135
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,700
They can't help each other at all.

136
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,700
Around each of their barracks, there are our troops.

137
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,200
Once we take action,

138
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,100
they will not be able to fight back.

139
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,700
Report!

140
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
What is it?

141
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,900
Division Commander, Tan Xuanlin is here.

142
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
Tan Xuanlin?

143
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,100
Could he have noticed something?

144
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,200
I'll go and find out.

145
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,600
If you notice anything wrong,

146
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,200
kill him immediately.

147
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,700
Yes, sir.

148
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,600
Commander Tan.

149
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,500
Why do you come here in person so late?

150
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
If you need anything, just call me

151
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,000
and I'll come to you.

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,400
Uncle Liu, you're so kind.

153
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,600
You are my elder.

154
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,800
I come to visit you so late at night,

155
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,200
and I feel sorry for that.

156
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,800
I'm here to ask a favor from you.

157
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,200
Can you clear away the mines near the wharf in Jiang City?

158
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,400
Tomorrow morning, I want Wanqing to go out of the city.

159
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,000
Miss Mu going out of the city at a time like this…

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,200
Where is she going?

161
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,000
She is going to see Xu Bojun's son, Xu Guangyao.

162
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,900
At this time,

163
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,500
won't it be too dangerous to go to Yue City?

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,300
Xu Guangyao is no longer in Yue City.

165
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,200
He has joined the Revolutionary Army.

166
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,900
He's just kept it from his father.

167
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,400
However, Wanqing has been his friend for a long time

168
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,600
and they have remained in touch.

169
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,800
So only Wanqing knows where he is.

170
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,900
Wanqing... she's going to see Xu Guangyao now?

171
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,700
Why?

172
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,900
Uncle Liu, as you know,

173
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,500
Xu Bojun has always regarded me as his enemy.

174
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,700
When something so big like this happened,

175
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,500
there was no reaction from Yue City.

176
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,900
I feel strange about that.

177
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,000
So I want Wanqing to see Xu Guangyao to get some details.

178
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,400
You are considerate, Commander Tan.

179
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,300
No problem.

180
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,700
I'll send my men to clear the mines and prepare the boat.

181
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,300
Tomorrow, I'll take Miss Mu out of the city.

182
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
All right. Thank you, Uncle Liu.

183
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,100
Then I won't bother you any longer.

184
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,400
Okay, Commander Tan. Take care.

185
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,000
All right.

186
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,400
Issue my order.

187
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,500
Our action is postponed to tomorrow night.

188
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,400
And send some reliable men to watch Mu Wanqing.

189
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,600
To find Xu Guangyao for Marshal Xu…

190
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,800
It will be another great achievement.

191
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,100
Yes, sir!

192
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,800
Let's go.

193
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,100
Commander, how was it?

194
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,600
Liu Fu indeed works for Xu Bojun.

195
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,050
He wants to take advantage of Wanqing's exit from the city

196
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,300
to find Xu Guangyao.

197
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,800
Then he can ask Xu Bojun for credit.

198
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,300
So he didn't hesitate to promise getting Wanqing out of the city.

199
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,600
Even so, we can only stall him for one day.

200
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,000
Tomorrow night, we'll be engaged in a fierce battle.

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Don't worry, Commander.

202
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,100
Even if we have only one man left,

203
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,000
with our last breath, we'll fight Liu Fu to the end.

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,800
Commander,

205
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,200
Miss Wanqing is still waiting for you in the City Guard Office.

206
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
What do you plan to do?

207
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:52,453
Go to the barracks first.

208
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:54,078
Yes, sir.

</i> Sorry, I can't. It's my treasure.

212

213

but also relieves worries.

214

And there are many other uses as well.

215

You are so stingy.

216
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:50,883
Didn't you get your payment?

219
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:09,642
Why haven't you gone to bed yet, Wanqing?

220
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:13,756
Aren't you a bit too busy, dear City Guard? You came back so late.

221
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:18,214
Just now, I was busy with the arrangement of soldiers.

222
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:19,651
There's too much to do.

223
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,615
Is everything settled then?

224
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,958
Yes, it's settled.

225
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,503
I made lotus seed soup. Will you have some?

226
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:27,057
Wanqing.

227
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:35,226
There's something I need your help with.

228
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:38,160
You can let me know.

229
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,679
Tomorrow morning, please get out of the city

230
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,101
and help me send a letter to Xu Guangyao.

231
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:48,204
Why do you suddenly want to send a letter to Brother Guangyao?

232
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,782
What's wrong?

233
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,224
<i>[City Guard Office of Jiang City]</i>

234
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:01,840
So Liu Fu wants to follow me in order to find Xu Guangyao,

235
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,100
and that was why he didn't take action tonight?

236
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,695
Yes.

237
00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:09,472
And the Telegraph Office is probably under his control already.

238
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:11,762
It's not safe. So you need to get out of the city.

239
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:13,511
At the moment, we can hold Liu Fu.

240
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:14,980
The second thing is,

241
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,060
I need you to ask Xu Guangyao to send men to help us.

242
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:22,523
But Liu Fu has 20,000 men, and you only have 2,000.

243
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:24,821
Can you hold on?

244
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,489
Liu Fu has been sick for quite some time.

245
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:31,358
And his soldiers haven't trained for a long time.

246
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:35,023
The Tan Army has been through many battles.

247
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,526
Holding on until Xu Guangyao comes to help won't be a problem.

248
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,114
But Brother Guangyao is in the front line of Huainan.

249
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:43,306
He can't come until the morning after tomorrow at the earliest.

250
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:46,928

Has your man ever lost a war?

252
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:57,754
It's fine. Don't worry.

253
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,422
A battle with fewer men is not something new to me.

254
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,615

How about we wait until you come back?

332
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,802
We…

333
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:32,114
We haven't had our cross-cupped wine yet.

334
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:36,081
If we don't drink cross-cupped wine on the wedding night, it will be unlucky.

335
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,462
Here.

336
00:21:57,597 --> 00:21:59,312
You want to make me drunk?

337
00:21:59,312 --> 00:22:01,125
Why would I do that?

338
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,724
If I get drunk,

339
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:06,068
you won't need to touch me.

340
00:22:07,497 --> 00:22:09,892
Then even if you die,

341
00:22:09,892 --> 00:22:12,226
I can still get married again.

342
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,600
I'll drink the cross-cupped wine.

343
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,500
But here's the deal.

344
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,200
Neither of us shall get drunk today.

345
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,200
Okay.

346
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,300
You can't escape this.

347
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,500
Really…

348
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,800
I've never seen a bride who is so eager as you.

349
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,300
I'm just taking off my husband's clothes.

350
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,500
It has nothing to do with others.

351
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,800
What are you doing?

352
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,300
These scars.

353
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,100
I'll check again when I come back.

354
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,700
If there's any new one, just wait to see how I will punish you.

355
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
I don't want to leave.

356
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,100
I want to stay with you.

357
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,500
I promised you a home.

358
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,100
We're going to have many children.

359
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,900
We're going to take family photos every year.

360
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,800
I don't want to leave you here alone.

361
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,300
Wanqing.

362
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,900
Promise me.

363
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,700
You must give the letter to Xu Guangyao

364
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,800
and ask him to send troops to help.

365
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,200
That's the only way we can hold Jiang City

366
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,400
and keep our home.

367
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,200
Then, children…

368
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,300
and family photos… we'll have them all.

369
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,500
For me…

370
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,100
only when you are by my side,

371
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,700
grow old with me,

372
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,500
and we watch our children grow up…

373
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,600
That's all I want.

374
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,000
If you are gone,

375
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,700
I will have nothing left.

376
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,200
You promised me a lifetime.

377
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,600
I don't want to have a single day less.

378
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,400
You have my word.

379
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,500
Not a single day less.

380
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,800
Have you kept the letter well?

381
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,300
Have you put on the safety amulet?

382
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,100
I've always been wearing it.

383
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,400
I asked for it for you, so it will work.

384
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,300
The bullets won't hit you even if they fly around you.

385
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,600
I believe you.

386
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,700
But I still don't want to leave you.

387
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,100
It's fine.

388
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,000
In two days at most, you will see me again.

389
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,400
And we will have a life so long, we won't miss a single day.

390
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,900
I have to go.

391
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,600
Liu Fu's soldiers are watching me.

392
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,800
- Wanqing.
- Please.

393
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,200
Wait for me!

394
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,000
Commander,

395
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,100
I can't imagine when Miss Wanqing reads the letter–

396
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,800
Get back to the barracks.

397
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,600
Prepare for battle.

398
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,500
Governor.

399
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
We received a message from Jiang City.

400
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,300
It said that Mu Wanqing went out of the city to see Junior Marshal.

401
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,000
<i>[Mu Wanqing knows Junior Marshal's position]</i>
He knows you worry about Junior Marshal.

402
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,800
So he postponed the action for a day.

403
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,700
And he sent his men to follow Mu Wanqing out of the city.

404
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,600
I believe we'll hear news about Junior Marshal soon.

405
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,200
I conquered the territory for him.

406
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,700
But he doesn't want it.

407
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,600
He would rather be a pawn for others.

408
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,200
Tell Liu Fu he must take action tonight.

409
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,300
If Tan Xuanlin is killed,

410
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,400
Jiang City will be his.

411
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,200
Yes, sir.

412
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,000
Governor.

413
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,400
Governor.

414
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,600
Go. Go find Guangyao.

415
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,200
Bring him back to me.

416
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,900
Even if you have to tie him up, you must bring him back.

417
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,000
Don't worry, Governor. I'll go there myself.

418
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,600
- I will bring Junior Marshal back.
- Good. Hurry.

419
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
<i>[Jiang City Military Map]</i>

420
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,100
After Chen Shaowu died,

421
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
his troop of more than 10,000 men

422
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,400
was integrated by Liu Fu.

423
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,100
A living depending on others won't be easy.

424
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,600
If we want to defeat more with less,

425
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,800
we must pull Chen Shaowu's soldiers to our side.

426
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,700
Good idea.

427
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,000
Take Chen Shaowu's men away.

428
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,200
Yes, sir! Move!

429
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,000
- Come out!
- Why do you arrest me?

430
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,200
- Why do you arrest me?
- Move!

431
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Officer, Chen Shaowu plotted a rebellion.

432
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,800
But we knew nothing about it.

433
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,500
Did you take the wrong person?

434
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,100
We were ordered by Division Commander Liu Fu

435
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,900
to strictly investigate Chen Shaowu's men.

436
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,120
Division Commander Liu Fu also has

437
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,600
a list of names from Chen Shaowu.

438
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,100
Tonight, we will make arrests according to the list.

439
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,500
For those involved, you'd better confess tonight

440
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,100
before it gets dark.

441
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,700
Maybe you can have a chance to be treated with leniency.

442
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,200
Arrest according to a list of names?

443
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,300
What kind of list? Could our names be on it?

444
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,600
Liu Fu can't possibly decide it all by himself, can he?

445
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,700
Wanqing.

446
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,400
My soldiers can't move right now.

447
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,300
Why can't they move?

448
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,700
Right now, we are

449
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,100
in a standoff with two divisions of the City Guard of Wuhu.

450
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,500
If I send my soldiers to Jiang City,

451
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,000
Huainan will fall into the hands of the enemy soon.

452
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But I've informed the headquarters.

453
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,600
The headquarters will soon send two regiments

454
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,200
to Jiang City as reinforcement.

455
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,000
But Liu Fu has 20,000 soldiers.

456
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,600
Two regiments are not enough at all.

457
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,900
Brother Guangyao.

458
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,500
You are Xuanlin's last hope.

459
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,100
Please save him.

460
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,100
Wanqing.

461
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,600
Some time earlier,

462
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,620
Liao Xi sent Commander Tan a front-line briefing.

463
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
I can't move any men,

464
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
and he already knew about it.

465
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,700
That's impossible.

466
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,300
He asked me himself to come to you for help.

467
00:33:41,105 --> 00:33:43,392
If that's the case, why did he write a letter to you?

468
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:46,006
What did he say in the letter? Give it to me.

469
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:48,980
- Give it to me! Give it to me!
- Wanqing, calm down.

470
00:34:09,496 --> 00:34:12,257
<i>Brother Guangyao, reading my words is like meeting me in person.</i>

471
00:34:12,257 --> 00:34:14,223
<i>Jiang City is in danger now because of a sudden change of situation.</i>

472
00:34:14,223 --> 00:34:16,220
<i>2,000 soldiers of the Tan Army and I</i>

473
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,131
<i>have been trapped in the city by the traitor Liu Fu and his 20,000 men.</i>

474
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:21,300
<i>We are outnumbered by the enemy and we are fighting alone.</i>

475
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,099
<i>Apart from victory and righteousness, I want nothing else.</i>

476
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:27,530
<i>Now that I've devoted myself to the revolution, I don't care if I can survive.</i>

477
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:31,525
<i>The only concern in my heart is Wanqing.</i>

478
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:36,368
<i>You've known her since childhood. You truly care about her.</i>

479
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,930
<i>We used to work together. Although we don't communicate much,</i>

480
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:42,138
<i>we respect each other and understand each other.</i>

481
00:34:42,138 --> 00:34:44,973
<i>If I die in battle, Wanqing will be in great pain.</i>

482
00:34:44,973 --> 00:34:48,534
<i>You are her only family. Please take good care of her.</i>

483
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:52,806
<i>Make her forget me and spend the rest of her life happily.</i>

484
00:34:54,608 --> 00:34:57,213
<i>After the revolution achieves success, if you can return to Shanghai,</i>

485
00:34:57,213 --> 00:34:59,128
<i>remember to take her to the old street for pan-fried buns</i>

486
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:00,914
<i>and go to She Mountain to see the night view.</i>

487
00:35:00,914 --> 00:35:02,392
<i>I owe her my company for a lifetime.</i>

488
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,712
<i>If I can't pay it back in this life, I hope you can do this for me.</i>

489
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:07,296
<i>Protect her and keep her safe.</i>

490
00:35:07,296 --> 00:35:09,476
<i>What is precious for people is understanding.</i>

491
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:11,905
<i>I don't think you'll let me down.</i>

492
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:14,635
<i>Farewell for now and forever. Thank you.</i>

493
00:35:14,635 --> 00:35:17,200
<i>Tan Xuanlin's last words.</i>

494
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,200
<i>[Tan Xuanlin's last words]</i>

495
00:35:21,898 --> 00:35:23,922
He lied to me.

496
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,325
He said he would live and wait for me to go back.

497
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:37,227
We just got married yesterday.

498
00:35:38,118 --> 00:35:41,022
He abandoned me today.

499
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:45,735
Wanqing.

500
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:50,561
I'm going back to Jiang City.

501
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,539
I can't let him stay there alone.

502
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:56,244
Wanqing.

503
00:35:56,817 --> 00:35:59,978
Calm down. We'll figure out a way.

504
00:35:59,978 --> 00:36:03,174
Division Commander, if we lose Huainan, we'll be punished by military law.

505
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:04,939
Shut up!

506
00:36:05,892 --> 00:36:07,753
We'll figure out another way.

507
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:12,691
Brother Guangyao, I know it's difficult for you.

508
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,319
I won't force you.

509
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,060
But Xuanlin is my husband.

510
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,400
I have to be with him.

511
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:27,670
Report!

512
00:36:28,368 --> 00:36:32,168
Division Commander, we caught a spy of Xu Bojun. He wants to see you.

513
00:36:32,168 --> 00:36:34,196
A spy? Did you find out who he is?

514
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:37,776
He said he is Xu Bojun's adjutant, Xu Yuan.

515
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:43,794
Wanqing, I know how to save Commander Tan.

516
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,661
Division Commander.

517
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:50,436
Xu Yuan, it's really you.

518
00:36:50,436 --> 00:36:53,487
Junior Marshal, I finally found you.

519
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:55,599
Did my father send you here?

520
00:36:56,878 --> 00:36:58,339
Yes, he did.

521
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,571
Is he all right?

522
00:37:03,118 --> 00:37:05,879
Governor is sick. Now, he's getting worse.

523
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:07,613
He can't get out of bed now.

524
00:37:07,613 --> 00:37:09,322
How could he suddenly be so ill?

525
00:37:09,322 --> 00:37:11,314
It's the old problem in his lungs.

526
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:15,636
He told me many times to bring you back.

527
00:37:15,636 --> 00:37:18,699
For the safety of the people in Yue City, he's willing to hold a peace talk.

528
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:21,974
Is my father willing to hold a peace talk?

529
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:23,776
He said he finally understands.

530
00:37:23,776 --> 00:37:26,150
He did all of this for you.

531
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,593
He doesn't want to lose his only son.

532
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:31,131
That will be the real failure.

533
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,661
Come back with me.

534
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:36,668
All right.

535
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:38,177
I'll go with you.

536
00:37:38,177 --> 00:37:41,760
<i>[City Guard Office]</i>

537
00:37:46,908 --> 00:37:50,688
At 9:00 in the evening, the signal will be three shots.

538
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:53,298
At the same time, we'll attack both the barracks of the Tan Army

539
00:37:53,298 --> 00:37:55,826
and the City Guard Office of Jiang City.

540
00:37:55,826 --> 00:37:57,600
We must crush the Tan Army in this battle.

541
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,936
Yes, sir!

542
00:37:58,936 --> 00:38:02,380
<i>[Jiang City is in Danger. Need Help.]</i>
<i>[Help them Immediately.]</i>

543
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,441
Give them my order. Jiang City is in danger.

544
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:10,716
Everyone sorts out the equipment within ten minutes and sets off immediately.

545
00:38:10,716 --> 00:38:12,382
Yes, sir!

546
00:38:21,213 --> 00:38:22,974
Report!

547
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,956
Report. Jiang City is in danger. They need our reinforcement.

548
00:38:27,956 --> 00:38:31,336
Everyone, turn back! To the direction of Jiang City!

549
00:38:31,336 --> 00:38:33,524
Run forward!

550
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:46,940
Old Fu, take your men to capture the armory and get the heavy weapons and ammunition.

551
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,000
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

552
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,410
- Machine Gun Company!
- Sir!

553
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,500
You must take the clock tower, the highest spot in the city.

554
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,620
- Send your best machine gunners up there.
- Yes, sir!

555
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,696
- Guard Camp.
- Sir!

556
00:38:54,696 --> 00:38:56,180
Protect the City Guard Office.

557
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,020
- Prevent Liu Fu from sneaking up on you.
- Yes, sir!

558
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,860
The rest of you. Concentrate your firepower and destroy Liu Fu's base.

559
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,440
To catch all followers, capture the leader first. Bring him to me alive or bring me his body.

560
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,261
Yes, sir!

561
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,556
All right. Every evening, Liu Fu's men patrol the barracks at 8:00.

562
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,267
If they take action today, they will surely do it after the patrol

563
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,929
when they can confirm that everything is normal.

564
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:18,860
So we must take a chance before their action to complicate their situation.

565
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,662
- Understood?
<i>- Yes, sir!</i>

566
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,580
<i>[NO FIRE]</i>

567
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:45,865
It's the last room.

568
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:48,396
Go back to work after it's finished here.

569
00:39:54,295 --> 00:39:56,055
Why did you put it here?

570
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:57,860
Hey!

571
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:00,449
I'm talking to you!

572
00:40:10,337 --> 00:40:11,698
Drop your weapons!

573
00:40:11,698 --> 00:40:13,716
What do you want?

574
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,661
Report!

575
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,496
- What is it?
- Division Commander.

576
00:40:35,496 --> 00:40:37,871
Chen Shaowu's soldiers rebelled.

577
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,922
Take Miss Mu into the room.

578
00:40:45,922 --> 00:40:48,183
Don't let her go anywhere. I'm going to see my father first.

579
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:49,684
Yes, sir.

580
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:51,758
This way, please.

581
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,420
Report!

582
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,889
Chen Shaowu's soldiers have taken action.

583
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,981
Good. Follow the plan.

584
00:40:58,981 --> 00:41:00,473
Yes, sir.

585
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,105
Military Governor, I have brought Junior Marshal back.

586
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:09,352
Father.

587
00:41:16,498 --> 00:41:18,359
Son.

588
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,000
You're finally willing to come back.

589
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,270
Finally, the Xu family can have heirs.

590
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:29,650
Father, are you really willing to have a peace talk?

591
00:41:32,983 --> 00:41:36,044
Come here. Sit down.

592
00:41:39,526 --> 00:41:41,911
I can agree to peace with Pei Xun

593
00:41:42,493 --> 00:41:45,613
and I can surely have it with the Revolutionary Army, too.

594
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:51,026
Whether to fight or talk, it is just a method.

595
00:41:51,026 --> 00:41:53,720
As long as we have the territory and military power,

596
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,120
we have nothing to be afraid of.

597
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,137
And I got a big bargaining chip for you.

598
00:41:59,672 --> 00:42:01,633
A bargaining chip?

599
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,028
Jiang City is about to be ours.

600
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,920
If the Revolutionary Army wants to cross the Yangtze River,

601
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,864
they'll definitely pass through Jiang City.

602
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:13,161
You tell me.

603
00:42:13,161 --> 00:42:16,614
Is this a big bargaining chip or not?

604
00:42:18,716 --> 00:42:21,096
If I want to talk with them,

605
00:42:21,096 --> 00:42:23,129
I'd better have a position.

606
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:26,259
But now I'm only a supervisor in the Command of Shanghai.

607
00:42:26,259 --> 00:42:29,320
And I don't have an official position in Yue City.

608
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,946
Without proper authority, I can't do it properly either.

609
00:42:39,902 --> 00:42:44,953
The military and political power in Yue City will be given to you sooner or later.

610
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,540
Nothing is irregular about this.

611
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:52,741
Go and fetch my Marshal Seal for me.
