My Lord, look. What do you think of this fabric? Is it suitable for making dresses?

16
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,270
- What do you think?
- It's not bad.

17
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,289
So that's it.

18

Hurry up. Come here.

We just received some fabrics that were sent from abroad.

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,416
Come pick one. See if there's anything you like.

23
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,150
Come here. Sit down.

24
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:02,510
Right.

25
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,810
Didn't you go see Commander Tan?

Is everything all right?

27
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:11,451
Everything is fine. I just took his suitcase by mistake.

28
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:13,195
So I sent it back.

29
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:15,170
That's good.

30
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,060
When he sent you and Brother Guangyao back this morning,

31
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,560
why didn't he take the case then?

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,460
You didn't need to go to find him alone.

33
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,070
Thinking of it, you two seem to be meant for each other.

34
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,850
You took the boat back to Shanghai together,

35
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,290
and you accidentally took each other's luggage.

36
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,970
During the party, he even kidnapped you as a hostage.

37

If we didn't know the truth,

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,020
we would think that you and Commander Tan made up.

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,390
- This kid!
- Sister Wanting,

40
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,970
if you had admitted your relationship with Brother Guangyao last time,

41
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,330
the person Commander Tan would have taken away would have been you.

42
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,670
Sister, I was just kidding.

43
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,780
How can you say that?

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,936
Wanting, you shouldn't talk like that.

45
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:56,700
It's not funny.

46
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,930
I won't make you a dress. I will make one for Wanqing.

47
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,468
Wanqing, do you like this one?

48
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,422
Wanqing, Wanting didn't mean it.

49
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:09,650
Don't take it seriously.

50
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,000
You, your Aunt Cui, and Wanting,

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,144
go choose some fabric so that we can make dresses for each of you.

It's not appropriate that I go to see you.

Young Uncle, your office is so stylish.

You brought me here, but aren't you afraid of being seen?

You are so pretty. Why would I be afraid of being seen with you?

Don't worry. As long as I'm here,

all of Shanghai will respect you.

I can earn respect on my own. I don't need your help.

So what? I'm still older than you.

Supervisor Xu, come here. Sit down, please.

98
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:39,477
Supervisor Xu, Governor Xu is already on the train, right?

99
00:06:39,477 --> 00:06:42,547
Is he still mad at me?

100
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:44,390
Don't worry, Commander Tan.

101
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,180
As long as you keep your promise, my father will forget the past and move on.

102

That's so good. I appreciate your father's kindness.

I, Tan Xuanlin, am a grateful man.

As long as you speak up, I will do everything for you.

106
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,770
Commander Tan, I don't think these are important. It's mainly about—

107
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,884
I know. I know what you're going to say.

108
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:11,752
It's about the renovation of your old house.

109
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:14,150
I found you the best craftsman in Shanghai.

110
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,880
Come, follow me. I'll show you.

111
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,209
I also built a bedroom in your office.

112
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:22,303
Let's go take a look. This office is absolutely unique.

113
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:24,414
Commander Tan. I think—

114
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:26,580
Hey, listen to me.

115
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,368
I even hid a little secret in there.

116
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:31,616
Let's go. Hurry.

117
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:38,350
Here it is. As you can see,

118
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,330
here is your office.

119
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,160
I bought these in Hong Kong. These are of the best quality.

120
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,240
This is the bedroom. You have a big bed here.

121
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,486
This is made of fine red rosewood.

122
00:07:55,486 --> 00:07:58,389
I also bought you an American mattress.

123
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:03,450
What's the brand name again? It's called... Simmons.

124
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,650
Come here. Feel it. It's super comfortable.

125
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,510
It's wide enough. It's soft enough.

126
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,456
No matter how many women, you can sleep with all of them here.

127
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,630
Commander Tan, this is an office.

128
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,680
Look at me.

129
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,366
Right. We must be careful.

130
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:32,050
So, I made a secret door between the office and the bedroom.

131
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,763
You won't even notice it at all.

132
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:36,683
And the soundproof feature is particularly good.

133
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,460
I came to Shanghai to assist you in managing the defense of the city,

134
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,519
not to sleep with women.

135
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,600
Supervisor Xu,

136
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,080
don't be so serious. You also have your requests.

137
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,896
My point is... Since we made the regulations,

138
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:54,980
we have to take action immediately.

139
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,340
I'll decide how to deploy soldiers and how to spend the money.

140
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,150
As for the dissolution of the Tan Army,

141
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,480
I'm afraid you have to deal with it yourself, Commander Tan.

142
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,160
I don't usually make many requests about my living habits.

143
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,416
- Just a camp bed is fine.
- A camp bed?

144
00:09:11,453 --> 00:09:13,993
Okay, a camp bed is good.

145
00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:16,836
Supervisor Xu, you know a lot.

146
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:18,350
I'll do it right away.

147
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,550
Tan Si! Shuang'er!

148
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,780
Let's go. Let's go buy a bed for Supervisor Xu.

149
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,380
Commander.

150
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,686
For things like shopping, you can just give me the instructions.

151
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:54,930
You don't need to do it yourself.

152
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,383
You don't understand.

153
00:09:57,383 --> 00:10:01,250
I just don't want to be alone with Xu Guangyao.

154
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,836
Why?

155
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,670
Every time he comes to see me,

156
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,540
all he wants to talk about is

157
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,860
the dissolution of the Tan Army.

158
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,430
I'll hide from him for a few days.

159
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,020
Anyway, you're going to overtly agree but covertly oppose.

160
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,428
Why don't you just agree with him? There's no need to hide.

161
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:22,886
If I agree too quickly,

and then he'll put pressure on me.

165

I will compromise at that time.

166
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,420
That will make him feel that I compromised under pressure.

167

That way, he won't be suspicious.

You can hide from him now, but you can't hide forever.

Is this what you are looking for?

321
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
My brother's jade!

322
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,720
Catch it!

323
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,123
You!

324
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,900
The belongings of people who have died are fragile.

325
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,720
Apologize!

326
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,190
Why should I do that? You didn't catch it yourself.

327
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,160
You can be rude to me, but you can't insult my brother.

328
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,250
- Apologize!
- I did nothing wrong. Let me go!

329
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,750
Mu Wanting, don't push me again

330
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,780
or I won't spare you!

331
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,390
Scram.

332
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,950
<i>Kind people are always bullied.</i>

333
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,930
<i>Mother, I'll never sit still</i>

334
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,490
<i>and let them bully me.</i>

335
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,130
Have a look! New books!

336
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,180
Masterpieces! Have a look.

337
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,270
Madam, take a look.

338
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,660
Sir, do you want an umbrella?

339
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,720
<i>Steamed stuffed buns.</i>

340
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,280
I want to eat this. I want to eat this.

341
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,300
Seriously? You... don't need to stay in shape anymore?

342
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,630
Are you not afraid of looking fat under the camera?

343
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,792
Did you forget?

344
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:36,116
When you picked me up on the battlefield,

345
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:38,656
you gave me a sugar bun.

346
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:03,553
<i>What are you doing?</i>

347
00:23:03,553 --> 00:23:05,610
<i>Where are your parents?</i>

348
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,290
<i>They're both dead.</i>

349
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,296
<i>Eat it.</i>

350
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,860
You saved my life.

351
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,440
For me, this is the most delicious food in the world.

352
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,566
Fine. If you want, I'll buy it.

353
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:36,480
Boss, pack all of these.

354
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,290
Okay.

355
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,800
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

356
00:23:46,924 --> 00:23:50,170
- Tan Si, accompany Shuang'er around. I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

357
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,420
Where are you going?

358
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,820
I have something to do. Tan Si will be with you.

359
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,880
<i>[Baoli Pawnshop]</i>

360
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:15,696
Miss, what do you want?

361
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:18,816
Boss, please take a look.

362
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:22,180
Can you fix this jade pendant?

363
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:26,779
Can you fix it?

364
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:30,156
In my pawnshop, the skill of repairing jewelry

365
00:24:30,156 --> 00:24:32,510
is the best in Shanghai.

366
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,900
But the labor cost for broken jade is very high,

367
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,210
and the price will be expensive.

368
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,970
The price doesn't matter. Please fix this jade.

369
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:44,236
Two hundred silver dollars.

370
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:47,726
Okay.

371
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,180
Boss, take a look. Look at this jewelry.

372
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:07,183
This is one thousand silver dollars at most.

373
00:25:07,183 --> 00:25:08,570
One thousand?

374
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,630
Impossible. These all are from my mother's dowry.

375
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,216
This necklace is worth tens of thousands of silver dollars.

376
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,946
Miss, you see.

377
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:18,580
This jewelry just looks good and seems expensive.

378
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,430
Actually, these jewels are made of small diamonds. They aren't valuable.

379
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:26,000
Besides, these days, jewelry isn't a necessity.

380
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,150
I'm willing to give you a thousand silver dollars.

381
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,010
It's already very high.

382
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,170
<i>Could it be Cui Lianfeng did something to the jewelry?</i>

383
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,740
Boss, can you offer a higher price?

384
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,270
Sorry, I can't. One thousand silver dollars is the highest price I can offer.

385
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,870
Please check it carefully.

386
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,564
- I'm sorry. This–
- Hey.

387
00:25:44,564 --> 00:25:47,730
Isn't this the wealthy Miss Mu?

388
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,670
Why is it you again?

389
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,040
What a coincidence. If I wasn't here,

390
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,420
I wouldn't have known that you've been reduced to selling jewelry.

391
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,670
Miss, have you considered it?

392
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,640
Will you sell it or not?

393
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,603
Are these all yours?

394
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,630
They are my mother's.

395
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,890
Why don't you keep it for yourself?

396
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:12,590
Miss, if you regret it, you can take them back.

397
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,130
I'll sell them. I can't pay you if I don't sell them.

398
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,960
Okay.

399
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,940
Boss, how much does this girl owe you?

400
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,230
Two hundred silver dollars.

401
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:26,470
Okay. Tomorrow, you can get the money at the Defense Command of Shanghai.

402
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,323
Just say that Commander Tan approved it.

403
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:30,860
You are the commander!

404
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,110
You don't have to pay. I can't take your money.

405
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,550
- No.
- I can't take your money.

406
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,780
I'll give you the money she owes you.

407
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,396
Thank you, Boss.

408
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,070
Why do you keep following me?

409
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,300
I'm not.

410
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,580
Are you stalking me?

411
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,950
Why would I do that?

412
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:03,090
Oh, right. That fake fiancé of yours lives in the command center now.

413
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,890
If I go back, he'll talk official business with me.

414
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,310
I don't want to talk about that.

415
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,570
Well, don't tell him you met me here.

416
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,530
Why won't you talk to him about official business?

417
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,220
Why would I do that?

418
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,730
Look at the scenery of Shanghai. The extravagant feasting and revelry.

419
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,043
Smell it. In the air, the smell is like luxury and dissipation.

420
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,320
I will return the money that I owe you.

421
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,950
How? As a little girl, don't push yourself so hard.

422
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,040
You have no choice.

423
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,640
Who told you I have no choice?

424
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,920
I have many ways.

425
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,676
Like what?

426
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,165
Sell yourself?

427
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,910
<i>Take a look! Take a look!</i>

428
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,910
<i>Come take a look!</i>

429
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,360
Who is that?

430
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,840
She's the daughter of Mu Zhiyuan, the President of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.

431
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,620
She's Mu Wanqing.

432
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,480
I'll tell you the same thing.

433
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,200
You're weak in the Mu family and you can't find support.

434
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,620
You need me and I happen to need you, too.

435
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,370
This is your mother's heirloom. Keep it.

436
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,110
You don't have money either. Why are you paying for me?

437
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,680
Funny.

438
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,930
What I lack are military funds, which is huge.

439
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,990
These two hundred silver dollars are not important.

440
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,570
Of course. This is what I lent to you.

441
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,860
You have to pay me back with interest.

442
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,030
So this is what you want.

443
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,240
You already knew I couldn't get the fifty thousand silver dollars,

444
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,570
and you showed up when I was desperate.

445
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,363
Good. I like to work with smart people.

446
00:28:41,363 --> 00:28:45,010
But I won't work with you. I just want to live a peaceful life.

447
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,900
I will give you the money. Forget everything else.

448
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
A peaceful life?

449
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,860
You have to ask if your stepmother agrees.

450
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,460
Don't be fooled by others and help them count money.

451
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,450
I'm above it all. I'm not like you.

452
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,680
You are full of schemes.

453
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,430
Are you hungry?

454
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,156
I'm not.

455
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,036
I see. It's time to eat.

456
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,020
I just helped you. Have a meal with me.

457
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,500
<i>[Defense Command of Shanghai]</i>

458
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,810
Junior Marshal, Tan Xuanlin said that he would be back in an hour.

459
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,330
What time is it now?

460
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,200
He makes irresponsible remarks and has no credibility.

461
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,403
Don't worry. He wants to procrastinate.

462
00:29:44,403 --> 00:29:46,450
I'll wait for him.

463
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,316
Anyway, he'll be back sooner or later.

464
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,740
<i>Take a look.</i>

465
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,340
<i>Do you have Crab Yolk Bun?</i>

466
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,000
- Is it good?
- <i>I'll pack it up for you.</i>

467
00:30:17,203 --> 00:30:21,290
Right. What were you going to get repaired at the pawnshop today?

468
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,853
It's not your business.

469
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:24,420
Okay.

470
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,270
Two hundred silver dollars.

471
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,120
My brother's jade pendant is broken.

472
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,840
My mother's last wish was to have it buried with her.

473
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,450
So, I went to the pawnshop to get it fixed.

474
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,310
You're too careless.

475
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,140
Never mind.

476
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,650
Is it what I think it is?

477
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,910
It's your stepmother and sister…

478
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,030
Let me say it again. Don't interfere with my family affairs.

479
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:01,350
Don't think that since you paid for me, I'll work with you.

480
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,150
You just want to use me.

481
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:10,350
Let's see when I get the chance.

482
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,430
Be careful.

483
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,260
Yes, Madam.

484
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,100
Xiaocui, hurry up.

485
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,440
Okay.

486
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,220
Wanqing, you're back?

487
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,690
- Aunt Cui.
- Wanqing,

488
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:28,120
during these terrible times, if you hadn't come back,

489
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,730
I'd have to send someone to find you again.

490
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,200
I had something to do outside.

491
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,930
I haven't been back for so many years. I almost lost my way.

492
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,910
It seems like Commander Tan sent you home.

493
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:43,180
It seems the two of you have been pretty close.

494
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,120
I met him at Qi Bao.

495
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,950
He was helping Brother Guangyao buy furniture. So he sent me back along the way.

496
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,090
Buy furniture?

497
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,530
It seems that the Xu family's old house is being renovated,

498
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,840
so Brother Guangyao is temporarily living in the command center.

499
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,400
Then I'll go back to my room and rest now.

500
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,230
Are you hungry? Can I get you something to eat?

501
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,440
No need. Thank you, Aunt Cui.

502
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,330
Okay, go get some rest.

503
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:17,830
<i>It seems that my behavior here is being monitored by her.</i>

504
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,140
- You're drunk now. Don't go.
- Right.

505
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,400
Hurry up. I still need to talk with Supervisor Xu

506
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,700
- about official business!
- Slow down. Slow down.

507
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,020
<i>- Hurry up.
- Fine, fine. What are...</i>

508
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,360
<i>- Supervisor Xu!</i>
- How about we go back?

509
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,750
- He's already drunk.
- Slow down.

510
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,520
No. I'm going to talk with Brother Guangyao about official business.

511
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,890
Slow down. Commander!

512
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,670
Supervisor Xu, I'm so sorry.

513
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,120
I didn't pay attention and he got drunk.

514
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,040
When he came back, he started speaking nonsense.

515
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,480
But he still wanted to come to see you. As y-you see...

516
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,230
- Supervisor Xu.
- This way.

517
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,220
Here.

518
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,960
I'm sorry.

519
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,640
Supervisor Xu, I'm here to talk with you about official business today.

520
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,330
You're drunk. We shouldn't talk.

521
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,210
Who are you?

522
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,830
Don't you see that I'm talking with Supervisor Xu?

523
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,210
Why did you interrupt me?

524
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,460
Calm down.

525
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,500
You don't know the rules...

526
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,330
Guangyao,

527
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,880
go ahead. I'm listening.

528
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,760
I'm sorry, Supervisor Xu. How about you two talk tomorrow?

529
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,430
He vomits easily when he gets drunk.

530
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,100
If he vomits in your office, it's not good.

531
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,940
I'll get him to bed. Okay?

532
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,500
It seems that he's really drunk.

533
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,350
So we'll wait until he wakes up tomorrow.

534
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,840
Take him to bed now.

535
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,450
Remember to keep someone close to him at night.

536
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,760
I'm not drunk.

537
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,330
Enough, Commander.

538
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,730
- Don't pull me. Don't pull me, Tan Si.
- Okay.

539
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,350
- I'm talking with Supervisor Xu.
- I'm sorry.

540
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,160
I'm sorry.

541
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,560
I'm sorry, Supervisor Xu.

542
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,300
- Supervisor Xu, wait for me!
- Let's leave.

543
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,570
- Wait for me!
- I'm sorry.

544
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,680
Wait for me, and I'll talk with you!

545
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,970
Wait for me, I'll talk with you right away.

546
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:25,150
He knew you were waiting for him, and he still got drunk.

547
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,870
He doesn't value you at all.

548
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:31,230
Do you really think he's actually drunk?

549
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,590
Slow down, Commander.

550
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,070
I'm not finished yet.

551
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,820
- I'm talking official business.
- Okay. Miss Shuang'er, help him.

552
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,920
Be careful.

553
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,280
Talking official business...

554
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,310
Be careful, slow down.

555
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,530
Talking official business.

556
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,380
Superstar, what do you think?

557
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,290
How's my acting?

558
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,140
Your acting skills are amazing!

559
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,220
The male actors in our company are not as good as you.

560
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,680
Of course.

561
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,620
Our Commander shows one side to others and another side in private.

562
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,970
There's no one who can do the same.

563
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,620
I feel sorry for that Supervisor Xu.

564
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,320
He waited for you for a whole day, and he asked Tan Si to take care of you.

565
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,870
Such a good person.

566
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,480
He can't beat you at all.

567
00:35:25,396 --> 00:35:27,346
You have more things to learn.

568
00:35:27,346 --> 00:35:28,930
Do you think he believed me?

569
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,800
He only pretended to believe me.

570
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,020
So both of you are acting?

571
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,700
This is not acting.

572
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,010
It's called meeting my competitor.

573
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,250
Tan Si, get me some water.

574
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,080
<i>[The Sincere Co. Ltd]</i>

575
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,680
<i>[Supervisor Office]</i>

576
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,530
Does Guangyao live here?

577
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,120
Yes.

578
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,320
Guangyao, your office is really nice.

579
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,170
But no matter how nice it looks, it's not your home.

580
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,980
Guangyao, since you were a child, as long as you came to Shanghai,

581
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,320
you would live in the Mu mansion.

582
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,790
Thank you, Madam Cui.

583
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,320
I appreciate that.

584
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,270
I'm afraid Commander Tan will misunderstand

585
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,100
and think he is treating me badly.

586
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,870
You always think of others.

587
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:44,830
You care about him, but he doesn't care about you.

588
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,870
Besides, what if he brings back a woman?

589
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,660
You'll be embarrassed.

590
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,930
You look thinner.

591
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,250
- I told you to change into another dress.
- Doesn't it look good?

592
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,200
Yes. But the position of the slit is too high.

593
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,480
Commander Tan.

594
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,370
Hello.

595
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,500
Hello, Madam Mu.

596
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,350
Madam Mu.

597
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,000
Supervisor Xu, I asked her to come and get something.

598
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,690
What? Get what?

599
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,960
Anything is okay. Go ahead.

600
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,570
Go.

601
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,960
It seems that I inconvenienced Commander Tan.

602
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,930
No. No, you didn't.

603
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,130
That's my little sister.

604
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:51,240
Commander Tan, you seem to have so many sisters.

605
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,740
Commander Tan, you don't have to force yourself.

606
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,970
My old house is currently being renovated,

607
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,850
and I'll be able to live there in two months.

608
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,380
I'll move to the Licha Hotel first.

609
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,310
Our lives will not interfere with each other. It's convenient for both of us.

610
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,050
You didn't interfere with my life.

611
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:08,120
If you go out like this, people will think I drove you out.

612
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,070
Besides, two months is a long time.

613
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,020
You can't live in a hotel for two months.

614
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,250
Yes, right.

615
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,920
And this hotel is in the concession.

616
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,110
It's not easy to get in and out.

617
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:21,350
My soldiers can't get in. If something happens to you, how would I face Governor Xu?

618
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,040
Guangyao,

619
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,620
don't make it harder on Commander Tan.

620
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,550
You can move to the Mu mansion and live with us.

621
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,960
First, the Mu family and Xu family have a good relationship.

622
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,980
If you live there, no one will gossip.

623
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,130
- Second.
- Yes.

624
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,530
it is also close to the command.

625
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,900
It's convenient for you to get in and out.

626
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,020
When the old house is finished with renovations, you can go back there.

627
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,270
Madam Mu's right.

628
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:48,393
Supervisor Xu, I won't worry about you if you live there.

629
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:50,463
That's right.

630
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,970
- Thank you, Madam Mu.
- You're welcome.

631
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,900
Supervisor Xu, see Madam Mu out first.

632
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,570
I have something to do first. I won't see you out.

633
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,960
Okay.

634
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,260
Commander Tan.

635
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,290
We still have official business to talk about. Did you forget?

636
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,230
Give me some time. I will definitely give you an answer.

637
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,890
At least you can tell me what you plan on doing.

638
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,330
If you move to the Mu mansion,

639
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,690
Miss Wanting will pester you all the time.

640
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,070
In my opinion,

641
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,440
you would be more comfortable living in the hotel.

642
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,040
Today, Madam Mu invited me

643
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,470
and Tan Xuanlin also agreed.

644
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:11,390
If I don't go, I will offend them both.

645
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,360
The governor told me

646
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,230
you must monitor Tan Xuanlin regarding the dissolution of the Tan Army.

647
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:20,420
At this time, Tan Xuanlin spoke so enthusiastically for Madam Mu,

648
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,170
he must want to distract you and do something behind your back.

649
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,600
It's okay.

650
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,200
Anyway, during the day, I will also work at the headquarters.

651
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,410
No matter what he wants to do, I will find everything out the same.

652
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,040
Junior Marshal,

653
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,590
I think since Miss Wanqing came back,

654
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,340
your thoughts have gone to the Mu mansion.

655
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,960
What are you talking about?

656
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,140
I was wondering

657
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,390
why you were willing to stay here as supervisor.

658
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,240
You must have done this for Miss Wanqing.

659
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,320
I didn't stay because of her.

660
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,420
It's just that I'm also in Shanghai.

661
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,096
And I can take care of her.

662
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,710
It has been ten years since she left home

663
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,310
and her mother has passed away.

664
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,070
If there is an acquaintance by her side,

665
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,180
it would be comforting for her.

666
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,120
Commander,

667
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,330
a pawnshop guy came just now.

668
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,240
He brought this bill and said that you owe him two hundred silver dollars.

669
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,610
Yes.

670
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:26,690
I do owe him two hundred silver dollars.

671
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,920
This bill, not only do I have to sign it,

672
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,870
I also have to stamp it.

673
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,770
For this kind of bill, why do you need to use the command's stamp?

674
00:41:47,617 --> 00:41:51,250
The money I spent must be well-documented.

675
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,850
