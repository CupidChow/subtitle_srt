Six.

16
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:38,936
I like six. It's a good number.

17
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:40,815
Let's do this.

18
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:42,780
She drinks one,

19
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,600
then you drink six for her. Okay?

20
00:01:48,386 --> 00:01:51,510
Don't bother, Supervisor Xu.

21
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:54,349

Waiter!

27
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,830
It seems like your boss isn't that sincere.

28
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,370
You'd better drink it yourself.

29
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:29,597
Come on, come on.

30
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:40,149
Miss Mu, originally, he was supposed to help you drink this bottle of wine.

31
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:42,380
But I haven't enjoyed drinking with him.

32
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,202
Come on.

33
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:46,910
How about we drink together?

34
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,290
Fine, I will.

35
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,775
I will.

36
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:52,011
No stopping until we're drunk.

37
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,160
Your Moutai actually feels more gentle the more you drink.

38
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,490
You'll get used to it if you drink several more glasses.

39
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,852
All right.

40
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,143
Here.

41
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,441
Another one to you, Mr. Executive Director.

42
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,294
All right.

43
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,088
I can't drink anymore. I can't.

44
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:36,486
I'll keep drinking.

45
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:39,768
All right, all right. Then let's go home and drink, okay?

46
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,080
I'll keep drinking.

47
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,440
Let's go home then.

48
00:05:54,173 --> 00:05:56,000
Wanqing,

49
00:05:56,548 --> 00:05:58,556
don't be afraid.

50
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,850
I will... always protect you.

51
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,603
What are you doing here?

52
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:34,000
I should ask you the same.

53
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,410
What are you doing here?

54
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,140
Are you trying to destroy my plan?

55
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,849
What do you mean by that?

56
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:42,176
I'm here to help Supervisor Xu with the reorganization of the Tan Army.

57
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:45,440
Earlier I had talked with Executive Director Fay about building up a local militia.

58
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,957
Just a moment later, you came to destroy it.

59
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,976
But you never told me that you wanted to build up a militia.

60
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,006
Tell you?

61
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:53,292
If I had told you, he wouldn't need to check anymore.

62
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,040
You don't trust me.

63
00:06:57,153 --> 00:07:00,540
I only believe what I see with my eyes.

64
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,580
Today when you asked about my injury,

65
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,020
was it just to find information for him?

66
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,997
So you sent someone to spy on me.

67
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:09,670
Yes, I did send someone to follow you.

68
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,320
Otherwise, how would you have gotten the plain water on the table?

69
00:07:24,497 --> 00:07:27,020
Did you change the alcohol into water?

70
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,880
Nonsense.

71
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,690
Who knows what would have happened if you got drunk

72
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,060
with Xu Guangyao…

73
00:07:52,935 --> 00:07:55,530
So in your mind, I am such a person.

74
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,320
Since you don't trust me at all,

75
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,670
I suggest a drink to you then.

76
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,030
From now on, our partnership is over.

77
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:37,791
Wanqing, are you all right?

78
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,499
Fine.

79
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:52,700
If it wasn't for me, could you have remained sober?

80
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,140
Did I ask you to take care of me?

81
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:26,516
Commander, Miss Mu and Supervisor Xu,

82
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,580
they're not finished yet.

83
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,516
Well…

84
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,936
Hello. Where is Executive Director Fay's room?

85
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:08,564
Well, I can't tell you this.

86
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:13,119
All right, all right.

87
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,300
Did Miss Mu drink a lot?

88
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,800
She's not only drunk, she has mental issues too.

89
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,400
Send someone to get Xu Guangyao later.

90
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,800
I'll come back here after I drop you off.

91
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,900
Oh, right. Those bottles of wine on the table,

92
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,300
bring all of them back to me.

93
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,200
But all of them have been opened.

94
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,100
Just do it. Why are you complaining?

Open your mouth.

141
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,900
Drink some more.

142

Let's have one more glass, okay?

143
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,000
You're drunk.

144
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,400
First, make it clear who I am.

145
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,300
I'm not drunk.

146
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,100
I went there to drink just to help you.

147
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,100
To help me?

148
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,300
Fine.

149
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,900
I'm Xu Guangyao.

158

What are you doing, Commander?

159
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,100
What's the problem?

160
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,100
We have places to shower. Why are you pouring water on yourself?

161
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,800
If you don't have anything to do here, get lost!

00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,500
I... I do have something to do.

163
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,000
I've brought Supervisor Xu back for you.

I also brought back the wine. Do you want to drink it now?

165
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,700
What, drink? No!

166
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,600
You didn't want to drink?

167
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,000
I thought you and Miss Mu hadn't got enough fun, so you wanted to continue...

168
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,600
Scram!

169
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,900
Why do you have to yell?

170
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,800
<i>Calm down, calm down.</i>

171
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,500
<i>It's not the time yet for us to put away our weapons</i>

172
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,900
<i>and let the battle steeds retire.</i>

173
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,200
<i>I can't get emotional.</i>

174
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,900
<i>I have to help her cover up.</i>

175
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,800
Hello?

176
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,900
Please connect me to Mu Mansion.

177
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,200
<i>[Still Waters Run Deep]</i>

178
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,600
My Lord.

179
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,200
It's getting late. Have something to eat.

180
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
Okay. Go to bed first.

181
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,400
I'll go to bed after I've read these papers.

182
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,800
Was there anything special going on today?

183
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,600
Guangyao didn't come back. Nor did Wanqing.

184
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,300
What's going on with them?

185
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,800
Commander Tan just called.

186
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,900
He said they had too many files to translate.

187
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,100
Wanqing and her colleagues in the Translation Office had to work overtime.

188
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,100
Guangyao called also and said he couldn't come back tonight.

189
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,600
You don't have to wait for them. Just go to bed first.

190
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,100
However, Wanqing is a girl after all.

191
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,600
It's so late, and she hasn't come back yet.

192
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,300
I can't help but worry for her.

193
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,400
<i> Work overtime?</i>

194
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,600
<i>Impossible.</i>

195
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Daughter?

196
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,900
Daughter?

197
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,400
Daughter?

198
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Why aren't you coming downstairs for breakfast?

199
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,400
Brother Guangyao didn't come back all night.

200
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,700
That little brat didn't come back either.

201
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,200
How am I able to eat?

202
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,400
I heard that last night Guangyao had some issues with work.

203
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,840
Mu Wanqing was working overtime.

204
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,530
How about you send them some breakfast and go take a look?

205
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,436
You're right, Mother.

206
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:31,730
I can use the chance to see whether the little brat worked overtime.

207
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,850
Or if she just seduced Brother Guangyao.

208
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,804
Only when you go…

209
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,720
Only when you go there, you can know for sure.

210
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,300
Maybe...

211
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,810
there was nothing at all.

212
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,235
Why are you here?

213
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:33,630
This is my office. Why shouldn't I be here?

214
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,140
Then… why am I here?

215
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,618
<i>Fool.</i>

216
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,540
I drank too much last night.

217
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,690
Did I say anything inappropriate?

218
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,240
You didn't say anything you shouldn't.

219
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,510
But do you think you should have slept in Xu Guangyao's office?

220
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,610
What do you mean by that?

221
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,437
I don't mean anything.

222
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,460
You are his secretary.

223
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,000
Besides, last night you were with him at dinner.

224
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,140
You drank too much so you slept in his office.

225
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,680
As it should be.

226
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,184
So why do you speak so sarcastically so early in the morning?

227
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,380
That is because I was so kind and took care of someone who was drunk,

228
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,390
so I stayed awake all night.

229
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,490
I drank too much,

230
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,510
I can't remember anything that happened yesterday.

231
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,550
Did I cause any trouble?

232
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,190
If I did, I apologize.

233
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,923
<i>I'm Xu Guangyao.</i>

234
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:52,183
<i>How are you going to help me?</i>

235
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,140
<i>Fool.</i>

236
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,000
You did cause trouble.

237
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,926
Then, Commander Tan, please ignore what I said last night.

238
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:13,240
You can't take the words of a drunkard seriously anyway.

239
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,620
Not truthful words?

240
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,240
Haven't you heard of this saying

241
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,170
called "drunk words, sober thoughts"?

242
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,056
Not to mention, what you drank last night, was that even wine?

243
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,310
Do you need to look so surprised?

244
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,170
If it wasn't...

245
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,080
If it wasn't for the fact that we are partners,

246
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,150
I wouldn't have cared about you.

247
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,460
That's right, we're partners,

248
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,940
and also the kind that doesn't trust each other.

249
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:52,214
All right.

250
00:25:52,214 --> 00:25:55,500
Now you'd better go and find your Brother Guangyao.

251
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,370
If others find out you spent the night in my place last night,

252
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,123
things won't be good for you or me.

253
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:02,030
I haven't gotten a wife yet.

254
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,726
You must not ruin my reputation. Leave now.

255
00:26:04,726 --> 00:26:07,010
Fine, I'll leave. You should not ruin my reputation either.

256
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,710
Wait.

257
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,070
Please ask Xu Guangyao to come here.

258
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,120
Thank you.

259
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,150
You are welcome.

260
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,364
Brother Guangyao.

261
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,343
Wanqing.

262
00:27:02,343 --> 00:27:04,510
Wanqing, are you okay?

263
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,496
I'm fine.

264
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,770
- Yesterday...
- Last night, Commander Tan brought us back.

265
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:15,764
I'm sorry. I got drunk yesterday.

266
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:18,760
Did Fay ask you to drink wine afterward?

267
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,700
No, he didn't. Commander Tan happened to be next door.

268
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,080
Oh, yes, he just asked you to see him.

269
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,520
All right.

270
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,340
You certainly didn't sleep well yesterday.

271
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,290
Get some rest here in my room.

272
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,493
Okay.

273
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,860
<i>[Defense Command of Shanghai]</i>

274
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,796
Did you want to see me?

275
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:52,690
You got up so early, Supervisor Xu.

276
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,660
I thought you wouldn't be able to get up until the middle of the day.

277
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,500
Thank you so much for last night.

278
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,795
Forget it.

279
00:29:00,795 --> 00:29:03,200
You work here in the commander's office.

280
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,200
If you couldn't outdrink a foreigner,

281
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,500
you would disgrace us.

282
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,940
If you had told me earlier that you were drinking with Fay,

283
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,460
you could have brought me with you. I would definitely beat him.

284
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:16,280
It was a private meeting last night.

285
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,540
I shouldn't have bothered you with this, Commander Tan.

286
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,880
However, what a coincidence that you were there.

287
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:24,360
So it was a private meeting?

288
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,310
Does it mean you didn't talk about any serious business?

289
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,693
Brother Guangyao.

290
00:29:58,335 --> 00:30:00,310
Brother Guangyao?

291
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:04,092
Brother Guangyao!

292
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:08,467
Why are you here, you little brat?

293
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:10,550
Why are you here?

294
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,280
- What did you call me?
- I called you brat, you little brat!

295
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,510
How dare you hit me?

296
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:23,630
I told you earlier.

297
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,870
If you try to be so domineering and bossy and put me in any trouble again,

298
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,360
I would give it back double to you!

299
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,690
You've clearly done shameless things.

300
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,910
I caught you right in his bed.

301
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,500
This is the commander's office.

302
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,810
Have you ever thought about how much trouble your words could give Supervisor Xu?

303
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,780
You just have a guilty conscience. Bra…

304
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:46,540
I'm going to tell other people about this right now.

305
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,130
Just go.

306
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,050
I dare you to make a big deal out of this.

307
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,840
You will not only slander me but also damage his reputation.

308
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,630
Then I don't need to do anything.

309
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,360
Your Brother Guangyao won't spare you either.

310
00:31:05,232 --> 00:31:07,598
Brother Guangyao!

311
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:13,854
Wanting?

312
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:15,578
Why are you here?

313
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:18,000
I brought you a meal just now,

314
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,400
but she knocked over the lunchbox.

315
00:31:24,812 --> 00:31:26,510
We were just talking about sisterly things.

316
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,826
Are you sure you want to hear it?

317
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,010
Brother Guangyao.

318
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,195
Mother!

319
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,353
Mother!

320
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:03,100
My little girl. Why are you shouting?

321
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,003
Mother, I just saw Mu Wanqing

322
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:06,790
sleeping in Brother Guangyao's bed.

323
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,938
What did you say?

324
00:32:07,938 --> 00:32:10,300
I saw it with my own eyes. And...

325
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,060
she also hit me.

326
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,320
She hit you?

327
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,730
Let me have a look. Let me see.

328
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,860
- Where did she hit?
- Here.

329
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,970
She hit me twice.

330
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,360
Fortunately, your face is not damaged.

331
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,420
That little bitch!

332
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,180
I pitied her because her mother passed away early, so I've been tolerant towards her.

333
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,910
But she...

334
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,130
is not tactful at all.

335
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,330
In this case,

336
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,720
I don't need to be kind to her either.

337
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,300
Mother, please find a way soon.

338
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,580
Mu Wanqing has already slept in Brother Guangyao's bed.

339
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,590
If she really could get into the governor's mansion by marriage,

340
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,000
I would be the laughingstock of all Shanghai.

341
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,400
She is merely a secretary in the commander's office.

342
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,760
Is that a big deal?

343
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,590
Has she been emancipated or gone to Heaven?

344
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,100
What luck.

345
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,150
Wanting.

346
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,690
Don't provoke her anymore.

347
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,600
I'll find a good plan.

348
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,880
Just wait and see how I'll deal with her.

349
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:23,187
Brother Guangyao.

350
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,223
What's wrong?

351
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:27,285
What's going on?

352
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:32,830
Yesterday, what I talked about with Fay, Commander Tan knows about it too.

353
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,420
Really?

354
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,600
What did he say then?

355
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,570
What else can he say?

356
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,320
I said I went to talk about the loan yesterday.

357
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,740
Then he said

358
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,930
he talked with Anton Fay about the arrangement of the troops.

359
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:52,210
We both understood it well but didn't mention militia at all.

360
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:55,050
So we barely shed a pretense of cordiality.

361
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,100
What if he doesn't demobilize the troops in time

362
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,290
and becomes determined to build up the militia?

363
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,210
After Tan Xuanlin got his position,

364
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:05,230
my father recalled a whole division of troops to the station in Yue City.

365
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,070
Just in case he can't keep his promise.

366
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,370
My father can let him keep his promise for now,

367
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,580
but that's about it.

368
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,150
If he dares to break that promise...

369
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,260
that will be the end of the cordiality.

370
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,630
So do you mean Uncle Xu will attack Shanghai?

371
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,270
Shanghai is the place with all the powers,

372
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,906
so my father will of course be prudent.

373
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:29,360
But if he insists on playing dirty,

374
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,860
this possibility can not be ruled out either.

375
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,200
About the Tan Army, what on earth are you going to do?

376
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,780
What are you doing here?

377
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,340
We just have a partnership between us.

378
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,190
What does this have anything to do with you?

379
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,420
Then as a work partner, it's necessary for me to tell you

380
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,650
that the governor already knows your plan.

381
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,510
The deadline is also approaching.

382
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,603
Once you break your promise, you won't be able to stay as King of Shanghai.

383
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,910
What does that have to do with you?

384
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,380
I really want to help you.

385
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,610
I'd be satisfied if you didn't help Xu Guangyao.

386
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,240
Why can't you tell right from wrong?

387
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:38,640
Did you know Supervisor Xu recalled his troops from the frontline?

388
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,650
He's just waiting to settle the debt with you.

389
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,968
Once you fail to maintain the relationship of cordiality,

390
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:44,059
how can you fight against him with merely two thousand people?

391
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,234
Has he recalled the troops?

392
00:35:50,654 --> 00:35:52,412
A great man knows when to yield and when not to.

393
00:35:52,412 --> 00:35:54,260
You should resettle the Tan Army first.

394
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,570
Never throw an egg at a rock.

395
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,640
All right. And also this one.

396
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,951
Wait a minute.

397
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,635
- Hello?
- <i>Brother Guangyao,</i>

398
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:13,820
<i>I will disband the Tan Army and turn in their guns.</i>

399
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,660
<i>Please come over here.</i>

400
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,480
All right, I'll go there later.

401
00:36:21,037 --> 00:36:22,665
What happened?

402
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,850
Tan Xuanlin has agreed to resettle his men.

403
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,372
He will also turn in their guns to the governor's mansion.

404
00:36:28,372 --> 00:36:31,250
So, has he finally come around?

405
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,940
How is that possible?

406
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,755
Good morning, Supervisor Xu.

407
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,356
Well, can we start?

408
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:13,968
Please.

409
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,970
Listen carefully!

410
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,020
Rifles on the left, pistols on the right.

411
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,250
Machine guns and their bullets are handed in together. Into the cases.

412
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,857
<i>I believe you.</i>

413
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:45,017
<i>However, all these men are my brothers</i>

414
00:37:45,017 --> 00:37:47,080
<i>who have been through life and death with me.</i>

415
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,697
<i>I can't just let them carry bags on the docks.</i>

416
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,830
<i>I treat them as my brothers.</i>

417
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,570
<i>How can those bosses do the same?</i>

418
00:37:55,204 --> 00:37:56,789
Commander Tan.

419
00:37:56,789 --> 00:38:00,001
Was this different from what you had planned?

420
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,445
Well, what else can I do since you've figured it out?

421
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:07,417
I didn't expect you to be so capable, Guangyao.

422
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:09,638
You just had some drinks with Fay,

423
00:38:09,638 --> 00:38:11,978
and I've lost so badly.

424
00:38:11,978 --> 00:38:14,340
But I admire your victory.

425
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,070
Look, these soldiers of mine,

426
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,360
they are surely good in battle,

427
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,408
but they're not good laborers.

428
00:38:21,408 --> 00:38:22,798
Their hands are used to hold guns,

429
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:24,982
and now you want them to handle spindles and wrenches.

430
00:38:24,982 --> 00:38:26,560
That's rather difficult.

431
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,331
But a factory is not a place you can easily earn a meal.

432
00:38:29,331 --> 00:38:31,571
How much you work, how much money you can earn.

433
00:38:31,571 --> 00:38:33,637
So what if they can't earn

434
00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:36,138
enough money to raise their family?

435
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,340
Commander Tan, you said it yourself.

436
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,360
How much you work, how much money you can earn.

437
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,990
Since your soldiers are both hard-working and capable,

438
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,492
how come they can't earn enough money for a living?

439
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,796
That's right.

440
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:50,616
That's what worries me the most.

441
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:52,774
Work in the factories is always technical.

442
00:38:52,774 --> 00:38:54,100
How does the saying go again?

443
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,118
"Practice makes perfect."

444
00:38:56,118 --> 00:38:58,520
However, when they just begin, they will be surely short on practice.

445
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,110
Others will be tough to them.

446
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,141
So I just want to ask you, Guangyao.

447
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:05,754
Can you talk to those bosses and make sure they can get

448
00:39:05,754 --> 00:39:08,878
the same payment as skilled workers?

449
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,728
About this,

450
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:15,406
I'm afraid I'll have to talk to the bosses.

451
00:39:15,406 --> 00:39:18,422
If only you will ask for us, Guangyao, it wouldn't be a problem.

452
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,260
Then on behalf of these brothers,

453
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,376
I will thank you, Guangyao.

454
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,665
<i>Don't worry. In my opinion, after about a month,</i>

455
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:31,073
<i>someone will be begging you to take the soldiers back.</i>

456
00:39:31,073 --> 00:39:33,940
<i>Then you can still build up the militia.</i>

457
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,171
<i>[Account]</i>
Junior Marshal, everything has been counted.

458
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,220
<i>[Weapon Registration Form]</i>

459
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:48,201
I didn't expect

460
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:52,329
the weapons of the Tan Army to be so varied.

461
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:57,020
It really... includes everything.

462
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,950
They've never gotten a proper number.

463
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,300
They made a living by fighting for all the provincial generals and officers.

464
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,170
Naturally, what weapons the employers give them,

465
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,776
they have to use them.

466
00:40:05,776 --> 00:40:10,464
In short, it's just a low-level mixed army.

467
00:40:10,464 --> 00:40:12,480
Why should those generals and officers

468
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,482
use an army like this to fight for them?

469
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:17,484
They would like to spare their own troops

470
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:19,192
and send them to die, of course.

471
00:40:19,192 --> 00:40:22,427
All in all, we can't underestimate the Tan Army.

472
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:24,040
That's right.

473
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,621
The Tan Army can't be underestimated.

474
00:40:27,621 --> 00:40:29,729
Although their equipment isn't good,

475
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:33,406
for a long while, they did fight some good battles.

476
00:40:33,406 --> 00:40:35,717
They have almost never lost.

477
00:40:35,717 --> 00:40:38,769
Tan Xuanlin has a talent as a general.

478
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:41,437
If we can use him,

479
00:40:41,437 --> 00:40:45,127
maybe we can even be friends.

480
00:40:45,127 --> 00:40:47,362
He's not a normal person.

481
00:40:48,003 --> 00:40:49,903
Interesting.

482
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:53,753
So we can say Tan Xuanlin was born rebellious.

483
00:40:53,753 --> 00:40:57,276
He will not really work for others.

484
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,578
Maybe that's why my father

485
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:04,985
had to disband the Tan Army.

486
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,070
He was afraid that we'd be feeding a tiger.

487
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,600
♫ <i> Tears turn into heavy rain </i> ♫

488
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,099
♫ <i> We went back to when we first met </i> ♫

489
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:26,407
