Wanqing.

16
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,100
If it were up to you, what would you do?

17
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,600
Now trading volumes are huge for the Japanese,

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,600
but they withheld wages and killed their workers.

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,600
If we can give reasonable pay,

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,800
who will work for them?

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,300
Without workers, how can they compete with us?

22
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,800
As the saying goes, "Avoid the enemy's initial momentum

23
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,000
and strike hard when they are tired."

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,100
When they showed their ability to the full extent,

25
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,400
we avoided their attack.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,300
Now that they are in trouble, we should defeat them in one go.

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,500
My good daughter,

28
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,900
we think the same way.

29
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,100
Why don't we go to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce now

30
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,400
and deliver the final blow?

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,900
Let's go!

He is not in the office,

Everyone! If you work for us,

56
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,900
I promise you thirty silver dollars each month.

57
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,400
Miss Mu, are you serious?

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,900
If you trust me,

59
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,700
come to the head office of our cotton mill and sign the contract.

60
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,000
I, Mu Wanqing, will guarantee

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,600
thirty silver dollars each month.

62
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Even if the yarn market is tough,

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,700
we still have warehouses, wharves,

Okay! Okay! Okay!

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Miss Mu, what about our brothers who were killed by them?

67
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,300
Should the Japanese Chamber of Commerce get away with it?

68
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,000
<i>- Right!
- Yes! How can they?</i>

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,900
You are a real man who is loyal to your friends.

70
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,000
I also remain faithful to my friends.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,200
As long as you sign the contract, you work for the Mu family.

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,000
My father will negotiate with the Japanese Chamber of Commerce

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,600
in the name of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.

74

<i>Okay! Okay! Okay!</i>

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It looks like Mu Zhiyuan left no room for us this time.

77
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,300
Does he think collecting some workers

78
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,000
will leave us at our wits' end?

79
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,600
President, you mean…

80
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,700
Now, our yarn is being managed well in Shanghai.

81
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,400
Many important figures want to become a shareholder and make money.

82
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,600
I believe Tan Xuanlin, the new Commander of Shanghai,

83
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,200
will also be interested.

84
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,500
But he comes from the Tan family in Jiang City.

85
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,200
What about what happened in the past?

86

That is not important.

87
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,700
There's an old Chinese saying.

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,600
"Money makes the mare go."

89
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,600

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,500
We had done so much to get a job here.

And we worked so well as a team.

Brother Guangyao,

97
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,000
thank you for taking care of me during this time.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,600
Due to the upheaval in my family,

99
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,300
Father wants me to run the family business.

100

It's time for me to fulfill my filial duty.

101

Wanqing,

102
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,200
I feel like you treat me

103

differently these days.

104
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,500
Is it because of what I said to you in the hospital

105
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,200
that has made you uncomfortable?

106
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,300
Of course not.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But I made up my mind, and you need say no more.

108
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,800
The renovation to my old house is almost complete.

109
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,900
With your resignation,

110
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,500
will it be difficult to see you again?

111
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,500
We are busy doing our own things.

112
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,700
It is normal to not see each other every day, right?

113
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,500
Fine.

114
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,700
It seems that you have made up your mind.

115
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,800
Then it is up to you.

116
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Just don't forget that if something happens in the future,

117
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,200
don't forget me, your brother.

128
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,200
I have never had any dealings with the Japanese Chamber of Commerce.

129
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,600
To what do I owe this pleasure?

130
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,800
Commander Tan,

131
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,700
the Japanese Chamber of Commerce represents

132
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,400
the interests of all Japanese merchants.

133
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,700
We always make harmony a top priority,

134
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,100
conduct the duties of businessmen,

135
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,800
and have never done anything that would go against reason and nature.

136
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Things that are against reason and nature?

137
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,600
Who said you have done such terrible things?

138
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,800
This is slander. You can sue them.

139
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,700
Now that Commander Tan understands that we follow the rules,

140
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:11,100
what do you think about our disputes with the Mu family?

141
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,000
Me? I'm a professional.

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
I don't know about business.

143
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
Commander Tan,

144
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,600
sometimes, an outsider sees more objectively.

145
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,400
I'd love to get your opinion on this matter.

146
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,800
I am listening.

147
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,400
Our yarn is cheap and of high quality,

148
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,200
and they sell very well.

149
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,400
It does affect some local cotton mills.

150
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,000
But doing business is the survival of the fittest.

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,800
If you don't want to be obsolete,

152
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,200
you have to make progress and keep up with the market.

153
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,900
Am I right?

154
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,960
It makes sense.

155
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,200
But the Mu family doesn't want to improve their technology,

156
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,800
is creating a destructive competition,

157
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,600
and is inciting workers to make trouble.

158
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,800
They have even disrupted market prices

159
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,100
and poached our workers.

160
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,600
Even if the Mu family is big in Shanghai,

161
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,000
and we are outsiders,

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,800
the market is all about equality.

163
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,600
They promote exclusivity

164
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,200
and disrupted our factory.

165
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,400
This will force Shanghai residents

166
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,700
to have no access to cheap and high-quality products.

167
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,900
The Mu family did cross the line.

168
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,100
But Mr. Yamashita,

169
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,800
I don't know about the cotton yarn business.

170
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
The Command is not in charge of it.

171
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,600
So I can do nothing to help you.

172
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,500
Commander Tan.

173
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,700
I came today

174
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,600
to do business with you.

175
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,000
Mr. Yamashita,

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,140
what business can you do with me?

177
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,100
To be honest, many important figures in Shanghai

178
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,700
made purchases in our yarn factory.

179
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,800
But the Mu family broke the rules,

180
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,000
and as a result, our yarn factory failed.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,500
I can't break my promise,

182
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,000
so I want to transport

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,300
foreign yarn from Qingdao to sell in Shanghai.

184
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,200
The cost will be lower than setting up factories by ourselves.

185
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,800
But Shanghai is your territory.

186
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,900
Your militia is in charge of all ports and wharves.

187
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:33,200
So I wonder if you can give the green light to us.

188
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,500
I'll make sure it's worth it.

189
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,900
You mean if I let you transport goods to Shanghai,

190
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,600
I can make money. Right?

191
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,300
Commander Tan is so smart!

192
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,100
So quick!

193
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,000
Fine! Who doesn't want to make money?

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,800
Go ahead. The more you transport, the more money I make.

195
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,400
From now on, you are my "God of Wealth."

196
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,800
Commander Tan, I hope we can work well together.

197
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
Me too.

198
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,700
<i>- Take it easy.
- Okay, okay.</i>

199
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,100
Mr. Yamashita. Commander Tan sent me to help you unload.

200
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,900
Sir, we have almost finished loading this truck.

201
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,600
There is no need to bother you.

202
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,700
So you only have two trucks of goods?

203
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,300
Commander Tan had us prepare a large warehouse for you.

204
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,800
If that's all you have,

205
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,300
it wouldn't even cover a single corner of the warehouse.

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,100
This is just our first shipment.

207
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,900
Just trying our hands at it.

208
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,800
We are expecting more goods.

209
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,600
Commander Tan's large warehouse will be useful to us.

210
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,300
Good. If you need anything else, just come to me.

211
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,800
I will bring my brothers to help.

212
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Please send my thanks to Commander Tan.

213
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,000
And thank you, sir.

214
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,400
Mr. Yamashita, we will be leaving.

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Come. Tidy up.

216
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,200
Wanqing.

217
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,300
Father, why are you still up?

218
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,700
Still thinking about the cotton mill.

219
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,700
Never mind, it is too late.

220
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,900
Just go back to sleep.

221
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,000
Why did you smoke so much?

222
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,900
Didn't their yarn factory just fail?

223
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,500
We poached workers from Junichi Yamashita

224
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,700
and caused their factory to halt production.

225
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,800
Then, they used the Japanese Chamber of Commerce

226
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,400
to transport large quantities of poor-quality yarn from Qingdao.

227
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,200
If we want to sell our cotton yarn,

228
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
we have to sell at the same price as them.

229
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,400
We promised the workers thirty silver dollars a month.

230
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,800
That means losing two silver dollars for a bolt.

231
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,800
We can afford this for a short period,

232
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,900
but if this continues,

233
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,000
the Mu family will be brought down.

234
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,700
If Junichi Yamashita can't transport yarn from Qingdao,

235
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,300
the problem will be solved. Right?

236
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,500
They did so, using normal channels legally.

237
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,700
There is nothing we can do.

238
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,400
What if we ask Commander Tan to help?

239
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,000
Maybe he can solve the problem.

240
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,200
You knew it. Why didn't you tell me?

241
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,000
I did know.

242
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,700
According to President Yamashita, I am a major shareholder.

243
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,700
I heard the foreign yarn sells well.

244
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,700
I can make a lot of money.

245
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,000
You always play without a rulebook.

246
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,400
What are you planning this time?

247
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,800
I did this to help you.

248
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,400
As they say, "No guts, no glory!"

249
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,000
"Know thyself, know thine enemy." "A thousand battles, a thousand victories."

250
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,900
You have to trust me.

251
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,800
I stand on their side, but I'm actually on your side.

252
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
For things that concern the Mu family,

253
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,600
can you please discuss them with me first?

254
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,200
Are you angry with me?

255
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,100
So how are you going to deal with Junichi Yamashita?

256
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,000
Listen.

257
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,300
Now, he is calling me names.

258
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,200
He is very crafty.

259
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,800
If he knows that you are hitting below the belt, he will have a Plan B.

260
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,500
Just be careful.

261
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,700
Rest assured, my darling.

262
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,700
Come here.

263
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,200
Relax. I know what I'm doing.

264
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,600
<i>[Shanghai Shiliupu Pier]</i>

265
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,500
Sir.

266
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,600
Today, our president sent more workers to help out.

267
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,800
We will finish soon.

268
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,800
So there is no need to bother you.

269
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,800
What are you doing?

270
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,300
Who allowed you to unload on the wharf?

271
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,800
Do you have a pass?

272
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Pass?

273
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,700
Commander Tan promised us himself.

274
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,800
Didn't Commander Tan get the warehouse ready?

275
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,200
Why do we still need a pass?

276
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,900
The warehouse is ready,

277
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,100
but you need a pass to travel from the wharf to the warehouse.

278
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,400
You don't?

279
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Sorry.

280
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,000
Keep all the goods and send them to the Command.

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,600
Wait! Wait! Sir.

282
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,300
I have never heard of a pass from the wharf to the warehouse.

283
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,400
Now you know.

284
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,600
These goods also belong to Commander Tan.

285
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,300
He has a share. Don't you need to ask for his permission?

286
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,800
Commander Tan should set a good example and play by the rules.

287
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,000
Take them away!

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,900
Sir, you can't do this.

289
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,900
Commander Tan promised us himself.

290
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,400
Then you should go to Commander Tan.

291
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,300
Since he promised you, it is none of my business.

292
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,500
Go!

293
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Commander.

294
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,000
Mr. Yamashita is here.

295
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,400
Mr. Yamashita, long time no see. Long time no see.

296
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,100
- Please take a seat.
- Commander Tan.

297
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
The ship with cotton yarn which just arrived at the wharf

298
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,600
was withheld by your subordinate.

299
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,000
He said that a pass is needed from the wharf to the warehouse.

300
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,700
I have never heard of that.

301
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Mr. Yamashita, I am so sorry.

302
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
I forgot to tell you.

303
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,900
But it is never too late.

304
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,500
How do I get this pass?

305
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,600
Simple. One pass for one truck of goods.

306
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,700
And 5,000 silver dollars for one pass.

307
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,600
Commander Tan.

308
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Are you kidding me?

309
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,900
Do I look like I'm kidding?

310
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,600
You ask for too much.

311
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,900
Mr. Yamashita,

312
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,900
you said that if I let you transport goods to Shanghai, I will get money.

313
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,400
Yes.

314
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,100
I did say that.

315
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,800
But you need to let me make money first.

316
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,900
If I lose money, how can you receive dividends?

317
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,200
You demand 5,000 silver dollars for one truck of goods.

318
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,200
As a shareholder, how can you receive dividends?

319
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,900
Mr. Yamashita,

320
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,300
let me put it this way.

321
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,900
I come from a bandit's family

322
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,400
and don't know about business.

323
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,600
I am just seeking fast money.

324
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,300
I'm just afraid that something might go wrong with your business.

325
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,200
So I had this idea.

326
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,000
I think that you should give me money

327
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
for each shipment of cotton yarn.

328
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Later, no matter how well your sales go, it won't bother me.

329
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,600
I can make money no matter what.

330
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,800
Commander Tan,

331
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,800
you are being a bully!

332
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,100
The Japanese Chamber of Commerce has run business in China for so many years.

333
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,600
And have cooperated with important figures in both politics and business.

334
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,700
We have never heard of such a ridiculous requirement.

335
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Just because they don't have one doesn't mean I can't.

336
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,900
If you value them so much, why would you still work with me?

337
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,800
Commander Tan,

338
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,400
I see. You don't really want to cooperate with us,

339
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,800
but just want to seize the chance to blackmail me.

340
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,300
Mr. Yamashita.

341
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,400
I have a good reason for asking for your money.

342
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,200
Look. Your ships dock at Shanghai Shiliupu Pier every day.

343
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,500
The loading and unloading of cotton yarn produce dust everywhere.

344
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,800
The whole wharf has a foul atmosphere.

345
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,400
Besides, your ships are coal-fired.

346
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,400
It totally pollutes the Huangpu River.

347
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,000
Shouldn't you pay for that?

348
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,500
Fine.

349
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,600
Let us both take a step back.

350
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,300
I agree to pay for the pass.

351
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,700
How about 500 silver dollars for a truck of goods?

352
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,900
Mr. Yamashita. You can't bargain like this.

353
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,800
Do you see me as a beggar?

354
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,200
I know the Japanese are made of money.

355
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,800
Your Chamber of Commerce

356
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,100
is much more luxurious than the Command.

357
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,400
This money is nothing to you.

358
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,900
Even if we are rich,

359
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,300
we will not be blackmailed by you.

360
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,200
As the Commander of Shanghai,

361
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,300
you should understand.

362
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,300
Of course. I simply act according to rules.

363
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,500
This is my rule.

364
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,000
Okay. I see.

365
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,400
You pretend to work with me,

366
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,600
but you're actually on the side of the Mu family.

367
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,000
Mr. Yamashita, I am on the money's side.

368
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,800
As long as you give me 5,000 for a truck of goods,

369
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,900
I will take your side immediately.

370
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,600
Aren't you afraid that

371
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,800
I will protest to the Beijing government against you.

372
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,900
Go ahead.

373
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,100
They just sit idly by, and I can do nothing about it.

374
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,800
What if I won't pay for the pass?

375
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,100
Won't pay?

376
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,700
That's easy. Transport as much as you like, and I will withhold them all.

377
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,300
I have so many soldiers,

378
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,300
and cotton yarn is useful to us.

379
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,000
Or I can sell them

380
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
and get some military wages. I lose nothing.

381
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,247
Fine.

382
00:21:59,247 --> 00:22:04,300
Let's wait and see who will lose in the end.

383
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,022
I'll leave.

384
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,420
Mr. Yamashita.

385
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,397
Take care.

386
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,142
Commander,

387
00:22:20,142 --> 00:22:23,390
Mr. Yamashita is really angry.

388
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,480
I actually made it easy for him

389
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,290
in case things get ugly.

390
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,310
Otherwise, he would have been absolutely livid.

391
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,110
Talking about pissing people off,

392
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,730
you're number one at that.

Shouldn't you battle the fire now?

This cotton yarn will burn soon.

405
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,440
The Mu cotton mill will be burned down.

406

Can't you see that

410
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:19,376
the fire has nearly been put out?

411
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,340
How can this be?

412
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,360
That's impossible.

413
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,796
Commander Tan knew you would play dirty.

414
00:24:36,796 --> 00:24:39,290

Now, what should we do?

00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:00,630
A mere Commander of Shanghai dares to be so arrogant.

420

Mr. Mu, we saw the newspaper.

433
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:37,120
Your daughter is a commercial genius.

434
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,530
She recruited workers to our factory,

435
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,830
causing Japanese factories to stop production.

436
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,390
Such a brilliant idea.

437
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,755
Yes!

438
00:25:44,755 --> 00:25:48,306
The Japanese transported cotton yarn to Shanghai to compete with a low price.

439
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:51,494
But the Mu family didn't panic and still continued production as usual.

440
00:25:51,494 --> 00:25:53,576
Now, the Japanese cotton yarn is out of stock.

441
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:56,040
And we have stocks to flood the market rapidly.

442
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,990
It seems your daughter had a plan.

443
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,600
Impressive! Impressive!

444
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Of course, Mr. Mu is behind all this.

445
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,520
How can I take credit for my daughter's idea?

446
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,820
She is old enough to help me.

447
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,880
I can't be happier.

452
00:26:30,517 --> 00:26:32,880
You put Miss Mu in the spotlight again.

453
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,210
Even the foreign press calls her a commercial genius.

454
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,855
Of course.

455
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:40,480
Just think about the man behind her.

456
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,370
Miss Mu is so different.

457
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,610
A girl knows so much.

458
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,490
After all, she is just a girl and isn't as good as me.

459
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,650
But she is good at one thing,

460
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:58,290
which is choosing a boyfriend.

461
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:06,049

495
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,600
Thank you for reminding me.

496
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,970
Tan Xuanlin should not be underestimated.

497
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,880
First, he seized the chance to organize the militia.

498
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,460
Now he and the Mu family are so close.

499
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,280
If it goes on like this,

500
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,370
Shanghai will become the territory of the Tan family.

501
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,200
Military Governor Xu,

502
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,410
if we hadn't helped you ten years ago, you might not have

503
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,524
defeated Military Governor Luo and become a provincial military governor yourself so easily.

504
00:29:25,524 --> 00:29:31,210
Of course... you repaid us well,

505
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,340
which laid a foundation for our development in decades past.

506
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,960
Although we didn't work together these years,

507
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,505
but the Japanese Chamber of Commerce

508
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:47,550
and Military Governor Xu are bound together in a common cause.

509
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,330
About your aid,

510
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,330
I always feel grateful.

511
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,590
People all think that my social status depends on the Mu family.

512
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,966
But I know in my heart that

513
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:03,990
your help was the key.

514
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:08,489
I believe Military Governor Xu is a grateful man.

515
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:10,090
This Tan Xuanlin

516
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,140
is your student in name.

517
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,610
He made things difficult for me

518
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,530
and presents himself as the King of Shanghai.

519
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,500
At this rate,

520
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,660
the Shanghai residents will only know of Tan Xuanlin

521
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,620
and not you.

522
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,230
Please rest assured, I will pay for all your lost goods.

523
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,023
If the Japanese Chamber of Commerce needs me,

524
00:30:34,023 --> 00:30:37,600
I will definitely help.

525
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,030
As for Tan Xuanlin, I have to weaken his power

526
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,020
and cut his ties with the Mu family.

527
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,326
Then we can make the final move.

528
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:46,220
Keeping Tan Xuanlin

529
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,360
is like taking a tiger as a pet.

530
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,350
I know fairly well.

531
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,100
Please rest assured.

532
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,423
Okay.

533
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:56,730
Since Military Governor Xu knows well,

534
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,130
I should be leaving.

535
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,978
- Come in.
- Yes.

536
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,310
Is the renovation of the old house in Shanghai finished?

537
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,530
Almost. After some cleaning, it will be ready.

538
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,100
I will hold an inauguration ceremony then.

539
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,680
Tell Mr. Mu and the bosses of Shanghai to come.

540
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,784
Military Governor, why make the completion of

541
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:36,537
the renovation of a house so grand?

542
00:31:36,537 --> 00:31:38,930
For the Mu family, Tan Xuanlin

543
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,730
ruined Mr. Yamashita's cotton yarn business.

544
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:46,730
He dared to offend the Japanese for the Mu family?

545
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,120
Yes.

546
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,360
It seems Tan Xuanlin got close to

547
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,940
the Mu family when Guangyao was in the hospital.

548
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,100
But I heard that Mr. Mu has not been well recently,

549
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,970
so Miss Mu runs the business now.

550
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:03,360
And Miss Mu and the Junior Marshal were childhood sweethearts.

551
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,391
She will definitely take our side.

552
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:08,420
I think Tan Xuanlin is

553
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,610
barking up the wrong tree.

554
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,326
Send some people to keep watching Tan Xuanlin.

555
00:32:15,326 --> 00:32:17,895
Report to me when something turns up.

556
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:22,460
It is time to bring up the proposal of marriage to Mr. Mu.

557
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,620
Last time, Tan Xuanlin sabotaged the engagement.

558
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,351
This time, I will use the renovation as an opportunity

559
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:32,080
to propose the marriage to Mr. Mu myself.

560
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,655
Yes.

561
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,860
I can't see her.

562
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,890
I have no midnight snack.

563
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,070
What's the matter, Commander? Do you want a midnight snack?

564
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,023
I will buy something for you.

565
00:32:53,614 --> 00:32:56,870
If you have something to say, hurry up. Otherwise, get out.

566
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,460
Yes, sir.

567
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,517
Mr. Liao is here.

568
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,100
Commander Tan,

569
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,600
I will just dive straight to the point.

570
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,700
After the victory party, I came here

571
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,600
to remind you that the assassins were not from the Revolutionary Party.

572
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
But why did you close the case

573
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
when you found out that the assassin was

574
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,730
from the Revolutionary Party?

575
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,800
Uncle Liao.

576
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,100
At that time, I didn't find out the truth and had no clues.

577
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:33,800
- So…
- Can't find out or don't want to?

578
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,800
I understand you have no foundation in Shanghai.

579
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,200
If you disband your army,

580
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,800
you will be like a fish on the chopping block.

581
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,100
You used every means to keep your army.

582
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,000
It is natural and normal.

583
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,500
But in doing this,

584
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,900
foreign firms in the concession see Guangdong merchants as monsters.

585
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,900
On this trip to Shanghai, some familiar foreign firms

586
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,900
refused to sell Western medicine to me.

587
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,100
I finally found out that Anton Fay, the executive director,

588
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,100
thought that the Revolutionary Party wanted to kill Joseph.

589
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,900
So he asked all foreign firms

590
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,900
not to do business with Guangdong merchants

591
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,500
to avoid having materials end up in the hands of the Revolutionary Party.

592
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Commander Tan,

593
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,200
wasn't it you who ruined my business?

594
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,600
So Uncle Liao,

595
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,200
you do business with Western medicine.

596
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,500
You know I used to be a doctor in your father's army.

597
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,300
So business related to Western medicine is my old job.

598
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,700
During the Xinhai Revolution, you joined my father's army
<i>(The 1911 Revolution, that ended China's last imperial dynasty, the Manchu-led Qing dynasty)</i>

599
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,300
and went from being a bandit to an officer.

600
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,200
So your old job... should be a revolution.

601
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,700
Commander Tan suspects

602
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,100
I am a member of the Revolutionary Party?

603
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,900
Uncle Liao,

604
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,400
let's be honest.

605
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,800
Back then, you spoke boldly in defense of the Tan Army.

606
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,600
You also looked after me.

607
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,800
So even if you did join the Revolutionary Party,

608
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
I will not arrest you.

609
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,900
Uncle Liao,

610
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,800
what do you want?

611
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,250
You are right.

612
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,200
I do things for the Revolutionary Party.

613
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,900
Now we are at war with Xu Bojun

614
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,800
and are in urgent need of aspirin and quinine.

615
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,700
Uncle Liao,

616
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,900
these are controlled substances.

617
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,400
If someone finds out,

618
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,900
I will face the charge of aiding the enemy.

619
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,100
Last time I came to you,

620
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,300
I wanted to tell you something.

621
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,500
The Tan Family, except you,

622
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,100
all died in the warfare with the military governors.

623
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,200
At that time, a 15-year-old boy like you

624
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,700
led thousands of people to fight for life.

625
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:17,500
Did Xu Bojun and Luo Bingwen ever have mercy on you?

626
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,300
I don't need their mercy.

627
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,400
I can take back what belongs to me.

628
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,600
Have you ever thought about what you really want?

629
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,900
I think with your strength,

630
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,500
it would not be impossible if one day, you will replace Xu Bojun.

631
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But what then?

632
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,800
Another military governor seizes power over the dead bodies of civilians.

633
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,500
Then waiting for a reign of terror?

634
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,600
What is the difference

635
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:53,200
between Military Governor Tan, Military Governor Xu, and Military Governor Luo?

636
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,600
Yes.

637
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,800
You are right, Uncle Liao.

638
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,900
But what else can I do?

639
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,100
I create a bright future for my brothers.

640
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,100
What's wrong with that?

641
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,000
I still can't figure out what you want.

642
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,300
I want to make the world peaceful for civilians.

643
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,600
Now the Revolutionary Army is fighting a bloody battle,

644
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,100
not for themselves but for the civilians.

645
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,900
It wishes to save them from warfare among military governors.

646
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,300
Without Western medicine, injured soldiers can only wait to die.

647
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,700
Commander Tan,

648
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,100
you use tricks to keep your army.

649
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,300
There is nothing to be said against it.

650
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,900
But you leave millions of injured soldiers with no medicine.

651
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,900
Xuanlin,

652
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,500
soldiers fight and sacrifice for the whole country.

653
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,000
We can't leave them alone and watch them die!

654
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,860
<i>[Far East Hotel]</i>

655
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,200
We haven't seen each other for six days and ten hours.

656
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,700
I missed you so much.

657
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,000
It wasn't as long as that.

658
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,800
And I also called you.

659
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,300
Calling is not enough.

660
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,400
I can't hear you and touch you.

661
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,500
You might as well haven't called.

662
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,900
Fine, as you said, I will not call you again.

663
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,600
Anyway, I have been busy every day

664
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,000
and had no time for you.

665
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,900
No, no, I didn't mean that.

666
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,400
I…

667
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,500
I was just kidding.

668
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,900
I look forward to seeing you every day.

669
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,800
But as you said, we are in a pinch.

670
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,500
In order to take down Xu Bojun,

671
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,000
we have to be patient.

672
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,300
Right.

673
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,800
I hope that day will come sooner.

674
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,200
Then, I can openly marry you

675
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,000
instead of meeting behind closed doors.

676
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Why did you want to see me here today?

677
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,700
I am going to the Municipal Council.

678
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,500
The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce is not far from here.

679
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,000
Besides, this is the concession.

680
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,800
So Xu Bojun's spies can't be here.

681
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,900
Going to the Municipal Council?

682
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,700
What happened to the militia?

683
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,100
No, I am just seeing Anton Fay,

684
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,900
asking him to introduce me to some manufacturers of Western medicine.

685
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,600
I need to buy Western medicine.

686
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,300
Buy Western medicine?

687
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,800
You know well that my father sells Western medicine.

688
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,900
Why didn't you come to me?

689
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,600
No.

690
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,800
It is just that you have been so busy recently.

691
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,300
I didn't want to bother you.

692
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,500
You should bother me.

693
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,200
Right.

694
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,200
Are you hiding something from me?

695
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,200
No, no, nothing.

696
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,900
Then tell me what you need to buy.

697
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,500
Aspirin and quinine.

698
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,900
Aspirin and quinine?

699
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,900
Those are controlled substances used by combat troops at the front.

700
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Who is it for?

701
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,500
A friend.

702
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,400
From the Southern government?

703
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,700
Yes.

704
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,600
How-How did you figure it out?

705
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,600
Quinine is used to treat malaria.

706
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,400
And malaria only exists in hot places.

707
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,100
Wanqing, I will be honest with you.

708
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:38,100
I have to buy this medicine for an old friend of mine.

709
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,000
He works for the Southern government,

710
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,400
but I received his kindness.

711
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,500
I have to repay him.

712
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,400
Kindness shall be repaid.

713
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,700
I will buy the medicine for you.

714
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,500
Good.

715
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,500
Good. I have many things to do in the company.

716
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,600
I should leave now.

717
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,300
Don't.

718
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,200
Leaving so soon?

719
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,000
I haven't had enough of your hug.

720
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,200
We just hugged.

721
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,300
You no longer work in the Command.

722
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,400
I can't see you. And you don't care about me.

723
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,700
What shall I do to show that I care about you?

724
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,300
Well…
