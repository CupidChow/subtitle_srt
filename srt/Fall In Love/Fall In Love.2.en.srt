00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,640
I come here today,

166
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,180
firstly, to thank you for the favor you've shown me all these years.

167
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,829
Secondly, to thank Mr. Mu for his unwavering support.

168
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:41,137
A deep friendship exists between us.

169
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:43,890
Now that our children are adults,

170
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,448
I hope this friendship

171
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:48,810
can continue for the younger generation.

172
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:51,281
To show my respect, I toast to you all!

173
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:53,430
<i>Great! Great!</i>

174
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,498
<i>Come on, drink up!</i>

175
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,750
<i>Great! Great!</i>

176
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,846
Now, I welcome you all to dance!

177
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,867
First, we'll give the dance floor to our perfect couple,

178
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,278
Junior Marshal Xu and Miss Mu.

179
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:08,500
<i>Great! Great!</i>

180
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,918
A capable boy and a pretty girl! What a perfect match!

181
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:57,991
You should give your hand to Wanting.

182
00:13:57,991 --> 00:14:00,270
It's easier to talk this way.

183
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,050
But I'm not good at dancing.

184
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,770
It doesn't matter. Just follow my pace.

185
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,580
- Mom.
- Don't play the child now. The guests are all here.

186
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,180
But clearly, I should be the one in this dance!

187
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,301
Enough.

188
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,775
What's in it?

189
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,950
It's the defense deployment map of Shanghai.

190
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:18,018
The city's deployment map?

191
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,348
Are you sure?

192
00:15:19,348 --> 00:15:21,010
I'm positive.

193
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,446
Mr. Mu.

194
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:30,890
Who is this young lady?

195
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,360
My daughter by my ex-wife, Wanqing.

196
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,063
She just came back from Japan.

197
00:15:35,063 --> 00:15:37,037
She's grown so much.

198
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,060
That year if Military Governor Luo hadn't…

199
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,058
As both of you generals have kindly visited my home,

200
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:44,210
we'd better not talk about ancient history.

201
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,328
Mr. Mu. Brother Bojun.

202
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:50,640
About establishing the five-province coalition force and fighting the enemy,

203
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,780
may I ask what you think?

204
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:56,032
That's a talk for you army men.

205
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:57,625
I don't know much about war.

206
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,587
I'll attend to other guests then.

207
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,519
That Mr. Mu.

208
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:09,667
He times his exits perfectly.

209
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,098
He knows very well

210
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:13,830
that we need his help funding the army.

211
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,953
This attitude of his makes it clear he'd rather not participate.

212
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:19,738
In my opinion,

213
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:22,454
we should push him into a corner tonight.

214
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,410
Tonight, we're going to select

215
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,796
the commander-in-chief for our coalition.

216
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:32,609
When I was in Japan, I also studied architecture.

217
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:35,040
It's a topographic map with contour lines.

218
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,528
There are also military marks all around Shanghai.

219
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:41,050
And even the widths of bridges and roads, all noted in great detail.

220
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,370
It's obviously a military map.

221
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,012
But it differs from a normal military map.

222
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:49,434
Beside each item, troop numbers are listed and arrows indicate direction.

223
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:51,550
I think it's directions for an attack.

224
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,603
That's bad.

225
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:54,398
You know who he is, don't you?

226
00:16:54,398 --> 00:16:56,320
My mother's ashes are still there.

227
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,298
I promise you I'll get your mother's ashes back.

228
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:01,850
- Wait a moment for me.
- <i>Good! Good!</i>

229
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,557
<i>Great! Great!</i>

230
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:05,851
Ladies and gentlemen!

231
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:07,926
Please give me your attention.

232
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,817
We have so many great guests gathered here tonight for this grand celebration.

233
00:17:11,817 --> 00:17:15,408
Thanks to Mr. Mu for his hospitality.

234
00:17:16,978 --> 00:17:18,878
I'd also like to remind you,

235
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:20,066
on the front line,

236
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:23,688
fierce battles have rung the alarm for us.

237
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:26,238
The Revolutionary Army should not be underestimated.

238
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:29,568
If our five provinces in eastern China don't team up

239
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:30,978
and just let the Revolutionary Army

240
00:17:30,978 --> 00:17:33,050
occupy the cities and take down our towns,

241
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,201
the ones who will soon be in trouble

242
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:39,628
could very possibly be every one of us here.

243
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:43,258
Today, as all the officers

244
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:45,180
and commanders are here,

245
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,098
we can just borrow this great place of Mr. Mu

246
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:50,328
to select our candidate

247
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:53,300
for Coalition Commander-in-Chief of the five provinces of East China.

248
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,218
<i>- This is a good proposal.
- Yes, it is.</i>

249
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:57,199
<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

250
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,972
I, firstly,

251
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:04,440
would like to suggest

252
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,650
the Military Governor of Yue City,

253
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,545
Xu Bojun.

254
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,437
Everyone,

255
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,900
are there any disagreements?

256
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,592
<i>No, very good! Very good!</i>

257
00:18:17,592 --> 00:18:20,030
<i>Great! Great!</i>

258
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:24,590
It appears that Xu Bojun will serve as

259
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,100
the Commander-in-Chief of Coalition Forces as he commands so much popularity.

260
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,468
<i>- Good!
- Yes, great!</i>

261
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:30,218
Brother Bojun, please come.

262
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:31,550
<i>Great! Great!</i>

263
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,436
Applause, please!

264
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,890
<i>Great! Great!</i>

265
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,060
If there is no further disagreement,

266
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,508
I will now make it official.

267
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,890
Commander-in-Chief of Coalition Forces for the five provinces of East China

268
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,348
will be served by the protector of Yue City,

269
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,280
Military Governor Xu Bojun!

270
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,720
<i>I disagree!</i>

271
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,950
Who are you?

272
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,410
Do you know the consequences of coming uninvited

273
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,000
to the dance party here in the Mu Mansion?

274
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,010
I'm Tan Xuanlin, Junior Marshal of the Tan Army.

275
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,380
Tan Ziyao, the commander of the Jiang City guards, was my father.

276
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,243
I was wondering who it was.

277
00:19:55,243 --> 00:19:59,148
It turns that it's Tan Ziyao's son.

278
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,688
I don't think anyone

279
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:04,980
invited you to the party tonight.

280
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,430
My father was the commander of Jiang City.

281
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,570
My uncle, Tan Zijie still guards it now.

282
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,598
How can you select the Commander-in-Chief of Coalition Forces, without us, the Tan family?

283
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:19,290
You're right.

284
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,666
The Tan family is indeed famous.

285
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:26,228
The guard corps risks death by roving bandits!

286
00:20:26,228 --> 00:20:29,689
Your father was also the first one "there"!

287
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,038
<i>The Tan family were also roving bandits.</i>

288
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:34,670
<i>It was just a dog eating another dog.</i>

289
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,080
<i>What a pity.</i>

290
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,080
Young man,

291
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,705
we have no intention of offending your father.

292
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:46,853
Truly, we do not.

293
00:20:46,853 --> 00:20:49,870
However, the selection today has nothing to do with the Tan family.

294
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,710
So, please leave at once.

295
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,950
We naturally won't argue with a kid.

296
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,514
Governor Xu.

297
00:21:00,514 --> 00:21:03,170
Please don't think of me as a kid.

298
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,758
Your Tan Army was disbanded ten years ago.

299
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:09,530
You still dare to come to this party?

300
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,128
If you can't come to your senses,

301
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:14,894
I'm going to have someone escort you out.

302
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,730
I've come here today

303
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,638
as everyone is assembled

304
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:22,290
to announce some good news.

305
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,246
The Defense Command of Shanghai

306
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:27,520
has been taken over by me.

307
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,803
From now on, your personal safety

308
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:35,043
is up to me to guarantee.

309
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:38,830
Taken over by you?

310
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,409
What kind of joke is this?

311
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:42,133
Where's Wu Xiangying?

312
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,770
Military Governor Xu,

313
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,606
don't waste any more of your strength.

314
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,712
Let me call him for you.

315
00:21:47,712 --> 00:21:49,511
Wu Xiangying!

316
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
Wu Xiangying!

317
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm sorry, Governor Xu.

318
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,400
Now the Defense Command of Shanghai

319
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,100
follows the orders of Junior Marshal Tan.

320
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Fine.

321
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,600
Tan Xuanlin, you dare to play dirty tricks here.

322
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,000
You are starting a rebellion!

323
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Shanghai, the metropolis infested with foreign adventurers,

324
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,400
can only be ruled by the capable.

325
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,200
Xu Bojun, since you could do it,

326
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,200
why can't I?

327
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,400
You little brat.

328
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Do you know no shame?

329
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,300
The Revolutionary Army is coming in great force.

330
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,100
You're even turning the gun around to point it at those on your own side!

331
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,400
Governor Pei,

332
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,600
now you're starting to say I'm one of your own.

333
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,300
Why? Doesn't it feel good to be outsmarted by

334
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,400
a young man?

335
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,800
Outrageous! Arrest him!

336
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,400
I'd like to see who dares!

337
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

338
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,300
Tan Xuanlin, put the gun down.

339
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,500
So, it's the son of Military Governor Xu.

340
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,200
Are you trying to take my life?

341
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,800
I don't want to kill you.

342
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,000
Shanghai is under the protection of the Xu family.

343
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,400
Let the other guests go first.

344
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,600
Don't get them involved.

345
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,400
We can sit down and talk about our business.

346
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,900
Tan Xuanlin, you're looking for death!

347
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,300
Governor Xu,

348
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,000
I don't think you've understood the situation.

349
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,400
I already have the Mu Mansion surrounded.

350
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,800
I have troops stationed

351
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,700
on the railways, roads, and docks.

352
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,800
Even if you do get out of here,

353
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,200
you can't get out of Shanghai.

354
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
You, come out!

355
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,800
Put the gun down.

356
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,500
Or else, I'll shoot her.

357
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,800
What does that have to do with me?

358
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,800
Oh, right! Why are you pointing a gun at me?

359
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,400
Don't play games with me.

360
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,200
She's your younger sister.

361
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,500
Am I right?

362
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,000
Little girl,

363
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
when did I claim you as my sister?

364
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm so sorry. I have a terrible memory.

365
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,300
Tell me.

366
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,800
Have I ever claimed you as my sister?

367
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,900
H-He's right.

368
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,700
I don't even know him. Who is he?

369
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,200
I think you've got the wrong person.

370
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,800
When he came in just now, you started to look at him with shifty eyes.

371
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
And you're both have the same surname, Tan.

372
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
I don't believe you two don't know each other.

373
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Anyway, I'll count to three.

374
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,000
If you don't put the gun down,

375
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,200
I'll shoot her.

376
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,300
Little girl, don't blame me for not saving you.

377
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,800
If you must, blame yourself for having the wrong surname.

378
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Shoot her.

379
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,400
Three! Two! One! Shoot her!

380
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,400
Don't hurt the innocent.

381
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,700
Tan Xuanlin,

382
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,400
what do you want from me?

383
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,500
Governor Xu,

384
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,200
as long as you and Governor Pei jointly send a telegram to the whole country

385
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,100
acknowledging my control over Shanghai,

386
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,200
I'll immediately let you out of the city.

387
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,400
You don't have the right to negotiate with me.

388
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,500
What if I refuse to send the telegram?

389
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,600
What can you do to me?

390
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,100
The lives of everyone present are all worth more than mine.

391
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,600
But what if I open Shanghai

392
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,600
to the Revolutionary Army?

393
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,700
All you high and mighty governors

394
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,300
and resplendent officers,

395
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,800
won't you all lose everything?

396
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,500
So you're threatening me?

397
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,400
Without leverage,

398
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
why would I come here to negotiate?

399
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,800
Governor Xu,

400
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,700
either you'll be the commander-in-chief,

401
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,700
giving Shanghai over to my protection,

402
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,300
or I surrender to the Revolutionary Army

403
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,400
and let you go to war again.

404
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
How about that? It's your choice to make.

405
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,800
Choose wisely.

406
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,300
Junior Marshal Tan.

407
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,800
you just want control over Shanghai. Is that so?

408
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,000
You didn't have to make things so difficult.

409
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,500
Tell me.

410
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,000
Junior Marshal Tan,

411
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,500
actually, I sympathize with you very much.

412
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,500
The Tan Army was dispersed ten years ago.

413
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,800
You've wandered with a homeless army.

414
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,000
You must have suffered a lot.

415
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,300
Why don't you join us?

416
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,300
My father can recommend you as Commander of Shanghai.

417
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,000
How about that?

418
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,600
You scholars are such good talkers.

419
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
But I won't fall for that trick of yours.

420
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,400
Choose one from the two options I said before.

421
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,800
The rest is out of the question.

422
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,400
Wanqing,

423
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
what are you doing?

424
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,100
Let Junior Marshal Xu go or I'll shoot you.

425
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,500
Miss Mu,

426
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,100
we meet again.

427
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,800
It's true that one really can't avoid one's enemy.

428
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,700
This afternoon at the Far East Hotel,

429
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,500
we walked around as lovers.

430
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,400
And now you're pointing a gun at me?

431
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,000
It really casts a chill over me.

432
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,400
Stop your nonsense!

433
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,000
You obviously kidnapped me.

434
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,100
Do you know how to use a gun?

435
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,300
Don't let it go off accidentally. You might hurt yourself.

436
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,400
Shut up.

437
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,800
Where's my mother's urn?

438
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,200
How about this?

439
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,300
You tell him to put the gun down, and I'll take you to get it.

440
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,000
Wanqing, don't listen to him.

441
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,100
Your new sweetheart and your old love. Choose one.

442
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,400
Me or him?

443
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,600
Junior Marshal Tan.

444
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't know what kind of problems

445
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,500
Wanqing and you once had,

446
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,400
but her biological mother died of illness in Japan not long ago.

447
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,800
She has returned to her hometown to fulfill her mother's wish.

448
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,200
So, please don't do anything

449
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,200
to desecrate the memory of the deceased.

450
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,100
Mr. Mu,

451
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,900
I have no disrespect for your wife.

452
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,600
I took great care of her urn.

453
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,700
As soon as Governor Xu sends the telegram,

454
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,900
I'll offer you the urn with my own two hands.

455
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Unless, as Guangyao said,

456
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,200
you come under my command,

457
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,300
there is no chance of that.

458
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,100
Sending a telegram to the whole country is a matter of great importance.

459
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,900
It's not that I won't give you time to think,

460
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,800
But, Junior Marshal Xu,

461
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,900
you will have to come with me.

462
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,100
As soon as the telegram is sent, I'll send you back at once.

463
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,600
Wait a minute.

464
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Let him go. I'll go with you.

465
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Wanqing!

466
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,200
Wanqing, what are you trying to do?

467
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,100
Dad, I must go and get my mother's urn back.

468
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,400
Mr. Tan, I'll be your hostage.

469
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,200
Don't make things difficult for our guests.

470
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,500
Mom, she's crazy. Right?

471
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Oh, you must love him so much.

472
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
But first prove to me

473
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,300
that you are more suitable than he is.

474
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,900
I am the eldest daughter of the Mu family.

475
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,700
I'm also the daughter-in-law of the Xu family.

476
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,400
You'll kill two birds with one stone by taking me away.

477
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,700
You'll also put both families under control at one time.

478
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,600
Who else is more suitable than me?

479
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,700
The daughter-in-law of the Xu family?

480
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,400
I…

481
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,400
The reason the Xu family is here today

482
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,100
is to propose marriage.

483
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,300
Everyone here just saw that

484
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,200
it was Mr. Xu and I who danced the first dance.

485
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,800
Good.

486
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,800
It seems that no one is more suitable than you.

487
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,300
Wu Xiangying! Take her away!

488
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,500
This Mr. Tan.

489
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,400
Take me away and let Miss Mu go.

490
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,500
Take her away!

491
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,000
You!

492
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,000
Miss Mu, please.

493
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,300
Governor Xu. Governor Pei.

494
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,300
Miss Mu's life is now in your hands.

495
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,200
I hope tomorrow morning,

496
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,600
I'll see the telegram.

497
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,200
Little Sister!

498
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,800
Come out of here with me!

499
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,900
Yes.

500
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,000
You... How dare you lie to us!

501
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,000
Junior Marshal Pei, my name and phone number are real.

502
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,400
Call me when you have time. Bye-bye!

503
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,800
Look at what you've done.

<i>[Shanghai Chongde Girls' High School Dormitory]</i>

505
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,000
You can't even keep an eye on a silly little girl.

506
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,700
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

507
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,600
Junior Marshal, it's my fault.

508
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,510
Do you think you can escape the scolding?

509
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,900
Did you know that you almost ruined my plans today?

510
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,400
Brother,

511
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
don't be mad.

512
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,600
You see, today you gave me a look,

513
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,700
and I knew what you meant immediately.

514
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,500
We made a perfect... team.

515
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,200
Tan Si,

516
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,300
at this time, she can no longer leave the school.

517
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,800
Yes.

518
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,500
Brother. Wait, no.

519
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,200
Brother! Bro—

520
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,300
Military Governor Xu,

521
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,400
my daughter is being held hostage because of your son.

522
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,700
If you don't send the telegram tomorrow morning,

523
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,000
you won't get another penny of military funding from me.

524
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,400
Mr. Mu,

525
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
what do you mean by that?

526
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,900
Don't forget why

527
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,700
you're able to do such good business in Shanghai.

528
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,800
If you don't have the backing of Governor Xu

529
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,000
and if you don't have weapons,

530
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,800
even as a very rich man,

531
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,600
you're just a fat sheep in the eyes of others.

532
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,500
Then let me make it clear.

533
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,400
If anything happens to my daughter,

534
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,200
even if I am only just a fat sheep,

535
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,400
you won't get another bite of meat out of me.

536
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,500
Enough.

537
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,400
His daughter's life is at stake.

538
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,500
Mr. Mu is obviously upset.

539
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,500
Now is not the time to argue.

540
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,500
Father,

541
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,700
I think I still want to go.

542
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,000
I want to reason with that Tan character.

543
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,400
Now is the time for us to resort to arms.

544
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,400
It would be good if we can recruit

545
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,200
that Tan and his army.

546
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,790
After Tan Ziyao's death, the Tan Army

547
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,400
have been fighting as mercenaries to earn a living.

548
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,300
Such mercenaries will not be loyal to us

549
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,100
even if we take command of them.

550
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,200
Father, don't worry about that.

551
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,200
This Tan character, if he really wants to stand against you,

552
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,600
he could announce

553
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,200
the occupation of Shanghai himself.

554
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,400
Since he wants your recognition,

555
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,600
that means he doesn't want to be in open warfare with us.

556
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,400
The kidnapping of Wanqing

557
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,700
was just to make the situation less embarrassing.

560
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,600
Junior Marshal!

561
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,600
Yes, Sir!

562
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,900
You guys really don't pay attention to the details, do you?

563
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,800
How can he make Longjing tea with boiling water?

564
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,300
It tastes bitter.

565
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,000
But the food is fine.

566
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,500
It's just a little greasy.

567
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,400
Next time, send me something lighter.

568
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,600
You enjoy being a hostage, don't you?

569
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,000
I take things as they come.

570
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,900
You wouldn't dare to do anything to me anyways.

571
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,000
Wouldn't I, though?

572
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,400
What are you doing?

573
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,300
Give me back my mother's urn.

574
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,100
That depends on when your future father-in-law,

575
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,100
Xu Bojun, sends the telegram.

576
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,400
Don't talk so close to me.

577
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,000
I can hear you.

578
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,600
Okay.

579
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,600
Then tell me about it.

580
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,200
Are you really going to marry Xu Guangyao?

581
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,700
No.

582
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,900
Oh, you're so honest.

583
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,000
Tell me. Why did you lie to me?

584
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Why do you want to be my hostage in Xu Guangyao's place?

585
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Junior Marshal Xu saved me before.

586
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,300
I was just returning the favor.

587
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,000
That's all?

588
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,100
That's all.

589
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,900
Now, it's your turn to answer my question.

590
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,800
Why did you agree that I replace Junior Marshal Xu?

591
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,000
I've told you that before.

592
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,100
If a beautiful woman like you

593
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,000
wants to come with me,

594
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,300
why would I refuse?

595
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,900
Do you expect me to believe that?

596
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,500
So you think I'd believe you?

597
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,400
You didn't come to Shanghai

598
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,000
just to bury your mother, did you?

599
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,700
I took the time to read it.

600
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,400
In fact, you are the real eldest daughter of the Mu family.

601
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,300
Now, Ms. Cui of the Mu household

602
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,400
was actually your mother's servant.

603
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,300
Your younger sister...

604
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,100
is the illegitimate daughter of your father and her (the mom's) servant.

605
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,400
Am I right?

606
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,300
It's a pity that your brother tragically died ten years ago.

607
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,300
Your mother was so distraught that she took you away to Japan,

608
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,800
which allowed that servant girl

609
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,400
and the illegitimate daughter to take your place.

610
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,700
Anyone would be angry about that kind of thing.

611
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,900
Don't try to provoke me.

612
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,200
I came back to Shanghai just to bury my mother.

613
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,970
They're like sparrows flying up thinking they'll become phoenixes.

614
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,170
But what about you?

615
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,400
You're like the falling phoenix, inferior to the common birds.

616
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,000
I wonder how you'll be able to live your life under another's roof.

617
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,300
I'm worried about you.

618

I advise you to worry more about yourself.

If Governor Xu doesn't send the telegram,

620

I'd like to see what you'll do.

621
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,600
What a loving couple we are.

622
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,200

Whether it's good news or bad news,

635

depends on how you conduct yourself.

636

Does that mean you want to negotiate with me?

Naturally, it would be good news if we could make a deal.

If we can't, you can hold me captive

Guangyao is a boy with a conscience.

659
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,200
He hasn't forgotten that

660
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,700
it was my girl, Wanqing, who suffered for him.

661
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,400
So this is the future you said you'd help me find.

662
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,000
It sounds somewhat reasonable.

663
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,800
If you agree to hand over your military and financial power,

664
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,800
and disband the Tan force, then...

665
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,000
my father will not only send a telegram to admit you,

666
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
but will also recommend you to Army Headquarters

667
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,300
as a follower of the Xu family.

668
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,000
As soon as the letter of appointment arrives,

669
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,200
you'll be the rightful Commander of Shanghai.

670
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,600
A fine fowl perches only on fine trees.

671
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,900
Wouldn't this be a good time to join us?

672
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,200
"A fine fowl perches only on fine trees." That's a very good line.

673
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,300
I quite agree.

674
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,200
Well, how can I be sure that in your father's eyes,

675
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
I am a fine fowl

676
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,200
and not a fat goose?

677
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,300
