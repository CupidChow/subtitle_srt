Even now,

352
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,900
the opposite conclusion.

353

Today, I think I...

361
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,570
I've been too self-righteous,

362
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,520
refusing to listen to others' opinions,

363
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,730
blind to the evidence before my eyes.

364

for a long time, haven't you?

365

No. Not at all.

368
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840

369
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,880
Your intuition has always been accurate.

370

from frontline work.

374
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,990

You got stabbed in the belly.

384

Why do I trust my intuition?

388
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,970
Because since childhood,

389
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,270

520
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,200
In this world,

521
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,920
everyone else is an outsider.

522
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,980
Only you and I are connected by blood.

523
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,530
The promises I made—

524
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,800
I can still keep them!

525
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,160
I told Mom today

526
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,400
what I promised her

527
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,750
still stands.

528
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,600
Actually, all these years,

529
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,220
I often thought of you.

530
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,910
I hoped you were still alive,

531
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,680
so at least there would be someone

532
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,750
I could talk to.

533
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,240
Some people say twins

534
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,000
have telepathic connections.

535
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,130
Do you believe that?

536
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,900
I regret it.

537
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,960
I really do.

538
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,720
There's no point

539
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,340
bringing up the past anymore.

540
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,080
We should look ahead, right?

541
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,750
If you want money,

542
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,350
I'll do everything I can.

543
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,270
Consider it my way of making amends.

544
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,400
As for other things,

545
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,240
we can talk about them later.

546
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,210
As long as you're willing.

547
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,920
Let's meet,

548
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,310
okay?

549
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,350
Sure.

550
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,170
Let's meet then.

551
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,320
Xiaowei.

552
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,960
I've modified it the way you said.

553
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,440
It can knock someone out in an instant,

554
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,100
but it won't cause any injury.

555
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,640
You asked around
for his phone number at Zhuo'er.

556
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,100
Could that cause trouble?

557
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,030
No.

558
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,110
I've taken care of everything.

559
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,510
It shouldn't be an issue.

560
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,920
Are you sure
you only ran into him briefly?

561
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,590
Yes, I'm sure.

562
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
That boss—

563
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,830
he won't go digging
into my household records, will he?

564
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,510
No,

565
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,100
he's not a police officer.

566
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,070
But for the time being,

567
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,870
you'd better keep a low profile.

568
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,270
Okay.

569
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,720
Aunt!

570
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,400
Why are you back so late?

571
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,310
Xiaoling asked me
to save some food for you.

572
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,720
If it were up to me,
I wouldn't have left you any.

573
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,270
Uncle and Xiaoling are already asleep?

574
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:56,720
Yes.

575
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,110
Eat.

576
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,240
Look at you.

577
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,200
You can't see,

578
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,160
yet you're always running around outside.

579
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,960
You'll spend money if you go out.

580
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,370
When can you ever save anything that way?

581
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,210
Why don't you

582
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,570
give me your money?

583
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,180
I'll manage it for you.

584
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,960
Quit grinning like that.

585
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,590
Here, fish.

586
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,880
Do you know how much grass carp sells

587
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,400
for per 500 grams at the market now?

588
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,750
Here.

589
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,240
Eat.

590
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,440
Eat some fish.

591
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,590
Wait a moment.

592
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,550
What's the rush?

593
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,280
No need.

594
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:40,920
No need for what?

595
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,080
Can you even see?

596
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,200
If a fishbone gets stuck in your throat,

597
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,000
you'll have to go to the hospital.

598
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,550
Going to the hospital to remove it

599
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,640
means paying medical fees.

600
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,480
And who's going to cover that?

601
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,240
It'll be me.

602
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,310
What's going on?

603
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,960
See? See?

604
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,200
I'm just teasing you.

605
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,640
Seriously,

606
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,510
you're an adult now.

607
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,510
Why can't you

608
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,480
act properly?

609
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,090
I can't believe you.

610
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,070
Here.

611
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,970
Be careful.

612
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,270
Tell me,

613
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,720
wouldn't it be better
if you just stay home

614
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,520
and work shifts with your uncle?

615
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,760
Let me see. Here.

616
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,510
How come I didn't see it? Really.

617
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,880
Always reading those books,

618
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,750
listening to those radio programs—

619
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,750
what's the point?

620
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,390
Will it get you into college?

621
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,960
Carpentry,

622
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,440
bamboo weaving,

623
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,230
and... and what else?

624
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,530
And repairing household appliances?

625
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,550
How many times have you shocked yourself?

626
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,880
You're still laughing?

627
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,550
You'll be shocked to death one day.

628
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,510
Really.

629
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,440
Here.

630
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:39,830
Aunt.

631
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,680
I'm leaving.

632
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,570
Where are you going?

633
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,350
Here.

634
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,570
I've found a relative.

635
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,960
A relative?

636
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,580
Since when do you have a relative?

637
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,720
It's been over 10 years.

638
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,750
I've never heard of you
having any relatives.

639
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,270
Don't get tricked again.

640
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,400
It's fine.

641
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,350
Whenever I have time,

642
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,320
I'll come back to visit you all.

643
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,160
Really?

644
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,159
In the future,

645
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,850
stay in touch if you want to.

646
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,360
If not, forget it.

647
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,360
Whatever.

648
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,810
Xiaowei.

649
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,440
Are you never

650
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,500
coming back again?

651
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,930
Why are you leaving?

652
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,760
Is it...

653
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,320
because you're not happy

654
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,650
living with our family?

655
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,440
Have you thought about

656
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,110
what will happen to our family

657
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,190
after you leave?

658
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,440
My dad and mom—

659
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,110
how sad they'll be?

660
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,230
Big Brother listens to everything you say.

661
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,960
What will he do after you leave?

662
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,150
And me.

663
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,630
Who's going to support me

664
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,960
in learning to play the guitar?

665
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,020
Who'll be there to listen when I sing?

666
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,710
Xiaoling,

667
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,480
I'm sorry.

668
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,030
It's all my fault.

669
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,760
But whether I'm here or not,

670
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,410
you must keep working hard.

671
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,820
If you have dreams,

672
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,670
you should strive to achieve them.

673
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,030
That's what makes life meaningful.

674
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,590
Right?

675
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,880
I understand all that!

676
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,550
What I don't understand is

677
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,150
why you have to leave us.

678
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,710
It took me 16 years

679
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,670
to finally understand this:

680
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,230
running away only brings

681
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,360
more suffering.

682
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,960
Actually, before I came to this family,

683
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,880
I had my own family.

684
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,690
But because I ran away,

685
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,670
they were

686
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,030
deeply hurt.

687
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,160
So now,

688
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,710
I have to face it.

689
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,360
I have to resolve all these problems.

690
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,480
Otherwise,

691
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,440
I don't deserve to be your brother.

692
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,480
And I don't deserve to continue to live

693
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,550
in this world.

694
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,400
He's gone.

695
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,910
Should we follow him?

696
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,810
Let's follow him first.

697
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,960
Although

698
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,350
I don't understand what you're saying,

699
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,880
I can tell

700
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,640
it's something very important to you.

701
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,210
I truly hope you...

702
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,710
you'll never have to understand.

703
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,710
Just like the lyrics

704
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,970
of your favorite song:

705
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,190
"May your eyes

706
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,710
only see smiles.

707
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:25,320
May every tear you shed

708
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,800
move someone's heart."

709
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,320
He went in.

710
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,790
Are you really going?

711
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,000
Are you sure about the house number?

712
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,630
I asked the property management.

713
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,440
I gave them 2 cartons of cigarettes, so...

714
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,700
it should be reliable.

715
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,250
Xiaowei,

716
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,760
if... if you just go in
and talk to him like this,

717
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,800
will he even admit it?

718
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,460
Whether he'll admit it or not,

719
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,960
I'll go meet him,

720
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
just like he said.

721
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Two rows of buttons.

722
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,250
Left side: B2 to 7.

723
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,390
Right side: 8 to 16.

724
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
There's Braille.

725
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,400
After you step out of the elevator,
it's on your left.

726
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,030
I know.

727
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,170
Maybe I should go with you.

728
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,670
No need.

729
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,270
I can manage on my own.

730
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
You go back first.

731
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:47,710
Okay.

732
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,710
Be careful.

733
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,190
Okay.
