I went to the police station.

If this has nothing to do with her,

222

why didn't she answer my phone?

223
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,900
She even turned off her phone!

Nonsense.

254
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,260
The police said she was murdered!

255
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,630
That's because the police don't know

256

[The only person I feel guilty towards]

348
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,670
[is you, Mom.]

349
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,290
[You've always been]

350
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,730
[so proud of me.]

351
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,350
[But I'm sorry, Mom.]

352
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,810
[I let you down this time.]

353
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,940
[Your loving daughter, Hao Meili]

354
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,160
You're such an ugly freak!

355
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,300
You are so annoying!

356
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,820
Qu Tong.

357
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,440
You won't come to a good end.

358
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,640
Meili.

359
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,750
What's wrong?

360
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,510
Why are you crying so late at night?

361
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,000
Get up! Let's go home!

362
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,550
Get up. What happened?

363
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,000
Don't cry.

364
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,440
What happened? Tell me.

365
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,350
Don't cry.

366
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,270
Don't cry.

367
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,830
What happened to you?

368
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,200
Mom.

369
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,550
Help me.

370
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
I killed someone.

371
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,490
I killed someone.

372
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,770
You killed someone.

373
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,550
Who did you kill?

374
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,720
I don't know if she's dead or not.

375
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,680
But I don't regret it.

376
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,240
I don't regret it.

377
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,830
Who is it?

378
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,120
Qu Tong.

379
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,680
I killed her.

380
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,770
You must never tell anyone.

381
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,890
Got it?

382
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,460
Never tell anyone.

383
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,880
Never tell anyone.

384
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,240
Mom.

385
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,920
The job was very important

386
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,480
to Mother and me.

387
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,840
Dad has passed away.

388
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,980
And Mother and I

389
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,110
did not have enough

390
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,270
to live

391
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,200
on those hard present years.

392
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,510
Meili.

393
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,160
Mom.

394
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,840
How is it?

395
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,440
I saw Qu Tong just now.

396
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,910
She was with her mother.

397
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800
I think she's fine. Don't worry.

398
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,340
Are you sure, mom?

399
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,240
Yes.

400
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,830
But that day...

401
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,030
Was that someone else

402
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,640
with an umbrella that looked like hers?

403
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,510
Or

404
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,110
she was actually fine,
but she was just faking it?

405
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,000
Sit down.

406
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,160
Listen to me.

407
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,880
Just pretend it never happened

408
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,720
and never mention it again, okay?

409
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,660
Remember that.

410
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,750
But...

411
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,000
Who else could it be?

412
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,550
Then...

413
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,070
Well,

414
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,000
you have an uncle who lives abroad.

415
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,410
Go abroad.

416
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,030
Go to college there
and take the exam again.

417
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,360
Your English is so good.

418
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,960
I'll save money for you.

419
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,680
But...

420
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,680
But studying abroad is expensive,

421
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,240
Mom.

422
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,920
It's okay.

423
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,300
I'm with you. Don't worry.

424
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,780
I'll borrow money from someone else.

425
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,920
That's it.

426
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,690
Alright.

427
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,230
Mom.

428
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,960
No.

429
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,880
Su Muxin.

430
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,100
I still didn't see you today.

431
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,690
This is

432
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,030
the fifteenth day.

433
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,150
Every time the sun sets,

434
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,440
the river is always beautiful.

435
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,310
I want to watch

436
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,990
this lovely scenery with you.

437
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,110
But unfortunately,
every day there's only me

438
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,000
and the beacon tower,

439
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,790
forming two lonely shadows.

440
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,510
No matter

441
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,010
whether you're avoiding me
on purpose or not,

442
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,960
I'll still come and wait

443
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,820
under the beacon tower every day,

444
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,640
until you show up.

445
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,350
I'll always wait for you.

446
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,510
Always.

447
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:19,960
Always.

448
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,160
Meili.

449
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,960
Study hard and make progress every day.

450
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,930
You can't drink the tap water.

451
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,030
Muxian, you...

452
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,440
Where are you going at this hour?

453
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,110
Meili went to school.

454
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,290
It's getting dark.

455
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,830
And she still hasn't come back.

456
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,640
She's such a naughty kid.

457
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,270
She deserves a spanking.

458
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,510
Didn't Meili...

459
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,740
She went to school.

460
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,880
I can do it myself.

461
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,510
I can do it myself.

462
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,110
Let's go.

463
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,070
Muxian.

464
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,550
Go home.

465
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,240
Xiaowei.

466
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,250
Time to eat.

467
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,350
Coming.

468
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,110
Qu Tong.

469
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,080
Do you have no appetite?

470
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,690
I'm not hungry.

471
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,480
Don't worry.

472
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,160
Give me two more days.

473
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,680
I'll get everything arranged

474
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,340
for the trip to the northwest.

475
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,960
Let's go take a look at the beacon tower,

476
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,510
okay?

477
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,730
We might not get another chance
in the future.

478
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,720
Are we there yet?

479
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,640
Yes.

480
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,590
It's okay.

481
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,490
I'll wait for you two here.

482
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,240
Okay.

483
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,300
By the ancient path,

484
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,590
green grass stretches to the sky.

485
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,570
It has been so long
since I last came here.

486
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,320
Everything here is different from before.

487
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,640
But the beacon tower is still the same,

488
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,960
only a little more worn out.

489
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,270
It's on your left.

490
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,310
Doesn't it

491
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,350
just stand there firm and steady

492
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,550
like my walking cane?

493
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,670
The ground here

494
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,250
is different from before.

495
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,640
There used to be so many cobblestones.

496
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,400
But now,

497
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,510
it's all small gravel.

498
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,590
Is this it?

499
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,350
Yes.

500
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,640
But

501
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,020
we need the kind

502
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
that's round and flat.

503
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,540
Is this the right one?

504
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,520
This is good.

505
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,410
Watch closely.

506
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,070
How is it?

507
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,840
One, two, three.

508
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,690
I haven't been this happy in ages.

509
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,510
16 years.

510
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,110
Time flies.

511
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,110
The world has changed.

512
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,400
But you're the only one
who hasn't changed.

513
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,630
If you hadn't

514
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,880
met me again,

515
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,440
you would have stayed
at the massage parlor,

516
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,040
living a happy life forever.

517
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,389
Do you still remember

518
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,690
what we used to play

519
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,739
here?

520
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,120
Hide-and-seek.

521
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,020
Do you want to play now?

522
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,400
Now?

523
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,760
Well, why not?

524
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,230
No.

525
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,950
It's not fair.

526
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,230
I'm blind. I can't see.

527
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,550
You dare not?

528
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
I dare not?

529
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,800
Have you ever defeated me
in hide-and-seek?

530
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,110
I won every time!

531
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,000
To be fair,

532
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,830
let's cover our eyes this time.

533
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,710
Come on.

534
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,860
I'm not afraid.

535
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,030
Come on.

536
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,230
Okay.

537
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,690
How do we cover our eyes?

538
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,010
Use my clothes?

539
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,880
No need.

540
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,490
I brought it.

541
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,550
You cover my eyes.

542
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,550
What about yours?

543
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,870
I brought two.

544
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,600
You're well prepared, huh?

545
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,360
Come on.

546
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,150
I'll cover your eyes first.

547
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,680
Go ahead.

548
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Is it necessary

549
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,100
that you cover my eyes?

550
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,670
Only this is fair.

551
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,920
Are you done?

552
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,240
Are you done?

553
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,830
Yes.

554
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:39,960
Count slowly.

555
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,280
Okay.

556
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,710
One.

557
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,110
Two.

558
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,230
Three.

559
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,480
Four.

560
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:13,760
Five.

561
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,800
Six.

562
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,110
Seven.

563
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,000
Eight.

564
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,230
Nine.

565
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:39,840
Ten.

566
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,710
I'm coming.

567
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,760
The sound went this way,

568
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,480
right?

569
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,230
Qu Tong.

570
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,840
Give me a hint.

571
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,960
Qu Tong.
