175
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,570
and his lover, Shi Yue,

176
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,300
both loved this dry white wine.

177
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,440
Shi Yue often bought it

178
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,500
and brought it back to their residence.

179
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,270
After Shen Jing observed this,

180
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,220
she prepared the same dry white wine
in advance.

181
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,500
After injecting it with poison,

182
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,320
while the company arranged

183
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,650
the design-work session,

184
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,840
she swapped the bottle

185
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,360
on Shi Yue's desk.

186
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,330
Her goal

187
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,140
was to poison both of them to death.

188
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,930
What about the source
of the sodium cyanide?

189
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,770
The sodium cyanide also came from

190
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,970
Zhuo'er Jewelry's cleaning workshop.

191
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,450
Although Shen Jing didn't manage directly,

192
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,369
she still patrolled the factory

193
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,599
to check production.

194
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,339
Do we have solid evidence?

195
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,190
Yes, we do.

196
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,099
Shen Jing told Qu Lijun

197
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,410
not to destroy the evidence,

198
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,300
because she feared Qu Tong

199
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,500
would take the blame.

200
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,490
She just voluntarily confessed

201
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,220
where the evidence was buried.

202
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,170
Take him away.

203
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,690
Is the evidence intact?

204
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,990
It's been preserved.

205
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,410
The soft cork with the injection puncture

206
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,280
is still there.

207
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,680
The bottle has Shi Yue's fingerprints.

208
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,850
This indicates

209
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,860
that the wine was indeed
brought by Su Mufan

210
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,190
from Shi Yue's home.

211
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,680
More importantly,

212
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,690
there is also a partial

213
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,060
fingerprint from Shen Jing.

214
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,860
When Shen Jing swapped the wine,

215
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,930
due to time pressure,

216
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,140
she didn't wear gloves.

217
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,780
She used a tissue as a barrier
while handling it,

218
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,540
but still accidentally

219
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,140
left a partial fingerprint.

220

How's Qu Tong?

223
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,820
Qu Tong inhaled water,

228

the pneumonia is almost cured too.

and gave it to Shi Yue.

245

and oral residue analysis

Su Muxin did try to save her.

In this case,

I have a suggestion!

377
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,650

Why are you here?

424
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,170
Sun Qiaofang and Xue Zhong

moved to another province.

426

I know.
