when you see Tong.

Don't worry.

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,180
She's much better now.

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,240
Has she gone out recently?

7
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,370
Take her out for a walk.

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,430
It's

00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,030

10

for a while.

Besides that,

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,850
she doesn't want to go out.

17
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,519
Here's what I think.

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,930
Let's step by step.

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,480
We can't force her

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,970
to become a normal person.

21
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:11,960
To be honest,

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,620
she is willing to communicate with me

23
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,000
and gets close to me occasionally.

24
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:17,950
I'm satisfied.

No hurry.

27

You're right.

Mom,

36
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,660
what made you think of treating me to tea?

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,440

It's just a show.

I don't have to remember it so clearly.

how Tong treats me.

46
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,240
I need some personal space.

47

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,600
you are not generous enough.

Let me put it this way, Mom.

63
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,850
For eight years,

64
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,750
I turned your family's company

65
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,680
from a quiet, unknown

66
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,510
county-level business

67
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,630
into a well-known jewelry brand

68
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,950
in the city.

69
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,680
The next step is provincial expansion.

70
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,190
Then national expansion.

71
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,680
Now the company's revenue

72
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,560
has multiplied several times
compared to before.

73
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,070
Mom,

74
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,680
you don't think

75
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,680
Zhuo'er is still the small workshop

76
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,080

77
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,600
Zhuo'er needed

78
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,600
to expand its business map,

79
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,510
so many companies

80
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,680
have joined.

81
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,970

82

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,630
If you want to kick me out of the company,

85
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,490
you should ask the shareholders.

86
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,800
What do these shareholders

87
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,430
have to do with you?

88
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,950
There is a relationship,

89
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,310
but to

90
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,310
what extent,

91
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,310
I don't think it's necessary

92
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,190
to let you know.

93
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,430
I'm afraid

94
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,510
you'll get angry.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,870
Back then,

96
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,240
you did this for that?

97
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,960
How can you not understand?

98
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,450
I don't want to do this, Mom.

99
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,200
I don't want to divorce Tong.

100
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,070
But I really didn't expect

101
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,680
in the end

102
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,120
you would do this,

103
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,390
backstabbing me.

104
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,240
Fortunately,

105
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,100
I left a way out.

106
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,600
A way out?

107
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,680
Ridiculous.

108
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,310

Severing ties?

110
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,060
Call it severing ties?

111

right?

115
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,150
Alright, then I'll speak about

116
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,550
the things you have done.

117
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,040
Mom,

118
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,080
what's the difference between you and me?

119
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,159
Neither of us is good person.

120
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,750
Why did you

121
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,680
marry Qu Lijun?

122
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,680
Because you had a purpose.

123
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,260
Your purpose wasn't pure.

124
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,790
Wasn't it just to

125
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,240
crawl back to the county town

126
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,950
from that stinky mountain valley?

127
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,010
Wasn't that why you

128
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,020
sold yourself?

129
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,070
Look at you now,

130
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,360
you're living well,

131
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,470
but you're always frowning.

132
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,960
Who are you showing it to?

133
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,310
I know why

134
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,710
you married Qu Tong to me;

135
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,040
wasn't it because I was

136
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,390
a deputy section chief
in the bureau at the time?

137
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,490
Back then, many people

138
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,480
wanted me to

139
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,809
join their companies.

140
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,320
As long as they used my connections,

141
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,360
their companies could improve

142
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,960
by hundreds or thousands of times.

143
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,840
But why

144
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,600
did I choose your family?

145
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,600
Have you ever thought about it?

146
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,600
You sold your daughter,

147
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,460
so stop playing the virtuous one.

148
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,360
From now on,

149
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,840
you'll make the decisions at home,

150
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,810
and I'll listen to you.

151
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,630
You're

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,670
threatening me now,

153
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,720
using those

154
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,920
old, useless things.

155
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,610
Does it still work?

156
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,000
Mom,

157
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,080
you're being foolish.

158
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,910
Don't deny it.

159
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,750
After all, in this family,

160
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,230
you know me the best.

161
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,240
In fact,

162
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
we are the same.

163
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,670
Since

164
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,840
you don't truly love like Tong,

165
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,560
why are you holding onto her?

166
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,510
Who says I don't love her?

167
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,960
I love Tong.

168
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,390
I would love her

169
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,240
with my life!

170
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Who can do it?

171
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,870
Can you?

172
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,510
Listen,

173
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,220
if you want me to leave Tong, fine,

174
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,600
unless she dies,

175
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,510
or I die.

176
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,440
From the moment

177
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,150
I met Tong,

178
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,550
I knew she belonged to me.

179
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,840
Everything I have now

180
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,840
is given by God.

181
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,740
Because God owes me.

182
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,840
Why

183
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,910
could he escape back then,

184
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,480
and I had to stay there?

185
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,030
Why could he study,

186
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,750
go to college,

187
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,480
but I couldn't?

188
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,240
Why does everyone love him

189
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,840
but no one cares about me?

190
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,180
Including Tong.

191
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,330
Over the years,

192
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,690
I've stopped being myself.

193
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,850
But why

194
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,230
can't she forget him?

195
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,750
So, Mom,

196
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,510
I

197
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,240
want Tong to belong to me,

198
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,750
from head to toe, body and heart,

199
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,110
only to me.

200
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,630
Are you crazy?

201
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,750
Are you crazy?

202
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,000
Mom.

203
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,440
Do you remember

204
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,700
what I told you before?

205
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,240
I will always

206
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,840
treat Tong well.

207
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,440
I'll let her live a good life.

208
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,640
In the future,

209
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,550
I'll have another baby with her.

210
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
I will be with her.

211
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,500
I'll always be with her

212
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,580
until she dies.

213
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,330
Don't worry.

214
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,390
All right.

215
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,270
Okay, Mom.

216
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,120
If there's nothing else,

217
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,670
I'm going back to the company.

218
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm busy.

219
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,550
I'll pay the bill.

220
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,760
Su Muxin.

221
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,670
Don't push me too hard.

222
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,720
If you push me,

223
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,750
I'll do anything.

224
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,020
Mom.

225
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,240
Mom.

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,440
I'm Su Mufan.

227
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,150
I only have one name.

228
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,270
My name is Su Muxin.

229
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,570
Over there.

230
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,230
Go ask whose car it is.

231
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,780
Boss.

232
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,670
Xue, where is Xiaowei?

233
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,700
He went back to his hometown.

234
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
He went back home?

235
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,320
No wonder he isn't in the shop.

236
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:08,980
I'm done.

237
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,780
It's comfortable.

238
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,290
Your waist is not good.

239
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,670
Don't do

240
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,930
heavy work.

241
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,790
Yes, yes.

242
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,750
See you.

243
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,730
I'll write it down for you.

244
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,270
Sure.

245
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,290
Make an appointment in advance next time.

246
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,090
OK. Bye.

247
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,150
Xiaoling is so naughty.

248
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,880
After Xiaowei left,

249
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,790
she's been out all day.

250
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,360
I need to teach her a lesson
when she comes back.

251
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,750
I'm so worried.

252

[Xue's Blind Massage]

253
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,870
[Xue's Blind Massage]

254
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,610
Let's go.

255
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,030
Hello.

256
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,600
Massage?

257
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,800
Come in, please.

258
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,790
We're police officers from the Dongjiang

259
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,150
Criminal Investigation Unit.

260
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,810
I'm Zhou Mi.

261
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,770
This is Wu Dong.

262
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,750
Take a look.

263
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,010
Do you know
these two people in the photo?

264
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,440
Why...

265
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,390
why are you looking for them?

266
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,080
Who are you looking for?

267
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,670
These two people
are involved in a criminal case.

268
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,600
Have you seen them?

269
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,530
Do you know them?

270
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,120
No, I don't.

271
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,080
Sit down.

272
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,580
How many people

273
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,240
live here?

274
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,470
Three people.

275
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,360
Only our family.

276
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,580
My name is Xue Zhong.

277
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,240
This is my wife,

278
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,640
Sun Qiaofang.

279
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,200
And we have a daughter,

280
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,030
Xue Xiaoling.

281
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,640
She went out just now.

282
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,030
Our place is simple,

283
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,750
very normal,

284
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,150
it has nothing to do

285
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,630
with your case.

286
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,150
You just said

287
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,850
you have a daughter, right?

288
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,150
These two razors are...

289
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,200
Well,

290
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,390
I bought a new one

291
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,760
for Xue.

292
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,100
And didn't want to throw the old one away.

293
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,240
How many technicians do you have?

294
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,200
Just me.

295
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,880
Okay.

296
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,650
Wu Dong,

297
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,270
take that photo

298
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,880
and ask the neighbors.

299
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,589
They don't recognize them;

300
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,310
maybe the neighbors do.

301
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:16,839
Let's go.

302
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,460
Wait.

303
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,680
What are you doing?

304
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,329
What are you doing?

305
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,960
I've already told you,

306
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,790
we've worked hard

307
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,849
to open this shop.

308
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,750
It's not easy.

309
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,349
You show a photo,

310
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,680
suddenly suspecting them,

311
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,400
and then calling them criminals.

312
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,410
If this

313
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,480
gets out,

314
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,170
how can we

315
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,480
operate

316
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,000
here?

317
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,980
I'm on duty,

318
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,410
please step aside.

319
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,480
No, sir.

320
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Sir, I beg you.

321
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,410
Please, don't investigate anymore.

322
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,500
Please.

323
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,510
This...

324
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,590
this case

325
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,830
has nothing to do with us.

326
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,590
Our kids

327
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,870
are good kids.

328
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Your kids?

329
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,400
Officer,

330
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,750
let me tell you,

331
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,920
Xue.

332
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,600
Can...

333
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,570
can you stop talking?

334
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,880
It's useless now.

335
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,440
Go ahead.

336
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,640
Officer,

337
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,230
if I'm not mistaken,

338
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,520
one of the two people

339
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,060
you're looking for

340
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,920
is Xue Xiaowei of our home.

341
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,550
Xue Xiaowei.

342
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,390
He is my nephew.

343
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,030
Biological Nephew?

344
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,550
No.

345
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,310
No.

346
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,510
We found him

347
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,620
from the river.

348
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,200
He wouldn't tell us his name.

349
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,030
I have a nephew

350
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,510
who died in an accident in 1986,

351
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,590
and his household registration
wasn't cancelled.

352
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,270
We used

353
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,830
his identity.

Sure.

477
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,200
I mean,

478
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,760
did I break the law?

479
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,680
I... I'm asking about

480
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,640
the driving.

481
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,590
I don't know which part of my answer

482
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,030
might have gotten me involved in this.

483
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,360
I can't guarantee that.

484
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,700
If you're not sure,

485
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,850
just ask the police.

486
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,830
Ask them.

487
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,200
If I did this thing,

488
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,160
would it be a crime?

489
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,730
Driving itself
is not a crime.

490
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,030
But deliberately obstructing
a police investigation

491
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,240
is another matter.

492
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,190
Then I'll tell you the truth.

493
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,240
Xiaowei told me to do it.

494
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,720
He told me to drive the car alone,

495
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,480
and when I saw the intersection,

496
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,160
I should rush through.

497
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,920
He also reminded me

498
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,780
to be careful,

499
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,690
don't get hurt,

500
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,000
and don't crash the car.

501
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,310
Otherwise, I'll have to pay
the company back.

502
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,350
The most important thing is,

503
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,160
don't crash into other cars

504
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,440
or people.

505
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,030
As for what Xiaowei is up to,

506
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,270
I really don't know.

507
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,210
I'm just helping a friend.

508
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,240
He asked me to drive,

509
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,200
so I drove.

510
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,340
It wasn't intentional.

511
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,110
Earlier, you mentioned

512
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,640
obstructing traffic...

513
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,110
no,

514
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,180
obstructing the investigation, sorry.

515
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,270
So,

516
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,990
where did Xue Xiaowei go?

517
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,030
I don't know.

518
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,530
Do they have other cars?

519
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,680

520
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,070
can you wait and take note later?

521
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,870
Officer Zhou,

522
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,360
can I ask another question?

523
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:35,830
Sure.

524
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,960
Let's say,

525
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,390
just as an example, not real,

526
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,020
if I knew they have other cars,

527
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,680
but

528
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,150
I didn't tell you,

529
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,750
would that be a crime?

530
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,950
Chen Shuncai,

531
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,750
answer the question.

532
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,590
No need to bargain

533
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,210
or ask extra questions.

534
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,340
Are you playing games with us?

535
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,240
Did Xue Xiaowei teach you this?

536
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,350
If you're not sure how to answer,

537
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,480
just ask the police.

538
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,240
Cooperating with the police investigation

539
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,680
is a citizen's duty.

540
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,380
Understood, understood.

541
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,830
Officer,

542
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,710
please take your notes, go ahead.

543
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,440
Officer Zhou, what was the question

544
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,640
you asked me earlier?

545
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,920
Do they have other cars?

546
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,590
I don't remember.

547
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,830
Chen Shuncai,

548
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,580
do you know where this place is?

549
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,110
Do you know what crime

550
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,640
Xue Xiaowei has committed?

551
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,800
I don't know.

552
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,940
He's suspected of murder.

553
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,630
Chen Shuncai,

554
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,510
if you help him

555
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,030
and obstruct the police investigation,

556
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,160
that's also a crime.

557
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,010
Xiaowei wouldn't kill anyone.

558
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,500
[Video recording]

559
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,230
Don't be nervous,

560
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,320
just answer truthfully.

561
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,550
What's your relationship

562
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,610
with Chen Shuncai?

563
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,230
When we checked
the household registration,

564
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,510
we found that you're not
from the same village,

565
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,880
but you both moved to
South Cross Street at the same time.

566
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,540
Why is that?

567
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,969
Do you know each other?

568
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,760
Officer,

569
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,920
Er Gouzi, no,

570
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,360
Chen Shuncai,

571
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,190
was raised by us.

572
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,360
He's a relative of Xiaofang's family.

573
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,230
By bloodline,

574
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,760
he should be her grandnephew.

575
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,230
His mother died young,

576
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,800
the family was poor,

577
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,240
and they couldn't afford to raise him,

578
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,800
so Xiaofang often brought him

579
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,460
into the house to eat and stay.

580
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,920
It was just

581
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,880
eating here,

582
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,410
sleeping there,

583
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,850
and he lived like that.

584
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,890
Do you know where Xue Xiaowei

585
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,320
and Xue Xiaoling are now?

586
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,760
Xue Xiaowei

587
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,280
has been with your family for 16 years,

588
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,000
didn't you ever ask about his past?

589
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,840
When we found him,

590
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,670
he was barely alive.

591
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,870
Hurry up!

592
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,670
Hurry, Mom!

593
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,630
Hurry, Mom!

594
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,710
Hurry, Mom!

595
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,210
Hurry, Mom!

596
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,160
Chen Shuncai,

597
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,630
put him down!

598
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,210
Chen Shuncai,

599
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,440
let him go!

600
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,760
No!

601
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,840
The water's rushing
in this season.

602
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,640
And you dare touch a drowned man?

603
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,030
I'm talking to you.

604
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,150
Let go or not?

605
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,210
No!

606
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,670
Put him down!

607
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,750
I won't!

608
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,360
It's okay. Don't be afraid;
don't be afraid.

609
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,160
Don't be afraid; don't be afraid;
don't be afraid.

610
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,550
A blind man,

611
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
barely able to survive,

612
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,630
is already doing better than expected.

613
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,800
If it weren't for Xiaoling,

614
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,510
following him every day,

615
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,960
he'd have died long ago.

616
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,110
I know why

617
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,770
he hasn't committed suicide.

618
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,230
He's afraid Xiaoling would be hurt.

619
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,230
A person who thinks about dying every day,

620
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,630
what do you want me to ask?

621
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,360
What do you want me to ask him?

622
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,440
Like this,

623
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,590
it went on for years.

624
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,440
Until later,

625
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,960
I saw him laughing more and more.

626
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,400
I knew then,

627
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,280
this child

628
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
came back to life.

629
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,760
So,

630
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,020
who was Xue Xiaowei closest to

631
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,150
in your family?

632
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,550
It was

633
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,150
Xiaoling.

634
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,630
Does she know

635
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,320
his past?

636
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,890
She probably doesn't know.

637
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,030
Where is she now?

638
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,070
Has she shown any

639
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,670
unusual behavior recently?

640
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
She hasn't shown anything unusual.

641
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,590
Xiaoling is a good child.

642
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,510
She's just

643
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,000
unlucky,

644
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,230
Unlucky?

645
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,960
Xiaofang and I

646
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,550
don't know which one of us is at fault

647
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,320
but we've been unable to
have our own child.

648
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,410
[Video recording]

649
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,110
Xiaoling.

650
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
She's an orphan from our village.

651
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,510
We saw that this child was pitiful,

652
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,280
so we took her in and raised her.

653
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,690
Xiaoling doesn't know about this.

654
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,880
She always thought

655
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,940
she was our biological child.

656
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,440
Xiaoling has nothing

657
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,030
to do with your case.

658
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,230
These three children

659
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,360
are all adopted by you?

660
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,590
Yes.

661
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,450
I can't have children,

662
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
but I'm lucky.

663
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Heaven

664
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,440
gave me three children.

665
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,030
Our family,

666
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,880
though poor,

667
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,680
with one disability,

668
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,430
and

669
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,440
I don’t have much education,

670
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,630
but I think we live pretty well.

671
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,070
I never dared to imagine

672
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,210
that I could have such a family.

673
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,360
Our family

674
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,320
has no bad people.

675
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,360
My children

676
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,230
won't do bad things.
