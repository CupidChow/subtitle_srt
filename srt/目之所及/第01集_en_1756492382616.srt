Su Muxin brought Qu Tong home

571
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,640
from the sanatorium.

572
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,240
She felt wronged and couldn't bear it.

573
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,960
Qu Tong has gone crazy.

574
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,389
She's gone crazy.

575
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,440
Was it...

576
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,770
Was it Su Muxin who sent Qu Tong

577
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,130
to the sanatorium?

578
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,280
No.

579
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,810
My daughter said it was her mother.

580
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,030
Yes.

581
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,770
It was Qu Tong's mother.

[Before the incident]

583
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,670
What's wrong?

584
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,030
Mom.

585
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,889
What happened?

586
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,320
I don't know what's going on either.

587
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,920
I have no idea why we're here.

588
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,550
You don't know what you did?

589
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,810
I really never hit her.

590
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,679
Are you saying she's crazy?

591
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,090
She's mentally ill

592
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,760
so she came to the police station
to file a false report?

593
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,840
Can you lower your voice?

594
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,770
There are people coming and going.

595
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,070
Why... Why don't we

596
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,280
go somewhere else to talk?

597
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,960
Go where?

598
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,040
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

[Foster New Police Conduct

600
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,000
Come here.

601
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,510
Mom.

602
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,360
Dad.

603
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,000
I only know that Tong hates me.

604
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,840
Actually, I hate myself too.

605
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,110
If I could change the past,

606
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,000
I'd do anything.

607
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,170
What she did is indeed too much,

608
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,190
but can you promise me

609
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,230
that you've never hit her?

610
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,160
Can you promise that?

611
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,030
This...

612
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,400
What...

613
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,590
What happened?

614
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,010
Actually, I'm the one who got hit.

615
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,670
This is our family business.

616
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,480
I didn't tell anyone.

617
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,920
I'm human too.

618
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,280
I have my breaking points.

619
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,550
The way Tong looks at me

620
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,080
and her attitude toward meâ€”

621
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,770
I really can't take it much longer.

622
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,640
As long as she's not harmed,

623
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,230
we can seek

00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,590
professional help.
