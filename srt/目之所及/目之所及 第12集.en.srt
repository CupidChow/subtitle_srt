Based on your opinion,

530
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,610
what places in Yunzhou

531
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,240

532
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,640
several conditions?

533
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,550
Yunzhou

534
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,510
is a port city.

535
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,720
Things like waterborne

536
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,650

and train transportation

538
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,460
are very advanced.

539
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,720
If you put it this way,

540
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,440
the search range

541
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,500
is indeed smaller.

542
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,350
But there are

543
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,440
there are also several counties and cities

544
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,750
that fit this condition.

545
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,110
How can you be sure that...

546
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,640
they didn't leave Yunzhou?

547
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,240
Su Muxin's blind.

548
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,720
He's most likely moving together

549
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,480
with Qu Tong.

550
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,920
And since the day before yesterday,

551
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,320
in order to find Qu Lijun,

552
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,640
We set up surveillance in

553
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,920
Yunzhou and Dongjiang.

554
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,850
It should be hard for them to leave.

555
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,810
Then that way we can

556
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,940
carry out a one by one investigation.

It's already been more than five days,

she hasn't come home.

570
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,360
I'm worried about

her whereabouts and safety.

I haven't said all along.

Before Tong Tong went missing,

she was already very abnormal.

didn't tell me what she was going to do.

she was bewitched by bad guys.

Now she's missing and can't be contacted,

582
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,770
It must be controlled by that person.

583
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,440
Do you know who this person

you're talking about is?
