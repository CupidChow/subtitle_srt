Hello.

How much do you know about Su Muxin?

540
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,770
I've heard some things from my daughter.

541
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,730
She said Su Muxin was good to her.

542

But it's a pity he got married so early.

Do you have any photos of her before that?

No.

547

Why not?

548
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,270
She thought she wasn't pretty.

549
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,680
She hated looking at those old pictures.

550
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,010
Even this house where she used to live—

551

she never wanted to come back.

there are recently healed scars.

She attempted suicide?

Does that even matter now?

556

561

when those scars

562
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,640
were made.

563

About a month or 2 ago.

564

She was so foolish.

565
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,860
Was it because of Su Muxin?

566

No.

567
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,590
Su Muxin knew nothing about it.

568
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,980
Then why?

569

Because

No.

Yes.
