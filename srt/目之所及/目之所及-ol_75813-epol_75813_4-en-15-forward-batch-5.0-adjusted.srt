Judging from the time Su Muxin

527
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,890
was witnessed,

528
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,000
with Yunzhou floating corpse.

529
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It doesn’t match.

530
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,160
Then we can be sure that...

531
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,790
Yunzhou floating corpse,

532
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,160
is not Su Muxin.

533
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,160
Besides,

534
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,160
Let's talk about the next step.

535
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,720
Stop dragging.

536
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,680
Next!

537
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,550
I think

538
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,790
we should follow

539
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,680
Su Muxin,

540
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,270
the clue of the murder is on the run.

541
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,160
Keep investigating.

542
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,640
Okay.

543
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,370
Continue to search Su Muxin.

544
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,830
I'll follow my plan.

545
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,000
As long as there is a little possibility,

546
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,170
I won't give up.

547
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,510
If on the 17th

548
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,720
Su Muxin was dead.

549
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,720
Then on the 18th Qu Tong

550
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,720
was meeting with whom?

551
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,480
She went through so much trouble

552
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,310
to circle us around.

553
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,370
What does she want?

554
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,680
I think...

555
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,260
I think this corpse

556
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,160
is not Su Muxin.

557
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,400
This basic physical characteristics

558
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,830
is quite similar to the Su Muxin

559
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,750
that you're looking for.

560
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,680
The time of death has been speculated

561
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,790
[Autopsy opinion]

562
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,160
on the night of July 15

563
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,880
between 18:00 to 24:00,

564
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,310
Then we can fully determine,

565
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,310
that the floating corpse in Yunzhou is not Su Muxin.
