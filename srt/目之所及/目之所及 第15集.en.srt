00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,340
[you'll be free.]

178
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,960
Open your mouth.

179
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,670
Sometimes I really think

180
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,120
you can see.

181
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,790
Regarding your name and identity,

182
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,990
we already have quite a bit of evidence.

183
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,280
But there are still some things

184
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,400
I want to

185
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,970
confirm with you in person.

186
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,400
What is there to confirm?

187
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,960
You already have evidence.

188
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,240
Just convict me then.

189
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,240
You won't get away with your crimes.

190
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,270
We'll figure out

191
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,390
how many crimes

192
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,290
need to be pinned on you.

193
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,900
Is Qu Tong really dead?

194
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:11,940
Yes.

195
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,880
You don't look very sad.

196
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,080
Then what should I do?

197
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,480
Cry here?

198
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,930
I had a crush on her in high school.

199
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,310
Should I hold onto that forever?

200
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,630
After the child died,

201
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,210
she completely fell apart.

202
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,260
She was even sent to a sanatorium.

203
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,890
I heard Qu Tong

204
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,680
had even reported to the police,

205
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,080
saying she was being domestically abused.

206
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,240
Chen.

207
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,220
I need to do something.

208
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,170
What can you do?

209
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,970
I don't know.

210
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,550
Let me think about it.

211
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,200
Xiaowei.

212
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,000
It has been so many years.

213
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
No one knows what's going on

214
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,800
between them.

215
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,110
What can you do?

216
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,140
You don't understand.

217
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,240
It seems

218
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,400
Qu Tong has always kept you in her mind.

219
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,640
Otherwise, she wouldn't have married you.

220
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,400
At least she thinks she married you.

221
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,790
That's because she's stupid.

222
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,830
If she wanted to know the truth,

223
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,830
how could she not know?

224
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,740
They've lived together

225
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,940
for so long.

226
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,330
Couldn't she tell something was off?

227
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,680
She was doing well with my brother.

228
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,350
Do you really have to do this?

229
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,930
Aren't you afraid
Qu Tong won't believe you?

230
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,900
I am afraid.

231
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,040
But after hiding for so many years,

232
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,930
I've had enough.

233
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,180
It's time to make it clear.

234
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,460
So you became jealous of your brother,

235
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,110
hated him,

236
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,370
and killed him.

237
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,240
This was your motive?

238
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,910
If it were you,

239
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,370
would you hate him?

240
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,450
I'm asking you.

241
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,170
[Class 1, Senior 3]

242
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,160
I've been working on the registration form

243
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,490
and noticed something.

244
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,190
What is it?

245
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,170
Your birthday is very auspicious.

246
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,750
All the digits are eight.

247
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,630
Not exactly.

248
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
There's also a six

249
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,480
and a two.

250
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,310
Yes.

251
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,220
Also a six and a two.

252
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,030

[Eight]

258
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,120
Let's talk about Shi Yue.

259
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,620
Why did you kill her?

260
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,660
She deserved to die even more.

261
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,880
She ruined my life.

262
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,050
The crime scene was a mess.

263
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,000
Many things scattered in the living room

264
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,260
were from the kitchen.

265
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,750
You can't see.

266
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,720
I guess Shi Yue started it.

267
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,270
She grabbed something in the kitchen

268
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,330
and threw it at you.

269
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,480
Don't come over!

270
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,570
Don't come near me!

271
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,720
At that time,

272
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,230
Shi Yue had an asthma attack
and collapsed.

273
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,500
She needed her medicine,

274
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,330
so she crawled toward the living room.

275
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,750
But she was struggling to breathe,

276
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,480
and soon lost all her strength.

277
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,750
You didn't know what was happening

278
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,210
or what was wrong with her.

279
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,240
You panicked.

280
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,570
The cabinet was covered

281
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,000
with your fingerprints.

282
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,260
Where is the medicine?

283
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,650
You were looking for the medicine.

284
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,770
You wanted to save her.

285
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,390
You turned on the bathtub faucet

286
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,740
and plugged the drain,

287
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,020
so that later

288
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,350
the neighbors would find out

289
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,720
about Shi Yue's death in time.

290
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,380
Judging from the crime scene,

291
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,450
you didn't plan to hide these.

292
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,440
You're a police officer.

293
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,000
What you need to do is
to catch the criminal.

294
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,400
Now the criminal is here!

295
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
We go by evidence.

296
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,000
The evidence you left is complete.

297
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,920
Chen Shuncai told us everything we asked.

298
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,650
Xue Xiaoling

299
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,780
voluntarily reported to the police.

300
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,030
The sodium cyanide left
at the massage parlor,

301
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,000
and even the tape,

302
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,310
your full fingerprints were left on them.

303
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,640
All these things seemed

304
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,590
to be arranged by you on purpose.

305
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,830
We need to clean this place thoroughly.

306
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,400
Do you have alkaline disinfectant at home?

307
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,600
It's in the bathroom.

308
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,090
Why would I do these?

309
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,850
What benefit would I get

310
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:42,710
by doing these?

311
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,500
Some people still do things

312
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,530
even if there's no benefit.

313
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,500
Really?

314
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,520
I'm not one of those people
you're talking about.

315
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,810
Qu Tong is not dead,

316
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,400
right?

317
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,550
She is dead.

318
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,080
On the night of July 15th,

319
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,440
only you and she were

320
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,570
at the crime scene.

321
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,190
If she were dead,

322
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,810
you could say whatever you want.

323
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,630
You could've easily

324
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,030
pinned the murder charge

325
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,320
on a dead person.

326
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,800
But you didn't choose to do that.

327
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,070
Because she's not dead.

328
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,000
She's on the run.

329
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,850
You're afraid of causing trouble.

330
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,030
Of course I don't want anything bad

331
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,159
to happen to Qu Tong.

332
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,920
But I also don't want you

333
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,770
to make such a stupid mistake.

334
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,400
I don't understand what you're saying.

335
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,550
You're taking the blame for her.

336
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,760
Didn't you just say it?

337
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,880
You have evidence!

338
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,719
You can totally convict me!

339
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,120
Kill me if you want!

340
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,710
Give me the death sentence
if I deserve it!

341
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,710
I'm just a piece of trash!

342
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,909
I don't care!

343
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,680
Take a guess.

344
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,580
If Qu Tong is still alive,

345
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,880
what will she think

346
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,600
when she sees you like this?

347
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,670
I've told you many times.

348
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,360
She's dead.

349
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,260
She's already dead, understand?

350
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,320
I guess

351
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,860
if she isn't dead,

352
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,790
seeing you like this,

353
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,480
she must want to die too.
