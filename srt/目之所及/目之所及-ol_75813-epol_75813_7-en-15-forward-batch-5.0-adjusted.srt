00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,320
in either the water tank
or somewhere in the pipes.

177
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,440
Usually how far in advance

178
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,840
do you notify the residents?

179
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,360
We posted the notice that same day.

180
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,110
For residents
who provided their phone numbers,

181
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,440
we also sent text message notifications.

182
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,480
So if Qu Tong

183
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,440
placed Su Muxin's body

184
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,290
in the water tank,

185
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,510
it would explain why the body

186
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,160
was found in a sealed bag,

187
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,390
and also explain

188
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,150
why she was seen near

189
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,210
Sanjie Restaurant

190
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,480
that afternoon,

191
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,980
as well as why she was so desperate
to lose us

192
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,510
and rush back to Dongjiang.

193
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,300
Goodbye.

194
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,890
Goodbye.

195
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,350
I understand.

196
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,390
So that means her accomplice,

197
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,000
Su Mufan,

198
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,230
disposed of the body together with her.

199
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,800
That's right.

200
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,630
Qu Tong.

201
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,080
Stop right there.

202
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,320
But Shi Muxian's appearance

203
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,650
disrupted their plans.

204
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,990
Qu Tong was taken to the police station.

205
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,510
So Su Mufan moved the body alone.

206
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,589
Can we take Qu Tong

207
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,589
into custody now?

208
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,240
Not yet.

209
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,510
Su Muxin's DNA test results

210
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,720
aren't back yet.

211
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,960
And the water tank was cleaned

212
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,790
on the 18th,

213
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,240
so all traces on the rooftop

214
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,440
have been destroyed
by maintenance workers.

215
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,569
We have no evidence.

216
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,400
So what do you plan to do?

217
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,109
We still need to start

218
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:30,550
with the body disposal site.

219
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,310
Last night I simulated

220
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,550
their body disposal route.

221
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,070
It must meet several conditions.

222
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,690
First,

223
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,830
it needs to start from Dongjiang

224
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,750
and end between Wangjiatuo

225
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,810
and another backwater bay upstream.

226
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,700
Second,

227
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,400
it needs to be relatively close

228
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
to Qu Tong's home.

229
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,880
The security guards
at Qu Tong's residential complex

230
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,240
start their break at midnight.

231
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,200
So during that time period,

232
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,030
there's no record
of vehicles entering or leaving.

233
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,440
The body was likely dumped

234
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,240
sometime between midnight

235
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,510
and dawn on the 19th.

236
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,550
Additionally,

237
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,480
it needs to completely avoid

238
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
all traffic surveillance cameras.

239
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,800
So locations meeting all these conditions

240
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,720
are only these four.

[Map of Yunzhou]

But there's one thing

243
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,400
I still can't figure out.

244
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,350
Based on the current river flow rate,

245
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,310
the body should have appeared

246
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,770
in Tangchuan Town between

247
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,790
Dongjiang and Yunzhou on the 20th.

248
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,350
Why did it appear in Yunzhou?

249
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,130
This is a backwater bay, right?

250
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,610
Is that upstream area Dongjiang?

251
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,350
Yes.

252
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,310
I haven't figured this out yet.

253
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,720
It's okay.

a breakthrough
at these four locations,

257
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,180
right?

258
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,490
Alright.

259

the former village secretary
of Chen Village.

Why would you do something so foolish?

350
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,170
What's going on?

351
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,790
What could be so unbearable?

352
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,220
Over there, over there.

353
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,920
What made you so desperate?

354
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:19,840
Li.

355
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,520
She was just fine a moment ago.

356
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,760
Why did she drink pesticide?

357
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,070
I heard her arguing with Mufan.

358
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,640
It seems

359
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,380
she was forced to drink it.

360
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,330
Hurry, carry her out.

361
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,440
Send her to the clinic!

362
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,350
Give us a hand!

363
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:32,890
Hurry!

364
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
The car's here! The car's here!

365
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,780
Hurry up!

366
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,720
Quick! Careful, careful!

367
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,550
Make way! Make way!

368
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,200
Move aside!

369
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,960
Slow down. Be careful!

370
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,750
Gently!

371
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,160
Hold her steady!

372
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,510
Mom!

373
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:40,880
Mom!

374
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,350
Mom!

375
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,750
Let's get her to the clinic first!

376
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,640
Let's go!

377
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,550
Move, move!

378
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,350
Muxin.

379
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,160
Muxin!

380
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,770
Where's your brother?

381
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,670
I don't know.

382
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,270
When I was on my way here,

383
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,530
I saw him running away.

384
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,790
Ran away?

385
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,600
Erzhuang!

386
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,050
Take two men with you

387
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,550
and bring him back right now!

388
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,200
Got it!

389
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:58,920
You two, come with me!

390
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,450
Let's go!

391
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,090
I'm going to the clinic.

392
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,610
Okay.

393
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,490
Su Mufan!

394
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Stop right there!

395
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,200
Uncle.

396
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,800
You bastard!

397
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,020
What happened to Su Mufan afterward?

398
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,030
At first, everyone took turns
watching him.

399
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,480
But then the police said

400
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,240
that Li drank the pesticide herself,

401
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,410
so Su Mufan wasn't charged with murder.

402
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,160
A few days later,

403
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,720
everyone let their guard down

404
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,480
and didn't watch him closely enough.

405
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,440
Su Mufan

406
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,640
still managed to escape.

407
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,960
His brother said

408
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,960
he jumped into the river.

409
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,920
Found something!

410
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,830
Don't move!

411
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,420
Based on these drag marks,

412
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,640
it was right from here

413
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,830
that the body was dragged
and dumped into the river.

414
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,090
The grass over there has been flattened.

415
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,670
Mr. Zhang.

416
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,510
Your map

417
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,960
makes a lot of sense.

418
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,880
This must be where the body was dumped.

419
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,210
Alright.

420
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,000
I'll call the technical team

421
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,400
to secure the scene.

422
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,070
Good.

423
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
What did you find?

424
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,750
Found a set of footprints.

425
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,610
Leather shoes.

426
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,590
Size 42.

427
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,640
Based on the size and depth,

428
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,270
I'd say

429
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,160
the suspect

430
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,480
is about 180 cm in height,

431
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,140
weighing between 75 and 80 kg.

432
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,260
What else?

433
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,030
There's also a set of tire tracks.

434
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,930
The wheelbase is slightly wider

435
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,200
than a standard family car.

436
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,920
It's likely

437
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,320
a business-class sedan.

438
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,920
The tire treads are quite common.

439
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,480
We'll need to go back

440
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,280
to compare the results further.

441
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,070
Zhou Mi.

442
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,400
Come.

443
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,570
Perfect timing.

444
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,770
This is our eyewitness.

445
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:22,910
Hello.

446
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,000
Tell us,

447
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,040
what did you see?

448
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,200
I was just here

449
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,370
with my girlfriend

450
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,370
on a date that day.

451
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,080
Run! Run!

452
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,050
Hurry!

453
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,680
Luckily, he didn't chase

454
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,790
after us in his car.

455
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,410
What did the car look like?

456
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,510
It was too dark.

457
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,270
I could only tell

458
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,600
it was probably a sedan.

459
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,090
What brand?

460
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,660
Couldn't see clearly.

461
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,570
What about the man?

462
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,120
What did he look like?

463
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,960
I only saw he was wearing a raincoat

464
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,910
and had a hat on.

465
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,480
Couldn't see his face.

466
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,920
He was carrying a shovel. Really scary.

467
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,720
Exact time?

468
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,250
Just before 2:30.

469
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,540
How can you remember so precisely?

470
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,310
My girlfriend had bought

471
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,050
a train ticket for the next day

472
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,250
to go work elsewhere,

473
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,210
so we couldn't stay out too late
that night.

474
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,030
That's why I specifically checked
the time.

475
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,230
I'm certain about it.

476
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,830
Where was your girlfriend going?

477
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,490
Jiangyuan.

478
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,570
The 19th.

479
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,700
The train from Yunzhou to Jiangyuan.

480
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,240
No, that's not right.

481
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,040
She bought a ticket for the 18th.

482
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,940
So was it early morning on the 18th

483
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,670
or the 19th?

484
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,110
The 18th.

485
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,770
The body was likely dumped

486
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,480
sometime between midnight

487
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,920
and dawn on the 19th.

488
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,000
Zhou Mi.

489
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
What do you think?

490
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,270
The time of body disposal
doesn't match our deduction.

491
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,640
And Su Mufan is blind.

492
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,920
There must be a third person involved.

493
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,880
Chen.

494
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,320
Help me confirm something.

495
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,030
Is this cigarette butt

496
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,310
the same as the two

497
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,510
I collected earlier?

498
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,030
Yes, identical.

499
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,490
Even the brand is the same.

500
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,130
Xiaowei.

501
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,200
Why did you ask me
to collect this cigarette butt?

502
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,030
And where did you

503
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,760
get these two cigarette butts?

504
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,550
So according to what you're saying,

505
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,920
these cigarette butts are almost

506
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,520
certainly from Fu Wenjiang.

507
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,030
This kind of cigarette is imported,

508
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,560
hard to find and expensive.

509
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,070
Whether in Yunzhou

510
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,110
or Dongjiang,

511
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,680
I've never seen anyone smoke these.

512
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,920
This is the surveillance footage

513
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,310
from the secondhand phone store
on Hongmiao Street

514
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,200
from July 20th.

515
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,400
Based on our previous

516
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,750
investigation,

517
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,680
[South Counter]

518
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,750
Su Mufan had already lost

519
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,750
his sight due to injury

520
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,960
before his mother Chen Li

521
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
found him in 1986.

522
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,880

he can't orient himself.

541
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,000
So he is...

542
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
He's a blind person.

543
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,400
I'm more inclined to believe
he's Su Mufan,

00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,480
not Su Muxin.

545
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,850
The hand outside the door

546
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,720
must belong to the third person
in this case.

547
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,650
Let's follow this line of thinking

548
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,000
to analyze the case.

549
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,920
According to the forensic autopsy,

550
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,720
Su Muxin

551
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,480
died on July 15th.

552
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,970
So on the morning of July 16th,

553
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,440
the suspect who left

554

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,210
at Hesheng Street in Dongjiang

556
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,880
was Su Mufan.

557
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,930
The crime scene conditions
at Hesheng Street

558
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,110
actually point

559
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,510
to the suspect's unfamiliarity

560
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,830
with the place.

561
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,240
And it also explains

562
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,110
why the two of them

563
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,240
got into a conflict.

564
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,400
The crime scene at Shi Yue's case

565
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,200
also has many unusual aspects.

566
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,640
When the case details

567
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,880
weren't clear,

568
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,830
I was always confused

569
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,030
about the suspect committing the crime

570
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,350
while intoxicated.

571
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,270
If he was

572
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,160
pretending to be drunk,

573
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,110
why would he do that?

574
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,480
So there's

575
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,740
another possibility.

576
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
I understand now.

577
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,270
Su Mufan is blind.

578
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,480
He wanted to impersonate Su Muxin

579
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,920
without revealing any flaws.

580
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,960
The only way

581
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,880
was to use drunkenness as a cover,

582
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,750
to hide the fact

583
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,720
that his eyes couldn't see.

584
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,310
From

585
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,830
having security call him a taxi

586
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,680
to Shi Yue coming down

587
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,590
to meet him at Hesheng Street,

588
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,510
all of this

589
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,680
was to conceal the fact

590
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,640
that he was immobile.

591
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,400
Isn't that right, Captain Zhou?

592
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,810
So on the evening of the 15th,

593
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,920
the person who left

594
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,830
Oujin Garden

595
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,350
was already Su Mufan.

596
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,110
That means

597
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,070
Qu Tong and Su Muxin's home

598
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,880
is the primary crime scene

599
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,200
of Su Muxin's death.

600
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,640
Has Qu Tong and Su Muxin's home

601
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,350
been searched?

602
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:46,960
No.

603
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,030
There's insufficient evidence at present.

604
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,750
Before the DNA results come back,

605
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,070
the identity of the floating corpse
in Yunzhou

606
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,000
cannot be confirmed.

607
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,920
Everything is still
at the speculation stage.

608
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,480
But that doesn't mean

609
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,680
we can't do anything.

610
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,830
Based on our current chain of evidence,

611
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,640
I believe there are two

612
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
directions we can investigate.

613
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,750
First, how the body was

614
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,830
dumped in Yunzhou,

615
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,440
and who exactly did it.

616
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,150
According to eyewitness testimony,

617
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,790
the body was dumped

618
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,650
in the early morning of July 18th.

619
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,440
The person who dumped the body was male.

620
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,200
That day, my mentor and I

621
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,110
were following Qu Tong the whole time.

622
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,720
She had no time or opportunity,

623
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,110
and Su Mufan is blind,

624
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,920
so neither of them

625
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,310
could have dumped the body.

626
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,310
So identifying the third person
in this case

627
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,040
becomes extremely important.

628
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,890
Our technical team

629
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,780
has just matched the tire tracks.

630
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,750
The vehicle used to dump the body

631
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,410
is most likely a Toyota Camry.

632
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,590
It was probably manufactured

633
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,680
in 2000

634
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,270
or in 1999.

635
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,070
This is also an important breakthrough.

636
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,310
First, we need to check if Zhuo'er Company

637
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,400
has such a vehicle.

638
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,990
Second, we need to locate

639
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,400
Su Mufan and Qu Tong.

640
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,110
The Yunzhou team has informed us

641
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,790
that Qu Tong hasn't returned
to her parents' home.

642
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,430
She hasn't gone back to Oujin Garden
in Dongjiang either.

643
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,590
She seems to have disappeared.

644
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,400
It's also possible that both of them

645
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,350
are hiding together.
