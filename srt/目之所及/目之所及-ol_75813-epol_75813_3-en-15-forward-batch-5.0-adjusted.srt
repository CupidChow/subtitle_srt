What kind of person
is Qu Tong?

348
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,270
In my impression, she was
very introverted,

349
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,000
quiet,

350
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,400
and strictly supervised by her family.

351
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,790
So she never attended

352
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,240
any gatherings with classmates.

353
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,570
She didn't talk much,

354
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,540
and basically had no friends.

357
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,550
But she was very smart,

358
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,880

359

Before Hao Meili transferred
to our school,

360
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,860
she always ranked first in exams.

361
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,830
After that incident happened,

362
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,020
it had a huge emotional impact on her,

363
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,280
even affecting her academic performance.

364
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,040
But she recovered quickly,

365
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,240
and eventually

366
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,590
got into college successfully.

367
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,830
So I think

368
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,330
she might appear fragile on the outside,

369

my knowledge is quite limited.

519
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,310
What do you

520
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,270
think of Su Muxin?

521
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,270
Speaking of Su Muxin,

522
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,840
I think he's destined for great things.

523
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,630
He's decisive in his actions

524
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,770
and at the same time,

525
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,220
he's hardly influenced by emotions.

526
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,770
He's very rational.

527
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,090
Of course,

528
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,170
from another perspective,

529
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,710
some might find him a bit cold-hearted.

530
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,560
I see.

531
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,310
Thanks for your cooperation.

532
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,040
My pleasure.

533
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:42,960
Please don't see me out.

534
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,560
Take care.

535
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,590
Where did we go wrong?

536
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,850
Otherwise we shouldn't

537
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,510
have failed to catch Su Muxin.

538
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,230
It's fine. Let's head back first.

539
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,640
Hello.

540
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,290
Okay, I'll be right there.

541
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:24,640
Mentor,

542
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,500
I think there's one possibility.

543
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,680
Qu Tong and Su Muxin

544
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,440
did actually arrange

545
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,920
to meet at Sanjie Restaurant.

546
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,960
But she discovered early on

547
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,490
that we were following her.

548
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,790
You were inside the restaurant then,

549
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,450
while I was watching at the entrance.

550
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,550
When Qu Tong left,

551
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,450
her movements were a bit strange.

552
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,830
But only now do I realize what was wrong.

553
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,000
After she went out,

554
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,020
she went to her car to get something.

555
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,040
There was a clear unlocking sound.

556
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,480
But when

557
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,000
we came back with her,

558
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,240
she made

559
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,730
a fake unlocking gesture,

560
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,080
with no unlocking sound.

561
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,440
Goodbye.

562
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,160
She wasn't getting something earlier.

563
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,890
She was just unlocking the car.

564
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,310
If we follow this reasoning,

565
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,440
when we were following her,

566
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,750
her nervous expression

567
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,950
and looking back at us

568
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,060
wasn't because she feared
us following her,

569
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,790
but she feared we wouldn't follow her.

570
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,350
Right.

571
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,830
I suspect

572
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,140
that during this time,

573
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,680
Su Muxin had already hidden

574
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,280
in the trunk of Qu Tong's car.
