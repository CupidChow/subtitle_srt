<i>It is the 1950s,

<i>Female </i>gukgeuk,<i> or traditional theater,</i>

19

"Narrator: Cho Yeongsuk
First-generation female <i>gukgeuk </i>actor"

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,604
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.

22
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,980
THE SHOW CONTAINS JAPANESE EXPRESSIONS
TO REFLECT THE TIME PERIOD.

23
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,362
<i>Soldiers!</i>

24
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,407
<i>Listen to my cry</i>

25
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,161
<i>Come and listen to my cry</i>

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:24,959
<i>As an only son
I took a wife at the age of 17…</i>

27
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,628
Isn't that <i>The Soldier's Lament?</i>

28
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,380
Is she actually singing right now?

29
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,550
<i>And rejoiced to finally have a son</i>

30
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,929
<i>At the age of 50</i>

31
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,932
<i>Then my country summoned me</i>

32
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:42,352
<i>They called the Nakrang people</i>

33
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,146
<i>To battle against Goguryeo</i>

34
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,482
<i>How could I possibly
Ignore their call…?</i>

35
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,192
Get a hold of yourself, Hyerang.

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,362
Focus, don't look at the audience.

37
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,406
<i>I paid my tearful respects</i>

38
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,119
<i>To my ancestors</i>

39
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,247
<i>Laid down</i>

40
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,375
<i>With my family</i>

41
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,379
<i>And said to my wife</i>

42
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,757
<i>Please let my son know of me</i>

43
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,219
<i>As he grows up</i>

44
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,889
<i>I bid them goodbye forever</i>

45
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,809
<i>To be on the battlefield</i>

46
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:26,396
<i>When will I ever</i>

47
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,941
<i>Go back home</i>

48
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,403
<i>And have my son in my arms again?</i>

49
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,906
<i>Alas, my unfortunate fate</i>

50
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,836
That was great!

51
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,182
I loved it!

52
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,358
But isn't that soldier an extra?

53
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,652
- He shouldn't stand out like that.
- You're right.

54
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,323
That role is only supposed
to inform them of the Goguryeo soldiers.

55
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,868
The whole show has been thrown off.

56
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,369
How is this even <i>Jamyunggo </i>anymore?

57
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,958
Jooran.

58
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,463
Do you hear that?

59
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,132
They're all cheering for my soldier.

60
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,803
Jeongnyeon.

61
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,805
Follow me.

62
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,491
What do we do?

63
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,078
I was so scared.

64
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,080
What?

65
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,459
Not anyone can get into character
that deeply.

66
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,843
Jeongnyeon.

67
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,763
You are not allowed on stage
starting tomorrow.

68
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,393
Did you not hear me?

69
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,270
You are not allowed on stage.

70
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,025
But what did I do wrong?

71
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,283
So you're not even aware
that you've ruined the show.

72
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,328
Geumhui will take your place
from tomorrow.

73
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,707
Why are you still here?

74
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,375
The show's not over yet.

75
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,584
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,336
Didn't you hear…

77
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,381
how the audience cheered for me?

78
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,553
I just poured my heart out on stage.

79
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,348
And I captivated
every single person in the audience,

80
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,017
and they cheered me on.

81
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,019
Didn't I just save our show?

82
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,396
How did I ruin anything?

83
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,606
That's exactly my point.

84
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,776
The audience had to focus on the show,

85
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,987
and not on you, an extra!

86
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,906
You think the audience loved you?

87
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,702
If you act like a fool on stage again,

88
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,913
the first people to criticize you
will be that very audience.

89
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,249
If you have that much to show on stage,

90
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,252
then you should have been a lead,
not an extra.

91
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,514
{\an8}Act 7

92
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,740
{\an8}We have to do this again?

93
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,797
{\an8}I had no idea that Jeongnyeon
would cause this much trouble.

94
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,340
{\an8}Was she possessed or something?

95
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,966
{\an8}Why would she do such a thing?

96
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,301
{\an8}Why do you think?

97
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,554
{\an8}She probably lost all reason
when the audience cheered her on.

98
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,432
{\an8}- Oh, you're probably right.
- Yeah.

99
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,059
{\an8}- Youngseo.
- No wonder.

100
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,895
Your mother is here to see you.

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,361
Mother.

102
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,158
Great job, Youngseo.

103
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,370
You were top-notch in everything
from singing to acting.

104
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,878
You did so well.

105
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,195
You look happy.

106
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,657
I thought you'd be down
because of Jeongnyeon.

107
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,996
I knew how extreme she could be,
so I wasn't too surprised.

108
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,626
It's good
that you were still able to save it.

109
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,173
I told you that she has a limit.

110
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,177
Yes, her ability to plunge into character
got her to where she is now…

111
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,263
but that same ability destroyed her today.

112
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,850
This is the furthest she can go.

113
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,853
So stop doting on her.

114
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,147
What if…

115
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,691
she's able to break through
her limit again?

116
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,278
What do you mean?

117
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,280
She's still young.

118
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,950
Being young allows her

119
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,454
to take in everything
and keep on improving endlessly.

120
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,998
Are you saying she's that great?

121
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,000
Or you may be right.

122
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,503
Maybe this is as far as Jeongnyeon can go.

123
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,047
Then it's really no fun.

124
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,074
Jeongnyeon.

125
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,246
Everyone left.

126
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,665
We should get going too.

127
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,128
Okay.

128
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,304
Jeongnyeon!

129
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,181
That was an amazing performance.

130
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,267
You were amazing!

131
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,726
- You were so cool!
- Yeah, you were!

132
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,811
Thank you.

133
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,729
I could only focus on you tonight.

134
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,566
- On me?
- Yes.

135
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,778
So much so that I don't remember anything
after your <i>Soldier's Lament.</i>

136
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,364
Oh! I hope your soldier gets more scenes.

137
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,409
- I agree.
- You were so cool.

138
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,035
- You're the best.
- So cool.

139
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,120
It's getting late.

140
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,163
I think you should all get going.

141
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,248
Oh, you're right.

142
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,250
Anyway, you were amazing tonight.

143
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,334
I hope to see you again.

144
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,211
- See you!
- See you soon!

145
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,552
Jeongnyeon…

146
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,102
The director was right.

147
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,399
The audience…

148
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,777
didn't watch our show tonight.

149
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,700
They just watched me
running wild on stage.

150
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,622
If it wasn't for Hyerang…

151
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,712
I would have completely wrecked
the whole show.

152
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,074
Youngseo.

153
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,700
When did you arrive?

154
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,619
Welcome home, my little girl.

155
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,163
Why didn't you let us know
the moment you came?

156
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,999
Did you sleep well last night?

157
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,835
Oh! Look how tired my baby looks.

158
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,672
Um, I'm okay.

159
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,006
You should eat.

160
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,301
We're having steak since you're home.
You like steak, right?

161
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,598
That was the first time
I sat through an entire <i>gukgeuk </i>show,

162
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,475
and it was so much fun.

163
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,937
I didn't know you'd enjoy it this much.

164
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,021
But…

165
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,150
about that soldier girl…

166
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,654
Yoon Jeongnyeon?

167
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,948
Yes, her.

168
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,744
Do you happen to know who her mother is?

169
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,664
What about her mother?

170
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,583
Her voice

171
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,837
was exactly like that of Chae Gongseon.

172
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,174
You mean Chae Gongseon
who sang <i>The Blooming Autumn Field?</i>

173
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,843
Yes.

174
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:03,764
I had a sneaking suspicion,
so I made some calls.

175
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,474
And I was right.

176
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,270
<i>There's something I found out recently.</i>

177
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,021
My mother…

178
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:15,025
was apparently a famous master of <i>pansori.</i>

179
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,903
I never imagined

180
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,698
I would see Chae Gongseon's daughter
in such a setting.

181
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,992
She's been gifted by the heavens,

182
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,620
so it can't be helped
that her starting point is different.

183
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,875
Some people never make it
even after pouring out their all,

184
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,253
but some people are just born with it.

185
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,090
So Youngseo,

186
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,719
you just have to get to the top
before she does.

187
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,516
That girl almost ruined
the whole show yesterday.

188
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,521
So before she gets to the top,

189
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,442
all you have to do
is break her spirits completely.

190
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,696
I know you can do it, my sweet girl.

191
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,669
So she's not allowed to train with us
and can only do chores?

192
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,422
That's what you get
for getting on the director's bad side.

193
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,342
{\an8}She can't even play an extra on stage.

194
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,719
She's pretty much done here.

195
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,137
That's so sad.

196
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,986
Don't cry, Jeongnyeon.

197
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,493
You'll get another chance.
Please don't cry.

198
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,496
What are you saying?

199
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:55,459
I'm tearing up because the smoke
keeps getting in my eyes.

200
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,254
What?

201
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,428
I thought you were crying
because you were banned from the stage.

202
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,430
Goodness me.

203
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,602
Actually…

204
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,148
it's still quite hard for me.

205
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:24,655
But I can't just stay down.

206
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,451
Since I now know what I did wrong,

207
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,162
I should focus on
never making that mistake again.

208
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,918
Ah! I'm actually practicing
by myself nowadays.

209
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,546
Practicing what?

210
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,893
What is this?

211
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,686
You analyzed all the roles in the play?

212
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:00,441
You remember why I took on
the soldier role in the first place?

213
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,903
It was to have a chance
to observe the other roles.

214
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,572
And I completely forgot about that
along the way

215
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,575
and was too busy
trying to show everyone what I've got.

216
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,285
I know it's late,

217
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,495
but I'm trying to get back
into the right mindset

218
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,955
and study every character.

219
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,876
But wouldn't this be a waste

220
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,587
if you can't get on
the <i>Jamyunggo </i>production?

221
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,840
It doesn't matter.

222
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,928
If I want to grab the chance
to get back one day,

223
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,805
I need to be prepared.

224
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,142
King of Nakrang

225
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,644
Precious

226
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,896
All right.

227
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,315
I'll help you in any way I can.

228
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,067
- Will you?
- Of course.

229
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:48,364
Then could you be Gomigeol
while I play Precious?

230
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,448
Sure.

231
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,121
- Let's start here.
- Okay.

232
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,835
Such vile words!

233
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,920
Gomigeol.

234
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,631
You may be the chancellor of Han,

235
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,424
but I…

236
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,386
des… despise you.

237
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,517
Something's off.

238
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,228
I can't seem to get Precious right.

239
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,355
She's a bit complicated.

240
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,067
She's not totally weak,
but she isn't that strong either.

241
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,944
That's so true.

242
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,572
She seems very weak but isn't.

243
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,493
At the same time, you can't just
portray her as outright powerful.

244
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,997
This won't do.

245
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,373
Let's switch roles.

246
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,172
My dear Precious…

247
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,093
you are as pretty as ever.

248
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,012
If it wasn't for Mokryeon…

249
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,141
I would have you as my concubine.

250
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,602
Such vile words!

251
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,772
Gomigeol.

252
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,524
You may be the chancellor of Han,

253
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,776
but I despise you.

254
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,238
Dear Precious.

255
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:16,368
Have you heard
that Mokryeon and Hodong are to be wed?

256
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,621
They are nothing but rumors.

257
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,674
You poor…

258
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,635
pretty little thing.

259
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,979
Deliver this letter

260
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,107
to Princess Mokryeon in secret.

261
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,943
I desire to have Mokryeon,

262
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,239
and you desire to have Prince Hodong.

263
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,207
If you deliver this letter…

264
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,877
the two will never…

265
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,923
be able to wed.

266
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,347
Jooran.

267
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,810
How is…

268
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,354
my Gomigeol?

269
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,982
It's good.

270
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,778
Right?

271
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,239
It was so hard playing Precious,

272
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,866
but playing Gomigeol is so easy.

273
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,701
And I think we had great chemistry.

274
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,755
<i>Who is this princess of Nakrang?</i>

275
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,050
<i>The enemy princess
Who protects the Jamyunggo</i>

276
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:59,054
<i>Those wretches
Who trampled on my beloved Goguryeo</i>

277
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,641
<i>Shall pay for what they did</i>

278
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:07,020
<i>Their treasure is guarded by a woman</i>

279
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,482
<i>How incompetent
Are the men of Nakrang?</i>

280
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,484
<i>I shall infiltrate Nakrang myself</i>

281
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,611
<i>Tear apart the Jamyunggo</i>

282
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:19,324
<i>And see who this princess is</i>

283
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,243
Whoa!

284
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,245
<i>She's been gifted by the heavens,</i>

285
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,874
<i>so it can't be helped
that her starting point is different.</i>

286
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,972
That scared me.

287
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,224
Hey! Where are you going this late?

288
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,852
What's gotten into her again?

289
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,401
The Blooming Autumn Field

290
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:05,662
<i>Beneath the moon</i>

291
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:19,051
<i>Cries</i>

292
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:26,141
<i>The goose</i>

293
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:34,233
<i>Hearing its cries</i>

294
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:40,030
<i>Empress Sim</i>

295
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:47,955
<i>Calls</i>

296
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:55,754
<i>To the goose</i>

297
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,226
Teach me…

298
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,608
how to sing like you.

299
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,903
Why?

300
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,406
Because you're a genius.

301
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,121
You know how to sing well
without having to practice like I do.

302
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,205
So please…

303
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,876
teach me how to be like you.

304
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,839
What is it?

305
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,633
You don't want to?

306
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,725
Is it something only geniuses
like you and your mother can get?

307
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,978
Do I look pathetic for struggling so much?

308
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,823
How did you know…

309
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,201
that my mother is Chae Gongseon?

310
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,456
My mother knew it
the moment she heard you sing.

311
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,043
You can't hide something like that.

312
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,590
I guess geniuses like you
will be recognized wherever you go.

313
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,300
That's interesting.

314
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,764
The people at the broadcasting station
and even the director

315
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,725
said that the moment they heard me sing,

316
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,145
they immediately knew
that I was Chae Gongseon's daughter.

317
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:41,485
Do you know
what I'm most afraid of these days?

318
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:48,075
I'm afraid I'll always live
in my mother's shadow.

319
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,664
That whenever I sing…

320
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,002
I'll only remind them of her.

321
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,505
I'm so afraid.

322
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,592
But you know what I decided?

323
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,471
Chae Gongseon is Chae Gongseon…

324
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,724
and Yoon Jeongnyeon…

325
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,519
is Yoon Jeongnyeon.

326
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:22,484
If I'm not going to quit
because I'm afraid of my mother's shadow,

327
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,572
then all I can do is keep going my way.

328
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,910
So you should…

329
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,705
keep going your way too.

330
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,669
Everything you've achieved so far
with your blood, sweat, and tears…

331
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,799
is yours and yours alone.

332
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,054
And it will continue to be yours.

333
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,535
Jamyunggo
Moon Okgyeong, Seo Hyerang

334
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,703
Precious.

335
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,169
My dear Precious,

336
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,505
you are as pretty as ever.

337
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,092
If it wasn't for Mokryeon,
I would have you as my concubine.

338
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,771
Precious? What are you doing?

339
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,735
Such vile words!

340
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,445
Gomigeol.

341
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:52,282
You may be the chancellor of Han,
but I despise you.

342
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,410
Dear Precious.

343
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,915
Have you heard
that Mokryeon and Hodong are to be…

344
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,294
Sorry, I'll go again.

345
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,420
No.

346
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,757
Jooran, are you not paying attention
because we're just rehearsing?

347
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,968
You can't get your timing
or your diction right.

348
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,012
I can't believe this.

349
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,223
And Youngseo.

350
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,184
You've also been
getting your lines wrong today.

351
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,019
What's with you two?

352
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,896
Get your heads on straight!

353
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,149
I'm sorry.

354
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,484
I'm sorry.

355
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,739
Who were you seeing?

356
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,159
- What?
- When we were on stage.

357
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,578
You weren't looking at me.
You were seeing someone else.

358
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,292
Who were you thinking of
with me in front of you?

359
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,254
That was…

360
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,172
Please keep your focus on me
when we're on stage.

361
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,688
They are nothing but gossip…

362
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,233
Nothing but rumors!

363
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,610
It's "rumors," not "gossip"!

364
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,905
Come on!

365
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,786
What kind of Precious is that energetic?

366
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,705
Okgyeong!

367
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,665
So you're going over
every character in the play?

368
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,712
"Precious, 38 times"

369
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,839
Look how many times
you've practiced this role.

370
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:36,595
I keep getting Precious's lines wrong
no matter how much I practice.

371
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,473
Okgyeong.

372
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,103
{\an8}Didn't you also play the antagonist

373
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,314
{\an8}when you first started <i>gukgeuk?</i>

374
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,358
I did.

375
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,488
Are you saying…

376
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,074
What do you say?

377
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,744
Would you give me the honor

378
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,496
of practicing
with the legendary antagonist?

379
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,458
So you're going to flatter me, huh?

380
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,377
All right.

381
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,254
Let me try playing the antagonist
for a change.

382
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,964
My goodness!

383
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,641
Precious.

384
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,399
My dear Precious,

385
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,652
you are as pretty as ever.

386
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,781
If it wasn't for Mokryeon…

387
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,326
I would have you as my concubine.

388
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,289
Ah! Such vile words!

389
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,625
Gomigeol.

390
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,002
You may be the chancellor of Han,

391
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,423
but I despise you.

392
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,052
Dear Precious.

393
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,806
Have you heard
that Mokryeon and Hodong are to be wed?

394
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,727
They are nothing but rumors.

395
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,231
This is driving me nuts.

396
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,858
I'm so sorry.

397
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,319
I still can't get it right.

398
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,157
What are you stuck on?

399
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,994
I don't think
such delicate roles suit me at all.

400
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,957
And on that note,
everyone says that Precious is weak,

401
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,043
but I don't think she's weak at all.

402
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,713
Then what do you think she's like?

403
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,756
She's quite daring.

404
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:42,303
First, you'd need a lot of guts
to spy on other countries.

405
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:47,934
Plus, she keeps talking back to Gomigeol
who is the chancellor of Han.

406
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,811
That's good.

407
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,397
Then try combining your interpretation

408
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,983
and the existing interpretation together.

409
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,404
If you express her daring nature
simply as rude behavior,

410
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,030
it might take away from her character.

411
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,118
Try hinting at it with your eyes
and subtle movements.

412
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,247
And most importantly,

413
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,541
look at the big picture.

414
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,795
Don't be too immersed
in your own character,

415
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,964
but think about the role
within the whole narrative.

416
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,091
The whole narrative?

417
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,678
Shall we try again?

418
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,346
Yes.

419
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,410
They're the costumes
for Gomigeol and Precious.

420
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,499
Who's there?

421
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,644
I don't think anything's been damaged.

422
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,564
They may have just lost their chance
because we came.

423
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,901
The lock wasn't damaged, was it?

424
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,778
It wasn't.

425
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,951
Then it must've been
someone from the inside.

426
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,212
Why are we rehearsing again
right before the show?

427
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,380
We just had one yesterday.

428
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,673
Why do you think?

429
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:45,051
The director must be worried
someone might go wild like Jeongnyeon did.

430
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,096
And we're the ones paying for it.

431
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,266
Seriously.

432
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,730
I checked all the stage gear,
props, and costumes,

433
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,816
and everything's as it should be.

434
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,943
I didn't notice anything out of place.

435
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,573
Were we perhaps overreacting?

436
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,868
Overreacting is better
than being careless.

437
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,746
Even so, keep your guard up
until the very end of the show.

438
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,207
And report back to me
if you notice anything suspicious.

439
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,417
Yes, ma'am.

440
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,639
You came.

441
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,058
Yes.

442
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,811
I wanted to watch from out here at least.

443
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,281
<i>Oh, my prince</i>

444
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,950
<i>Face as smooth as jade</i>

445
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,369
<i>And stature so manly</i>

446
00:31:55,747 --> 00:32:00,376
<i>My prince is as passionate as the sun</i>

447
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,921
<i>His bright eyes…</i>

448
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,049
I think her voice
is even more refined than before.

449
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,510
I guess she's improving quickly
now that she has her chance.

450
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,847
<i>Are as strong and swift</i>

451
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,642
<i>As the mountain gales</i>

452
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,561
Let's go.

453
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,982
<i>Dear heavens, I beg of you</i>

454
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,360
My dear Precious,

455
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,445
you are as pretty as ever.

456
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,240
If it wasn't for Mokryeon,
I would have you as my concubine.

457
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,327
Such vile words!

458
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,662
Gomigeol.

459
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:39,123
You may be the chancellor of Han,
but I despise you.

460
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,209
Dear Precious.

461
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,214
Have you heard that Mokryeon and Hodong…

462
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,388
Jooran!

463
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,307
- Oh, no!
- My goodness!

464
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,017
Guys! Are you okay?

465
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,727
Oh, my goodness!

466
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,479
Oh, no, Jooran!

467
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,690
I'm okay, I'm okay.

468
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,903
What's wrong?

469
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,446
I don't know.

470
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,573
- I can't walk.
- Can't walk?

471
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,158
Don't move.

472
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,953
Take her to the green room.

473
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,671
You sprained your ankle.

474
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,882
It must've happened
when you jumped out of the way.

475
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,301
Are you hurt anywhere else?

476
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,762
No, I feel fine everywhere else.

477
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,683
Thank goodness it's just your ankle.

478
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,020
Director, but why did the lights fall?

479
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,604
Is it because the theater is old?

480
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:48,276
Someone said they saw a ghost
the last time they were here.

481
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,487
They said an actor who only played extras
died and became a ghost.

482
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,574
So apparently, it only harms lead actors.

483
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,535
Then are you saying
that a ghost dropped the lights?

484
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:00,997
Nonsense!

485
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,082
There are no ghosts.

486
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,128
Doaeng,

487
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,130
have her get changed
and take her to the hospital.

488
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,715
Okay.

489
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,845
- Here, hold on to me.
- Okay.

490
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,811
Good luck on the show tonight.
I'm counting on you.

491
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,360
Bongseon was the stand-in
for Precious, right? Get ready.

492
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,445
What?

493
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,863
Me?

494
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,283
Sorry, but I don't think
I'm feeling well today, so...

495
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,410
What are you saying?

496
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,955
You're supposed to take care of yourself
to fit the show's schedule.

497
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,755
Movies, gukgeuk
International Theater

498
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,423
Wait here, I'll get the car.

499
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,508
Okay.

500
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,098
- Jeongnyeon.
- Yeah?

501
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,434
Get in there and tell the director
you'll play Precious.

502
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,353
What are you talking about?

503
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,146
I'm going with you to the hospital.

504
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,731
Doaeng can take me.

505
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,901
So go and tell her you'll play Precious.

506
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,826
The director will be able to find
another stand-in.

507
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,536
There's no one but you.

508
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,870
I'm not doing it!

509
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,084
You want me to just take your place

510
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,752
as if I were waiting for this to happen?

511
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,045
So what?

512
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,173
Someone has to take my place.

513
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,300
And…

514
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,388
I want it to be you.

515
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,226
I don't even know…

516
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,522
whether I'm ready yet.

517
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,026
What if…

518
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,739
I ruin everything like last time?

519
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,368
You're more than ready.

520
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:06,664
You're the only person
who's practiced Precious as much as I did.

521
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:10,418
And not only that, you've gone over
every single character in the play.

522
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,754
You've got the whole script and the show

523
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,173
stored in your head.

524
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,219
You haven't memorized the lines?

525
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,973
What do you mean
you haven't memorized the lines?

526
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,809
This is preposterous!

527
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,145
Then what have you been doing
all this time?

528
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:33,399
I didn't know
I'd have to stand in for her so suddenly.

529
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,194
I don't need to hear anymore, you fool.

530
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,779
You've just missed your big chance.

531
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,826
Is there anyone
who has Precious's lines memorized?

532
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,245
I'll give anyone a chance.

533
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,879
You absolute imbeciles!

534
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,674
No one's prepared to grab this chance?

535
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,094
Are you telling me there's no one
who's memorized Precious's lines?

536
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,931
I'll do it.

537
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:15,358
I know all of Precious's lines,
songs, and dances by heart.

538
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,986
So I'll do it.

539
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:22,365
I could recite everything for you
right now if you want me to.

540
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,248
If you make another mess like last time,

541
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,584
you'll be leaving the troupe voluntarily.

542
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,794
Yes, ma'am.

543
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:39,924
And if I leave this time,
I swear to never come back here.

544
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,637
All right.

545
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,643
Remember.

546
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,773
Don't you even dare think about
how you'll stand out.

547
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,819
You'll be playing Precious
strictly led by Gomigeol.

548
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:04,490
Your role is to be the fuel
to Youngseo's acting,

549
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,368
for her Gomigeol
to leave a lasting impression.

550
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,120
That's your role.

551
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,789
Understood.

552
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,335
The show's about to begin.

553
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,962
I want everyone to get ready.

554
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,297
Yes, ma'am.

555
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,802
Precious?
What is she talking about?

556
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,638
Is she out of her mind?

557
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,850
- She's playing Precious?
- Right?

558
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,768
- Oh, no.
- What if she ruins the show?

559
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,228
She's crazy.

560
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,189
She's so full of herself.

561
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,446
<i>And most importantly,</i>

562
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,156
look at the big picture.

563
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,326
Don't be too immersed
in your own character,

564
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,870
but think about the role
within the whole narrative.

565
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,425
All you have to do

566
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,510
is follow my lead.

567
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,097
Okay, I'll be counting on you.

568
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:23,778
<i>Han strikes from up north</i>

569
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,780
<i>And Nakrang attacks from the east…</i>

570
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,573
It's Precious's scene next.

571
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,493
Okay.

572
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:34,914
<i>The north wind quakes our earth</i>

573
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:39,835
<i>And the east wind brings forth a storm</i>

574
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,756
How could anyone say that all is well?

575
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,391
Prince Hodong, Precious has returned.

576
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,478
You're right, it's Jeongnyeon.

577
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,230
- She looks so different.
- Yeah.

578
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:04,693
Your Precious has returned
from her espionage mission.

579
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,781
I have found out
that the Jamyunggo was protected

580
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,950
by the princess of Nakrang, Mokryeon.

581
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,331
The princess of Nakrang,

582
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,750
Mokryeon?

583
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:25,131
<i>Who is this princess of Nakrang?</i>

584
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:28,676
<i>The enemy princess
Who protects the Jamyunggo</i>

585
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:32,555
<i>Those wretches
Who trampled on my beloved Goguryeo</i>

586
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:36,225
<i>Shall pay for what they did</i>

587
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:44,150
<i>Their treasure is guarded by a woman</i>

588
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,361
<i>How incompetent
Are the men of Nakrang?</i>

589
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,782
<i>I shall infiltrate Nakrang myself
Tear apart the Jamyunggo</i>

590
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:56,120
<i>And see who this princess is</i>

591
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,057
Precious.

592
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,686
Are you hurt?

593
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,899
This is nothing…

594
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,445
compared to the pain of my country.

595
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,127
Precious.

596
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:52,259
I shall not forget
what you have done for your country.

597
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,137
- My heart.
- Oh, my goodness.

598
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,990
<i>Oh, my prince</i>

599
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,618
<i>Face as smooth as jade</i>

600
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,870
<i>And stature so manly</i>

601
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,961
<i>My prince is as passionate as the sun</i>

602
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,798
<i>His bright eyes</i>

603
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,803
<i>And unwavering heart</i>

604
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,723
<i>Are as strong and swift</i>

605
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,560
<i>As the mountain gales</i>

606
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,167
Mokryeon and Hodong have promised to wed?

607
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,504
That won't do. That simply won't do.

608
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,632
Goguryeo and Nakrang
are to remain as enemies.

609
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,886
They need to keep fighting
and wear each other down

610
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,055
for the great Han…

611
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,810
to strike both at the same time.

612
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,272
Things will be bad
if they form an alliance.

613
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,442
What should be done about this?

614
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,498
Precious.

615
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,426
My dear Precious,

616
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,596
you are as pretty as ever.

617
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:05,184
If it wasn't for Mokryeon,
I would have you as my concubine.

618
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,770
Such vile words!

619
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,814
Gomigeol.

620
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,275
You may be the chancellor of Han…

621
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,445
but I despise you.

622
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,325
Dear Precious.

623
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:26,038
Have you heard
that Mokryeon and Hodong are to be wed?

624
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,669
They are nothing but rumors.

625
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,757
You poor,

626
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,802
pretty little thing.

627
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,436
What's with that gaze?

628
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,523
It feels more like
Precious is seducing Gomigeol.

629
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,317
Her Precious
is the exact opposite of Jooran's.

630
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,998
Deliver this letter
to Princess Mokryeon in secret.

631
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,525
Did she forget her lines?

632
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,863
- She forgot her lines?
- I think so.

633
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,866
Director.

634
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,535
Hold on, just wait.

635
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,538
We need to close the curtains.

636
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,749
It's not like last time
when I was out there to save it.

637
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,208
No.

638
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,754
I believe
her quick thinking can save this.

639
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:04,261
Your role is to be the fuel
to Youngseo's acting,

640
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,597
for her Gomigeol
to leave a lasting impression.

641
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,432
That's your role.

642
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,608
What are you speaking of?

643
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,402
What do you mean deliver this letter
to the princess in secret?

644
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:24,156
Are you telling me to turn my back
on my Prince Hodong…

645
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,159
and join hands with the likes of you?

646
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,874
Why do you think it's not possible?

647
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,544
Just as I desire to have Mokryeon,

648
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,173
you desire to have Prince Hodong.

649
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,597
If you deliver this letter…

650
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:53,018
the two will never be able to wed.

651
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,804
Jeongnyeon!

652
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,294
But this is for Jeongnyeon.

653
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,766
You made a mistake
in Gomigeol's most important scene.

654
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,771
Mistakes will always happen on stage.

655
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:23,150
What's important
is how you smooth it over.

656
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,737
You both…

657
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,281
did an amazing job.

658
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,247
I liked your gaze as Precious.

659
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,875
But make sure to relax more
when you say your lines.

660
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,960
Yes, ma'am. I will.

661
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:46,048
It seems that you finally know
how to empty yourself.

662
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:52,554
I think it's time for you
to become an official trainee.

663
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,519
Are you being serious?

664
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,229
Am I really…

665
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,025
an official trainee now?

666
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,655
Just make sure
not to cause any more trouble.

667
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,534
Yes, ma'am!

668
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,373
You all heard that, right?

669
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,960
I'm an official trainee
of Maeran Gukgeukdan.

670
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,254
I'm on the same level as you, Chorok!

671
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,757
Whatever.

672
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,384
Congrats, Jeongnyeon.

673
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,593
Congrats.

674
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,136
- Thanks.
- Congrats!

675
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,930
- You did well!
- Thank you!

676
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,932
- Congratulations.
- Congrats.

677
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,727
Hey, about that scene…

678
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,610
It won't happen again.

679
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,196
So don't worry.

680
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,241
I was never worried.

681
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,371
And compared to the mess
I caused last time,

682
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,081
yours was nothing.

683
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,549
You think Mr. Ko tampered with the lights?

684
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,633
Yes.

685
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,469
It was strange
that he was at the rehearsal today

686
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,055
when he's never even come
to watch the show.

687
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,850
But he couldn't have…

688
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:23,186
Mr. Ko is one of the people
who has access to the prop room.

689
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,733
What I don't get
is why he's going so far to ruin the show.

690
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,862
<i>The owner of Daehan Theater said</i>

691
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:37,909
they'd split the ticket sales 7:3
if we move our production there.

692
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,204
It must be…

693
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,123
…because of the profit distribution.

694
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:47,961
What's going on?

695
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,350
All the ledgers are gone.

696
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:05,145
He must have taken everything
during the performance.

697
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,523
The safe.

698
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,776
The safe.

699
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,455
Everything's gone.

700
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,751
He took all the money from the safe.

701
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,006
And we owe people a lot of money
due to this production.

702
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,133
Let me go to his house.

703
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,718
There's no use.

704
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,429
He would have known
we'd look for him there.

705
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,724
You should go

706
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,893
and identify which documents are missing.

707
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,394
Okay.

708
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,272
I'll call the police.

709
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,530
- Director.
- And what if word gets out?

710
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,700
Everyone will be elated
that Maeran is going down.

711
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,787
We can't give them any reason
to slander us.

712
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,205
But we need to find him.

713
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,624
You can't just do nothing.

714
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,751
If word gets out about this,

715
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,713
it'll affect our troupe's morale first.

716
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:15,757
I'm so sorry.

717
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,802
I was the one who introduced him to you.

718
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,137
It's fine.

719
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,473
How could you have known?

720
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,979
Report to me immediately
if you hear anything about Mr. Ko.

721
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:30,689
Okay.

722
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,539
She won't be reporting you to the police.

723
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,124
I knew it.

724
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,878
If it becomes public that Maeran
was robbed by its own business team,

725
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:56,298
it's practically advertising
that Maeran's on the verge of collapse.

726
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,759
I didn't know that Doaeng would catch on.

727
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:05,098
I almost got caught back there
if it wasn't for your message.

728
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,726
This is why I said
we shouldn't go too far.

729
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:11,605
We should have quit
when we failed in the prop room.

730
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,734
But we didn't get caught, so no harm done.

731
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:18,904
By the way, did you bring it?

732
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:27,913
This is the list
of all the journalists we were paying off.

733
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:39,382
Why are you going this far
to stop them from writing about Okgyeong?

734
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,761
Our audience watches our shows
to escape from reality.

735
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,014
There's no need for them to know
about who Okgyeong was in the past…

736
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,349
"Editor Park: 14,000
Special on Moon Okgyeong…"

737
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,516
…nor should they.

738
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,769
Okgyeong…

739
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,439
needs to remain a prince forever.

740
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:01,279
"The little mermaid
felt her beautiful fins and tail

741
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,907
dissolve into foam."

742
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,035
"The red sun rose in the sky

743
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,704
and shone upon the mermaid's foam…"

744
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,002
<i>The Little Mermaid </i>again?

745
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,797
- Do you like it that much?
- Yeah.

746
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,218
The prince never finds out
how much the little mermaid loved him.

747
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,096
You're right.

748
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,518
It's time for bed, Eunjae.

749
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,186
Could we read some more?

750
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,980
I have to head out now.

751
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,648
Come on, no pouting.

752
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,525
Be a good girl and go to bed.

753
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,821
You have to come home early, my prince.

754
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:43,905
I will.

755
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,031
Goodnight.

756
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,046
Are you going to meet those friends again?

757
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:04,217
I don't like
that you keep hanging out with them.

758
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,345
Whenever you come home
after meeting with them,

759
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,973
you act like you're tired of everything.

760
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,438
If I ever get tired of <i>gukgeuk,</i>

761
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,190
it won't be because of them
but because of you.

762
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:23,236
Why would it be because of me?

763
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,572
Sure.

764
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,991
Keep pretending like you don't know.

765
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,494
But know this, Hyerang.

766
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,165
Jeongnyeon, Youngseo, and Jooran.

767
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,375
The more you try
to drive them out of the troupe,

768
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,377
the more you're driving me out as well.

769
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,381
I have no idea what you're talking about.

770
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,759
Are you saying I did something?

771
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,969
I didn't tell the director

772
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,389
out of minimum courtesy for you.

773
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,185
Don't test my patience.

774
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,525
You said you were excited
to see them improve.

775
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,278
But I'm not.

776
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,906
They're our competitors
and we're up against them.

777
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,284
Being young means
that they can improve endlessly?

778
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,913
Jeongnyeon, Youngseo, and Jooran
are all out to get us!

779
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:18,166
What are you going to do
if they start challenging us?

780
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,960
Are you going to let them take your place?

781
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,212
I could never.

782
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,130
I will never let that happen!

783
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,843
This is exactly why our troupe
has been stagnant for years.

784
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,054
We were rotting away, stuck in one place,

785
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,931
because no one was challenging us.

786
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,975
Our troupe is kept alive
because of you and me.

787
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,061
Who do you think
all those people are coming to see?

788
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,187
You're wrong.

789
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,815
The audience is getting tired.

790
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,860
We never get
any new audience members at our shows.

791
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,197
Even I'm sick and tired of this.

792
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,033
How do you think the audience would feel?

793
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,119
You're not…

794
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,123
seriously thinking about leaving, are you?

795
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,835
Maeran Gukgeukdan National tour

796
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:56,306
Guys! Could you please keep it down?
Come on!

797
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,784
{\an8}"Thank you for coming to Busan, Maeran"
"Moon Okgyeong Busan Fan Club"

798
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,453
"Prince Okgyeong of Maeran"

799
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,227
Doaeng.

800
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,311
Yes?

801
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:49,484
Since the show is tomorrow night
and the rehearsal is at 2:00,

802
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,819
let them have some free time today.

803
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:52,904
Okay.

804
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:56,991
- Hi, Okgyeong.
- Hello.

805
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,619
My little sister is getting married today.

806
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:03,456
And she's as crazy as I am
for both you and Hyerang.

807
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,417
So if it's not too much trouble,

808
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,504
could I ask you to pay a little visit
and congratulate her on her wedding?

809
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,049
I think I'll have to...

810
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,803
Of course we will.
Thank you for inviting us.

811
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,721
Really?

812
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,933
Yes, we'll be there.

813
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,310
My goodness!
I can't believe you're actually coming!

814
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,523
It'll be such an honor for our family.

815
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,442
I invite all of you
to please join as well.

816
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,611
The more the merrier, am I right?

817
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,864
Before we head to the wedding,

818
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:40,451
please let our women's association
treat you to some Chinese food. Let's go!

819
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,328
Chinese food!

820
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,499
- This looks great.
- It's so good.

821
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,792
- Delicious.
- Seriously, so good.

822
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,877
This is the best thing I've ever had.

823
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,470
Is it good?

824
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,850
What is this?

825
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,312
It's dancing in my mouth.

826
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,112
Here they come.

827
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,035
Go on and eat, Okgyeong.

828
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:25,038
Please let us know
if you want anything else.

829
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,122
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

830
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:28,458
My goodness, how pretty.

831
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,672
- Jeongnyeon.
- Yes?

832
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:36,507
Here, take some.

833
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,468
Really?

834
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,262
If any of you want some too,
come have some.

835
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,560
The whole dish?

836
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,480
Oh my…

837
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:51,939
Look at this, kids!

838
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,233
My goodness,
you're so generous, Okgyeong!

839
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,485
It looks amazing.

840
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,404
What is this?

841
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,489
<i>Tangsuyuk.</i>

842
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,532
<i>Tangsuyuk?</i>

843
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,249
So it's meat.

844
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,877
It's so good.

845
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,015
I want to get married one day

846
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,142
- in a veil like that.
- Me too.

847
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,602
- What are you saying?
- Oh, my gosh.

848
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,730
A bride looks best
in our traditional coronet and <i>hanbok,</i>

849
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:36,651
with blush on her forehead and cheeks.

850
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,404
Right, Jooran?

851
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,158
<i>I only have</i>

852
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,787
one thing to say to the bride and groom.

853
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,707
And that is to love one another.

854
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,126
Together, you will go through
some hard times.

855
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,629
Whether in sorrow or in anger,

856
01:01:56,713 --> 01:02:00,383
you shall love and cherish one another.

857
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,262
To be joyful, a family must…

858
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,055
One, two, three.

859
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,225
Wait, could we take one more?

860
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:10,309
Sure.

861
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,771
Oh, my goodness.

862
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:16,607
I think you look happier
than when you were with your groom.

863
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:22,113
Look, our groom is already pouting.

864
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,365
- No, not at all.
- My goodness.

865
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,368
Come here, Jeongnyeon.
Everyone, let's all take one together.

866
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,329
Scooch in, everyone.

867
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,082
All right, ready?

868
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,418
One, two, three.

869
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:40,548
One more?

870
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,302
Thanks for coming
all the way down to Busan.

871
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,305
I reviewed the script
for <i>The Princess and the Fool,</i>

872
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:48,931
and it looks great.

873
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,684
If the upcoming joint performance
is a success,

874
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,562
I'm sure
every theater troupe in the country

875
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,647
will want their own production
from next year.

876
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,860
We first need to create buzz
with the audition itself.

877
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,321
Have you been working on
the list of judges?

878
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:06,324
Yes, I'll let you know
as soon as it's finalized.

879
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,826
On a side note,

880
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:13,080
I have something to say to you
on behalf of the other troupes as well.

881
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,043
Could we rediscuss the profit distribution

882
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,086
for our joint performance?

883
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,130
I think it only benefits one side,
don't you think?

884
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,259
What do you mean by one side?

885
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,721
Are you talking about Maeran?

886
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:34,477
Is there any other troupe
actually benefitting from this?

887
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:42,151
Do you think we're exempt
from the production costs?

888
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,070
In fact, we're paying
a lot more than other troupes.

889
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,239
But for you, it's a good investment.

890
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:49,158
You always get the spotlight every time.

891
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,702
You'll be getting a lot of publicity.

892
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,625
There's no need to go into detail
about the past,

893
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:01,629
but a lot of the other troupes
are really struggling this year.

894
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:05,591
We hope Maeran is willing
to compromise on these matters.

895
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:10,221
That way, we can continue
these joint performances in the future.

896
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,919
Why are you still up?

897
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,964
It's been a while
since I've been this near the sea.

898
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,215
I can't seem to sleep.

899
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,259
It reminds me of my hometown.

900
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:52,471
Do you ever regret leaving home?

901
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:58,978
No.

902
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:04,692
I do miss my family
and feel sorry whenever I think of them…

903
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,738
but even if I were to turn back time,

904
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,325
I would have made the same choice.

905
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,492
Me too.

906
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,789
We really are something.

907
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,003
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

908
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,130
I do feel sorry,

909
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:29,634
but I love the stage too much.

910
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:37,934
Oh my.

911
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,270
Your hand is so cold.
You must have been out here too long.

912
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:43,564
I'm okay.

913
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:47,401
We still have some shows left.
It'll be bad if you get a cold.

914
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,409
Wow.

915
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,079
You can see…

916
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:02,416
a lot more stars here than in Seoul.

917
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,849
Hey, Yoon Jeongnyeon.

918
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:21,769
I have…

919
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,359
Jeongnyeon, I have…

920
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,486
No.

921
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:33,698
I can do this.

922
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:36,617
I can do this.

923
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,245
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

924
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,039
I have something to tell you.

925
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:45,292
I'm here.

926
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:56,887
Why the heck
were you standing here like a ghost

927
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,514
and mumbling my name?

928
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,228
What's that?

929
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,648
- What are you hiding?
- It's nothing.

930
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,818
I'll get going, guys.

931
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:14,864
Jooran.

932
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:20,828
What is it?

933
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,331
Just tell me.

934
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,292
Hey,

935
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,543
you got food?

936
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:29,920
It's food, isn't it?

937
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:33,049
If you have something good,
share it with me, huh?

938
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,134
No, it's not food.

939
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,344
What is it then? What are you hiding?

940
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,140
{\an8}The Blooming Autumn Field

941
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:43,976
I'm sorry.

942
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:55,654
Hey,

943
01:07:57,073 --> 01:08:00,493
I think there's something wrong
with my ear.

944
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:04,121
I kind of missed what you just said.

945
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,915
Could you repeat it for me?

946
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:08,167
You said something.

947
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,002
I said I'm sorry!

948
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:17,009
Hey, I didn't hear what you said!

949
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,177
What did you say?

950
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,261
Shut up!

951
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,890
Come on! Say it again!

952
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,814
Good job with the tour, everyone.

953
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:35,945
I have something to tell you all
before we leave for Seoul.

954
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,614
You're all aware that every year,

955
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:42,034
theater troupes get together
for a joint performance, right?

956
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,202
Yes, ma'am.

957
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:44,703
This year,

958
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:48,165
the younger versions of the leads
will have a lot more scenes than usual.

959
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,793
And the audition to pick these roles

960
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,336
will be held in a month.

961
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:54,755
If any of you get those roles,

962
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:57,091
you'll be able to solidify yourselves

963
01:08:57,174 --> 01:08:59,718
as the upcoming stars
for male and female leads

964
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,846
who will succeed Moon Okgyeong
and Seo Hyerang.

965
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,806
But…

966
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,016
there's a condition.

967
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:11,272
The young male and female leads
are to audition as a pair.

968
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,483
In other words,

969
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:17,611
you will not be able to audition
without a partner.

970
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:19,905
I wish to see

971
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,741
the successors
of Moon Okgyeong and Seo Hyerang

972
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:26,787
come out of none other than
our Maeran Gukgeukdan.

973
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:31,834
And it's vital that a Maeran trainee
become the successor of Okgyeong,

974
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:35,129
the Prince of Maeran.

975
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:37,965
Know this.

976
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:40,050
Only the one
who proves herself to be the best

977
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:43,262
in singing, dancing, and acting

978
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,973
may ascend to the throne

979
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:48,142
and rule as our new prince.

980
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:50,895
So go and show everyone

981
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:52,646
what it means…

982
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,317
to be Maeran Gukgeukdan.

983
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:42,655
JEONGNYEON: THE STAR IS BORN

984
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,490
{\an8}<i>The play for this joint performance</i>

985
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,076
{\an8}<i>is notorious for its difficult songs.</i>

986
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,453
{\an8}Whether you make it or not
will come down to your singing.

987
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:52,873
{\an8}<i>Chae Gongseon's daughter
versus Han Kijoo's daughter.</i>

988
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:56,168
{\an8}<i>I need to know who's more talented.</i>

989
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,837
{\an8}<i>You haven't already decided
to audition with Jeongnyeon, have you?</i>

990
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,382
{\an8}I'd like you to be my partner.

991
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:03,634
{\an8}We need to practice for the audition.

992
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:05,761
{\an8}<i>Let's start tomorrow morning, okay?</i>

993
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:07,388
{\an8}<i>Let's start practicing.</i>

994
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:09,682
{\an8}<i>I want to audition with you.</i>
