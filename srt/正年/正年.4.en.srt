ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.

22
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,980
THE SHOW CONTAINS JAPANESE EXPRESSIONS
TO REFLECT THE TIME PERIOD.

23
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,988
It's been a while, Gongseon.

24
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,742
How did you…

25
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,621
Are you here to take your daughter home?

26
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:25,210
So you knew… that she was my daughter?

27
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,089
You know the director?

28
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,342
Let's go.

29
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,551
No, I'm not going!

30
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,806
Jeongnyeon is my student
and a part of our troupe.

31
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,017
You can't take her like this.

32
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,194
Of course,
she's free to leave of her own free will.

33
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,279
I have no intention of leaving.

34
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,743
Talk to me
if you want to take her home.

35
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:03,623
Or should I talk about our past
in front of your daughter right here?

36
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,131
Go on. Get inside.

37
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,022
You've changed a lot.

38
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,073
And you haven't changed at all.

39
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,355
We're not late, are we?

40
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,399
- No, we're not.
- Then let's go.

41
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,443
- Wait, Gongseon.
- What?

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,910
It's medicine for nerves.

43
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,412
They say
this calms your nerves right down.

44
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,750
It's so bitter!

45
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,293
You still have to finish it, okay?

46
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,922
Oh, my goodness, that was awful.

47
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,300
Now all there's left to do
is wow them with your voice.

48
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,260

Anyone who hears this rendition

I'll be taking Jeongnyeon home,

72
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,900
so don't get in our way.

73
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,985
Why?

74
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,321
Are you afraid?

75
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,116
That Jeongnyeon might face failure
like you did?

76
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,869
She was the one who chose this path.

77
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,414
You think she's going to back down now
just because you pressure her to?

78
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,583
That's exactly why I'm against this.

79
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,377
I know what she's like more than anyone.

80
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,673
She'll go all the way, no matter the cost.

81
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,508
And what about you?

82
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,553
Are you happy
now that you gave up that path?

83
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,267
You reached a position
any <i>pansori</i> singer could only dream of.

84
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,478
But you…

85
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,522
gave that up way too easily.

86
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,607
Then what?

87
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,818
What should I have done?

88
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,781
I couldn't sing…

89
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,658
even if I wanted to.

90
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,502
Jeongnyeon was the one
who sought me out.

91
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,671
Have you even…

92
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,510

I still remember the time
when you came with your father…

104
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,025
<i>and asked Master Im to teach you</i> pansori.

105
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,029
<i>Your father was adamantly against it.</i>

106
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,241
<i>And yet you held your ground</i>

107
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,493
<i>and ended up learning under Master Im.</i>

108
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,000
From your voice

109
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,336
to your stubborn nature…

110
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,090
Jeongnyeon…

111
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,843
is your spitting image.

112
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,349
If…

113
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,187
you also used to sing <i>pansori,</i>

114
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,441
why are you so against me doing it?

115
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,986
If I were you, I'd be happy about it.

116
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,990
Mother.

117
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:57,703
I still want to earn lots of money
and treat you to a better life.

118
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,871
But along with that,

119
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,290
I have a bigger dream now.

120
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,253
I want to be a <i>gukgeuk </i>actor.

121
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,337
My goodness.

122
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,341
Do you like it that much already?

123
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,885
Yes.

124
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,515
When the crowd claps for me,

125
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,101
it feels like

126
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,563
sparks are running up and down
my whole body.

127
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,651
I like it that much.

128
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,153
Mother.

129
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,407
Could you please let me do this?

130
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,535
I promise that I'll work very hard.

131
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,164
Jeongnyeon.

132
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,211
I'm begging you.

133
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,047
Come home with me.

134
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,467
Please listen to me.

135
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,227
If I go back…

136
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,688
then what?

137
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,568
You want me to dig for clams
and clean fish all my life

138
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,196
and then get married to some guy one day?

139
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,115
Mother.

140
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,660
I can't live like that now.

141
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,788
Do you know
what's at the end of this path?

142
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,960
I poured out everything I had

143
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,047
into <i>pansori.</i>

144
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,675
And in the end,

145
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,678
I had nothing left.

146
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,766
Let's stop here…

147
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,686
before you end up like me.

148
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,440
No.

149
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,734
I'm different from you.

150
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,320
I'm positive I won't end up like you.

151
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,449
How could you get in the way of my life

152
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,744
just because you failed?

153
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,916
Then I'm not going to consider you

154
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,710
my daughter anymore.

155
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,589
Will you still stay then?

156
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,094
Will you?

157
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,390
Yes.

158
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,906
{\an8}Act 4

159
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,368
{\an8}Jeongnyeon!

160
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,995
{\an8}Hmm?

161
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,998
{\an8}I took my cast off today,

162
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,083
{\an8}so you don't have to work
at the coffee shop anymore.

163
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,794
{\an8}I'm so scared
that someone will find out you sang there.

164
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,882
{\an8}I was also feeling guilty
every time I met the director.

165
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,427
{\an8}But will you be okay?

166
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,803
{\an8}I'll be fine.

167
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,388
{\an8}See? Good as new.

168
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,517
{\an8}I can't believe you!

169
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,437
{\an8}You have to be careful for a day or two
even if you remove your cast.

170
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,565
{\an8}This won't do.

171
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,567
{\an8}Let me work at the coffee shop for today.

172
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,903
{\an8}- No, I'm really fine.
- Stop talking nonsense.

173
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,530
{\an8}I just have to sing for one more day.

174
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,616
{\an8}I haven't been caught yet.

175
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,326
I'll be back, okay?

176
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,996
Don't you dare move.

177
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,130
Come in.

178
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,049
You called for me?

179
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,094
Hi, Youngseo.
I haven't seen you in a while.

180
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,679
Have a seat.

181
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,309
When was the last time
you were in Korea, Youngin?

182
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,562
The last time I flew in from the US
was last year,

183
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,897
so it's been about a year.

184
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,190
Hmm.

185
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,901
Aren't you happy to see your sister?

186
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,111
I could have gone home to see you.

187
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,696
There was no need for you to come here.

188
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,533
But you always leave
right after seeing Mom.

189
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,411
And I also came to spend time
with my favorite director.

190
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,080
Really?

191
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,251
You sisters really are polar opposites.

192
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,212
Youngseo is just like our mom.

193
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,465
Both of them
live for their pride as artists.

194
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,969
Oh, I almost forgot to give you this.

195
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,389
I'm having a homecoming recital.

196
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,682
I hope to see you there.

197
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,310
Of course, I'll be there.

198
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,939
Youngseo,

199
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,316
go spend some time with your sister.

200
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,405
Uh… thank you.

201
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,616
You're Heo Youngin,
the soprano, right?

202
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,285
Yes, I am.

203
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,579
Could I…

204
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,914
please have your autograph?

205
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,207
What's your name?

206
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,001
It's Lee Jongbun.

207
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,045
I'm going to brag to everyone about this!

208
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,091
Here you go.

209
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,176
- Thank you so much.
- I'm flattered.

210
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,848
Lighten up, will you?

211
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:55,102
I feel invisible whenever I'm with you.

212
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,648
I read the article about you playing
the lead in your trainee performance.

213
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,568
You got a standing ovation and everything.

214
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,988
It's nothing compared to you.

215
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,698
Come on.

216
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,742
Who cares if I'm happy with it?

217
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,996
It probably means nothing to Mother.

218
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,623
Do you think…

219
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,542
Mom is ever fully satisfied with anything?

220
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,549
There's a lot of you today.

221
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,926
Hello!

222
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:32,389
Thank you again
for visiting our coffee shop!

223
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,810

What? Don't you want to hear the song?

236
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,969
Oh. Director.

237
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,944
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

238
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,784
Is it true you're singing in town
for money?

239
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,791
Answer me!

240
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,758
Director, I was just…

241
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,094
A Maeran troupe trainee singing for money?

242
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,390
This is a complete embarrassment
and a total disgrace.

243
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,061
You have no pride as an artist.

244
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,104
You're done here!

245
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,036
Director.

246
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,668
I was in the wrong, Director.

247
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:11,131
I was in need of some money,

248
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,927
so I wasn't thinking straight.

249
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,678
Get up.

250
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,640
You think begging is going to solve
all your problems?

251
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,812
I can't give you all the details,

252
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,772
but please believe me when I say…

253
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,567
that I had no choice
but to work at the coffee shop.

254
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,861
I was only going to work as a waitress,

255
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,490
but some things came up,
and I had to sing there as well.

256
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:41,411
It was never ever my intention
to sing for money!

257
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,498
Then…

258
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,585
tell me why you had to work
at the coffee shop.

259
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,255
That's…

260
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,481
I can't tell you.

261
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,066
- Huh?
- She can't say.

262
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,405
Director!

263
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,743
What should I do for you to forgive me?

264
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,579
I'll do anything!

265
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,418
I made it very clear from the beginning.

266
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,336
To train diligently,

267
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,381
and never to use Maeran's fame
for personal gain.

268
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,925
And you couldn't even do that.

269
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,261
You're not prepared to become an artist,

270
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,763
let alone an actor.

271
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,729
She's unbelievable.

272
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,666
Everyone, get inside.

273
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,044
Now!

274
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,463
- Get in.
- Come on, let's sit down.

275
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,098
Yoon Jeongnyeon!

276
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,563
I know full well that what I did

277
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,900
isn't going to go away just because I beg.

278
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,110
But…

279
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,740
I just can't bear to leave.

280
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,827
So please excuse me
for coming to beg for your forgiveness.

281
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,707
I have no other place to go.

282
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,294
You know that.

283
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,632
I've abandoned my mother

284
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,134
just so I could stay
and become a <i>gukgeuk </i>actor!

285
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,680
I can't leave like this!

286
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,933
From the beginning,

287
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,978
you've never been an official trainee,

288
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,064
but someone who had to prove herself
during a trial period.

289
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,441
And as of today,

290
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,486
your trial period is over.

291
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,906
I'll do anything.

292
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,160
I'll even stay as the cleaning staff.

293
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,542
So please let me stay in Maeran.

294
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,919
I guess talking
isn't getting through to you.

295
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,629
What?

296
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,425
Drag her out right now!

297
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,759
Director!

298
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,886
- Let me go!
- Jeongnyeon!

299
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,680
- Director, please!
- Let's go!

300
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,015
Director!

301
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,266
Please!

302
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,520
- No…
- Wait, please.

303
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,772
Jeongnyeon… Oh, no…

304
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,244
Jeongnyeon…

305
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,996
I'm so sorry.

306
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,344
It's okay.

307
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,890
It's a relief you weren't found out.

308
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,142
But why do you have to…

309
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,102
You told me not to do it.

310
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,230
I was the one who made that choice.

311
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,110
Don't cry.

312
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,905
If you cry,

313
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,699
you're going to make me cry.

314
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:57,501
Don't you even think about
telling the director you worked there.

315
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,419
If she needed to hear that,

316
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,254
I would have told her myself.

317
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,428
I'm the one who chose to sing.

318
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,432
But you have nowhere to go.

319
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,647
They may not want me,
but I still have places I can go.

320
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,239
Wait for me.

321
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,910
I'll do whatever it takes…

322
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,122
to come back to Maeran.

323
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,585
So…

324
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,296
you do whatever it takes

325
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,634
to stay right here, okay?

326
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,554
Oh!

327
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,278
I'll talk to the director
once she's calmed down a bit.

328
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,783
But why were you working
at the coffee shop?

329
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,163
Whatever the reason may be,
she did sing there for money.

330
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,915
The director's not going to forgive her.

331
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,334
The one thing she doesn't take lightly

332
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,212
is anyone using Maeran's fame
for personal gain.

333
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,550
If all else fails, I'll introduce you
to other theater troupes.

334
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,262
There are lots of other theater troupes
in Seoul.

335
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,139
No.

336
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,603
I have to get back into Maeran
no matter what.

337
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,066
I can't leave without proving anything.

338
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,528
How will you do that?

339
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,155
And how are you going to stay in Seoul?

340
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,200
I'll...

341
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,284
That's enough.

342
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,497
You can stay here for as long as you need.

343
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,920
I need to get somewhere,
so make yourself at home.

344
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,923
But you didn't finish eating…

345
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,472
- Hey.
- Yes?

346
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,975
How long do you plan on staying here?

347
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,476
Sorry?

348
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,354
Use your brain, will you?

349
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:09,442
If the director hears
that Okgyeong is letting you stay here,

350
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,737
think about how much trouble she'd be in.

351
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,700
Don't tell me

352
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,702
you were planning on
staying here indefinitely

353
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,745
just because she's being kind to you.

354
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,166
Of course not.

355
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,546
I'll make sure not to cause any trouble.

356
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,307
If it's about forgiving Yoon Jeongnyeon,
I don't want to hear it.

357
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,559
She broke our rule.

358
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,273
You know she's not someone
who'd use our fame for personal gain.

359
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,734
You should first hear her out and...

360
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,277
Whatever her reason was,

361
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,323
there are still so many who look down
on <i>gukgeuk </i>troupes.

362
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:01,161
{\an8}So it's imperative
we don't sell our songs like courtesans.

363
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,331
We might lose her
to other theater troupes at this rate.

364
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,334
If I let this slide,

365
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,795
then everyone will try to make money
off of our fame.

366
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,966
And our reputation as a theater troupe
will go down the drain.

367
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,553
I can't ever let that happen.

368
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,689
Enjoy the buns.

369
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,816
Here you go.

370
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,044
Enjoy.

371
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,796
Thank you.

372
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,714
- Here, enjoy.
- Thank you!

373
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,633
- Guys, enjoy.
- You're going to become an author!

374
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,176
Just be quiet and eat your buns.

375
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,260
I'm not at that level yet.

376
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,637
Look who's being modest.

377
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,846
"You're that famous author, right?

378
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,098
Can I have your autograph?"

379
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,393
This tastes even better
because the great author is treating us.

380
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,936
Could I have five of these next time?

381
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,854
- Can we get some more?
- All right, fine.

382
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,690
Let the great author get you more buns.

383
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,234
You really know your stuff.
Steamed buns are best in winter.

384
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,360
Look how it's steaming.

385
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,613
It's hot.

386
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,495
Hey.

387
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,825
You all done?

388
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,994
That'll be 180 <i>hwan.</i>

389
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,917
It was right here.

390
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,502
What's going on?

391
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,672
Did you eat all those buns
without having money to pay?

392
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,134
My goodness, you planned this
from the beginning, didn't you?

393
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,762
No, that's not what's going on.

394
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,806
It really was right here.

395
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,726
All right, let's not do this here.

396
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,145
We'll deal with this
at the police station. Come on.

397
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,229
What?

398
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,773
I'm telling you, I have money!

399
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,940
Come on!

400
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,359
- Let's go, you scoundrel!
- But I really…

401
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,444
Are you kidding me?

402
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,528
That's not it!

403
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,491
It's not like I didn't pay
because I didn't want to.

404
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,494
Someone must have stolen my money!

405
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,037
It's just gone!

406
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,749
I've got nothing!

407
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,418
Whether your money was stolen

408
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,087
or whether you stuffed your face
without intending to pay

409
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,339
is none of my concern.

410
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,715
What did you say?

411
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,218
Why are you treating me like a scammer?

412
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,263
Why, you little…
How dare you raise your voice?

413
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,599
If you've done something wrong,
you should be begging on your knees!

414
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,149
He was just accusing me out of the blue.

415
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,819
I don't want to hear it.
Pay up for the buns.

416
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,573
There's no one in Seoul
who can help me out right now.

417
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,827
If you don't pay up,

418
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,119
you're going to jail.

419
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,664
J-Jail?

420
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,376
Gosh.

421
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,877
Oh, no.

422
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,300
Then…

423
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,429
could I just make one phone call?

424
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,949
Look at this brat trying to buy time.

425
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,909
Hey! Lock her up!

426
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,036
What? But sir!

427
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,580
- Oh, my goodness! Really?
- Come here!

428
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:17,166
Sir, please! My goodness, what do I do?

429
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,013
Oh, shut up!

430
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,056
My goodness!

431
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,766
I'm sorry.

432
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,996
Park Jongguk

433
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,581
What?

434
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:01,544
What do you mean Mr. Ko is the reason
the trainees have to work in town?

435
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,838
I think the head of finances

436
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,591
is using the troupe's money for gambling.

437
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,969
What are you talking about?

438
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,348
There are girls aside from Jeongnyeon
who have jobs in town.

439
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,267
And they can't help
but squeeze in work between rehearsals

440
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,686
because they don't get enough allowance
from the troupe.

441
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,482
Are you sure they're not working
for extra clothes and accessories?

442
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,650
I'm sure.

443
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,693
They can barely afford a cup of coffee

444
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,737
even with a few weeks of allowance.

445
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,073
Is that so?

446
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,409
I didn't know.

447
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,912
I think I should bring it up
to the director.

448
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,330
No.

449
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,832
She's already furious as it is
because of Jeongnyeon.

450
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,210
If you talk to her now,
it won't get through to her.

451
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,212
I'll make sure to bring it up to her

452
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,005
when she's calmed down a bit.

453
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,174
All right?

454
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,734
Hello, Princess.

455
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,821
Keep your gambling in check, will you?

456
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,242
- What?
- Someone's getting suspicious.

457
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,245
I'm telling you to lay low for a while
before the director hears of this.

458
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:18,913
Okay.

459
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,041
Also,

460
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,544
raise the allowance for the trainees.

461
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,756
Isn't it enough that the troupe provides
housing and food for them?

462
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,468
- What more do they want?
- If there are more complaints,

463
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,762
they'll want to examine the ledger.

464
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,973
Will you be okay with that?

465
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,271
All right.

466
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,400
I'll make sure none of this
causes you any trouble, okay?

467
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,029
Don't worry.

468
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,419
Please take care, sir.

469
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,503
- Thank you.
- Yes.

470
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,395
I'm so sorry for calling you
about something like this.

471
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:28,941
I'll make sure to repay you for the buns.

472
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,526
Don't worry about that.

473
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,904
What are you going to do now?

474
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:36,324
You probably don't have anywhere to go
if you were kicked out of the troupe.

475
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,703
If there's something you want to say,
say it now.

476
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:46,918
Last time,

477
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,422
you said you'd like to make me a star.

478
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,384
Is that still valid?

479
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,180
Of course. I haven't changed my mind.

480
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,601
Then…

481
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,604
could you make me a singer?

482
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,690
That's what I wanted to hear.

483
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,068
What changed your mind?

484
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,487
This is the only way

485
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,783
I can stay in Seoul
and not go back to Mokpo.

486
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,830
And there's no way
I can go back like this.

487
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,457
Good thinking.

488
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:30,002
You have to go all the way
if you came here to make it big.

489
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,963
But I have a condition.

490
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:37,385
I will not become a singer
by using Maeran's fame.

491
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,053
That's fine by me.

492
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,597
Then from now on,

493
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:45,685
you're a whole new talent
that I found and nurtured.

494
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,521
All right.

495
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,780
Get your tofu here.

496
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,118
Seoul Jongno Broadcasting Station

497
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,287
Hello.

498
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,750
This is our studio.

499
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,170
We shoot our program in here

500
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,714
and broadcast it
to all the televisions in the country.

501
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,968
My goodness, so if I sing here,

502
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,179
people will be able to see me?

503
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,430
Right.

504
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,224
But because our technology's
not up to par yet,

505
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,351
we can only stream the programs live.

506
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,604
So when you're up on stage,

507
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:33,691
you have to keep going
even if you make a mistake.

508
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:37,361
But most homes can barely afford radios.

509
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,448
So how many homes
actually have televisions?

510
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,033
Seems like it'd be expensive.

511
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,868
You're right, there aren't a lot.

512
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,746
A single television
is worth dozens of bags of rice.

513
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,956
What?

514
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,961
Then no one will be watching
even if we broadcast anything.

515
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,422
We need to look toward the future.

516
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,133
Televisions are going
to dominate the world.

517
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,218
There will come a time

518
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,303
when we'll all stay home
to watch television.

519
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,556
And people will be scrambling
to get on air.

520
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,185
With <i>gukgeuk, </i>only the audience
can enjoy your performance.

521
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,854
But in front of the camera,
the whole country can watch you perform.

522
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,981
Mr. Park.

523
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,484
The Kim Sisters are going to be late.

524
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,069
What? Hey.

525
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,446
Then when will they get here?

526
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,657
I'm not sure.

527
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,207
I have no idea what's written here.

528
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,792
Two cups of coffee, Miss Lee.

529
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:33,876
Yes, sir.

530
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,214
There are so many difficult characters.

531
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,715
It's a work contract.

532
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,342
It has the details

533
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,387
on how much we're going to pay you
if you appear in our shows.

534
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,931
- Make sure to stamp your fingerprint.
- Okay.

535
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,686
Yoon Jeongnyeon

536
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,857
The Fragrance of Seoul
Patricia Kim

537
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,791
Oh!

538
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,751
Say hello, Jeongnyeon.

539
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,880
This is Patricia Kim.
She'll be teaching you how to sing.

540
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,465
Nice to meet you.

541
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,260
My name is Yoon Jeongnyeon.

542
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,638
You're the singer from Pastel Tea Room.

543
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,142
Yes.

544
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,852
I knew it.

545
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,146
Mr. Park took
an immediate interest in you.

546
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,606
I may not be good at much,

547
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,526
but I'm great at picking out good talent.

548
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,238
I'll be going, so please take care of her.

549
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,533
You'll be staying at her place
until your debut.

550
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,076
Uh…

551
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,454
And call me if you need anything.

552
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,466
Is something wrong?

553
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,553
It's nothing. Let's start with our lesson.

554
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,638
How about you sing me a song to warm up?

555
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,101
Okay.

556
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,773
First…

557
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,524
take a look at this.

558
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,863
Youth of Mokpo

559
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,199
I've never heard of this song.

560
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,035
That's because
it hasn't been published yet.

561
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:36,207
Mr. Park got this song just for you
from a famous composer.

562
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,584
Oh my, for me?

563
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,336
Can you read sheet music?

564
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,213
No.

565
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:46,967
Then listen well.

566
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,804
I'm going to sing it just once.
Make sure to memorize it.

567
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,472
Okay.

568
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:58,813
<i>♪ The sun is setting on the Mokpo docks ♪</i>

569
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,734
<i>♪ A lady looks for her love ♪</i>

570
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:09,448
<i>♪ Her cheeks ♪</i>

571
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:13,244
<i>♪ Are as rosy as the setting sun ♪</i>

572
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,499
<i>♪ Walking by gracefully ♪</i>

573
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,671
<i>♪ She lives by the blue ocean ♪</i>

00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:29,218

00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:38,394

577
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:45,484

00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:06,922
<i>♪ Lady of the Mokpo docks ♪</i>

581
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,721
Oh, my goodness!

582
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,515
You're absolutely amazing!

583
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,893
Your voice is like honey!

584
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:20,895
Of course.

585
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,898
I used to be quite popular in my day.

586
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,658
Now then, sing along with me.

587
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,786
Okay.

588
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,957
Oh, goodness.

589
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,419
What's the matter?

590
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,255
This won't do.

591
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,174
I tried to ignore it,

592
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,218
but your fashion is bumming me out.

593
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,428
I can't seem to focus.

594
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,513
We'll need to…

595
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,016
do something about your fashion.

596
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,397
Try walking around.

597
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,621
Spin around.

598
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,750
Next.

599
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,419
Next.

600
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,705
Now, hold your head up slightly.

601
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,542
And put on a smile.

602
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,525
This steak thing tastes delicious.

603
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,155
I wanted to ask you,

604
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,907
why aren't you going back on stage

605
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,909
when you've got such an amazing voice?

606
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,161
Even if I want to,

607
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,289
no one's willing to take me
since I'm a divorcée.

608
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,708
A divorcée?

609
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,504
Why are you so surprised?

610
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:56,216
It's just that
I've only ever heard about it.

611
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,093
This is my first time
seeing a divorced person.

612
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,308
Then did you think

613
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:07,519
a divorced person would have
horns on their head or something?

614
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,604
Of course not.

615
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,398
Well,

616
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,193
I also didn't know I'd get a divorce.

617
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,779
I didn't know my husband

618
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,907
would have an affair
with a girl half his age.

619
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,284
Ah… So he had an affair.

620
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,872
The ladies in my hometown said

621
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:30,250
that men have small affairs
at least once in their lives,

622
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,795
so girls should just bear with it.

623
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,713
Maybe you should have been more patient.

624
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,049
How could I?

625
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,803
I would have been sharing my husband
with another woman.

626
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,305
But you just said
you couldn't go back to work.

627
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,016
Don't you have any regrets
about getting divorced?

628
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,227
How about you?

629
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,187
Do you have any regrets
about coming to Seoul

630
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,855
now that you're kicked out of the troupe?

631
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,695
- No.
- Why not?

632
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,364
You're not doing <i>gukgeuk </i>now.

633
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,367
You wouldn't have suffered so much
if you had never come here.

634
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,704
Still, it can't be helped.

635
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:11,041
I'd do the same thing
even if I were to go back in time.

636
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,043
That's how I feel.

637
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,214
Even if I were to go back
knowing how I would end up,

638
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,632
there's no helping it.

639
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,385
I can't live my life as anyone but me.

640
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,680
If I lived my life
as if I were someone else,

641
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,474
I would be deceiving myself.

642
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,477
Of course,

643
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:36,150
I may never be able to stand
in front of an audience as a singer.

644
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,653
But if I guide you
to become a wonderful singer,

645
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,864
then I'd begin the second act of my life.

646
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,868
Here.

647
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,202
Let's do our best, shall we?

648
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,790
Yes.

649
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,175
Hey, why didn't you clean up last time?

650
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,259
It wasn't on purpose.
Sit down.

651
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,261
- Come here.
- Chorok!

652
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,559
Ah, now that somebody's gone,

653
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:14,188
the whole atmosphere has lightened up.

654
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,649
I knew that country bumpkin
would cause trouble one day.

655
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:21,236
How could she even
think of singing for money?

656
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,655
She's just not on our level.

657
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,658
Park Chorok, Seo Boksil.

658
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,161
You guys get enough allowance
from your homes

659
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,288
because your family's well off.

660
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,625
Don't be so quick to judge someone
when you've never been short on money.

661
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,293
How scary.

662
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,213
We weren't talking about you.
Why are you getting worked up?

663
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,216
Do you work at the coffee shop too?

664
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,425
What?

665
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,510
She works at a coffee shop?

666
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,303
- Jooran's working there too?
- There's no way.

667
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,890
Hey, I think you were right.

668
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,517
This isn't something to laugh about.

669
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,019
- There's no way.
- Training's gonna start soon.

670
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,354
Keep it down.

671
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,359
Why would you talk trash
about someone who's already left?

672
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,488
You should be rehearsing
if you've got that much time.

673
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,407
Park Chorok, Seo Boksil, Jin Yeonhong.

674
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,077
You guys had the lowest scores
on the monthly review.

675
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,624
{\an8}Jamyunggo

676
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,795
- Let's get back to our seats.
- Hey, that's my seat. Move.

677
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,008
Thank you.

678
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,344
I didn't do it so you would thank me.

679
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,429
Still, thank you.

680
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,726
I have no idea

681
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,188
how the director found out
Jeongnyeon was working at the coffee shop.

682
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:43,026
Who could have told her?

683
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:51,451
<i>♪ The sun is setting on the Mokpo docks ♪</i>

684
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:56,206
<i>- ♪ A lady looks for her love ♪</i>
- Keep it light.

685
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:02,254
<i>♪ Her cheeks ♪</i>

686
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:05,883
<i>- ♪ Are as rosy as the setting sun ♪</i>
- A bit more nostalgic. Good.

687
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,553
<i>♪ Walking by gracefully ♪</i>

688
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,513
Bounce those hips.

689
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,433
<i>♪ She lives by the blue ocean ♪</i>

690
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,602
Like the waves, yes.

691
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,021
<i>♪ When will he return? ♪</i>

692
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,314

<i>♪ My love out in the sea ♪</i>

694
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,902
Keep it going!

695
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,279
Stop, stop, stop!

696
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,699
How would you rate yourself

697
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,535
for your performance just now?

698
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,370
I'd of course give myself…

699
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,665
…a zero.

700
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,751
Why is that?

701
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,086
I don't feel anything as I sing,

702
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,839
so what would the audience feel?

703
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,257
So you know.

704
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,677
Right now, you have the basic skills down.

705
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,597
But let me tell you something
about pop songs.

706
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,642
It's not enough for you
to simply sing well.

707
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,644
You need to be able
to entice your listeners

708
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,979
and excite them to their core.

709
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,565
How do I do that?

710
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,651
You need to own the song.

711
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:09,071
So much so that if people hear your name,

712
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:13,075
they'll be able to think
of <i>Youth of Mokpo </i>right away.

713
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,702
Listen to me.

714
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,704
When you sing your very first line,

715
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,916
you need to be able to pull
everyone's attention to the television.

716
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:23,919
Okay.

717
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,340
Kim Sungeum

718
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,597
Who are you?

719
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,184
Hello, ma'am.

720
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,645
Is Yoon Jeongnyeon perhaps…

721
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,230
Jooran!

722
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,987
Jeongnyeon!

723
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,532
How have you been?

724
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,576
How are you holding up?

725
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,592
How are you doing?

726
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,559
What about you?

727
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:25,022
Of course you wouldn't be doing well.

728
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,941
All because of me.

729
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,318
Stop, stop!

730
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,530
No more crying.

731
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,826
I'm fine.
I don't think about the troupe anymore.

732
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,579
Actually, I'm so busy learning new things.

733
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,374
How's the troupe doing?

734
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,711
Things must be so hectic
preparing for the audition and all.

735
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,505
Well, yeah.

736
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,592
{\an8}I bet that brat Youngseo…

737
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:58,013
{\an8}…will be auditioning for the male lead,
am I right?

738
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,640
You're still thinking about the troupe,

739
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,560
which means you still want to come back.

740
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,437
No, I mean…

741
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,897
I'm telling you, no!

742
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,984
I'm going to make it big
as a pop singer now!

743
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,445
They say…

744
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,822
that television is going
to dominate the world.

745
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:16,948
And I'm…

746
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,369
<i>Those people</i>

747
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,580
are from beyond the stars.

748
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,457
Beyond the stars?

749
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,257
I'm going to make it big among the stars.

750
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,220
And what about you?

751
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,473
Which role are you auditioning for?

752
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,391
{\an8}Oh…

753
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,602
{\an8}I'll probably end up as an extra.

754
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,146
I've never played

755
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,816
anything other than extras
for official performances.

756
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,318
And the director won't give me any leads.

757
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,820
What are you talking about?

758
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,572
You can't know for sure
until you actually try.

759
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,866
You need to aim for something bigger

760
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,827
for your skills to improve
even by just a bit.

761
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,079
And didn't you tell me

762
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:07,582
that you wanted to play leads
like Hyerang one day?

763
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,959
That was just…

764
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,050
But there's no one
to watch me on stage anymore.

765
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,594
What? What do you mean?

766
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:23,515
If you're going to be on stage,
you can count on me to be in the audience.

767
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,476
- You mean it?
- Come on.

768
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,727
Have I ever lied to you?

769
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,855
Of course I mean it.

770
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,984
Eat up.

771
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:37,195
These black things are really delicious.

772
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,448
Thanks.

773
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:01,928
What do you think?

774
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,639
I like it.

775
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,314
She's the most popular soprano these days.

776
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,982
You should know about these things now.

777
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,443
"Heo Youngin."

778
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,320
Heo Youngin?

779
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:23,033
Is she perhaps the daughter
of the famous soprano, Han Kijoo?

780
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,117
So you've heard of her?

781
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,372
Yes.

782
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,417
I know her younger sister quite well.

783
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,336
I didn't know she had a sister.

784
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,297
Anyhow, they're incredibly well off.

785
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,718
Her father, Dr. Heo Inseong,
is a dean of a medical college

786
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,595
and comes from old money.

787
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,264
Her mother, Han Kijoo,

788
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:50,185
is the only child of the director
of Cheongam Hospital in Jongno.

789
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,188
You'll be shocked
when you see where they live later.

790
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,608
We're going to their house?

791
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:57,692
Of course.

792
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,612
The purpose of our evening
is to meet people at their house.

793
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,157
Oh, come on.

794
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,912
By the way,
where in Mokpo did you say you lived?

795
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,874
I lived in Haean-dong. Why do you ask?

796
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:17,629
We need to shoot some footage
for when you get on air.

797
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,297
We'll just get some scenery shots.

798
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:25,345
The scenery in my hometown
is absolutely gorgeous.

799
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:28,265
You'll get a masterpiece
everywhere you shoot.

800
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,687
Soprano Heo Youngin
Homecoming Recital

801
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,628
Hello, ma'am.

802
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,015
Fate really is cruel, huh?

803
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,058
I guess Maeran is here today.

804
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,770
Make sure you hold your head up high.

805
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,897
You're going to be
a rising star of television.

806
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:20,525
Of course.

807
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,829
The music's beautiful, isn't it?

808
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:33,913
It is.

809
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,149
Oh, brava!

810
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:08,865
Brava!

811
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,371
Come on, get up for your sister.

812
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,139
- Hi.
- Hello, hi.

813
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,349
Christine?

814
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,434
- Nice to see you.
- Long time no see.

815
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,020
- How long will you stay here?
- Around two weeks.

816
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,438
- Sounds good.
- Enjoy.

817
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,773
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

818
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:42,941
Thank you.

819
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,071
Oh. Come with me, Jeongnyeon.

820
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,075
Good evening, Director Kim.

821
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:57,580
She's Yoon Jeongnyeon,
the girl I've been telling you about.

822
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,792
Uh, hello.

823
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,836
Yes. Hello, Ms. Yoon.

824
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,254
I've heard a lot about you.

825
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:08,133
Mr. Park here is expecting a lot from you.

826
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,509
So I hope you do well.

827
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,593
Then…

828
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,012
Yes.

829
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,434
And this is Journalist Son Jaedeok
from <i>Paradise Monthly.</i>

830
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,310
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

831
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,105
So she's your up-and-coming star?

832
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,317
She's younger than I thought she'd be.

833
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,112
Visuals are key for television.

834
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,030
We need to put forth
young and pretty talents.

835
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,491
We hope to hear
lots of good articles from you then.

836
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,077
Well, of course. I'll see you again then.

837
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:37,996
Yes, sir.

838
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,582
Let's work hard, all right?

839
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,380
The man beside Jeongnyeon
is a producer at a broadcasting station.

840
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:52,051
I guess they're trying
to broadcast her singing.

841
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:55,305
I told her to sing her heart out
outside the troupe,

842
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:58,057
and she's really living her life,
isn't she?

843
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,315
Director?

844
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,198
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Thank you.

845
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,284
I think it'll be a big hit this time.

846
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,452
Of course it should.

847
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,578
I'll be counting on you.

848
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,414
Don't you worry.
I'll write anything for you.

849
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,874
Really?

850
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,626
Jeongnyeon!

851
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,897
I barely recognized you.

852
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,066
You look good enough to be a model.

853
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,651
My goodness.

854
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,694
You're too kind.

855
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,240
How are you doing
with your debut as a singer?

856
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,450
I'm doing well.

857
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,995
For the first time in my life,
I'm wearing nice clothes and shoes.

858
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,499
I'm also getting singing lessons
from a famous teacher.

859
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,625
It's quite fun.

860
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,927
So have you
completely left <i>gukgeuk</i> behind?

861
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,055
I wish you wouldn't stray too far.

862
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,602
You were born to be a performer,

863
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,063
so I'm sure you'll do great as a singer.

864
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,731
But…

865
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,902
I liked it best when you sang <i>pansori.</i>

866
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:46,958
Okgyeong.

867
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,005
Please excuse me.

868
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,685
The person you came with today.

869
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,314
He's really trying to make you
into the finest product, huh?

870
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,399
Product?

871
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,570
Are you saying that I'm an object?

872
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,947
He bought you nice clothes and shoes,

873
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,408
and got you singing lessons, didn't he?

874
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:24,454
It was all to make you
into a product suitable for television.

875
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:31,544
I guess your sharp tongue
hasn't gone anywhere.

876
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,344
You don't think that I…

877
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,806
Never mind.

878
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,269
I know it wasn't you.

879
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,647
What?

880
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,607
I know you didn't tell the director…

881
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,694
about me working at the coffee shop.

882
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,198
Are you saying…

883
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,076
you trust me?

884
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,744
It's not that I trust you.

885
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,123
I just know your character.

886
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,753
Yeah, you might have an attitude problem,

887
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:17,215
but you're not someone
who'd tattle on someone's secret.

888
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,093
I know that much.

889
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,064
This is my family.

890
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:35,274
- Honey.
- My goodness, hello.

891
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:41,072
I'm sure you all know,
but this is my eldest daughter, Youngin.

892
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,658
And this is my second daughter, Youngseo.

893
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:46,452
Say hi, girls.
This is Assemblyman Jung and his wife.

894
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,496
Hello.

895
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,540
That was a phenomenal performance earlier.

896
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:55,420
I think you'll soon come to represent
the whole of Asia beyond our nation.

897
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,548
You're too kind, sir.

898
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,426
Are you also learning opera?

899
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:03,845
I'm learning <i>gukgeuk, </i>ma'am.

900
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,346
<i>Gukgeuk?</i>

901
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,560
You mean where you sing <i>pansori</i>

902
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,729
and dance around to noisy music?

903
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,105
Oh my.

904
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:18,568
Ma'am, you sure are cultured
in every aspect of the arts.

905
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:24,323
It's a combination of different art forms
including dancing, singing, and acting.

906
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:28,035
I think you'll quite like it
once you watch it.

907
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:34,000
Well, I suppose
it's good to keep our traditions alive.

908
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,209
I see.

909
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:37,670
Then you must be in lead roles.

910
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,256
Well, of course, sir.

911
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:45,219
Oh, I've only played lead roles
in trainee performances.

912
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,555
And I'm working hard
for our official performance audition

913
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,432
to play a lead role.

914
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,642
That must be a lot of work.

915
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,314
You must be so proud
of your two gifted daughters.

916
01:02:58,691 --> 01:02:59,859
- How about some wine?
- Shall we?

917
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,027
This way then.

918
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,250
Ow!

919
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,045
Oh, jeez.

920
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,756
My goodness.

921
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,091
I guess they really are rich.

922
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,721
Their garden is as big as a huge field.

923
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:34,018
Are you out of your mind?

924
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,021
Why in the world would you mention
you're not even in lead roles?

925
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:38,773
It's just the truth.

926
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:40,399
But you will get a lead role.

927
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:43,277
You said you'd get the lead role
with this audition.

928
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:44,862
I mean…

929
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,364
Not yet, Mother.

930
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,117
Didn't you see how she looked at you

931
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,370
when you mentioned your involvement
in the likes of <i>gukgeuk?</i>

932
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:55,164
And you just had to mention
that you're not even in lead roles.

933
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:58,084
It's such a disgrace.

934
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,127
"The likes of <i>gukgeuk"?</i>

935
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,840
Are you ashamed of me?

936
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,675
Don't change the subject.

937
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,510
You're the one in the wrong.

938
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:11,097
I always knew you felt this way.

939
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:18,020
You're ashamed of the very fact
that I'm doing <i>gukgeuk.</i>

940
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:22,149
Is it because <i>gukgeuk </i>isn't opera?

941
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:24,110
Don't you dare make me the bad guy.

942
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,864
You think I'm the only one
who thinks that way?

943
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:32,034
Everyone in the world knows
that there are classes within occupations.

944
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,954
And there are classes…

945
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,540
in the world of arts as well.

946
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,501
I don't care
if that's what everyone else thinks.

947
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:45,089
I only care that you are proud of me.

948
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,094
You're my mother.

949
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,097
Can't you just…

950
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,684
Can't you just be on my side?

951
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:59,729
The only reason
why I didn't cut ties with you

952
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:01,480
after you left home for <i>gukgeuk…</i>

953
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,067
was because you were still my daughter.

954
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:07,778
And on top of that,

955
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:12,366
I'm still being patient with you
when you can't even get a lead role.

956
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:18,706
Don't you think
it's now time for you to make me proud?

957
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:00,998
You.

958
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,962
Did you hear everything?

959
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:07,713
Hey.

960
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:10,299
I wasn't trying to…

961
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,595
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop.

962
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,056
I just happened to hear some stuff
because it was loud.

963
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,224
You just happened to?

964
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:24,438
So you flatter me earlier
by saying that you knew my character,

965
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,316
then go on to backstab me like this?

966
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:33,072
I didn't know you had a filthy habit
of eavesdropping on others.

967
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,281
What did you say?

968
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:36,242
Hey.

969
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:44,542
Never mind.

970
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,461
All right.

971
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,130
I didn't mean to hear anything,

972
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:51,674
but I'm sorry I did.

973
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,300
I apologize.

974
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,344
Where do you think you're going?

975
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,388
You think an apology is enough?

976
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,477
You're not mad at me right now.

977
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,147
You're mad at your mother.

978
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:10,651
She was the one who hurt you,
so why would you take it out on me?

979
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:26,208
You…

980
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:31,839
Did you just… slap me?

981
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:42,183
You're not the only one
with a temper or pride.

982
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:45,311
From now on…

983
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,231
I'll make sure to pay you back
for whatever you do to me.

984
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,402
I don't have any reason…

985
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:57,031
to be patient with you.

986
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:39,115
JEONGNYEON: THE STAR IS BORN

{\an8}<i>Why do you have pictures of my mother?</i>

988
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:43,452
{\an8}You're a total con man.

989
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,038

996
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,344
{\an8}I'm not going to do that.

997
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:02,096
{\an8}What? What is she doing?
