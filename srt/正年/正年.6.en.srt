1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,054
It is the 1950s,
following the devastating Korean War.

2
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,057
Female gukgeuk, or traditional theater,
captures the heart of the public,

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,602
and many girls dream of becoming princes.

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,022
Playing the role of Yoon Jeongnyeon,

5
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,441
a pansori genius
who dives into the world of stars,

6
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,525
is Kim Taeri.

7
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,985
Playing the role of Heo Youngseo,

8
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:30,488
an elite trainee skilled at singing,
dancing, and even acting,

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,948
is Shin Yeeun.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,867
Playing the role of Moon Okgyeong,

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,119
the undisputed Prince of Maeran,
is Jung Eunchae.

12
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,829
Playing the role of Seo Hyerang,

13
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,582
the beautiful flower of Maeran,
is Kim Yoonhye.

14
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,666
And last but not least

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,587
is the director of all the girls
who dream of becoming princes,

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,505
Kang Sobok played by Ra Miran.

17
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,051
We want to thank you for your patience

18
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,971
as we proudly present
the story of Jeongnyeon!

19
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,639
"Jeongnyeon: The Star Is Born"

20
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,977
"Narrator: Cho Yeongsuk
First-generation female gukgeuk actor"

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,604
All characters, places, organizations,
and events in this show are fictional.

22
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,980
The show contains Japanese expressions
to reflect the time period.

23
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,274
{\an8}Act 6

24
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,445
{\an8}My dear Precious,
you are as pretty as ever.

25
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,613
{\an8}- If it wasn't...
- Such…

26
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:24,209
{\an8}If it wasn't for Mokryeon,
I would have you as my concubine.

27
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,588
{\an8}Such vile words!

28
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,965
{\an8}- Have you heard...
- Gomigeol.

29
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,302
{\an8}You may be the chancellor of Han,
but I despise you.

30
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,055
{\an8}Gomigeol, Precious.

31
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,807
{\an8}Have you not practiced together?

32
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,521
{\an8}We didn't have time to meet up yet.

33
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,605
{\an8}What are you talking about?

34
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,943
{\an8}By this time, you have to be able
to finish each other's sentences.

35
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,362
{\an8}But you're completely off-sync.

36
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,116
In this production,

37
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,536
the chemistry between you two
is just as vital as the two main leads.

38
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,873
If you can't convince the audience
of your chemistry,

39
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,459
then the whole performance will falter.
Understood?

40
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,044
Yes, ma'am.

41
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,463
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,216
Let's move on to the scene

43
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:17,303
where Princess Mokryeon
receives the letter to tear the Jamyunggo.

44
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,142
But… Director.

45
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,271
Then we can't cover
the scene with the soldiers.

46
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,774
We'll prioritize the leads' scenes today
since we don't have much time.

47
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,943
- We'll have time for you another day.
- What? But…

48
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,570
- Princess Mokryeon.
- Yes.

49
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,073
The prince wants me
to tear the Jamyunggo.

50
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,451
What am I to do?

51
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,913
Hey, Youngseo.

52
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,502
Could we set a time to practice together?

53
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,753
Later.

54
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,838
Then…

55
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,925
I could match your schedule,
so could we start tonight?

56
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,635
I said later.

57
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,930
What's the point of practicing together
if we're not ready?

58
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,309
It's not too late to practice together

59
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,270
after we've prepared enough individually.

60
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,534
Come on.

61
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,453
It's okay.

62
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,706
You know how unreasonable Youngseo can be.

63
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,876
I'm so worried
because we've never practiced together.

64
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,712
But she wouldn't even let me bring it up.

65
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,130
That is a problem though.

66
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,302
Should I have a word
with that brat for you?

67
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:40,845
Jeongnyeon.

68
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,139
You should worry about yourself.

69
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,642
You didn't get to read a single line
during the read-through today.

70
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,895
That was because we prioritized the leads
since we didn't have time.

71
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,980
You're so naive.

72
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,775
Let's say we have
all the time in the world.

73
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,860
You think they'll ever
prioritize your role?

74
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:00,114
Performances are all about the leads.

75
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:05,119
So you should have auditioned
for a bigger role.

76
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,041
What do you know?

77
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:15,630
I had my reasons for taking the soldier.

78
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:20,093
I wanted to analyze
the performance as a whole,

79
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,304
so I took a smaller role on purpose, okay?

80
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,223
Oh my, is that so?

81
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,102
You say that,
but think of the audience.

82
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,312
They'll be sure to remember
Youngseo or Jooran,

83
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,106
but the moment they leave the theater,

84
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,192
they'll immediately forget
about your tiny little role.

85
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,361
Should we go?

86
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,530
All right, that's enough.

87
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,490
Let's go. Come on, Chorok.

88
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,574
But why?

89
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,829
Why, that little…

90
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,124
Of course she's got to ruin my day.

91
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,460
What's wrong with my role, huh?

92
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,174
Every role is important in a performance.

93
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,218
You're right.

94
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,638
You'll be able to find your own soldier
and wow the audience again.

95
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,266
Right.

96
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,977
I just need to show everyone
my own soldier.

97
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,939
You poor, pretty little thing.

98
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,318
Deliver this letter
to Princess Mokryeon in secret.

99
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,787
You're going to put me in my place?

100
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,874
Let's see who actually gets to do that.

101
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,793
Who knows?

102
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,503
Maybe one day…

103
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,884
I'll stand in front of you.

104
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,561
My dear Precious,

105
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,772
you are as pretty as ever.

106
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,859
If it wasn't for Mokryeon,
I would have you as my concubine.

107
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,570
Such vile words!

108
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,791
You are as pretty as ever.

109
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,253
If it wasn't for Mokryeon,
I would have you as my concubine.

110
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,756
Such vile words!

111
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,133
Gomigeol.

112
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,221
You may be the chancellor of Han,
but I despise you.

113
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,723
No, that's not it.

114
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,768
Such vile words!

115
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,271
No, I shouldn't sound too repulsed.

116
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,691
I have to show Precious's inner conflict.

117
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,904
Such vile words!

118
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,907
Why is Precious conflicted?

119
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,326
Youngseo.

120
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,120
I was just…

121
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,581
I wasn't trying to bother you.

122
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,666
It's fine.

123
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,001
Why is Precious conflicted?

124
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,631
It's natural for Precious
to be repulsed by Gomigeol.

125
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,801
He's using her weakness
to his own advantage.

126
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,306
So why would she feel conflicted
after hearing such words from Gomigeol?

127
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,391
That's because…

128
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,354
she might know in her head

129
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,107
that she shouldn't listen
to anything Gomigeol says,

130
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,319
but what he's suggesting is too tempting.

131
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:31,868
And she may say
that she despises Gomigeol,

132
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,914
but I think
she's secretly quite attracted to him.

133
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,583
Why?

134
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,918
Because he resembles her too much.

135
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,003
In what way?

136
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,216
Gomigeol is a chancellor
who wields a lot of power,

137
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,678
but Precious is just a spy.

138
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,389
They're both twisted in their own sense

139
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,974
because they weren't loved.

140
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,732
Sorry for bothering you.

141
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,275
I'll get out of your hair.

142
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,194
Did you find yours?

143
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,071
Find what?

144
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,366
Did you find your own Precious?

145
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,868
And…

146
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,538
are you ready to be perfect on stage?

147
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,332
Perfect?

148
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,958
Not at all.

149
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,129
I wanted to practice with you

150
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,423
because I wasn't ready yet.

151
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:33,679
Aren't you anxious if you don't know
how to portray your character yet?

152
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,389
I am anxious.

153
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,100
But I'm also excited.

154
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:44,857
I might be able to find my own Precious
that others have never seen before.

155
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,569
You're excited?

156
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:52,240
Uh, but you probably function differently
from how I do.

157
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,699
You're a perfectionist.

158
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,370
You don't want
to show anyone your character

159
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,413
unless you're sure
you've gotten it down perfectly.

160
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,333
I get it.

161
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,630
So I can wait
until you feel totally ready.

162
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,758
Goodnight then.

163
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,052
Let's practice together starting tomorrow.

164
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,265
I mean, we'll have to practice…

165
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,934
sooner or later.

166
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,021
Okay.

167
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,030
He runs into the palace
and sees Princess Mokryeon…

168
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,032
It's happening, Jeongnyeon!

169
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,202
- Hmm?
- Youngseo wants to practice together.

170
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,455
Really? That's amazing!

171
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,503
- But I'm kind of worried.
- Hmm?

172
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,089
You've seen it
during our trainee performance.

173
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,342
Youngseo doesn't listen to her partner

174
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,011
and tries to steer things her way.

175
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,596
Then I'll follow her lead.

176
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,682
The role that needs to stand out
in our scenes

177
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,851
is Gomigeol anyway.

178
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,645
Gomigeol needs to stand out?

179
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,940
Then what about you?

180
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,900
Precious is an important role too.

181
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:15,281
I think Precious is a supporting role
that helps Gomigeol stand out.

182
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:19,243
{\an8}The main antagonist needs to stand out
for the whole performance to go well.

183
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,328
Wow.

184
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,121
You're amazing.

185
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,999
It's your first time taking a big role,

186
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,293
and you want to make
your partner stand out.

187
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,128
My goodness.

188
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:33,257
That brat Youngseo is lucky to have you.

189
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,391
Auntie!

190
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,812
This is so pretty.

191
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,147
Is that pretty?

192
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,232
Should we try it on?

193
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,402
- Let's go.
- Are you Moon Okgyeong?

194
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,487
Oh, yes.

195
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,197
- Oh, my goodness!
- I knew it!

196
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,823
Okgyeong!

197
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,617
I want your autograph too!

198
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,535
Let's go in, Eunjae.

199
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,955
- Thank you so much.
- Let's go in.

200
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,086
Over here!

201
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,505
Okgyeong! Hyerang!

202
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,092
- You're so pretty!
- Oh, my goodness!

203
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,722
Look at them.
They even follow us out here.

204
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,312
Should we have gone to a vacation home?

205
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,690
It's okay.

206
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,692
They're doing it because they love us.

207
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,490
And Eunjae is just happy
because all three of us are out together.

208
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,326
She did have to spend
a lot of time alone lately

209
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,036
because we've been so busy.

210
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,871
I wish you'd spend
half as much time with us

211
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,748
as you do with your friends.

212
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,959
Okay.

213
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,502
I'll make more time from now on.

214
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,547
You're so pretty!

215
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,717
Really? It's a promise.

216
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,510
Okay.

217
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,143
The day of the Jamyunggo audition…

218
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,148
Jeongnyeon was apparently
stuck inside the prop room all night.

219
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,400
Is that so?

220
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,653
The door must have been stuck.

221
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,449
There's no way
someone locked her in on purpose.

222
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,161
Yeah.

223
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,913
I hope you're right.

224
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,501
I think I'll be really sad
if someone did lock her in on purpose.

225
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,715
What?

226
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,969
My dear Precious,

227
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,346
you are as pretty as ever.

228
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,684
If it wasn't for Mokryeon,
I would have you as my concubine.

229
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,817
What's your take on my Gomigeol?

230
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,529
Uh… can I be honest with you?

231
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,531
The reason why I showed this to you…

232
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,743
is to hear your honest opinion.

233
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,662
It's good,

234
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,791
but it doesn't feel like you.

235
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,169
It felt like I was watching
Doaeng's Gomigeol.

236
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,258
I heard your portrayal of Gomigeol
during the audition

237
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,344
was completely different from Doaeng's.

238
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,179
But the audience…

239
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,682
might not like my portrayal.

240
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,062
You may be right.

241
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,981
But we're just practicing right now.

242
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,192
We can experiment and fail
as much as we like.

243
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,947
What kind of person is your Gomigeol?

244
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,532
He's a stone-cold strategist.

245
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,703
If there's something he wants,
he doesn't make the move himself

246
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,789
but always manipulates others
to do his will.

247
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,793
Just as he manipulates Precious

248
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,837
to split Prince Hodong
and Princess Mokryeon apart.

249
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,798
Precious knows
that she's being manipulated,

250
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,009
but she has no other choice.

251
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,556
For her, this might be her only chance.

252
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,432
That's foolish of her.

253
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,059
You're right.

254
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,727
She's blinded by love.

255
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:20,067
But isn't that what happens
when someone's in love?

256
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,445
They know they're being unreasonable,

257
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,199
but they just can't help it.

258
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,464
Dear Precious.

259
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,765
Have you heard
that Mokryeon and Hodong are to be wed?

260
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,768
They are nothing but rumors.

261
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,689
You poor,

262
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,817
pretty little thing.

263
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,948
Deliver this letter
to Princess Mokryeon in secret.

264
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,658
I desire to have Mokryeon, and you…

265
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,912
desire to have Prince Hodong.

266
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,168
If you deliver this letter…

267
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,089
the two will never be able to wed.

268
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,356
You're amazing.

269
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,358
What?

270
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,568
You were completely different just now.

271
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,237
This is your Gomigeol, Youngseo!

272
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,198
Didn't you feel it too?

273
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,036
My heart was pounding so much.

274
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,581
I need to practice more.

275
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,209
Let's go again.

276
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,628
All right, think about being hungry.

277
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,254
You're absolutely starving.

278
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,633
How can anyone expect us
to fight in battle

279
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,303
when we are all absolutely starving?

280
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,391
Something's missing.

281
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,810
- Jeongnyeon.
- Yes?

282
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,229
We need to measure you for your costume.

283
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,147
Come to the main meeting room
tomorrow evening.

284
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,524
Okay.

285
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,320
Wait, Doaeng!

286
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,119
I do not go to battle for the king.

287
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:40,749
I go to battle for my family
back in my hometown!

288
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,088
How was it?

289
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,508
I don't feel any genuine emotion.

290
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,386
And your tone is too high.

291
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,097
So you think so too.

292
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,182
I knew something was wrong.

293
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,394
I need to portray
the soldier's desperation

294
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,731
of being in a war
where he could die at any moment.

295
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,650
But I have no idea how.

296
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:11,697
That's true too,
but your voice is too high and unstable.

297
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,909
I didn't notice when you played Bangja
because he was a playful character,

298
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,453
but it's pretty clear now.

299
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,830
All right.

300
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,166
The soldier is a male.

301
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,836
Anyone in the audience

302
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,797
should be able to tell that you're a man.

303
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,841
But…

304
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,594
Okgyeong told me

305
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,889
not to get too hung up on the fact
that I'm portraying a man.

306
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,182
Hey.

307
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,935
That only works for her
because she was born to play male roles.

308
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,482
She already knows
how to make women fall for her

309
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,443
without consciously thinking about it
in her acting.

310
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,196
But you're not at that level yet.

311
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,948
You're right.

312
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,828
You'll need to work your butt off
to even reach the tip of her shadow.

313
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,707
Work hard

314
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,085
if you don't want
to lose your place like me.

315
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,005
What?

316
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,760
It's just… you said it so casually.

317
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,306
I knew I wouldn't get the role
from the start.

318
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,477
I can't possibly beat Youngseo
with my singing.

319
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,272
But you're the best
when it comes to playing the antagonist.

320
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,483
I was making up
for what I lacked in singing

321
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,068
with acting and dancing.

322
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:36,365
But hard work can only do so much
against natural talent.

323
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,868
And that's the cold world of artists.

324
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,830
Even so…

325
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,874
The director's your aunt,
and she's too hard on you.

326
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,293
I'd be so bitter if I were you.

327
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,798
She doesn't owe me anything
just because I'm her niece.

328
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,677
I have no regrets since I did my best.

329
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:02,766
And I'm also excited to see
how Youngseo will portray Gomigeol.

330
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,570
Have you guys seen Jeongnyeon?

331
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,988
I can't find her anywhere.

332
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,949
She's in the prop room.

333
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,284
The prop room?

334
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,876
Jeongnyeon!

335
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,420
Oh! I'm here!

336
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,717
- What are you up to?
- Hey.

337
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,136
I'm looking for a costume for my role.

338
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,097
But the costume team
is probably making it for you.

339
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,682
Not that costume.

340
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,684
Oh my.

341
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,270
All right.

342
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,986
This is it.

343
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,951
How do I look?

344
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,245
Do I look like a male student?

345
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,330
You do.

346
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,956
It suits you.

347
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,835
Are you trying
to act like a man with this?

348
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,128
Yeah.

349
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:17,466
I felt like it wasn't enough for me
to keep poring over the script all day.

350
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,760
I'm going to go in town
and try it out directly.

351
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,514
But for some reason, this feels weird.

352
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,974
I'm a bit embarrassed.

353
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,560
I feel like everyone
will be able to tell that I'm a girl.

354
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,272
You can't do that.
The basis of good acting is confidence.

355
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,566
Wait here.

356
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,490
Come here.

357
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:52,459
From now on, you're a male student
who goes to an all-male high school.

358
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,712
Right, I'm no longer Yoon Jeongnyeon,

359
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,923
but Yoon Jeong… sik.

360
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,062
Ouch! Oh, I'm sorry.

361
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,818
No. Remember, you're Yoon Jeongsik.

362
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,266
Oh, right. Here you go.

363
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,185
Let's go!

364
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,490
Oh, my goodness.

365
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,493
- Goodness me.
- Let me help you, ma'am.

366
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,287
Please sit here.

367
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,205
Thank you, child.

368
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,582
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

369
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,833
It's nothing.

370
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,634
You're such a pretty boy.

371
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,219
- Sorry?
- How old are you?

372
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,181
I'm 19, ma'am.

373
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,892
Oh my, you're the same age
as my granddaughter.

374
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,102
You're so well-mannered.

375
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,896
I'd love to have you as a grandson-in-law.

376
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,023
My goodness.

377
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,651
Are you sure he's a boy?

378
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,111
What are you talking about?

379
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,571
He's like a girl.

380
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,907
Boys these days

381
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,118
don't know what it means to be a man.

382
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,829
Why would you say such a thing?

383
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,331
- I'm just saying.
- Can I get off?

384
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,957
Look at him yourself.

385
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,502
I'll get off here, sir!

386
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,764
Is this all you've got?

387
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,852
Hey, are we going to the bakery today?

388
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,521
I'm broke.

389
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,066
- Do you ever have any money?
- What did you say?

390
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,526
Hey, hey. Don't.

391
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,117
What are you talking about?

392
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,204
Come on, find some.

393
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,545
Hey, you.

394
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,380
Come here.

395
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,590
What is it?

396
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,926
You got a problem?

397
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,387
Would you look at this punk?

398
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,142
I guess you do have a problem!

399
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,451
Oh!

400
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,585
- Where'd he go?
- Find him!

401
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,669
Over there!

402
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,172
Where the hell is he?

403
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,256
Over there!

404
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,267
Gosh, I was just trying to learn
how to act like a man.

405
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,770
But this is going to get me killed.

406
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,691
You there.

407
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,027
- What are you doing here?
- Are… you…

408
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,199
Are you talking to me?

409
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,868
I've never seen you before.
What are you doing here?

410
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,622
Could I have some food?

411
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,916
"Let's aid our wounded soldiers"

412
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,626
"Korean Military Police Aid Soup Kitchen"

413
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,629
I'm here to volunteer for that.

414
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:10,592
I wanted to do something
to thank our soldiers

415
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,135
for serving our country.

416
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,972
How thoughtful of you.

417
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,150
- We'd like more soup.
- Yes? More soup?

418
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,655
- More soup, please.
- Here you go.

419
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,993
Here you go.

420
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,703
Be careful, it's hot.

421
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,539
Hey!

422
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,916
- Yes?
- Come and have a bite.

423
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,293
Yes, ma'am!

424
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,463
Could I pour you one?

425
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,173
- Why not?
- Hand me that bowl.

426
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,510
How old are you?

427
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,095
I'm 19, sir.

428
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,179
- My goodness.
- Oh my.

429
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,098
- You're still so young.
- You are.

430
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,977
How old were you when you went out to war?

431
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,814
I think I was about 18 at the time.

432
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,274
You were so young.

433
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,484
You must have been so scared.

434
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,486
Oh, yes, I was very scared.

435
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,447
I cried every night
because I missed my mother.

436
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,953
Ah, both the Lieutenant
and Sergeant Park over here

437
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,248
volunteered in the war as female soldiers.

438
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,332
What?

439
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,169
I never knew that women also volunteered.

440
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,839
I was studying education
before entering the force.

441
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:36,094
And Sergeant Park was already engaged
when she joined.

442
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,762
Weren't you scared?

443
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,184
I think I might've regretted volunteering.

444
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,478
I've never regretted it.

445
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,149
Isn't that so, Lieutenant?

446
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,278
Someone had to go and fight.

447
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,242
I heard that…

448
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,748
there are
still lots of unidentified bodies

449
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,500
left on the battlefield.

450
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,419
You're right.

451
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,298
We still haven't found
the bodies of some of my comrades.

452
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,386
We need to find them
and give them a proper burial…

453
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,139
one of these days.

454
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,646
It's a good day to drink!

455
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,523
I feel like singing a song.

456
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,192
Oh!

457
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,860

Father! Father!

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,169
Father!

470
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,700
Were you waiting for me?

471
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,744
Why would you wait out here?

472
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:11,124
Jamyunggo

473
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,001
What's this?

474
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,879
They're tickets to our troupe's
Jamyunggo performance.

475
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,549
{\an8}I'm playing the main antagonist
and not the lead,

476
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,761
{\an8}but it's my first official performance
playing a major role.

477
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,513
I hope you'll be there.

478
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,683
And is this performance worth my time?

479
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,143
Yes.

480
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,978
I worked really hard on this.

481
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,899
How hard you worked doesn't matter.

482
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,734
What matters is whether you're the best.

483
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,153
Please come and judge for yourself.

484
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,573
If you don't like my performance,

485
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,951
I won't ask you
to come to another show ever again.

486
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,583
All right.

487
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,555
Ah, I heard last time

488
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,475
that there was an issue
with the trainee allowance.

489
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,602
Ah!

490
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,980
We fixed up the dormitories last year,

491
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,690
and it took a lot of our budget.

492
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:21,027
So we had to decrease
their allowances just a tiny bit.

493
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,155
I guess that was uncomfortable for them.

494
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,450
The leads may earn a lot of money,

495
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:33,164
but the only income for the trainees
is the allowances from the troupe.

496
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,043
I know it's hard,
but please take care of them.

497
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,294
Of course, ma'am.

498
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:42,423
I'll take care of these tiny details,

499
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,677
so you don't have to worry about a thing.

500
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,305
More importantly,

501
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,934
here is the budget plan
for the Jamyunggo production.

502
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,144
Please take a look.

503
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,192
We were trying to cater
to all of your requests,

504
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,320
so we went a little over budget.

505
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,866
We could save a bit on costumes and props.

506
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,828
If we reuse the costumes
from last production...

507
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,163
We need to remake
all the leads' costumes from scratch.

508
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:18,293
We're revitalizing everything
for this production,

509
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,087
from the script to the stage itself.

510
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:26,134
We need to show the audience
that every little detail has been renewed.

511
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,970
Then I'm afraid

512
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:33,641
we'll have to go
a lot more over budget than anticipated.

513
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,144
Hmm.

514
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,021
Then, Director,

515
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,398
how about we move this production

516
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,360
from the International Theater
to Daehan Theater?

517
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,822
All of a sudden?

518
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,782
The owner of Daehan Theater said

519
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:55,622
they'd split the ticket sales 7:3
if we move our production there.

520
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,459
And of course, we'd take the 7.

521
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:04,005
Since we're splitting sales 6:4
with the International Theater,

522
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,090
Daehan Theater
would be a much better deal.

523
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,052
7:3 is a really good offer.

524
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:13,056
Apparently, most theaters demand
half the ticket sales from other troupes.

525
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,182
Huh.

526
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,023
- It's a good suggestion…
- Yes.

527
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:26,277
…but the stage in Daehan is way too small

528
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,030
to handle
the scale of our current production.

529
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,241
Then could we perhaps…

530
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:38,665
reduce the scale for this production?

531
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,335
You're telling me to fit the production
to the stage size?

532
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,796
That's unthinkable.

533
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,798
Mr. Ko.

534
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,342
Earning money is obviously important.

535
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,762
But we need
to keep our priorities straight.

536
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,892
That old hag.

537
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,938
She's driving me nuts.

538
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,440
She has no idea how the world works.

539
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,235
Does she still think
Maeran is as big as it once was?

540
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,905
Getting 70% of the ticket sales
is a great offer.

541
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,827
Daehan Theater offered you
something in return, didn't they?

542
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,371
What are you talking about?

543
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,332
You're going to lie to me too?

544
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,169
You think I'm doing this for my own good?

545
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,631
In the end,
this is all for the benefit of the troupe.

546
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,928
What does the director know
about the business side of the troupe?

547
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,181
All she cares about
is her high and mighty pride as an artist.

548
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,602
Without me,
Maeran would have fallen apart long ago.

549
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,981
You know how stubborn she can be.

550
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,816
She doesn't care about the numbers.

551
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:50,236
She's even put the troupe's pride
on the line with this production,

552
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,821
so she's never going to compromise.

553
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,239
Pride won't keep her troupe alive.

554
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,992
She needs to wake up to reality.

555
00:33:56,075 --> 00:34:00,163
Nowadays, other troupes aren't earning
half as much as they used to.

556
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,331
The only reason
why we're still above the water

557
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,876
is because we have Moon Okgyeong.

558
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,504
If we can't make enough sales,
how are we going to pay her?

559
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,381
And if we can't pay her,

560
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,383
you think she's going to stay in Maeran?

561
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,677
My goodness.

562
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,724
Let's talk after we're done
with this production.

563
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,018
If the director
is going to be that stubborn,

564
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,979
then Maeran won't last long.

565
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,731
You should think about your future too.

566
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,399
The only way to survive on a sinking ship

567
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,277
is to jump off as soon as you can.

568
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,155
This is crazy.

569
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,991
She drives me nuts.

570
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,995
Oh! Oh!

571
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,540
It's not them.

572
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,210
Excuse me!
Could you give this to Hyerang?

573
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,711
And this is for Okgyeong!

574
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,132
Oh, no.

575
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,594
Hey!

576
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,305
How could you step on my bouquet?

577
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,681
You need to apologize.

578
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,267
You little brats…

579
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,770
Do your parents know
you're out here like this?

580
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,856
Why mention our parents
when you're the one in the wrong?

581
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,942
You want to start with me?

582
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,693
How dare you talk back to me?

583
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,028
That's enough.

584
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,742
What the…

585
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,453
Who are you to butt in?

586
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,538
Good grief.

587
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,085
Why are you yelling at these girls

588
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,963
when you're the one in the wrong?

589
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,256
For goodness' sake.

590
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,049
You have pride as a man, is that it?

591
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,051
You want to be a little hero
to these brats?

592
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,555
Just mind your own business
and get on your way

593
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,473
before I embarrass the heck out of you.

594
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:45,852
Listen here.

595
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,104
I'm not going to be schooled

596
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,106
by some man-child who's not grown enough…

597
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,483
to admit to his own faults.

598
00:35:55,528 --> 00:36:00,032
You want to see
who's going to get embarrassed?

599
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,540
What are you looking at?

600
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,959
I can't take this crap.

601
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,254
Just my luck today, huh?

602
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,675
Oh, come on!

603
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,896
Are you all okay?

604
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,690
Thank you. You were so cool!

605
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:37,445
I didn't know chivalry still existed.

606
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,197
What's your name?
And what school do you go to?

607
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,615
I've never seen that uniform.

608
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,658
Wait, I know you.

609
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,037
Bangja! You were Bangja, right?

610
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,206
You're a trainee in Maeran Gukgeukdan!

611
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,541
Yes, I am.

612
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,546
I really thought you were a boy.

613
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,257
- Did you?
- Yes, I did!

614
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,301
Are you also in the Jamyunggo production?

615
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,886
Yes.

616
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,679
We'll be sure to come!

617
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,223
- We will, right?
- Of course!

618
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,733
I wish Jooran had seen this!

619
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,530
Now that I think about it…

620
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:27,286
is her practice going all right?

621
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:33,209
That Youngseo is probably being
super hard on her.

622
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,260
Instead of looking at Hodong directly,

623
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,637
I think it'd be better to avert your eyes.

624
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,889
That might be a better portrayal

625
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,393
since Precious has to hide her feelings
in this scene.

626
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,769
Great point.

627
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,229
Let me try again.

628
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,194
You're hurt, Precious.

629
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:07,243
This is nothing
compared to the pain of my country.

630
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,787
Wow.

631
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,998
- How was that?
- That was a lot better.

632
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,124
Really?

633
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,543
It's all thanks to you.

634
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,628
Thanks for helping out
when it's not even your scene.

635
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,422
It's nothing.

636
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,009
You helped me a lot too.

637
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,971
- Let's try another scene.
- Sure.

638
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,557
Mm…

639
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,810
How about we pick up
where we left off until here?

640
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,688
Let's do that. And today…

641
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,734
What is this?

642
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,902
I had nothing to worry about.

643
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:53,372
When did they get that close anyway?

644
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,718
It's a brand new Jamyunggo production

645
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,718
It's a brand new Jamyunggo production

646
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,844
by Maeran Gukgeukdan!

647
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,221
The prince of gukgeuk, Moon Okgyeong,

648
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,015
and the beautiful Seo Hyerang

649
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,976
will be appearing
in this new production by Maeran!

650
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,896
All seats are sold out

651
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,357
in this new Jamyunggo production!

652
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,403
Here, I replaced Gomigeol's fan
to fit your hand.

653
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,197
Thank you.

654
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,825
I see you've worked hard
to analyze your role.

655
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,995
I wanted to analyze as much as I could

656
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,747
even if I won't get to use
everything on stage.

657
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,040
It'll be helpful anyway.

658
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,542
I like the energy,
but don't stand out too much.

659
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,754
We've got 30 minutes. Wrap up, everyone!

660
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,214
Yes, ma'am!

661
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,465
Everyone.

662
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,552
Thank you for pouring everything you had
into this production.

663
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:54,392
Let's show them everything we've got
without any regrets!

664
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,476
Yes, ma'am!

665
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,566
During the time
when Goguryeo and Nakrang were at war,

666
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,360
Nakrang had a magical drum
called Jamyunggo

667
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,946
that played itself
whenever danger was near.

668
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:10,282
Because of this, Goguryeo's plan
to take over Nakrang failed.

669
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,159
Meanwhile, Goguryeo's Prince Hodong

670
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,830
vows to tear apart
Nakrang's Jamyunggo for his country.

676
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,442
Look.

677
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,819
The children are singing.

678
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,572
How merry.

679
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:37,745
This is all thanks to our great king.

680
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,747
Enough!

681
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:46,337

You're so cool!

690
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,748
Prince Hodong, Precious has returned.

691
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,629
Your Precious has returned
from her espionage mission.

692
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,923
I have found out
that the Jamyunggo was protected

693
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,800
by the princess of Nakrang, Mokryeon.

694
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:41,225

Are you hurt?

707
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:46,081
This is nothing
compared to the pain of my country.

708
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,344
Precious.

709
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,512
I shall not forget

710
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,098
what you have done for your country.

00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,992
My prince.

712
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:27,998
She is daydreaming again.

713
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,001
You are but a humble servant

714
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:35,089
while he is the prince
of the great Goguryeo.

715
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:39,718
Do you think he will ever have
any desire for the likes of you?

716
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,430
What you say is true.

717
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,601
But it is all right.

718
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,020
If he embraces me once in a while
like he did just now,

719
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,565
I have nothing more to want in the world.

That's interesting.

What is?

733
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,653
Her singing isn't amazing.

734
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,655
Her breath is short
and her tone isn't refined.

735
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,949

All right, you guys are next.

768
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,864
Did you see Youngseo trembling?

769
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,032
Yeah.

770
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,451
I guess she also gets nervous.

771
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,142
Mokryeon and Hodong have promised to wed?

772
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,103
That won't do. That simply won't do.

773
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,065
Goguryeo and Nakrang
are to remain enemies.

774
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,902
They need to keep fighting
and wear each other down

775
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,820
for the great Han…

776
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,158
to strike both at the same time.

777
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,579
Things will be bad
if they form an alliance.

778
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,207
What should be done about this?

779
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,352
Precious.

780
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,236
My dear Precious,

781
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,572
you are as pretty as ever.

782
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,952
If it wasn't for Mokryeon,
I would have you as my concubine.

783
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,205
Such vile words!

784
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,250
Gomigeol.

785
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,503
You may be the chancellor of Han,
but I despise you.

786
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,839
Dear Precious.

787
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,800
Have you heard
that Mokryeon and Hodong are to be wed?

788
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,892
They are nothing but rumors.

789
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,355
You poor,

790
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,441
pretty little thing.

791
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,907
Deliver this letter
to Princess Mokryeon in secret.

792
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,576
I desire to have Mokryeon, and you…

793
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,537
desire to have Prince Hodong.

794
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,583
If you deliver this letter…

795
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,504
the two will never be able to wed.

796
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,489
I didn't know
Gomigeol could be played that way.

797
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,700
- He's so cool.
- I know, he's so attractive!

798
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,619
I might fall for him.

799
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,757
I think Youngseo did
even better than usual.

800
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,760
I didn't know Jooran could act like that.

801
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,096
It's like they're…

802
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,639
Like they're…

803
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,559
- Like they're possessed, right?
- Yes.

804
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:50,398
I never knew those two
could have such chemistry.

805
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,985
They're bringing out
the best in each other.

806
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,614

811
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,984
Provisions are running short,

812
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,695
so they are only able to give us
one meal a day.

813
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:44,369
I wonder how my parents are faring
back at home.

814
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,121
I am worried sick for them.

815
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,957
Jeongnyeon's doing well.

816
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,584
Yes, she is.

817
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,378
She's actually doing too well.

818
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,632
- What?
- She's supposed to be a simple soldier.

819
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,259
How can anyone expect us
to fight in battle

820
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,720
when we are all absolutely starving?

821
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,305
She must feel challenged…

822
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,892
since she saw how Youngseo was earlier.

823
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,732
Watch what you say.
Someone might hear you.

824
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,904
Then let them hear!

825
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:23,325
I do not go to battle for the king.

826
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,994
I go to battle

827
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:31,208
for my family back in my hometown!

828
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,002
Hear, hear!

829
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,712
- Hear, hear!
- You're right!

830
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:36,880
That's right!

831
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,715
Hear, hear!

836
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,819
- Yes?
- Don't try so hard.

837
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,613
Oh…

838
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:05,784
But don't I have to do my best
for the audience?

839
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,202
Get out of your head.

840
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,789
The audience is not here
to see you tonight.

841
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:13,250
You'll disrupt the flow of the show
if you stand out too much.

842
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,751
Try to blend in, will you?

843
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,004
Yes, ma'am.

844
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,881
Pilsun and Geumhui too.

845
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,758
Make sure to stick to the script.

846
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,052
We don't need any impromptu reactions.

847
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,720
Yes, ma'am.

848
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,056
You may go.

849
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,937

854
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,745

Thank you for agreeing to this matrimony.

858
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,289
I have no doubt

859
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:20,085
that this marriage will fortify
Han and Nakrang's relations.

860
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,503
With this,

861
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,465
Goguryeo will no longer dare
to invade Nakrang anymore.

862
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,425
I agree with you, Chancellor.

863
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,760
I hear…

864
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,639
that the Princess of Nakrang
is so skilled at dancing

865
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,975
that she even puts goddesses to shame.

866
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,062
May I request to see it myself?

867
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,688
Of course.

868
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,399
Mokryeon.

869
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:47,445
How about a dance for the chancellor
on such a joyous day?

870
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,959
Father!

871
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,629
I have committed a grave sin!

872
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:05,922
What are you speaking of?

873
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,934
General!

874
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,602
The soldiers of Goguryeo…

875
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,565
You're right.

876
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,776
We still haven't found
the bodies of some of my comrades.

877
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:32,115
We need to find them
and give them a proper burial

878
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,075
one of these days.

879
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,390
General!

880
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,642
Please flee the palace!

881
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,187
I regret to inform you

882
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:06,274
that the soldiers of Goguryeo
have reached the palace gates!

883
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,669
My goodness! What are you going to do?

884
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:30,423
Don't just stand there, soldier!
Do something!

885
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:34,761
Yes, don't just stand there! Sing a song!

886
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,222
- Sing a song!

Jeongnyeon: The Star Is Born

907
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:45,850
{\an8}Yoon Jeongnyeon?

908
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,560
{\an8}She's been gifted by the heavens,

909
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,728
{\an8}so it can't be helped

910
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,897
{\an8}that her starting point is different.

911
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,816
{\an8}Teach me how to sing like you.

912
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,402
{\an8}You are not allowed
on stage starting tomorrow.

913
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,696
{\an8}But what did I do wrong?

914
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,157
{\an8}- Jeongnyeon!
- The audience had to focus on the show,

915
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,409
{\an8}and not on you, an extra!

916
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,329
{\an8}Maybe this is as far as Jeongnyeon can go.

917
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,122
{\an8}Then it's really no fun.

918
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:11,084
{\an8}I swear to never come back here.
