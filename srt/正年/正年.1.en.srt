It's freezing, isn't it?

25
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,316
Put this on.

26
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,027
Here.

27
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,038
All right.

28
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,626
There you go.

29
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,508
She would like you to come in.

30
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,054
Let's go.

31
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,109
<i>It's been so long.</i>

32
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,444
What have you been up to?

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,530
Well…

34
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,824
nothing much.

35
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,828
We've just been wandering about
here and there.

36
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,917
I don't have anything saved up…

37
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,754
having devoted my life

38
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,008
to accompanying <i>pansori </i>performances.

39
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:59,053
And I'd be fine
living like that by myself.

40
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,347
But my daughter…

41
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,811
I couldn't bear to see my daughter…

42
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,691
suffer in the cold anymore.

43
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,695
So if you could perhaps…

44
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,616
let us stay a while…

45
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,205
Of course I will.

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,374
You should have come to me sooner.

47
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,168
You were foolish not to.

48
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,963
Thank you so much.

49
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,805
You have a strong look about you.

50
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,141
What's your name?

51
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,810
Chae Gongseon.

52
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,397
Would you like to go to school?

53
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,693
Nowadays, even girls can go to school.

54
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,572
I heard you teach <i>pansori.</i>

55
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,658
I'd like to learn how to sing.

56
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,912
Nonsense.

57
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,957
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

58
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,169
You want to learn <i>pansori?</i>

59
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,254
Yes.

60
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:19,342
I want to become
a famous <i>pansori </i>singer like you.

61
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,510
Quiet.

62
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,179
Watch what you say.

63
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,140
Why do you want to learn <i>pansori?</i>

64
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,184
Is it so that you can wear nice clothes

65
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,479
and do nothing but sing all your life?

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,942
Whenever I sing,

67
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,611
I just feel this huge release inside me.

68
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,779
I love it.

69
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,992
You feel a huge release, you say?

70
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,493
Yes.

71
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,122
You're still so young,

72
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,916
and you've already felt such things?

73
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,004
Whenever I'm frustrated or lonely,

74
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,090
I feel as if something is blocked
within me.

75
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,968
But when I sing, it all goes away.

76
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:08,016
The path of an artist
doesn't always involve glory.

77
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,893
And for you to sing <i>pansori…</i>

78
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,231
you'll have to go through intense training

79
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:19,235
that will strain your throat to no end.

80
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,946
Do you still want to learn?

81
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:23,948
I do.

82
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,742
All right.

83
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,454
Then let's hear how good you are.

84
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,290
I will decide
whether to take you after that.

85
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,002
Sobok, bring the drum.

86
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,962
Yes, ma'am.

87
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:46,054

<i>Oh love, oh my love</i>

99
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:37,188

{\an8}But the tide's still out.

104
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,982
{\an8}I said let's go.

105
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,823
{\an8}You're leaving already, Jeongnyeon?

106
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,408
{\an8}Yeah.

107
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,411
{\an8}I knew your mother would get mad

108
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,079
as soon as you started humming along.

109
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,164
Go follow your mother.

110
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:40,376
I'll be back tomorrow,
so leave some for me.

111
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,711
Hurry up!

112
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,714
I'm coming.

113
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,632
She's so angry.

114
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,014
All right, I won't.

115
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,975
I won't sing.

116
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,231
Come on, let's go.

117
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,108
Jungja must be waiting.

118
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,408
Have you read this?

119
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,452
They're really praising
our Maeran Gukgeukdan.

120
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,162
"Tickets sold out
for Maeran Gukgeukdan's performance"

121
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,373
They're calling you
the Crown Prince of female <i>gukgeuk.</i>

122
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,338
Okgyeong.

123
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,049
Why are you so down?

124
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,301
It's no fun.

125
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,094
What is?

126
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,388
Everything.

127
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,559
Acting isn't as fun as it used to be.

128
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,146
You're just too worn out from the tour.

129
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,856
You'll feel better after some rest.

130
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,617
Hey, Jeongnyeon!

131
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,285
- Jeongnyeon, you're here!
- Yeah!

132
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,623
Oh, that's new.

133
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,625
- Hey, Jeongnyeon.
- Hey.

134
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,877
- Have you eaten?
- Not yet.

135
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,921
Jungja! Goodness!

136
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,673
Oh, my goodness!

137
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,007
Good work.

138
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,927
Oh my, this is heavy.

139
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,095
My goodness.

140
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,138
You dug up so many.

141
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,349
The more we sell,
the more money we get.

142
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,269
- Girls.
- Yes?

143
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,479
I'm heading out to work in the field.

144
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:28,401
Don't even think about singing
to gather customers, all right?

145
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,945
Goodness, look how dirty.

146
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,780
Did you hear me?

147
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,283
I heard you, okay?

148
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,662
See you later.

149
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,876
But seriously…

150
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,172
One song will get enough customers
to sell everything.

151
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,841
Such a waste.

152
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,468
You love money that much, huh?

153
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,306
- You want me to bash your head in?
- But sir!

154
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,106
What's with this?

155
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,108
Here, take everything.

156
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,484
Your knives are dull.

157
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:16,157
It must be hard doing business out here.

158
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,159
If you had paid us more,

159
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,704
you would've had a better spot
instead of this dingy corner.

160
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,957
You're being so difficult.

161
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,257
This isn't enough money.

162
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,092
That's more than enough!

163
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,511
We've doubled the price
starting this month.

164
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,513
What are you staring at?

165
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,309
You've already taken a fortune from us.

166
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,810
If you double the price,

167
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,937
we'll end up starving to death!

168
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,524
Would you look at this brat, all riled up?

169
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,652
Whether you starve or not
is none of my business!

170
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,153
If you don't have the money to pay,

171
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,073
then go work at a bar or something
to make some.

172
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,452
You know what?

173
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,079
You're all grown up.

174
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,957
How about I recommend you
someplace nice

175
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,668
to make yourself useful?

176
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,047
Trash it! Damn it, that hurts.

177
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,965
Stop it! Our money!

178
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,301
I said stop it!

179
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,721
No, don't! My money!

180
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,772
I said stop!

00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:39,990
<i>From the top of Namwon Fortress</i>

183
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:44,995
<i>There are all kinds of birds aflight</i>

184
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,917
<i>And look, a lark </i>

185
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,336
- Let's go!
- That's it!

186
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,714
<i>The seagulls cry at the sunset</i>

187
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:59,301
<i>And the willow trees sway in the wind </i>

188
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,220
Let's go, Okgyeong.

189
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,557
<i>A pair of nightingales</i>

190
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,934
<i>Take flight to the mountains </i>

191
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,895
<i>Chirping</i>

192
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,022
Don't!

193
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,608
Don't cheer her on!

194
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:20,239
<i>Oh my love </i>

195
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:24,368
<i>Oh love, oh my love</i>

196
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:29,081
<i>You are my love</i>

197
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,584
- That was great!
- Amazing!

198
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,169
Stop clapping, you idiot.

199
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,797
Stop cheering.

200
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,799
Pay for the song!

201
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,009
What?

202
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:44,013
I don't sing for free, so pay up.

203
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,266
You said to work at a bar to make money.

204
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:50,853
I just sang for you, so pay up!

205
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,188
Oh, wow.

206
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,649
Is this scrawny young thing
kidding me right now?

207
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,068
Everyone!

208
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,529
Am I wrong?

209
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,116
- Of course not!
- Pay up!

210
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,161
She's right.

211
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,623
You have to pay
if you listened to her song.

212
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,208
- Yeah.
- Pay up.

213
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,667
- Why, you little…
- That's right.

214
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,963
And Jeongnyeon's singing is top quality.
So pay your fee.

215
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,341
You don't get a free concert.

216
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,093
Sir, let's go for today.

217
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,096
I can't believe this.
I'll see you next time.

218
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,724
- You have to pay up!
- Are you running away?

219
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,733
Okay, settle down.

220
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,903
Jeongnyeon,
one song wasn't enough.

221
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,615
We want to hear more. How about it?

222
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,493
- One more song.
- Go on, Jeongnyeon.

223
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,329
I can't believe this!

224
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,790
Our mother is going to kill her
if she hears this!

225
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,671
What are you saying?

226
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,006
Yes, I might die,
but I'm going to die rich.

227
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,096
The preview was free,

228
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,058
but if you want to hear more,
you'll have to pay up.

229
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,643
- Come on.
- Really?

230
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,019
My goodness.

231
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,397
We can't sell these.

232
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,399
But these fish are fine!

233
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,442
How about you buy these?

234
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,822
I'll buy them all.

235
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,452
- Who's that?
- Goodness.

236
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,873
- Oh my…
- How pretty.

237
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,333
You're buying all of these?

238
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,835
In return,

239
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,588
I want to hear a different song
than <i>Namwon Fortress.</i>

240
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,090
What would you like to hear?

241
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,550
- Jeongnyeon…
- It's fine.

242
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,802
Tell me what you want to hear.

243
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,096
Anything you're good at.

244
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,895
Then I'll sing you something
from <i>Chunhyangga.</i>

245
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,691
What are you waiting for?
Pack up the fish for the customer.

246
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,276
You can't!

247
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:14,955
<i>I want to go</i>

248
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:21,670
<i>I want to go </i>

249
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:27,509
<i>I want to follow </i>

250
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:33,015
<i>My love </i>

251
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:38,479
<i>Over the snowy hill </i>

252
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:43,025
<i>Even the wind struggles to go over </i>

253
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:49,949
<i>Even the clouds </i>

254
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:54,078
<i>Struggle to go over </i>

255
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:01,418
<i>Even the birds </i>

256
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:06,799
<i>All kinds of birds </i>

257
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,469
<i>Struggle to go over</i>

258
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,845
Nice.

259
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,098
We got some rice and meat.

260
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,809
This is great.

261
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,852
See?

262
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,398
I sold all those fish just by singing.

263
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,358
I'm telling you, singing makes money.

264
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,569
I'm glad we sold everything,

265
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,030
but I'm so worried Mother will find out.

266
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,118
She's not going to be happy if she hears.

267
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,999
How would she find out
if we keep our mouths shut?

268
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:43,794
You're right.

269
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,797
Hey, Namwon Fortress!

270
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:59,810
You're not going back
on buying all that fish, are you?

271
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,437
Don't even think about it.

272
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,065
Where did you learn <i>pansori?</i>

273
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,949
I don't have the time or money
to learn anything.

274
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,327
I was just mimicking others.

275
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,914
Yet you're able to use
<i>cheonguseong </i>so easily?

276
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,334
Unbelievable.

277
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,128
<i>Cheonguseong?</i> What's that?

278
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,796
You don't even know what it is?

279
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,798
I've never heard of it before.

280
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,009
Do you know what <i>gukgeuk </i>is?

281
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,137
Yes, I've heard of it.

282
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,641
It's where actors sing
and dance on stage, right?

283
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,688
They're tickets
to tomorrow night's performance.

284
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,856
Come and watch.

285
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,441
Jamyunggo Ticket

286
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,609
Make sure to be there.

287
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,529
Also, Namwon Fortress.

288
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,655
Yes?

289
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,823
What's your name?

290
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,034
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

291
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,994
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

292
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,624
I'll see you again.

293
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,469
I'd rather have money than tickets though.

294
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:20,474
What use are these paper scraps?

295
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,184
I think I've seen that face before.

296
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,771
Who? Him?

297
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,731
Where have I seen him?

298
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,361
I wouldn't forget such a distinctive face.

299
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,448
"Moon Okgyeong"?

300
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,534
"Maeran Gukgeukdan…"

301
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,956
It's Moon Okgyeong!

302
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,374
Who?

303
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,585
It's Moon Okgyeong from Maeran Gukgeukdan!

304
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,838
The star actor!

305
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,881
"Maeran Gukgeukdan"?

306
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,968
Didn't you see the performance posters
all around the neighborhood?

307
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:03,267
I guess her unique face
is what draws all the girls to her.

308
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,978
"Her"?

309
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,400
He's a… woman?

310
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,111
That's right.

311
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,407
Maeran Gukgeukdan
is an all-girls theater troupe.

312
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,869
My goodness.

313
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,413
Could I have
just one head of your kimchi?

314
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,333
My kimchi this year doesn't taste as good.

315
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,128
One head isn't going to be enough
for your family.

316
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,216
Here, have a lot.

317
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,511
Well then…

318
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,181
Let me have a taste.

319
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,058
Goodness!

320
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,020
But Yongrye,

321
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,398
your daughters aren't back yet?

322
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,901
They must still be at the marketplace.

323
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,863
You must be so proud of them.

324
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,282
They're such good kids
helping out at the market.

325
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,909
That's true for Jungja.

326
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,995
But Jeongnyeon isn't like her sister

327
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:08,081
and causes so much trouble,

328
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,834
always doing what I tell her not to do.

329
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,462
She's still a good girl.

330
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,549
And she sings so beautifully.

331
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,968
Everyone was amazed at the marketplace.

332
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,098
Did Jeongnyeon sing at the marketplace?

333
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,184
Oh, no.

334
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,019
We're home!

335
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,438
My goodness.

336
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,443
Mother, look at this.

337
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,197
Did you sing at the marketplace?

338
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,034
Well then, I'll be off.

339
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,620
Time to make dinner.

340
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,211
Nine.

341
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,633
Keep counting.

342
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,843
Ten.

343
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,930
You stubborn girl.

344
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,725
Not a sound from you, huh?

345
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,981
I told you not to sing, didn't I?

346
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,943
What are you, a performer? A courtesan?

347
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,071
Why do you keep singing
in front of people?

348
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,241
Those guys were causing trouble again.

349
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,450
I didn't have a choice!

350
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,202
Is that right?

351
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,539
You think they won't come back
just because you sang at them?

352
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:36,128
It was better than doing nothing like you.

353
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,798
I'm just using my talent to make money.

354
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,217
Why are you so against it?

355
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,928
We don't even have money for rice.

356
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,389
What's so wrong
about earning money by singing?

357
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,808
Is that so?

358
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,352
I've been too kind.

359
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:56,064
I'm going to shave you bald…

360
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,026
so you won't be able
to go out in public again.

361
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,028
All right, let's go.

362
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,446
Where are we going?

363
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,156
To the barber.

364
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,283
Let's go shave your head.

365
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,909
- Come.
- Wait!

366
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,331
Hold on. Mother!

367
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,249
I'm not going.

368
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,877
- Come on.
- I'm not going!

369
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,295
Oh my…

370
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,838
Get inside!

371
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,257
- Mother!
- Mother, no!

372
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,800
- Mother! Mother, no!
- Goodness!

373
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,219
Mother, calm down!

374
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,430
Please! Mother!

375
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,223
- Get back here!
- Mother, wait!

376
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,768
I think she got your point.

377
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,563
Is that why she keeps singing
when I tell her not to?

378
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,023
You're at fault too.

379
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,985
You were right there with her.
Why didn't you stop your sister?

380
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:46,406
She wasn't there when I was singing.
Don't blame her!

381
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,784
- That's just great.
- Quiet.

382
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,953
What great sisters you are!

383
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:56,208
How dare you speak back to me, you brat?

384
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,542
Mother! Mother!

385
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,627
- No! Mother!
- Come here!

386
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,711
Mother!

387
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,631
You're right. I'm sorry.

388
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,965
From now on,

389
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,843
I'll make sure
to keep her from singing ever again.

390
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,470
So please let her go for now.

391
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,055
Jeongnyeon's all grown up now.

392
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,848
If you shave off her hair…

393
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,561
…how is she going
to show her face in public?

394
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,646
Goodness gracious.

395
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,190
- Get up, Jeongnyeon.
- Goodness.

396
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,025
Tell her you're sorry.

397
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,861
I'm sorry.

398
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,032
And?

399
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,410
I'll never…

400
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,038
sing again.

401
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,170
Thank you, Mother.

402
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,721
What am I going to do with you?

403
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,683
You should have been begging
on your knees.

404
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,601
Why would you talk back to her?

405
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,689
Hey, you bring in the food.

406
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,567
Go on.

407
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,027
I will, all right?

408
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,169
Stop.

409
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,254
You at the end.

410
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,797
Minju.

411
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,841
- Yes, ma'am?
- Get out.

412
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,428
{\an8}You're banned from the stage
even as an extra.

413
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,721
{\an8}Extra: A role in a play without any lines

414
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,518
Resume.

415
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,650
Director, I think you should see this.

416
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,032
{\an8}Star actor of famous theater troupe
suspected of opium addiction

417
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,533
When was this published?

418
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,577
This morning.

419
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,079
Should we inform Okgyeong?

420
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,957
No, let her focus on performing for now.

421
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,876
Yes, ma'am.

422
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:14,573
Jeongnyeon, I heard you were
with a handsome man yesterday.

423
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,907
Was it your boyfriend?

424
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:16,992
Come on.

425
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,537
You really think it was her boyfriend?

426
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,416
Where would she find the time to date
when she's so busy selling clams?

427
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,543
All she talks about is money.

428
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,629
No man is going to go for her.

429
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,341
What's wrong with you?

430
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,595
Hey.

431
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:41,725
You want to know who the handsome man
talking to Jeongnyeon was?

432
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,978
It was Moon Okgyeong.

433
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,938
Stop talking nonsense.

434
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,982
Why would she of all people
be at the marketplace,

435
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,567
talking to Jeongnyeon?

436
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,819
Jeongnyeon.

437
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,779
Let them see the tickets.

438
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,281
The tickets?

439
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,660
Jamyunggo Ticket

440
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,704
Oh my.

441
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,122
It's true!

442
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,751
Did you really meet with Moon Okgyeong?

443
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,169
What did she say?

444
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,462
She just wanted me

445
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,838
to come to the performance.

446
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,674
Jeongnyeon, take me with you.

447
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,761
Is she really all that?

448
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:21,598
Moon Okgyeong and Seo Hyerang
are the Prince and Princess of Maeran.

449
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,850
- Right.
- Then does she earn a lot of money?

450
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,560
Are you kidding me?

451
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,813
She has her own house, car,
and anything else you could think of.

452
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,816
I'm so jealous, Jeongnyeon.

453
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,944
Is that so?

454
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,071
Hey.

455
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,448
Jeongnyeon!

456
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,284
You're not thinking of going, are you?

457
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,869
Are you?

458
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,330
Are you?

459
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,042
{\an8}Jamyunggo
Now showing

460
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,502
{\an8}Sold out

461
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,672
<i>Jamyunggo </i>is now showing!

462
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,882
Come and watch
the Prince and Princess of Maeran,

463
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,467
Moon Okgyeong and Seo Hyerang!

464
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,220
I don't think we should be here.

465
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,057
Mother's going to be furious
when she finds out.

466
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,934
Mother told me not to sing,

467
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,686
but she never banned me
from watching <i>gukgeuk, did she?</i>

468
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,939
Besides, we finished
all our chores for the day.

469
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,023
What's the problem?

470
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,775
- Look at that.
- Even so…

471
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,193
Hot buns.

472
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,153
- Get your hot buns here.
- How much are these?

473
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,780
15 <i>hwan </i>for 10 buns.

474
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,824
- 15 <i>hwan? </i>That's too much.
- We'll have a bag.

475
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,034
Just give me ten <i>hwan.</i> Listen, Jungja.

476
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,830
Mother's too busy helping out
with a party in the neighboring village.

477
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:31,167
We'll have plenty of time
to get home before she does.

478
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,046
Looks delicious!

479
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,090
I told you, it's 15 <i>hwan!</i>

480
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,509
Let's settle at 10 <i>hwan!</i>

481
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,886
It's Moon Okgyeong!

482
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,639
This is insane!
These look so good.

483
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,308
I waited three whole months for this.

484
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,270
I'm going to buy
Okgyeong's picture for sure this time.

485
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,689
- Wow.
- Hyerang's just gorgeous.

486
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,607
Make sure to get the poster.

487
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,862
Maeran Gukgeukdan's
Jamyunggo

488
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,282
I can't believe it.
I'll be seeing Moon Okgyeong in the flesh!

489
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,457
- Get your taffy here.
- Taffy!

490
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,376
Jeongnyeon, it's taffy!

491
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,963
Just eat the hot buns.

492
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:24,512
You're here because <i>gukgeuk </i>actors
earn a lot of money, aren't you?

493
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,639
Aren't you curious too?

494
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:30,518
We work our fingers
and backs off every day

495
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,062
and still don't have enough to buy rice.

496
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,524
I need to see
why this <i>gukgeuk </i>makes a lot of money

497
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,526
with my own two eyes.

498
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,570
You do that.

499
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:03,444
<i>Hooray, hooray </i>

500
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,947
<i>Rejoice </i>

501
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,700
<i>Red flowers on every mountain </i>

502
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,411
<i>Green barley in every field </i>

503
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,080
<i>All is well </i>

504
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:19,544
<i>Thanks to our great and noble king </i>

505
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,963
<i>Hooray </i>

506
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,341
It's Moon Okgyeong.

507
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,553
The children are singing.

508
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,014
How merry. Ha!

509
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:35,226
This is all thanks to our great king.

510
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,605
Enough!

511
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,025
What is wrong, my prince?

512
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,821
Can you really say that all is well?

513
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,200
Han strikes from up north…

514
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,538
and Nakrang attacks from the east.

515
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,291
Alas, how my land suffers.

516
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:05,256
<i>Han strikes from up north </i>

517
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,508
<i>And Nakrang attacks from the east </i>

518
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,802
<i>Alas, how my land suffers </i>

519
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,141
<i>The north wind quakes our earth </i>

520
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:20,271
<i>And the east wind brings forth a storm </i>

521
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,484
How could anyone say that all is well?

522
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,531
"Mokpo loves Moon Okgyeong
Moon Okgyeong fan club"

523
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,455
Oh, my heart.

524
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:41,334
She really is a prince, huh?

525
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,127
Right?

526
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:50,718
Princess.

527
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,972
I have something to tell you.

528
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,183
The heavens have appointed us
rulers on earth.

529
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,020
And even beasts have their mates.

530
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,651
It's only right for us to be together.

531
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:13,366
<i>Dear Jamyunggo </i>

532
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:18,663
<i>Turn a blind eye </i>

533
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,957
<i>Do not set your eyes </i>

534
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,920
<i>On my heart</i>
<i>I once laid down for my country </i>

535
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:32,135
To my heart that now yearns
for the enemy prince.

536
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,763
All things under the sun
are set by the heavens.

537
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,099
So why were we fated to be enemies?

538
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:43,479
<i>My love, oh my love </i>

539
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:48,860
<i>Oh, my dearest love </i>

540
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:52,572
<i>- My love, oh my love
- My love, oh my love</i>

541
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:57,660
<i>- Oh, my dearest love
- Oh, my dearest love</i>

542
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,789
<i>- You are my love
- You are my love</i>

543
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:05,960
<i>- Indeed you are my love
- Indeed you are my love</i>

544
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,562
<i>Maeran Gukgeukdan's Jamyunggo!</i>

545
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,502
Ms. Moon!

546
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,587
Please look over here!

547
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,297
- Over here!
- You were amazing tonight!

548
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,549
This is for you!

549
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,052
- Okgyeong!
- Ms. Moon!

550
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:42,390
You've sold out
every performance on this tour so far.

551
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,683
Please give us a word.

552
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:44,976
Yes.

553
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,979
Our troupe only exists thanks to our fans.

554
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:51,440
We will continue to do our best

555
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,944
to showcase the best performances
for our fans.

556
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,821
Ms. Moon!

557
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,407
Could you comment
on your scandal with film actor, Kim?

558
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,201
There's evidence
that you've regularly met up.

559
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,706
If you consider
meeting up with someone as dating,

560
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,876
then I guess that means
I'm in countless relationships.

561
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,139
What is it?

562
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,600
Did something happen?

563
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,226
Tell me.

564
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,398
Star actor of famous theater troupe
suspected of opium addiction

565
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:38,321
The article didn't name any names,

566
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,865
but everyone would have gotten the hint.

567
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,577
They did this
so I won't be able to press charges.

568
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,788
The article says
it was at Kim's house in Seoul.

569
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,333
And you've been spending
a lot of time there

570
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,709
with your artist friends.

571
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,506
Say something, Okgyeong.

572
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,009
We need to know what's going on
to protect you!

573
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,680
What's there to know?
You already think I did it.

574
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,685
Do you also think I did it?

575
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,688
Whether you did or did not,

576
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:16,025
I will publicly announce that you did not.

577
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,820
That's the only way to save our troupe.

578
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,239
I didn't do it.

579
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,283
This is all just speculation.

580
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,160
My friends and I are all clean.

581
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,413
I made a promise when I joined the troupe.

582
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,249
And I always keep my promises.

583
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,421
All right, I believe you.

584
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,799
I'll take care of this then.

585
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,678
And I think it's best…

586
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,055
if you stay away from Seoul
for the time being.

587
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,974
Ms. Kang.

588
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:52,603
There are too many journalists
trying to get the scoop on Okgyeong.

589
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,856
It's best to lay low in times like this.

590
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,000
The children are singing.

591
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,337
How merry.

592
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,758
This is all thanks to our great king.

593
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,889
Then…

594
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,227
Moon Okgyeong says…

595
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:37,106
Can you really say that all is well?

596
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,531
There was something different
from the moment Moon Okgyeong first spoke.

597
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,173
Can you really say that all is well?

598
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,383
No, that's not it.

599
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,219
It wasn't like this.

600
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,722
She wasn't trying to sound cool.

601
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,850
I'm missing something…

602
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,727
What am I missing?

603
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:20,024
Can you really say that all is well?

604
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,985
That's right.

605
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,655
She had elegance.

606
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,326
Yes, elegance.

607
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,661
Sophistication.

608
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,550
Can you really say that all is well?

609
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:52,223
How could anyone say that all is well?

610
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,061
What are you doing up?

611
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,397
You scared me.

612
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,440
It's just…

613
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:05,027
my heart keeps racing and I can't sleep.

614
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,780
You keep saying that.

615
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,740
Maybe you're sick.

616
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,866
No, I'm not sick.

617
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,703
My heart…

618
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:19,083
just keeps thumping.

619
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,254
You're just excited

620
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,590
because you heard
those actors make a lot of money.

621
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,636
Am I?

622
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,179
Just forget about it.

623
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,183
Those people are from beyond the stars.

624
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,604
Beyond the stars?

625
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,238
You're right.

626
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,617
What I saw today…

627
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,456
was from beyond the stars.

628
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,471
Morning, sir!

629
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,905
Excuse me, sir.

630
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,867
Is this
where the Maeran actors are staying?

631
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,620
They just left.

632
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:38,704
What?

633
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,959
They already left?

634
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,337
You just missed them.

635
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,012
Yoon Jeongnyeon?

636
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,723
What the…

637
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,559
Are you here to see me?

638
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,856
How come you're still here?

639
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,276
Something came up,
so I'll be staying in Mokpo for a while.

640
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,111
Really?

641
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,073
So why did you come to see me?

642
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,157
What?

643
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:19,578
I'm here…

644
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,331
Well, I'm here…

645
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,792
I'm here because…

646
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,295
Come with me.

647
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,231
H-Hello?

648
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,567
<i>Is this Hanseong Inn in Mokpo?</i>

649
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,277
<i>You have a call from Seoul.</i>

650
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,486
<i>Please wait until I connect--</i>

651
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,406
This is a script for <i>Chunhyangjeon.</i>

652
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,866
Try reading it out loud.

653
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,871
Don't think too much about it.

654
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,004
"Here it is, Young Master."

655
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,758
"This is what I was telling you about."

656
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,678
"The most famous pavilion in all the land…

657
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,888
Gwang…

658
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,349
…G-Gwanghallu Pavilion."

659
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,434
"What do you think?"

660
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,103
It seems…

661
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,356
you've never acted before.

662
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,900
You're as stiff as a board.

663
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:35,237
I mean… this was so out of the blue.

664
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,490
How could I be good
at something I've only just seen?

665
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,659
Then are you better
with something you've seen before?

666
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,703
Of course I am.

667
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,500
The children are singing.

668
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,294
How merry.

669
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,797
This is all thanks to our great king.

670
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,217
Can you really say that all is well?

671
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,220
What is wrong, my prince?

672
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,974
Han strikes from up north

673
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,393
and Nakrang attacks from the east.

674
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,146
Alas, how my land suffers.

675
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,941
You memorized all that?

676
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,360
I did.

677
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,154
But you've only seen it
for the first time yesterday.

678
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,656
I know, right?

679
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,407
I wasn't trying to memorize them,

680
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,910
but the lines
were just imprinted in my brain.

681
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,126
Even I can't memorize
something I've only seen once.

682
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:33,879
So how was it?

683
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,883
My acting was better
than the first time, right?

684
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:38,967
No.

685
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,844
You were still as stiff as a board.

686
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,059
So why did you have me do this?

687
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,938
I wanted to see if you had it in you
to become a <i>gukgeuk </i>actor.

688
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,109
Isn't that why you came to see me?

689
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,369
Yes.

690
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,539
But…

691
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,292
you just said that I couldn't act.

692
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,879
A <i>gukgeuk </i>actor
must be adept at three things.

693
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,840
Singing, dancing, and acting.

694
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,760
Your acting isn't the best…

695
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,762
…but it'll get better with practice.

696
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,349
And you probably can't dance.

697
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,602
Yeah.

698
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,271
But you have your voice.

699
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,356
My voice?

700
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,900
{\an8}You were born with <i>cheonguseong.</i>

701
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,487
{\an8}It's a pure and lovely voice

702
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,741
{\an8}that also contains <i>aewonseong,</i>
or deep, heartfelt sorrow.

703
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,245
That's why it's called <i>cheonguseong,</i>

704
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,788
a voice given by the heavens.

705
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:54,001
A voice given by the heavens?

706
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,837
My voice?

707
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,172
In other words…

708
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,299
you were born to sing <i>pansori.</i>

709
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,930
Oh, my goodness.

710
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,349
I can't believe my ears.

711
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,814
My mother really ought to hear this.

712
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:19,276
Of course, that alone won't guarantee
that you can join our troupe.

713
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,737
Our director is incredibly picky.

714
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,821
Even so…

715
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,200
you're saying I have a chance, yes?

716
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,660
I think so.

717
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,419
- Jungja.
- Yeah?

718
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,004
Hypothetically…

719
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,799
let's say there's something
you want to do.

720
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,761
But there are so many reasons
why you shouldn't.

721
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,723
What would you do
if you still want to do it?

722
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,727
Something I shouldn't do?

723
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,690
Is it something illegal?

724
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,859
No, nothing like that.

725
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,738
Let me think.

726
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,452
I think there's a clear answer.

727
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,537
What is it?

728
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:17,459
You said you still want to do it,
even if you shouldn't.

729
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,128
Then you'd end up doing it eventually.

730
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,508
The human heart is like that.

731
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,343
You tell someone not to do something,

732
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,053
and it makes them want to do it even more.

733
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,601
Hey, take it easy.

734
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,354
Please stop!

735
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,648
There they go again.

736
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,279
Those scoundrels!

737
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,613
Kick everything down, okay?

738
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,490
The heavens ought to smite them to pieces.

739
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,911
It would be quicker
for us to leave Mokpo…

740
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,123
than to wait for the heavens to act.

741
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,457
Kick this down as well.

742
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,043
I refuse…

743
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,214
to live my life
waiting for divine intervention.

744
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:28,822
I've made up my mind.

745
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:34,578
I promised my mother
I would never sing again.

746
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,249
If she finds out
I'm trying to become a <i>gukgeuk </i>actor,

747
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,877
she's going to shave my head bald.

748
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,552
But I still want to do it.

749
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,056
You said I had a chance.

750
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:01,438
I want to make big money with this talent,
even if my mother kills me.

751
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:05,150
So teach me what I need to do

752
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:08,278
to get out of here and get to Seoul.

753
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:15,494
Our troupe is going to hold
an audition for new trainees.

754
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,245
You'll be taking that audition.

755
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,206
Au…

756
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,290
Sorry, what?

757
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,750
An audition.

758
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,086
It's an entrance exam for the troupe.

759
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,422
So what do they test at this "audition"?

760
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,091
Three things.

761
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,051
Singing, acting, and dancing.

762
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,888
Experts for each of the criteria
will serve as judges,

763
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,516
but Director Kang is the one
who holds the final say.

764
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,187
We'd better focus on acting and dancing

765
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,647
since we don't have a lot of time.

766
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,159
"Is that grass I see on the roof?"

767
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,662
"Since you wouldn't stop talking about
this Gwanghallu Pavilion,

768
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,455
I thought it'd be much grander than this."

769
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,082
"But is this what…

770
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,834
…all the fuss is about?"

771
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:13,135
Uh, the biggest problem…

772
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,262
is that you're not phrasing
the lines properly.

773
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,016
The audience won't get
a word of what you're saying

774
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,184
if you read off
a string of lines like that.

775
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,728
I have a question.

776
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,606
How much do you earn
if you play the main character?

777
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,108
What?

778
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,611
My friends said
that if you succeed as a <i>gukgeuk </i>actor,

779
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,822
you'd be rich enough
to buy a house and a car.

780
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,907
Is that true?

781
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,288
You better practice
if you want to get rich.

782
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,248
Relax your shoulders.

783
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,210
And maintain eye contact
with the person you're talking to.

784
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,172
Here it is, Young Master.

785
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,340
This is what I was telling you about.

786
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,594
The most famous pavilion in all the land,
Gwanghallu Pavilion.

787
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,304
What do you think?

788
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,056
Isn't it as amazing as I said it'd be?

789
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,478
Is that grass I see on the roof?

790
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:08,398
Since you wouldn't stop talking about
this Gwanghallu Pavilion,

791
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,901
I thought it'd be much grander than this.

792
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,945
But is this what all the fuss is about?

793
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,448
What?

794
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,658
Was it weird?

795
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,327
No.

796
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,623
Your tone and mood changed completely.
Let's keep going.

797
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,218
Pause.

798
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:40,222
Lower your shoulder and your knee.

799
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,057
And raise your toes.

800
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,492
Finish up here, will you?

801
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,035
Okay.

802
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,554
Good. Let's stop here.

803
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,145
I'd say you're not too bad now.

804
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:29,813
Seriously?

805
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:33,191
Come on,
tell me something better than that.

806
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,486
I'm telling you you're not that bad.

807
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,282
Which means I'm nowhere near good.

808
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,537
But…

809
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,373
why are you helping me?

810
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,126
It's not like I'm paying you.

811
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,046
I'm not bored.

812
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,966
What?

813
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,511
Everything was starting to get boring.

814
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:05,640
But you must be so busy
with all the performances.

815
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,058
What was so boring for you?

816
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,813
Anyhow, I want you to join our troupe

817
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,899
and continue to entertain me.

818
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,570
So make sure to pass the audition
for my sake.

819
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:22,157
So you weren't really helping me
just to help me.

820
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,702
Let's just say we're helping each other.

821
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,958
The breeze feels nice.

822
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,295
Pfft.

823
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:17,045
Where have you been running off to
these days?

824
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,589
I…

825
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,801
I've been hanging out with Insuk
at her place and…

826
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,809
They told me you weren't at their place.

827
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:35,021
They haven't even seen you around
these days.

828
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,857
That's…

829
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,112
{\an8}Chunhyangjeon

830
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:45,865
What are all these?

831
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,373
Do these have something to do with…

832
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,127
where you've been going these days?

833
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:07,387
I've been practicing by myself
to join the theater troupe.

834
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:11,725
I know you don't like me singing,

835
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,269
but could you just let me do it
this one time?

836
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,021
Once I make the troupe,

837
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,481
I promise I'll work
more than twice as hard as the others

838
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,983
and make it big.

839
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:23,403
Then I'll be able to help the family
with all the money I'll be making--

840
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,239
- Oh, my goodness!
- Mother! Mother!

841
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,949
- Get some water!
- Water?

842
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,994
Mother! My goodness! Mother, breathe!

843
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,746
- Here's the water!
- Oh, my goodness!

844
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,664
- Mother!
- Drink the water!

845
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,506
Goodness.

846
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,057
A theater troupe?

847
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,727
A theater troupe?

848
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,236
Didn't I…

849
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,281
tell you…

850
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,368
to never sing again?

851
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,911
I know, Mother.

852
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,917
I also tried not to
because I promised you.

853
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,211
But…

854
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:25,131
I have a talent.

855
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:29,177
And I'll be able to transform our lives
with this talent.

856
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,971
Stop talking nonsense!

857
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:36,518
You think you have some grand talent

858
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,686
just because people cheer you on a bit
when you sing?

859
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,814
I can't believe you.

860
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,733
- Mother, no!
- Get it together, you brat!

861
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,860
I'll never let you sing,

862
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,571
even if I have to beg on the streets!

863
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,865
I don't want to beg on the streets!

864
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:58,248
You want me to live my whole life
paying those thugs whenever they want?

865
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:01,543
I'm telling you,
we can have a better life!

866
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,336
I don't care!

867
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,257
You're not allowed to sing.

868
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,760
So tell me why I'm not allowed!

869
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:13,471
You'll only get hurt if you do!

870
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,147
How…

871
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,275
How would you know that?

872
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,698
I have nothing more to say.

873
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,954
You can't sing.

874
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,124
Just listen to your mother…

875
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,669
so you won't regret it later.

876
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,589
I won't regret it.

877
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:51,843
I'm…

878
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,138
going to make it…

879
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,515
no matter what.

880
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,942
Mother! Mother!

881
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:09,569
- Mother!
- Mother!

882
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,653
Mother!

883
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,281
You can't do this, Mother!

884
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:16,826
Don't you dare let her out
before I say so.

885
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,829
And don't even think about giving her food
behind my back.

886
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,249
So you're just going to let her starve?

887
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:27,337
Until you swear never to dream of <i>gukgeuk</i>
or singing ever again,

888
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,507
I'm not letting you out.

889
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,717
Mother.

890
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,927
Oh, no.

891
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,261
- Mother!
- Jeongnyeon!

892
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,972
- Jungja!
- Oh, no…

893
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,391
What are you doing? Get over here now!

894
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,729
This is driving me crazy.

895
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:48,316
Jungja, don't go! Don't go!

896
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,902
Jungja!

897
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,818
I hear Moon Okgyeong
is in our neighborhood.

898
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,194
I heard that too.

899
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,738
They say she's still at the inn
the troupe was staying at.

900
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,282
What's she doing here?

901
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,534
The innkeeper says

902
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:43,329
that she goes out early morning
and returns late at night.

903
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,790
Tch. Maybe she's seeing someone.

904
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,959
Oh, please.

905
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:51,087
You think Moon Okgyeong would date
some bumpkin from Mokpo?

906
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,677
Oh my. My goodness!

907
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,304
That's Moon Okgyeong!

908
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,055
It's her!

909
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,516
Hey, someone pinch me.

910
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,101
Am I dreaming?

911
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,353
You're Jeongnyeon's sister, right?

912
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,689
We've met before.

913
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,359
Yes.

914
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,418
Jeongnyeon.

915
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,502
Jeongnyeon!

916
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,421
Jeongnyeon!

917
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,466
- My goodness!
- Jungja!

918
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,593
You must be hungry.

919
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:39,886
Are you thirsty?

920
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,555
I'm fine.

921
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,433
Hurry and tell Mother
that you won't do <i>gukgeuk!</i>

922
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,644
That's the only way!

923
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,480
Jeongnyeon!

924
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,233
I can't do that.

925
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,905
If I give up now…

926
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,077
I'm going to regret it
for the rest of my life.

927
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,122
I don't want to do that.

928
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,876
What are you doing there?

929
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,339
Oh… I…

930
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,967
I didn't do anything.

931
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,177
Oh, the laundry.

932
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,721
I need to do the laundry.

933
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,350
I'll wash these clean!

934
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:38,236
I'm going over to the neighbor's,

935
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:39,737
so you'll have to eat by yourself.

936
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:41,989
Okay.

937
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:45,743
You better not give any food
to your sister, all right?

938
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,037
I won't.

939
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,126
Chunhyangjeon

940
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,128
These blasted things.

941
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,630
I ought to burn them all.

942
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,648
Oh my!

943
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,858
Oh, no.

944
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,901
What do I do?

945
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,904
What do I do?

946
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,410
{\an8}Yoon Jeongnyeon

947
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:32,081
<i>Could you tell Jeongnyeon</i>
<i>that we'll have to leave by today?</i>

948
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,666
What?

949
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,209
What do you mean?

950
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:38,337
Tomorrow morning
is the entrance exam for the troupe,

951
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,006
so we have to leave by today.

952
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:41,883
I mean…

953
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,011
Please tell her to meet me
at Hanseong Inn.

954
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,512
But…

955
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:48,222
Thanks.

956
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,206
Come on out.

957
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,638
Hey, this way.

958
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,057
Come on!

959
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,768
Hurry.

960
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,223
Our star must be waiting.

961
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,530
Are you okay?

962
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,033
I'm okay.

963
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,856
I'm sorry I'm so late.

964
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,151
It's fine. Let's go.

965
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,711
Mother's going to kill you.

966
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,256
I'm so sorry.

967
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,925
Come on.

968
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:33,304
You think I didn't know that
when I let you out?

969
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:38,893
I'm good at begging on my knees.
I'm not stubborn like you.

970
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:49,612
I know…

971
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:51,989
…how hard you're working
to support our family.

972
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,409
I'm also sorry about that.

973
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,453
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

974
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:01,540
Jeongnyeon.

975
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,752
Having a dream is a blessing.

976
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,798
If this is what you want…

977
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:12,134
then go and see it through to the end.

978
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:18,015
I promise I'll make it big.

979
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,978
It's all right if you don't.

980
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:26,357
Just know that whenever you feel lonely,
you can always come home.

981
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:30,319
I'll keep the door unlocked.

982
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,644
Go on.

983
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:06,188
Or Mother might catch you.

984
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,855
Jungja!

985
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:52,234
I promise I'll come back
after making it big!

986
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:56,030
Don't skip your meals!

987
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:24,558
No. 90, Seo Boksil?

988
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:25,768
- Yes.
- All right.

989
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:27,686
- No. 91, Park Chorok?
- Yes.

990
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,814
You're the last two. Please get ready.

991
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,569
Time's up. Let's close the gates.

992
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:36,654
Yes, ma'am.

993
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,284
Wait!

994
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,000
I want to sign up too.

995
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:59,510
I'm here
for the Maeran Gukgeukdan audition.

996
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,055
And your name?

997
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,311
I'm Yoon Jeongnyeon!

998
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:27,955
{\an8}Special thanks to Moon Sori,
Lee Dukhwa, Kang Jieun,

{\an8}<i>if it weren't for my shoulder.</i>

1004

1005

{\an8}<i>I don't care</i>

1006
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,496
{\an8}<i> how small a role it may be.</i>

1007
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,248
{\an8}<i>Just let me be on stage.</i>

{\an8}<i>I was a small fish in a pond.</i>

1009

{\an8}Don't be ridiculous.
You and I are not on the same level.

1010

{\an8}<i>You underestimated me.</i>

1011
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:23,260
{\an8}<i>Make sure to watch closely.</i>
