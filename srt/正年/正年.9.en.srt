Thank you, dear judges,

for taking time out of your busy schedules

29

And playing Princess Pyeonggang

00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,525
is Maeran Gukgeukdan's Hong Jooran.

40
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,828
Come up and say a word, Youngseo.

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,339
- Congratulations.
- Ms. Heo, look here, please.

42
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,676
Could you give us a wave?

43
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,512
<i>…of a dragon</i>

00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,652
- Over here.
- Ms. Heo!

48
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,779
- Here, Ms. Heo.
- Over here!

49
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,031
A word, please!

50
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,033
- Where's she going?
- What's going on?

51
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,161
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

52
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,832
Everyone, please bow.

53
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,143
Jeongnyeon.

54
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,104
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,359
I'm so sorry.

56
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,358
Okgyeong!

57
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,235
Okgyeong! Okgyeong!

58
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,322
Give me your hand.

59
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,116
Just leave me be!

60
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,914
Are you that sad?

61
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,586
Are you that sad Jeongnyeon is ruined now?

62
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,131
What is she to you?

63
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,593
I'm sad because of you.

64
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,472
You ruined everything.

65
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,226
What the hell have I ruined?

66
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,277
Okgyeong.

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,405
We can just keep living our lives.

68
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,577
We'll continue performing
as Maeran's leads.

69
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,372
We can just live like that.

70
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,249
What's the point…

71
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,004
of playing a good-for-nothing prince?

72
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,090
It's important to me.

73
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,138
Every single show we've performed together
is precious and important to me.

74
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,352
At the audition…

75
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,938
when Jeongnyeon started singing…

76
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,277
<i>…I thought that finally,
someone could surpass me.</i>

77
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,407
It was absolutely exhilarating.

78
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,326
I had chills all over my body.

79
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,123
I've never felt anything like that before.

80
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,711
But now…

81
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,173
Now…

82
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,109
{\an8}Act 9

83
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,072
{\an8}Oh, you're too kind.

84
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,241
{\an8}Thank you.

85
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,534
{\an8}All right then.

86
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,660
{\an8}Goodbye.

87
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,583
{\an8}Look at me getting all the congratulations

88
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,878
{\an8}when you're the one who got the lead role.

89
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,505
{\an8}Mother,

90
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,508
{\an8}I have something to tell you.

91
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,593
{\an8}Ma'am, someone is here to see you.

92
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,303
{\an8}Show him in.

93
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,388
{\an8}Yes, ma'am.

94
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,891
{\an8}I'm glad you came.

95
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,185
{\an8}You can say hi to him while you're here.

96
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,478
{\an8}Who is he?

97
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,232
{\an8}Hello, sir.

98
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,943
{\an8}I'm so sorry for taking so long
to invite you here.

99
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,695
I should have done so sooner.

100
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,866
Say hello, Youngseo.
This is Mr. Kim Nosik, a <i>pansori</i> master.

101
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,996
This must be your daughter
who got the lead role.

102
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,373
How about it, Ms. Heo?

103
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,375
Are you ready to spread your wings

104
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,712
in the National Gukgeukdan
that we're about to create?

105
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,048
The National Gukgeukdan?

106
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,384
We're going to create
the best theater troupe

107
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,012
with only the best talents in the country.

108
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,682
There, you'll be guaranteed
a lifelong career.

109
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,976
You should be honored.

110
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,104
Mr. Kim here has decided
to specially promote you

111
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,399
because you got
the lead role in the audition.

112
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,073
No.

113
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,161
I'm not performing
in the joint performance.

114
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,041
I actually came here to tell you that.

115
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,045
Youngseo,

116
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,172
what are you talking about?

117
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,594
Thank you for your offer
regarding the National Gukgeukdan…

118
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,641
but I'll have to decline
as I'm not worthy of such a position.

119
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,018
I'm sorry, sir.

120
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,147
Young… Youngseo.

121
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,109
Youngseo! What do you think you're doing?

122
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,528
Go and apologize right now!

123
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,696
Is this what you intended to do
from the beginning?

124
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,824
You were trying to plug me
into another theater troupe?

125
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,954
Then how long did you think
you could stay in Maeran?

126
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,457
All other troupes
are holding on by a thread.

127
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,959
You think Maeran's any different?

128
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,502
At the audition,

129
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,381
the person who sang the true essence
of <i>pansori</i> that you like so much

130
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,884
was Yoon Jeongnyeon, not me.

131
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,344
No.

132
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,679
It was you.

133
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,681
Stop spouting nonsense

134
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,392
and get prepared to leave Maeran
after the joint performance.

135
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,726
No.

136
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,938
I'm going to stay in Maeran.

137
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,524
You'll have nowhere to go
if it's too late.

138
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,319
Do you have any idea
what I had to do to get you that role?

139
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:41,289
Did you bribe the judges?

140
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,668
You did, didn't you?

141
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,672
Of course,
I knew you'd get the role either way,

142
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,426
but… there's no harm in making sure.

143
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,848
Youngseo.

144
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,891
I did it for you.

145
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,686
- I was looking out for you--
- No!

146
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,647
You did this all for yourself.

147
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,733
You needed a daughter…

148
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,990
who wouldn't shame
the great soprano Han Kijoo.

149
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,700
Is that so bad?

150
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:23,581
Is it so bad to want a daughter
that I could be proud of?

151
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,629
Do you know?

152
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,926
I've never once lived my life
as just Heo Youngseo.

153
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,387
I've always lived as Han Kijoo's daughter.

154
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,682
I wanted the same… No, even just half!

155
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:47,104
I practiced to death for half the love
and recognition you give Youngin!

156
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,899
"I'm proud of you, Youngseo."

157
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,234
"You're the best."

158
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,781
That's all I wanted to hear from you.

159
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,661
I'm…

160
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,581
I'm my own person.

161
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,795
I'm not going to live
as Han Kijoo's daughter anymore.

162
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,925
Youngseo…

163
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,391
You can't perform
in the joint performance?

164
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,101
My mother…

165
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,687
bribed the judges.

166
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,525
Someone else should have gotten the lead.

167
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,695
The choice to pick you…

168
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,613
was a unanimous decision.

169
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,409
- A unanimous decision?
- Yes.

170
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,868
I also picked you.

171
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,163
And if I were to go back, I'd do it again.

172
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,209
But if Jeongnyeon hadn't lost her voice--

173
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,545
And what's the point of speculating?

174
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,755
You're right.

175
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,427
Jeongnyeon's performance
was truly extraordinary.

176
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:04,098
But your singing, dancing, and acting

177
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,850
were just as extraordinary.

178
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,102
You were a lot more stable
than Jeongnyeon,

179
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,355
and your chemistry with your partner
was just perfect.

180
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:19,363
You know what I find
the most ridiculous about your mother?

181
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,616
She was too busy
holding someone else's daughter in check

182
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,537
that she failed to see
how much potential her own daughter had.

183
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,960
Don't be foolish like your mother.

184
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,133
Don't underestimate your own value.

185
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,713
Her vocal cords have gotten a lot better,

186
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,590
so speaking shouldn't be a problem now.

187
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,593
But it'll be difficult for her
to sing <i>pansori</i> anymore.

188
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,933
<i>She may be able to sing</i>
<i>after some time passes,</i>

189
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:33,145
<i>but I don't think she'll be able to sing
the same way as before.</i>

190
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,065
You need more practice, kiddos.

191
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,900
Oh, Director!

192
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,406
You must be so busy
with the joint performance.

193
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,367
So thank you for coming to pick me up.

194
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,828
Of course I should come.

195
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:55,125
I was itching to get out of here.

196
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,588
I'm going to get myself
some herbal medicine once I'm out.

197
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,716
I looked into medicine
that would help me get my voice back.

198
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,553
Medicine that would get your voice back?

199
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,264
Yes. Since I can't sing <i>pansori</i> for now,

200
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,391
I'll have to focus
on getting my voice back.

201
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,436
You heard from the doctor
about your voice, right?

202
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,106
That I'd never get to sing <i>pansori</i> again?

203
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:21,318
That's just because the doctor
doesn't know much about <i>pansori</i> singers.

204
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,362
I've seen it back in my hometown.

205
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:28,450
It's common for <i>pansori</i> singers
to temporarily lose their voices.

206
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,704
Once they got a lot of rest
and took the right medicine,

207
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,498
they got their voices right back.

208
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,549
I smell steamed buns.

209
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,888
They're steamed buns, right?
Did you get them for us?

210
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,931
Hands off!

211
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,892
They're not for you.
They're for Jeongnyeon.

212
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,894
You got her steamed buns?

213
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,520
She likes these.

214
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,689
She must have craved them at the hospital.

215
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,773
Park Chorok.

216
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,650
How could you do this to us?

217
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,111
Since when were you
this close to Jeongnyeon?

218
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,529
- She's right!
- Shut it!

219
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,867
You should also try doing something nice
for your friend who's been sick.

220
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,285
You're so cheap.

221
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,163
- I want some steamed buns too!
- Yeah!

222
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,998
Nothing's changed, huh?

223
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,625
My goodness.

224
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,418
Jeongnyeon!

225
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,003
You guys are so noisy.

226
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,589
I could hear you from outside the gates.

227
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,716
Is your voice all right?

228
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,801
I went to visit you at the hospital,

229
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,095
but they said you were asleep,
so I couldn't see you.

230
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,556
Don't worry, I knew you came to visit.

231
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,935
My gosh, you're pretty kind deep down.

232
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,062
Since you're speaking fine,
is your voice all right now?

233
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,856
- Of course. Everything's fine.
- Really?

234
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,816
We thought you'd never sing <i>pansori</i> again

235
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,652
because you were coughing up blood--

236
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,656
Come on.
Do you know how strong my throat is?

237
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,699
That incident
couldn't keep me from singing.

238
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,743
Once I get my rest and eat well,

239
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,454
I'll get better in no time,
so don't worry.

240
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,540
Wait.

241
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,920
I smell steamed buns.

242
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,466
I got them for you.

243
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,468
What? For me?

244
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,221
My goodness, Chorok.

245
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,018
Here.

246
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,937
- So hot.
- Here, have some.

247
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,065
They taste better if you share.

248
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,238
- Mmm! It's so good!
- So delicious!

249
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,410
My goodness.

250
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,498
Hey, did you also clean my room?

251
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,792
No, that was Jooran.

252
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,546
She was busy cleaning this morning
because you were coming back.

253
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,895
<i>I shall look for you, my love</i>

254
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,524
<i>I shall dry my sleeves of my tears</i>

255
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,360
<i>Treasure the marriage vows…</i>

256
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,073
Sorry, I'll go again.

257
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,326
That's enough for today.

258
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,037
Let's try again tomorrow.

259
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,083
You should go first.

260
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,420
I'll practice by myself for a while.

261
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,675
Are you that scared?

262
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,427
What?

263
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,430
You're afraid to run into Jeongnyeon,

264
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,766
aren't you?

265
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,894
It's not like that.

266
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,509
I'm back from the hospital.

267
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,136
Yeah, I heard.

268
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,724
How are you?

269
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,310
I'm good now.

270
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,187
See? I can speak just fine.

271
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,815
That's good then.

272
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,859
I heard you got the lead.

273
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,278
Congratulations.

274
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,406
You better do your best for my sake too

275
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,867
since you beat me for that role.

276
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,662
The one who should have gotten that role…

277
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,665
wasn't me.

278
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,960
- It was actually--
- That day…

279
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,962
I gave it my all

280
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,297
and didn't get the part.

281
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,759
That's all it was.

282
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,805
So you shouldn't think otherwise.

283
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,852
Come on, you should be happy.

284
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,939
Put on a smile, will you?
You got the role you wanted.

285
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,204
What to do of my dear princess's…

286
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,418
Hey, you're here.

287
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,295
What's going on?

288
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,340
Are they singling our troupe out?

289
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:39,469
Both the leads and the young leads
are from Maeran,

290
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,431
so the other troupes are complaining
because they feel like extras.

291
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,766
But what's the issue? They all auditioned.

292
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,186
They're just looking for things
to complain about.

293
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,771
Hey.

294
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,912
Hello, everyone.

295
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,582
We will now start the read-through
for the joint performance.

296
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:12,169
<i>Oh, please do not cry</i>

297
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,880
<i>My beautiful love</i>

298
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:19,843
<i>Do not shed</i>

299
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,471
<i>Your pearly tears</i>

300
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,057
<i>On your jade-like face</i>

301
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,479
<i>Oh, please do not cry</i>

302
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,316
<i>If you leave now</i>

303
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,110
<i>When will you return?</i>

304
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,781
<i>I'll miss you a thousand times</i>

305
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,908
<i>I'll miss you</i>

306
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,993
<i>My love</i>

307
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:49,081
<i>I will miss my dear husband</i>

308
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:53,502
<i>To no end</i>

309
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,588
Let's move on to the antagonist.

310
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,260
I have heard that a boy has been visiting
the princess's quarters.

311
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,346
So it is true.

312
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,399
This is the perfect opportunity

313
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,526
to drive out the king.

314
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,446
Again. That was a bit excessive.

315
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:27,202
{\an8}You don't have to be so overtly malicious
just because you're the antagonist.

316
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,287
{\an8}Go again.

317
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,956
I don't want to.

318
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,670
- "I don't want to"?
- What's with her?

319
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,257
There should be no doubt in anyone's mind
that I'm the antagonist.

320
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,466
He needs to be intimidating.

321
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,969
And this is his first appearance.

322
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,974
He should be a bit extreme
to leave an impression on the audience.

323
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,020
You haven't analyzed
your character correctly.

324
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:58,275
Johyeon is a calculating character
who often doesn't show his true self.

325
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,861
That's just…

326
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,821
your interpretation.

327
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,698
How dare you?

328
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,492
I don't think
she's being that unreasonable.

329
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,789
Maeran may have always followed your take,

330
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,874
but in my troupe,

331
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,585
I always respected
the take of individual actors.

332
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,420
And that is my rule.

333
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,469
We need to think of
the play's whole narrative.

334
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,972
She's sticking out like a sore thumb
without any coherence to the plot,

335
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,307
and you want us to respect that?

336
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,683
Is that so bad?

337
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:36,104
The majority of the leads
in this production are from Maeran.

338
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,817
What's so wrong about Geumju
trying to stand out from the others?

339
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,781
Is that what you wanted to say?

340
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,742
For you,
this is the best-case scenario right now.

341
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,787
You get to advertise Maeran
with Okgyeong and Hyerang,

342
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,748
while simultaneously pushing
Youngseo and Jooran as the next stars.

343
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,041
Then are you saying…

344
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,878
we should remove Okgyeong and Hyerang
from the show?

345
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,382
The majority of the audience
for this production

346
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,801
will be here to see Okgyeong and Hyerang.

347
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,885
Especially Okgyeong.

348
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:11,932
Do you have any idea how much influence
her presence has on ticket sales?

349
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,141
You're right.

350
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,976
We need Okgyeong.

351
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,856
But if I were you, I would have given
the other troupes a chance at the audition

352
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,982
and not let Maeran compete.

353
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,486
You said this joint performance
was so important to you.

354
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,779
But you have no idea

355
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,073
what the other troupes
are unsatisfied about

356
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,741
with this production.

357
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,577
And you probably don't care.

358
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,508
Let's practice by ourselves next time.

359
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,177
Yeah, I think that would be better.

360
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,438
I'll get going first.

361
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,780
Are you going somewhere?

362
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,991
Yeah.

363
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,701
Jeongnyeon!

364
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,456
Are you going to see another doctor?

365
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,332
Where is it this time?

366
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,127
I heard there's a good doctor in Cheongju.

367
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,045
How are you going to get
all the way there?

368
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,215
Mr. Jung has some business in Cheongju,
so he'll drive me there.

369
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,927
If I leave now, I'll return by nightfall.

370
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,013
I'm off.

371
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,726
She keeps coming back disappointed.

372
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,644
How many times is this?

373
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,354
I hope this time is different.

374
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,191
But is her voice actually getting better?

375
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:49,196
What? I'm just asking.

376
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,698
My gosh.

377
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:58,788
Herbal medicine clinic

378
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,004
Please wait your turn.

379
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,929
What's your name?

380
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,223
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

381
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,102
You said you lost your voice?

382
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,314
I didn't lose it completely, but…

383
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:25,815
It's just…

384
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,275
Let me see your hand.

385
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,252
Listen.

386
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,880
Try taking my pulse on this side.

387
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,092
What's the point of taking pulses?

388
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,677
This is as clear as day.

389
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,013
There's no way to fix something
that you've already lost.

390
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,015
Just accept it.

391
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,232
This is driving me crazy.

392
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,487
Sir.

393
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:17,993
I came all the way here from Seoul
because I heard you were that good.

394
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,831
I'm holding on by a thread every day,
and I'm willing to try anything.

395
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,376
Could you give me some kind of remedy?

396
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,631
You could try poppy flower extract.

397
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,966
Poppy flower?

398
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,386
But…

399
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,055
isn't that opium?

400
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,307
Yes, opium.

401
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,142
Haven't you heard

402
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,853
that you can do anything with your voice
when you take opium?

403
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,439
Who knows?

404
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:52,360
Maybe opium could fix your voice.

405
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,449
But what if I become addicted?

406
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,908
My goodness.

407
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,994
You said you were willing to try anything.

408
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,788
Just forget it.

409
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:04,873
Next.

410
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,501
- Get a move on, Manseok!
- Yes, sir.

411
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,046
Next! The doctor will see you now.

412
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,626
What is this?

413
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:55,840
I was told
I'd get my voice back if I took opium.

414
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,468
Who told you such nonsense?

415
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:03,014
There are countless <i>pansori</i> singers
whose lives were ruined by opium.

416
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,475
You want to end up like them?

417
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,105
Then what else can I do?

418
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,648
I need to do something!

419
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,025
When are you going to stop
going around in circles?

420
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:19,322
You have never once accepted the fact
that your voice is completely gone!

421
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,700
And if I accept it?

422
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,327
What happens after I accept it?

423
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,997
Asking a <i>pansori</i> singer
to accept that her voice is gone

424
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,250
means you're asking her to die.

425
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,461
You know that better than anyone.

426
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,463
So how could you…

427
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,891
I just haven't found the remedy yet.

428
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,478
My voice will get better for sure.

429
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,732
Jeongnyeon.

430
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,275
Let's go see a doctor tomorrow.

431
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,987
There's a famous doctor
who's studied in the States,

432
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,947
and he's in Korea right now.

433
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,075
He's a renowned expert in his field.

434
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,828
Then…

435
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,582
can he fix my voice?

436
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:15,587
I can't guarantee anything
until he sees you.

437
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,298
If he sees you

438
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,800
and says
that there's even the slightest hope,

439
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,012
then I'm going to wait for you
no matter how long it takes.

440
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,680
But…

441
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,475
if he sees no hope…

442
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,854
then you have to accept things
for what they are.

443
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,041
I was just going to leave.

444
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,588
Hey…

445
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,091
you don't have to do this anymore.

446
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,471
It's not like you're my maid.
My limbs are fine.

447
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,264
I just…

448
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,893
I just felt sorry.

449
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,354
I thought I should at least do this much.

450
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,441
What are you sorry for?

451
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,110
It's all my fault.

452
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,195
No.

453
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,074
What happened to me
has nothing to do with you.

454
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,453
I was the one who made that choice.

455
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,414
It has nothing to do with you.

456
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,462
So…

457
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,924
stop doing this.

458
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,009
It's uncomfortable.

459
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,515
Okay.

460
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,111
She's such an idiot.

461
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,031
What is she beating herself up for?

462
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,747
All right.

463
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,751
Now try saying, "Ah."

464
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,049
Okay.

465
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:33,224
Doctor, do you think I could get better?

466
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:40,690
Most of these vocal disorders
caused by overusing your vocal cords

467
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:46,237
go away after resting your voice
for some months.

468
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,656
Then does that mean I could--

469
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,283
But in your case,

470
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,243
you've overused your cords too much.

471
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,287
So it'd be difficult
for you to sing <i>pansori</i>

472
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,372
as well as you have before.

473
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,626
But there is some good news.

474
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:03,880
You'll have no trouble talking at all
on a daily basis.

475
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,636
I mean…

476
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,430
I get that I can talk.

477
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,016
But what about singing?

478
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,478
I don't quite understand what you mean.

479
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,564
I mean…

480
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,609
I can sing <i>pansori</i> again one day, right?

481
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,861
I'm sorry to say this,

482
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,404
but you'll have to give up <i>pansori.</i>

483
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,407
This can't be.

484
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,955
But you're an expert.

485
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,249
You know a way, don't you?

486
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,044
Come on, sir.

487
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,547
I'll do anything you tell me to.

488
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,176
So could you please fix my voice?

489
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:54,263
I heard that in the States,
they can fix anything with an operation.

490
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,225
I could get an operation for my voice.

491
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,559
It can't be done.

492
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,979
I'm sorry.

493
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,777
Jeongnyeon.

494
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,240
Are you sure he's an expert?

495
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,243
It makes no sense
that an operation can't be done.

496
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,913
It's because…
your vocal cords are too damaged.

497
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,499
I've seen others get their voices back
after damaging them.

498
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,418
So how come I can't get better?

499
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,919
Why can't I?

500
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,380
Jeongnyeon.

501
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:28,965
Jeongnyeon.

502
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,383
Jeongnyeon!

503
00:34:55,426 --> 00:35:02,433
<i>Upon</i>

504
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:06,270
<i>The marble</i>

505
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:11,651
<i>Carved from coral reefs</i>

506
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:21,202
<i>A wild goose</i>

507
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,622
<i>Flies…</i>

508
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,797
This won't make your voice come back.

509
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,258
You need to accept your reality.

510
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,471
You need to find your path again…

511
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,474
even if you've lost your voice.

512
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,936
What do you want me to accept?

513
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,026
That I've lost my voice for good?

514
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,741
What can a <i>pansori</i> singer
who lost her voice possibly do?

515
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,208
It's late. Where are you going?

516
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,253
To the mountain.

517
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,672
I lost my voice in the mountain,

518
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,966
so I'm going there to get it back.

519
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,426
Are you insane?

520
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,264
Are you trying to get eaten
by some wild animal going out this late?

521
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,892
I'd rather get eaten by a wild animal
than live like this.

522
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,772
Get your act together!

523
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,566
This won't make your voice come back.

524
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,945
Then what in the world
am I supposed to do?

525
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,739
Medicine doesn't work,

526
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,491
acupuncture doesn't work,

527
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:09,370
and nothing I ever do seems to work.

528
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,454
So what now?

529
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:17,920
What should I do to sing again?

530
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,428
I'm begging you.

531
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,517
Please tell me what to do
so I can sing again.

532
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,148
I'm begging you.

533
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,708
Get back inside.

534
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,835
Rehearsal's not over yet.

535
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,299
Let's go.

536
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,969
Guys, let's go. Come on.

537
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,935
She was already gone when I woke up.

538
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,775
<i>Dear Director.</i>

539
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,154
<i>I'm going back home.</i>

540
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,326
<i>Please forgive me</i>

541
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,079
<i>for leaving without saying goodbye.</i>

542
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,497
<i>From Yoon Jeongnyeon.</i>

543
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,797
Don't worry about someone
who's already left.

544
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,758
You both should focus on the performance.

545
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,391
{\an8}The Blooming Autumn Field

546
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,667
Oh, my goodness.

547
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,086
Jeongnyeon!

548
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,063
There, there.

549
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,440
It's okay.

550
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,193
It's okay.

551
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,155
Good job coming home.

552
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,783
Good job, Jeongnyeon.

553
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:18,512
Chunhyangjeon

554
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,699
You're making medicine?

555
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,994
Make sure to take this every morning
and evening starting tomorrow.

556
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:29,166
You're looking worse and worse every day.

557
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,882
Mother…

558
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,887
After you lost your voice…

559
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,557
how long did it take for you to be okay?

560
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,148
Something keeps raging inside me…

561
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,319
and I feel like I'll burn to death.

562
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,669
Jeongnyeon.

563
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,257
Some days…

564
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:24,513
it was suffocating,
like something was sitting on my chest.

565
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,311
And some days, I'd feel better about it.

566
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,233
And on other days,
I'd be absolutely furious

567
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,112
and cry myself to exhaustion.

568
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,160
I'd get sick from time to time…

569
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,579
and keep going back and forth.

570
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,126
And it turns out I could live on.

571
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:02,050
So stop looking back
on what you've left behind.

572
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,263
Just keep looking forward.

573
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,767
That's how you can keep going.

574
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,442
The smoke is getting into my eyes.

575
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,893
Stay seated.

576
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:02,820
Let's warm up with
<i>The Song of Four Seasons</i> today.

577
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,739
Jeongnyeon, you can start.

578
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,746
I mean, Youngseo.

579
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,915
Youngseo, you start.

580
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:21,046
<i>The flowers</i>

581
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,423
<i>Are abloom</i>

582
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:30,305
<i>It is spring indeed</i>

583
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,685
<i>The flowers</i>

584
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:37,187
<i>Are abloom</i>

585
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:54,913
Director.

586
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,417
Yes?

587
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,839
I thought a lot
about whether I should tell you this.

588
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,676
But now that Jeongnyeon has left,

589
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,970
I think you should know.

590
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:16,435
So you actually saw and heard…

591
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,439
Hyerang doing this?

592
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,065
Yes.

593
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,742
You want me to leave Maeran
after the joint performance?

594
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,035
You heard me right.

595
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:39,041
I want you to leave our troupe
after the joint performance is over.

596
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,669
Who's going to replace me once I'm gone?

597
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,755
That's none of your business.

598
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,841
You can't just kick me out like this.

599
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,553
I've worked so hard for Maeran.

600
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,933
I was out there day and night
promoting our troupe,

601
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,225
and that's how we grew!

602
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,644
You're right.

603
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:03,065
Our troupe grew
alongside you and Okgyeong.

604
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,318
Then as the face of our troupe,

605
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:09,863
you should have been more responsible
and taken care of the trainees.

606
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,741
Not destroy them one by one.

607
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:16,536
How could I just stand by and watch
as they tried to take my place?

608
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,998
What kind of an idiot
just lets others take what's theirs?

609
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,293
So…

610
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,881
now that you've cut off their buds,
what's left for you?

611
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:34,096
Are you going to keep clinging…
to Okgyeong's shell?

612
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:39,434
I'm to blame for all this
since I failed to stop you…

613
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:42,938
from ending up like this.

614
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,358
Fine.

615
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,903
After the performance,
I'll gladly leave the troupe.

616
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,245
But know this.

617
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,998
If I leave, Okgyeong will leave too.

618
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,792
Do you still not get it?

619
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,670
You can't manipulate Okgyeong…

620
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,007
to do what you want.

621
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:28,191
I think I can sound more carefree
from the beginning

622
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,152
since she's the lovable crybaby princess

623
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:34,114
who disarms everyone with her warmth.

624
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:41,872
Youngseo.

625
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,171
Oh, I'm sorry.

626
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,800
We were talking about Pyeonggang, right?

627
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:59,389
Yes, I think it'd be better
to show more of her innocence.

628
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,359
Sorry.

629
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,490
Where were we again?

630
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,523
Hey, let me do it. You should go rest.

631
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,108
It's fine.

632
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,776
You go rest.

633
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,363
Just how many did you do?

634
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,781
Oh, goodness me!

635
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,492
It's as smelly as ever.

636
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,703
Well, look who it is.

637
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,373
It's that brat who talked back to me.

638
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,542
I guess you're back from Seoul, huh?

639
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,003
All right.

640
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,672
Here, just take it.

641
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,007
I'm actually glad to see you.

642
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,468
How about a song?

643
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:22,139
I'm carrying a lot of cash today.

644
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,599
All right, we hear you.

645
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,726
Just take this and go.

646
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,020
She's sick, okay?

647
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:32,107
I don't give a damn.
She sings when I tell her to sing.

648
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,276
She was happy to sing last time
when no one asked her to.

649
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,819
What, you can't now?

650
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,446
I don't know how to sing.

651
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,950
Stop disrupting our business and go.

652
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,035
Would you look at this brat?

653
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:49,416
Hey, kid.
Are you trying to get killed on purpose?

654
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,042
Just kill me then.

655
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,086
What?

656
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,132
I said kill me.

657
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,850
I guess you must have
lost your mind in Seoul.

658
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:08,810
But did you hear?

659
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,562
In cases like this,

660
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,481
a good beating is what you need.

661
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,069
All right, boys. Trash it all.

662
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,531
Let's go!

663
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,575
No!

664
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,826
- Stop it!
- Move it!

665
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,994
Don't!

666
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,623
I said stop it!

667
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,970
I can't believe them.

668
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,265
We can't even sell any of these now.

669
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,936
Those blasted scoundrels.

670
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,772
I hope you all get hit by lightning!

671
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,190
<i>Cheap honey taffy</i>

672
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:58,818
<i>This taffy is dirt cheap</i>

673
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:03,406

<i>All kinds of precious herbs</i>

677
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,838
<i>And even ginseng for this taffy</i>

680
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,064
Hey, they're burning.

681
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,447
Mother.

682
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,078
Is Jeongnyeon going to be okay?

683
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,833
She's working nonstop from dawn till dusk.

684
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,960
I'm so worried for her.

685
00:54:57,043 --> 00:55:01,464
Sometimes she stares into nothing
like she's totally out of it.

686
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,841
Just leave her be.

687
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:07,637
Only time… will heal her.

Director.

699
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,599
Moon Okgyeong, the Prince of Gukgeuk,
wanders around opium den

700
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:41,815
How could you do this, Mr. Ma?
Who are you calling an opium addict?

701
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,025
Explain herself?

702
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:47,362
What does she have to explain
when she's done nothing wrong?

703
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,155
Release another statement right now!

704
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,039
- Ms. Moon! A word, please!
- Okgyeong! It's okay!

705
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,624
Who were the people
who took opium with you?

706
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,668
Is it true that you're still using opium?

707
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,002
Does Maeran Gukgeukdan know about this?

708
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,879
Ms. Moon, a word, please!

709
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:12,846
The investors
are demanding their money back.

710
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,181
What's going on? Opium addiction?

711
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,183
You already know the answer.

712
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,437
You've seen me up close
all throughout our rehearsals.

713
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,605
Did I ever seem
like I was addicted to opium?

714
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,693
I know the other troupes aren't happy
with Maeran right now,

715
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,695
so you would have
raised the issue yourself

716
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,072
if you thought I had a problem.

717
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,616
Am I wrong?

718
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,162
It doesn't matter what we believe.
The public's not going to buy it.

719
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,246
It does matter.

720
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,415
If you don't believe me,

721
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:43,251
then of course the public won't either.

722
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,337
If we turn against each other,

723
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,631
the public always notices.

724
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,176
Okgyeong's right.

725
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,345
In times like these,
we need to unite even more

726
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,139
and show everyone
that we believe Okgyeong.

727
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,474
Sobok.

728
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:00,351
The investors
haven't withdrawn their money yet.

729
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,937
I'll talk to them
and convince them myself.

730
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:08,735
And Okgyeong, you will meet with the press
and release a counterstatement.

731
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,488
Don't just say you didn't do it,

732
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:15,074
but make sure to counter
each and every point from the allegation.

733
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:16,826
Okay.

734
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,210
You really want us to go through
with the performance with this fiasco?

735
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,587
What if things keep going south?

736
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,672
I can't do it.

737
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,425
And the other troupes
are probably feeling the same.

738
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,221
If we end up losing money
with this joint performance,

739
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,139
Maeran will take full responsibility.

740
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,518
Are you serious?

741
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:45,480
The future of Maeran
and female <i>gukgeuk</i> itself

742
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,941
hangs on this joint performance.

743
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,612
Okgyeong has always been
and continues to be

744
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:57,158
the face of female <i>gukgeuk </i>itself.

745
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,453
If we can't protect our prince,

746
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,498
it won't just jeopardize our performance,

747
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:06,292
but female <i>gukgeuk</i> itself as well.

748
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,011
Where's everyone else?

749
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:18,846
I don't know.

750
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,891
Everyone's been so agitated…

751
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,018
because of Okgyeong's article.

752
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,188
I think things are pretty bad right now.

753
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,482
The article is
all anyone's been talking about.

754
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:37,240
Jooran. Someone's here for you.

755
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,372
Jooran.

756
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,003
Mom, what are you doing here?

757
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,550
Did she fall sick again?

758
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,218
Is she back in the hospital?

759
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:01,014
Fortunately, she was discharged yesterday.

760
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,268
I had no idea.

761
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,439
I'll visit home this weekend.

762
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,108
Jooran.

763
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,153
How long are you planning
on staying in the troupe?

764
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,947
Are you telling me to quit again?

765
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,618
Mom, please give me a little more time.

766
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,454
I've finally started to get proper roles,

767
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:27,582
and I'll be able to send more money home
once I get paid more.

768
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,087
We received a good marriage offer for you.

769
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,968
He's a government worker,
and he's a great man.

770
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,346
Mom…

771
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,514
He said that once he marries you,

772
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:47,727
he'll take care of your sister's
hospital and medicine fees for good.

773
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:52,190
This must be a match sent from heaven.

774
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,401
You know how sick your sister is.

775
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:58,821
How long will you play around
in that theater troupe?

776
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:21,010
The Princess and the Fool

777
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:26,808
I want us to stand on stage
face-to-face one day

778
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,393
with you as the male lead

779
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,895
and me as the female lead.

780
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,980
I'd love to!

781
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,756
I don't deny
that I've used opium in the past.

782
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:04,137
But once I started <i>gukgeuk,</i>
I have never once used it.

783
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,597
Yes?

784
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,641
But according to the article,

785
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:13,104
a witness saw you frequenting
an opium den with your friends.

786
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,565
To perform a single <i>gukgeuk</i> show,

787
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,775
I have to practice
for at least six hours a day

788
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,819
for two whole months.

789
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:25,408
If I really were that addicted to opium,
how could I have survived such a schedule?

790
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,914
I'm directly addressing
the witness from the article.

791
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:34,959
If you really have recently seen me
at an opium den,

792
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:37,879
then come out and address me directly.

793
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,601
You're always practicing till late.

794
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:53,561
Yes.

795
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,355
Are you nervous
about the upcoming performance?

796
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:00,401
Uh, Ondal has
a lot of sword-fighting scenes,

797
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,320
and I don't want to make any mistakes.

798
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:05,281
There's no need to be nervous
just because it's a joint performance.

799
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:06,783
Just do as you've always done.

800
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,409
It's not that.

801
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,538
I'm playing the younger version of you.

802
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,916
So this performance means a lot to me.

803
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:16,751
Is that so?

804
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:20,797
Your name, Moon Okgyeong,
represents female <i>gukgeuk </i>itself.

805
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,926
It has until now, and it always will.

806
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:29,597
So I want to be perfect in this role
befitting your reputation.

807
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,143
I'm very thankful
that you have such determination.

808
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:40,399
The fact that you've reached this point
after fierce competition

809
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,360
proves that you deserve to take my place.

810
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:43,778
Really?

811
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,947
Of course.

812
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,119
What about Jeongnyeon?

813
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,914
Jeongnyeon?

814
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:02,797
I used to feel so excited about her.

815
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:09,512
I thought that with all her imperfections,
I had found a diamond in the rough.

816
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,058
I still don't think I was wrong though.

817
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,311
But what use is that now?

818
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,940
In the end, she left us.

819
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:27,822
The audience only applauds
the one who has survived to be on stage.

820
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:32,118
And they applaud the most for the prince.

821
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,038
And they will applaud you too.

822
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:38,958
I do crave the audience's applause…

823
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,796
but I crave your applause even more.

824
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:53,848
Youngseo.

825
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,144
If I asked you to leave Maeran with me,

826
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,271
would you?

827
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:46,567
JEONGNYEON: THE STAR IS BORN

828
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:49,195
{\an8}<i>How about you pay Jeongnyeon a visit?</i>

829
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,489
{\an8}<i>How dare you show your face here?</i>

830
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:52,573
{\an8}<i>Mother!</i>

831
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,867
{\an8}<i>I'm here to take Jeongnyeon back.</i>

832
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:55,952
{\an8}You have something to say?

833
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,371
{\an8}<i>Jeongnyeon's already a lost cause.</i>

834
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:00,748
{\an8}<i>But I still need her.</i>

835
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:04,835
{\an8}<i>You know better than anyone</i>

836
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,213
{\an8}<i>how desperate she must be for her dream.</i>

837
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,547
{\an8}<i>Mother.</i>

838
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,633
{\an8}<i>Singing is the only way</i>

839
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:13,594
{\an8}<i>to feel this huge release inside me.</i>
