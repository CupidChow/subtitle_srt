1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,138
It is the 1950s,
following the devastating Korean War.

2
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,266
Female gukgeuk, or traditional theater,
captures the heart of the public,

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,394
and many girls dream of becoming princes.

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,980
Playing the role of Yoon Jeongnyeon,

5
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,399
a pansori genius
who dives into the world of stars,

6
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,525
is Kim Taeri.

7
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,943
Playing the role of Heo Youngseo,

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,613
an elite trainee skilled at singing,
dancing, and even acting,

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,823
is Shin Yeeun.

10
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,825
Playing the role of Moon Okgyeong,

11
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,036
the undisputed Prince of Maeran,
is Jung Eunchae.

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,746
Playing the role of Seo Hyerang,

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,540
the beautiful flower of Maeran,
is Kim Yoonhye.

14
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,624
And last but not least

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,377
is the director of all the girls
who dream of becoming princes,

16
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,130
Kang Sobok played by Ra Miran.

17
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,967
We want to thank you for your patience

18
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,805
as we proudly present
the story of Jeongnyeon!

19
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,474
"Jeongnyeon: The Star Is Born"

20
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
"Narrator: Cho Yeongsuk
First-generation female gukgeuk actor"

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,437
All characters, places, organizations,
and events in this show are fictional.

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,980
The show contains Japanese expressions
to reflect the time period.

23
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,191
{\an8}Act 11

24
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,007
{\an8}Did you read the news?

25
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,176
{\an8}They're all talking about Moon Okgyeong.

26
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,636
{\an8}Apparently, she'll be in films now.

27
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,388
{\an8}Then what will happen to our troupe?

28
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,473
{\an8}Are we all done for?

29
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,391
{\an8}Hey, what are you talking about?

30
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,852
{\an8}She's right, you know.

31
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,813
{\an8}How will we perform without a male lead?

32
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,694
All right, the director is running late
because something came up.

33
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,946
Let's start by ourselves.

34
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,992
What is it? What's with the mood?

35
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,870
Is our troupe in trouble?

36
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,164
The director's out to borrow money,
isn't she?

37
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,459
Is Okgyeong really not coming back?

38
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,546
Hey, it's obvious she isn't.

39
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,256
How many times are you going to ask that?

40
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,465
What's wrong with asking?

41
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,050
Quiet!

42
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,970
Don't worry about what you hear outside.

43
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,598
We've always had people quit
because they couldn't handle the grind.

44
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,517
We'll just pick out new trainees.

45
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,980
I'm a new trainee.

46
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,732
If you would have me.

47
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,776
Hey!

48
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,861
Hey!

49
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,028
It's Jeongnyeon!

50
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,655
You little brat!

51
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,615
I was worried sick because of you.

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,160
How have you been?

53
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,619
Welcome back.

54
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,288
Everyone's been waiting for you.

55
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,290
Doaeng.

56
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,586
And the one who waited for you the most
was Chorok.

57
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,172
Oh, really?

58
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,631
No! I was busy.

59
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,218
And I'm not a trainee anymore.

60
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:58,928
I'm an official troupe actor.

61
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,305
- What?
- She's right.

62
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:04,017
Chorok, Youngseo, and Jooran
aren't trainees anymore.

63
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,435
They're official actors now.

64
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,107
My goodness, is that so?

65
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,358
That's amazing.

66
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,404
Meanwhile, I'll have to take
the entrance test again.

67
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,657
I guess I'll have to treat you
with more respect now.

68
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,912
That's okay.
Just treat me as you always have.

69
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,289
I'll allow it as your gracious senior.

70
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,752
How's your voice, by the way?

71
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,961
Are you all better now?

72
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,798
You're here because you can sing
like you used to, right?

73
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,717
Ah…

74
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,346
That's…

75
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,892
Hey! Stop pestering her with questions
when she just came back.

76
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,310
Learn to…

77
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,187
hold back your questions.

78
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,108
You must be so tired.
Why don't you take a little rest?

79
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,155
What the… What's with your tone?

80
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,659
All right, take your seats.

81
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,332
Jeongnyeon,
you should go greet the director first.

82
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,917
Okay.

83
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,805
I'm really sorry.

84
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:29,727
But I promise to pay you back
if you could extend the due date.

85
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,147
Yes, I'm really sorry.

86
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,232
Okay.

87
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,246
{\an8}Moon Okgyeong disappears
from female gukgeuk

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,502
Yes?

89
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,715
Director.

90
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,555
I just arrived.

91
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,058
It took a while
to get my mother's approval.

92
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,228
Yes, welcome back.

93
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:17,692
And I'll take the entrance test
as soon as the date is finalized.

94
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,403
If you're wanting my approval,

95
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,197
then you don't need to take the test.

96
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,282
No.

97
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,701
I really want to.

98
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:30,621
I'm still not sure if I'll be able to sing
as well as I want to.

99
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,499
I'd like to see for myself.

100
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,546
If that's what you want,

101
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,174
I'll let you know
when and where it will be held.

102
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,800
Okay.

103
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,652
Hey, Youngseo.

104
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,113
I can't find Okgyeong anywhere.

105
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:08,159
I wanted to greet her,
but I guess she didn't come today?

106
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,370
Okgyeong…

107
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,039
quit the troupe.

108
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,709
-She quit?
-Yes.

109
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,462
What do you mean?

110
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,965
You mean she joined another troupe?

111
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,717
No.

112
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,096
She quit gukgeuk altogether.

113
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,601
She disappeared after the first show
of the joint performance.

114
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,605
So we couldn't properly finish
the production,

115
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,192
and the director's been really busy
trying to make up for that.

116
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,242
Okgyeong!

117
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,831
You're Hyerang's niece, right?

118
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,170
Could you tell me if Okgyeong is home?

119
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,631
I really need to meet her.

120
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,716
The prince left.

121
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,553
So the princess is sad.

122
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,680
Do you know where she went?

123
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,391
Okgyeong, is that you?

124
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,851
Okgyeong…

125
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,356
Get inside, Eunjae.

126
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,279
What are you doing here?

127
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,699
I heard that Okgyeong left.

128
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,369
Do you happen to know where--

129
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,662
I don't know.

130
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,957
And I wouldn't tell you even if I did.

131
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,294
Okay.

132
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,756
You think you can be the prince
now that Okgyeong is gone?

133
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,925
That's what you think, isn't it?

134
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,553
They say once the king is absent,
the fool steps up.

135
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,598
But you should forget it.

136
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,642
You can never become Moon Okgyeong.

137
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,855
You should have kept singing for money
in your dingy little hometown

138
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,565
where you belonged.

139
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,735
Oh, right.

140
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,653
I was mistaken about one thing.

141
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,491
I thought Okgyeong treasured you.

142
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,035
But you know…

143
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,622
she lost interest in you
the moment you lost your voice.

144
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,336
That's how little you meant to her.

145
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,630
Did you know?

146
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:38,392
You haven't changed at all.

147
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,315
I don't know why I ever listened
to someone like you.

148
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,319
You're just an empty shell.

149
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,203
I had a hard time…

150
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,831
when I heard Okgyeong had left.

151
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,960
It felt like…

152
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,421
she had abandoned me.

153
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,136
But I've decided to remember her fondly.

154
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,015
After all,

155
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,810
the one who introduced me to gukgeuk…

156
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,063
was Okgyeong.

157
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,984
So…

158
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,487
you should let her go as well.

159
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,908
There's no point holding on to someone…

160
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,619
who's never coming back.

161
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,506
Maeran Gukgeukdan

162
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,768
I don't think…

163
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,438
anyone could have changed Okgyeong's mind.

164
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,483
I thought everything would be okay

165
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,944
if I just came back.

166
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,657
I thought Maeran and Okgyeong…

167
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,453
would still be the same.

168
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,165
How naive of me.

169
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,750
I'm still here.

170
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,920
I'm not leaving, no matter what.

171
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,298
Plus,

172
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,342
you're back as well.

173
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,722
We'll have to fill in for Okgyeong now.

174
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,350
You definitely could.

175
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,145
But my voice is all messed up.

176
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,232
If anyone hears
I'm filling in for Okgyeong,

177
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,817
they'd laugh.

178
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,985
Then let them.

179
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,029
I know it.

180
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,657
You're more than qualified.

181
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,369
And don't forget.

182
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,163
You're the only person
I've ever considered to be my rival.

183
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,835
Of course,

184
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,463
it's a bit early to say,

185
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,508
since I'm an official actor
and you're not even a trainee yet, but--

186
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,801
My goodness.

187
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,178
So you mean I'm nowhere near your level?

188
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,680
Of course.

189
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,601
Oh.

190
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,444
Jooran!

191
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,447
Hong Joo…

192
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,588
I really liked the script.

193
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,007
There's just one thing.

194
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,552
If we're going to tell this story,

195
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,638
I think it'll be good
to include some scenes

196
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,099
that could showcase
the scale of the performance.

197
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:11,147
I'd like for the queen's coronation
and the war to be bigger in scale.

198
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,025
So when would you be able
to revise the script?

199
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,987
Well, the thing is…

200
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,281
Is there a problem?

201
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,533
Uh, the truth is…

202
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:26,495
I received an offer
to write for the film industry.

203
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,499
I think I'll have to focus on that
from now on.

204
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,044
Then…

205
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,964
you can't work on this script anymore?

206
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,008
I'm sorry.

207
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,260
I'll pay for the coffee.

208
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,887
But Mr. Kwon…

209
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,859
I brought this.

210
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,445
"Return to us, Moon Okgyeong."

211
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,613
"Return to us."

212
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,156
- Mine's the usual.
- Good.

213
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,325
- Let's begin.
- Yeah, we don't need more people.

214
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,827
- What's important is Okgyeong.
- Mm.

215
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,121
Let's gather more people tomorrow.

216
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:17,338
This is the new production
that you will be auditioning for.

217
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,924
The title is The Queen of Silla.

218
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,176
It's a story about Queen Seondeok.

219
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,594
Queen Seondeok?

220
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,429
Was she from the Joseon dynasty?

221
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,765
You idiot.

222
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,725
She just said she's the queen of Silla.

223
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,685
This is a new play, isn't it?

224
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,770
I think so.

225
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,896
- I've never heard of it.
- You're right.

226
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,566
This is a new play
written by Mr. Kwon Yeongseop.

227
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,985
The script hasn't been finalized yet,

228
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,446
but it won't be revised too much.

229
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,073
The audition will use this script

230
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,617
to select the female lead, Queen Seondeok,

231
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,079
and the male lead, Kim Yusin.

232
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,666
I will allow trainees
to try out for this audition,

233
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,086
so anyone willing is welcome to do so.

234
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,587
Jeongnyeon.

235
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:03,092
You will have to pass the entrance test
to audition for any role.

236
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,802
Yes, ma'am.

237
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,185
Hey.

238
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,314
This seems like a pretty big production.

239
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,484
Are we able to handle it
with the situation we're in?

240
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,195
It won't be easy for the director

241
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,948
to pass on a play this big.

242
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,617
That's how we'll show
our troupe is still going strong.

243
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,620
Hey, those are things
for the adults to discuss.

244
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,664
They'll figure something out, okay?

245
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,292
So, Chorok, you're auditioning
for Queen Seondeok, right?

246
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,376
Of course.

247
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,921
Since Hyerang isn't here anymore,
who else could play the female lead?

248
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,715
- Jooran.
- Hey.

249
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,599
Yes, I get what you mean.

250
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,103
How about we talk about this
when we meet later?

251
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,396
All right.

252
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,610
Do you have something to tell me?

253
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,487
Director…

254
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,282
About The Queen of Silla…

255
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,787
Isn't it too much for us right now
to put on such a big production?

256
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,748
This is about the production cost,
isn't it?

257
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,416
Don't worry.

258
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,170
I was just on the phone
with someone who wants to invest in us.

259
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,257
I think you'd know her.

260
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,176
You remember Hongmae from our early days?

261
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,928
Yes, I remember her.

262
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,390
Didn't a textile factory owner marry her
as his second wife?

263
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,894
Apparently, she received
a hefty inheritance after he died,

264
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,940
and she was looking
for places to invest in.

265
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,317
That's good.

266
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,779
We're going to hold an audition
for all the roles.

267
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,075
The audition
for our last joint performance

268
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,494
was a huge hit.

269
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,622
If we can arouse the crowd
with the audition,

270
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,999
it'll be easier
to promote the production itself.

271
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,045
You're as passionate as ever, Director.

272
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,175
But enough talk about your production.

273
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,262
Let's get into our business.

274
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,390
What?

275
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,183
I'll get to the point.

276
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:20,604
I want to buy
Maeran Gukgeukdan's building.

277
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,940
I'll make sure to give you a good deal.

278
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,108
What…

279
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,028
What do you mean
you want to buy our building?

280
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:34,159
Didn't you call me
to invest in our production?

281
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,038
I don't care about gukgeuk anymore.

282
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,623
Once I buy your building,

283
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,292
I'm going to turn it into a hostess bar.

284
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,503
A bar?

285
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,922
Does that hurt your pride?

286
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,299
I can imagine.

287
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:55,264
You kicked me out
because I made money off of Maeran's fame.

288
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,766
What was it you said?

289
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,851
Right.

290
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:03,313
You said I'd never be an artist,

291
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,108
selling my cheap talent everywhere.

292
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,364
For someone as noble as you
to meet with me…

293
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,326
I guess you really are short on money.

294
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,955
I shouldn't have come.

295
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,625
You still haven't paid off your debt
from when you bought that building.

296
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,336
How do you know that?

297
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,380
I have a business partner.

298
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,549
You'd know him.

299
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,843
Come in.

300
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,803
Goodness me.

301
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,349
Hello, Director.

302
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,144
How have you been?

303
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,442
What are you doing here?

304
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,201
Director,

305
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,536
don't be so stubborn.

306
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,539
This is a great opportunity
to hand over the building.

307
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,167
No.

308
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,127
I'll never do it.

309
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,756
Do you even know
what that building means to me?

310
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,885
That building is
the foundation of our troupe itself.

311
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,804
It's not something for sale!

312
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,225
That building's a piece of junk.

313
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,520
It'd be much better for you
to hand it over to me.

314
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,608
I'll be waiting for some good news.
All right?

315
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,111
This way, ma'am.

316
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,971
Ma'am?

317
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,440
Are you all right?

318
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,527
I'm all right.

319
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,800
Are you leaving?

320
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,306
Do you have places to go?

321
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,766
Someone I know works for a film company.

322
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,520
I'm sorry for letting you down, girls.

323
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,605
Don't be, ma'am.

324
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,774
We're the ones who are sorry.

325
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,262
Director!

326
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,680
Can you hear me?

327
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,058
Director! Director…

328
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,653
What did the doctor say?

329
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,572
She pushed herself too hard.

330
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,200
He said she'll get better
after a few days of rest.

331
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,622
What happened?

332
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,500
Well…

333
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:56,338
Sugyeong and Geumhui… left the troupe.

334
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,550
And the director saw them leave.

335
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,478
-What's for dinner?
-Pass it around.

336
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,146
Me, me! What is it?

337
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,648
Enjoy.

338
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,277
What is this?

339
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,738
Our food is getting worse and worse.

340
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,741
They kept giving us fewer dishes,
and now it's rice balls?

341
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,327
Maybe they were too busy to get groceries.

342
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,871
I'm sure it'll get better tomorrow.

343
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,456
Wake up, will you?

344
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,085
We're never going to get
anything better than these.

345
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,463
The good old days are behind us.

346
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,217
Are we really going to shut down?

347
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,927
No, we're not.

348
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,804
Maybe not in the near future,

349
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,473
but it'll be difficult
to get back to what we once were.

350
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,476
Apparently, Maeran's paying off
all the debts and cancellation fees

351
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,270
from the joint performance.

352
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,439
I knew it.

353
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,150
So that's why they reduced
our already tiny allowance.

354
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,694
If even the food's going to be like this,

355
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,904
how can I survive?

356
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,573
Stop with your complaints.

357
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,117
Remember the director just collapsed.

358
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,162
Why did she collapse anyway?

359
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,372
Sugyeong and Geumhui
left the troupe today.

360
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,833
She must have been shocked.

361
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,587
Hey, maybe we should also leave
and look for something else.

362
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,714
Hey…

363
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,885
you shouldn't say such things
when the director's just collapsed.

364
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,179
That's a bit much.

365
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,975
And when the director returns?
You think things will change?

366
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,811
Those who left first are the smart ones.

367
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,982
Just you wait.
Those who stay are going to regret it.

368
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,278
If you want to leave, just leave quietly.

369
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,030
Why would you stir up the others?

370
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,032
What are you saying?

371
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,368
When did we do that?

372
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,495
We're just stating facts.

373
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,205
You're making us feel uneasy,

374
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,707
saying that if we stay, we'll regret it.

375
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,877
Why? Because you're too ashamed
to leave by yourselves.

376
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,130
Are you trying to coerce some trainees
to save face when you leave?

377
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,508
What the hell…

378
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,884
Are you done?

379
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,178
No, I'm not. Should I go on?

380
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,264
You think the trainees don't know?

381
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,101
We're all feeling uneasy
after Okgyeong left us.

382
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,685
You're our seniors.

383
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,063
But instead of reassuring us,
you're busy fending for yourselves.

384
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:22,025
You think we should all just hold hands
and try to make the best of this?

385
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,236
Even Okgyeong left us.

386
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,030
Maeran's done for!

387
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,491
So leave by yourself if you want to.

388
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,494
Go ahead and join
that film company or whatever.

389
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,454
Stop wasting your time
trying to rope others in.

390
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,373
You've lost your mind, haven't you?

391
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,043
Hey, let go!

392
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,004
-Let go!
-You let go!

393
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,134
Oh, my goodness!
What is going on?

394
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,721
Stop it! I said stop!

395
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,141
Watch your mouth!

396
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,353
Fine. I'm leaving this godforsaken place.

397
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,481
- Sohyang, wait!
- Seriously.

398
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,858
Wait a minute.

399
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,359
Let her go!

400
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,777
It's done.

401
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,280
-She's leaving.
-But still…

402
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,532
Forget it!

403
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,742
Let's just eat.

404
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,664
Are you okay?

405
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,262
Hong Jooran.

406
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,391
Didn't you see what just happened?

407
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,478
We should be working together
to figure something out.

408
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,980
Not running away.

409
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:46,151
Why do you keep avoiding me?

410
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,950
I wasn't avoiding you.

411
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,661
Then what are you doing,
playing hide-and-seek?

412
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:58,997
I'm sorry.

413
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,334
You think I'm confronting you
to hear an apology?

414
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,962
What is going on with you?

415
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,382
Maeran is a mess,

416
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:14,221
and I'm still worried sick
about whether I'll be able to sing.

417
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,972
So why do you have to
add on to everything?

418
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,227
You think
I'm going to hurt you or something?

419
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,231
What have I ever done to you
for you to avoid me like this?

420
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,485
Jooran.

421
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,988
Aren't we friends?

422
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,292
I guess we're not.

423
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,855
What are you doing?
Aren't we rehearsing today?

424
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,234
We lost too many people.

425
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,194
We lost Geumhui and Sugyeong,

426
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,239
and now Sohyang and Bongseon too.

427
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,574
Hey.

428
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:19,953
They've been wanting to leave for a while.
We're better off without them.

429
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,543
Then the rest of us should be rehearsing.
We can't just sit around like this.

430
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,712
I just don't feel like it.

431
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,631
We might not even have a show.

432
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,231
Let's put on a show.

433
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,443
What show?

434
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,903
Tomorrow's supposed to be
my entrance test.

435
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,988
Let's showcase that.

436
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:59,117
But the director's not here.
And we don't even have any judges.

437
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,369
Judges aren't the only ones
who can evaluate me.

438
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,998
Anyone out there can listen to me sing

439
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,833
and judge how I sound.

440
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,418
So you're saying…

441
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,504
you'll have the crowd evaluate you?

442
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,548
-Yes.
-Sounds fun.

443
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,634
She's right.

444
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,970
There's no better evaluation
than having the crowd cheer for her

445
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,722
when they hear her sing.

446
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,641
Still, that's a stretch.

447
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,935
So if about 10 people cheer for her,
she passes?

448
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,813
That's not good enough.
We need a standard.

449
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,858
I'll be the standard.

450
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,820
I'll put on a show too.

451
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,033
Try to attract more people
to hear you sing than me.

452
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,620
If you have
even one more person in the audience,

453
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,414
then you'll get to join our troupe again.

454
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,500
But…

455
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,089
if you have
even just one less person than me,

456
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,133
you'll never get to join.

457
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,512
How about it?

458
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,139
Think you can do it?

459
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,315
Sure. Let's do it.

460
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,775
Brace yourself.

461
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,778
I won't go easy on you
just because you hurt your throat.

462
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,279
Oh, really?

463
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,031
Fine by me.

464
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,411
I'd be pretty mad
if you were planning to go easy on me.

465
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,497
Come at me with your worst.

466
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,625
And I'll do the same.

467
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,260
Heo Youngseo and Yoon Jeongnyeon

468
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,761
will be performing a gukgeuk show

469
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,888
at Changsuwon at 2 p.m.

470
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:47,976
and at Seoul Station
at 5 p.m. respectively!

471
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,145
Heo Youngseo
will be performing at Changsuwon

472
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,148
and Yoon Jeongnyeon at Seoul Station!

473
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,192
Heo Youngseo's performing at Changsuwon?

474
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,861
The one from The Princess and the Fool?

475
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:58,945
Yes, that's right.

476
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,322
Oh, my goodness! We'll have to be there!

477
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,366
- Yes, please be there!
- Yes!

478
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,502
"Changsuwon photos"

479
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,587
Get closer. That's good.

480
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,921
- Here.
- One, two, three.

481
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,511
How many do we have?

482
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,013
Almost 100.

483
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,849
There are more lined up outside
to hear Youngseo sing.

484
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,018
This is too unfair to Jeongnyeon.

485
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,313
Youngseo's already popular
from the joint performance.

486
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,440
That's her fan club.

487
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,277
There's just too many people.

488
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,863
Look at this.
Jeongnyeon's at a disadvantage.

489
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,784
Are you here to watch?

490
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,868
Did she start?

491
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,036
Not yet.

492
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,375
Free performance
by Maeran Gukgeukdan's rising star

493
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,879
When is she coming?

494
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,590
Just wait, will you? It's Heo Youngseo.

495
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,053
Hmm?

496
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,056
- It's Heo Youngseo!
- It's her!

497
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,766
It's Heo Youngseo!

498
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,236
Chunhyang.

499
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,156
Another day will dawn when tonight passes.

500
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,828
But I do not wish for the day to come,
when I will be alone thinking of you.

501
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,997
I only wish
for the night we spend together…

502
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,626
…to last longer.

503
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:40,296

Then shall we have a nice talk

521
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,673

Director…

527
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,746
You should eat something.

528
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,209
You haven't eaten anything in days.

529
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,502
Doaeng.

530
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,381
Where did I go wrong?

531
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,010
Was I supposed to give Okgyeong
what she wanted…

532
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,806
before she got tired of us?

533
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,768
But…

534
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:04,232
if we had put on
all those experimental shows,

535
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,317
we might have lost our audience.

536
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,488
No, that's not it.

537
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,157
I should have listened to you

538
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:18,746
and prepared the trainees more
for when Okgyeong and Hyerang left.

539
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,667
I shouldn't have relied
on those two this much.

540
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,751
Director.

541
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,338
Or…

542
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,842
maybe I shouldn't have pushed
the joint performance.

543
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,428
But…

544
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:37,432
that performance was the only chance
for female gukgeuk troupes to unite.

545
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,309
- Director!
- I did what I had to!

546
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,855
But look where it's gotten me.

547
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,983
I was stabbed in the back
by someone I trusted,

548
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,068
and all I have left is this huge debt!

549
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,238
And now I can't even protect my girls.

550
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,490
My poor girls.

551
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,952
They trusted me.

552
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,332
They trusted someone like me
to be their director.

553
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,635
How can I call myself a director
when I can't even protect them?

554
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,263
What kind of director am I?

555
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:21,392
What kind of director am I…

556
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:25,146
What kind of director am I…

557
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,108
Auntie.

558
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,820
Auntie!

559
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,491
There's something… you need to see.

560
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,501
Is this everyone?

561
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,586
It's barely 10 people.

562
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,272
It's past 5 p.m. now.

563
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,862
Should we wait until more people show up?

564
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,740
No.

565
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,373
I'm ready. Let's start.

566
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,422
Yoon Jeongnyeon?
I think I've heard that name before.

567
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,675
You know, she's Chae Gongseon's daughter.

568
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,343
-Oh, she's her daughter?
-Yes.

569
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,886
Let's see how good she is.

570
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,181
My goodness, a lot of you are here.

571
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,642
Ah, let me introduce myself.

572
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,603
My name is Yoon Jeongnyeon.

573
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:55,653
I'm going to sing some pansori for you.

574
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,030
But the thing is…

575
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,991
it's been a while since I've performed,

576
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,411
so I'm quite nervous and jittery.

577
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:07,832
So please feel free
to shout out your reactions.

578
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,834
All right!

579
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,335
And you kids,

580
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,588
I'll be counting on you
to clap a lot, okay?

581
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,048
Okay!

582
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,925
Please sit back and enjoy!

583
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,760
- Okay!
- Go ahead.

584
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,930
Once upon a time,

585
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,391
in Dohwa-dong, Hwangju,

586
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,936
there lived a blind man

587
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,397
living with his daughter.

588
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,608
The daughter's surname was Sim,
and her first name was…

589
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,068
Come on, what was her name?

590
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,361
It's Sim Cheong!

591
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,988
That's right, it was Cheong.

592
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,032
She's going to sing Simcheongga?

593
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,618
But those songs are so difficult.

594
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,994
No way.

595
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,246
To get back her father's eyesight…

596
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,248
She's not singing
The Blooming Autumn Field, is she?

597
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,333
…she throws herself into the sea.

598
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,962
My goodness.

599
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,839
It's freezing.

600
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,176
What to do? I'm going to freeze to death.

601
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,302
My goodness.

602
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,387
And that's when the heavens,

603
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,390
moved by her sacrifice,

604
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:10,561
revived her in a lotus flower
and had her marry an emperor.

605
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,605
-That's right!
-How beautiful!

606
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,899
After Empress Sim enters the palace,

607
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,360
the harvest is bountiful every year,

608
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,946
and laughter continues in every family.

609
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,406
- All right!
- Great!

610
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,367
Now autumn has come.

611
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,080
And like every year,
a goose takes flight into the sky.

612
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:32,917
Yes!

613
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,419
That's good.

614
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,137
And behold,

615
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,726
the goose is headed
to Empress Sim's hometown.

616
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,399
One night, she sits on a high ledge

617
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,529

What are you going to use
to fill the gaps in your voice?

649
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,146
I'll use…

650
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,234
my movements.

651
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,572

652
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,326
but I can still act.

00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,806

00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,164
Thank you so much!

685
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,667
Thank you for coming! Thank you!

686
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,586
Oh, my goodness! Jeongnyeon!

687
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,588
-Guys!
-Congratulations.

688
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,257
Youngseo had a lot of people,
but you had a bit more.

689
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,260
No way, really?

690
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,471
Yes, you did it.

691
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,348
Oh, my goodness!

692
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,353
Director!

693
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,188
Director.

694
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,648
Are you out of the hospital?

695
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,694
How did it feel to sing?

696
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,822
Absolutely amazing.

697
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,619
My voice was a mess though.

698
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,498
No.

699
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,208
Your broken voice…

700
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,087
is no longer a handicap for you.

701
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:35,923
You were…

702
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,676
Sim Cheong herself today.

703
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,220
Really?

704
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,429
Yes.

705
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,558
You did so well, Jeongnyeon.

706
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,273
I can't believe it.

707
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,528
All I was thinking
was to just finish it till the end.

708
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,699
Director.

709
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,117
Including today,

710
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:07,663
this is the third time you've accepted me.

711
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,499
So you have to take full responsibility
until the end.

712
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:15,713
Now that I'm an official trainee,

713
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,882
please watch me
as I become an official actor

714
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,761
and your male lead.

715
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,516
All right.

716
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,643
I will.

717
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,391
Jeongnyeon.

718
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,856
You were really great today.

719
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,941
I knew you could do it.

720
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,151
Well…

721
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,196
thanks for earlier.

722
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,406
I could finish well thanks to you.

723
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,408
Sure.

724
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,039
I wanted to congratulate you…

725
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,541
on coming back.

726
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,126
Thanks.

727
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:40,881
Then I'll be on my way now.

728
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:42,841
Wait.

729
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:45,886
Actually,

730
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,847
there's something I need to tell you.

731
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,852
About our audition back then.

732
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,397
That's all in the past now.

733
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,942
It's all right. I've forgotten about it.

734
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,360
No, wait.

735
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:05,322
I need to tell you this right now.

736
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:08,450
I don't think I'll have another chance.

737
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:13,288
Back when I told you
I couldn't audition with you

738
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,208
and that I couldn't rely on you…

739
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,044
I didn't mean it.

740
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,549
I'm sorry.

741
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,342
You weren't the problem.

742
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,552
I was.

743
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,681
But I hope you know this.

744
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:36,144
I really wanted to audition with you.

745
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:43,986
You don't need to say all this
just to console me.

746
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,529
No, I really mean it.

747
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,032
Yes, Youngseo was
the perfect partner for me,

748
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,869
but the one
who made my heart pound so much

749
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,830
that I'd forget I was even acting…

750
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:56,915
was you.

751
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,961
I blamed you because I was afraid
I wouldn't be able to focus with you.

752
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:08,218
I'll understand
if you continue to hate me all your life.

753
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,397
You silly girl.

754
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,693
Why won't you listen?

755
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,949
How many times do I have to tell you
it wasn't your fault?

756
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:36,663
I've never once blamed you
for what happened to my voice.

757
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,503
And how can I possibly hate you?

758
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,507
When I first came to Maeran…

759
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:53,972
you were the first person
who smiled at me.

760
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,062
Earlier today,

761
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:04,608
it had been so long
since I performed in front of people.

762
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,069
My heart was racing,

763
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,947
and my hands and voice
were trembling so much.

764
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:14,493
But when I locked eyes with you,

765
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,579
it all went away.

766
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,583
Once I knew that you were watching me,

767
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,212
there was nothing I was afraid of.

768
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,383
I hope…

769
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,554
you'll continue to stay with me
and watch me like today.

770
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,692
I'll… make you a promise.

771
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:52,114
I'm going to keep doing gukgeuk
no matter what happens.

772
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:57,077
So you have to keep watching how I grow…

773
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,372
until the end, okay?

774
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,349
I gave it some thought,

775
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:24,312
and I think The Queen of Silla
might be too much for us right now.

776
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:27,691
Even if we reduce the scale of the stage,
it'll still be difficult.

777
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,777
What a relief.

778
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,281
I was worried you might want
to push through with this production.

779
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:39,536
I want to try something new,
but it's not that easy.

780
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,873
But I don't want to rehash
our old productions again.

781
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,000
Director,

782
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,627
do you remember
The Legend of the Twin Pagodas?

783
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,922
We had given up on that
because it was too experimental.

784
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:54,760
Yes, but the story is
quite original and memorable.

785
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:59,681
But we'd have to take a risk
with an experimental play.

786
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,100
The rest of the play won't be a problem.

787
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,186
The issue is the ending.

788
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,687
You're right.

789
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,231
The lead will have to portray
a deranged artist,

790
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,984
but that's hard
even for an experienced actor.

791
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,909
Let's try it.

792
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,288
Perhaps either Youngseo or Jeongnyeon…

793
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,416
will be able to handle it.

794
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,473
I think this is it. You look beautiful.

795
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,650
You're so blessed.

796
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:57,072
Your groom wants to have a big wedding
with you in a beautiful veil.

797
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,577
Did you tell the troupe you're quitting?

798
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,454
No.

799
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,622
My goodness.

800
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,750
Your wedding date is set.
How long are you going to put it off?

801
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,545
The groom's family
might think less of you,

802
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,296
so move out of there as soon as possible.

803
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,673
Got it?

804
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,809
Ah.

805
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,435
What were you up to?

806
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,520
Nothing.

807
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,483
Have you read the script
for The Legend of the Twin Pagodas?

808
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,360
Yeah, it sounds fun.

809
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:38,363
But the story is just too sad.

810
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:43,994
I feel so bad for all three leads,
Asadal, Dalbi, and Asanyeo.

811
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,205
You're auditioning for Asadal, right?

812
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,249
Of course.

813
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,042
You're auditioning for Asanyeo, right?

814
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:56,047
That way,
we'll be on stage acting together.

815
00:52:56,631 --> 00:53:00,135
Don't forget about our promise, okay?

816
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,806
I'm going to become…

817
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,726
Maeran's prince.

818
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:11,479
So I really need your help.

819
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,064
My help?

820
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,483
A prince cannot act by himself.

821
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,028
He needs his princess by his side.

822
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,908
Of course, it won't be easy.

823
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,244
I'll have to fight tooth and nail
with Youngseo.

824
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:30,457
And that brat
has probably improved so much.

825
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,000
Jeongnyeon.

826
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:35,795
Let's do a scene
from the script right now.

827
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,005
Right now?

828
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,799
Sure, let's do it.

829
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,468
Which scene should we try?

830
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,762
Let's do Asadal's dream.

831
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,722
I want to try the scene

832
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:49,267
where the dying Asanyeo
appears in Asadal's dream.

833
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,102
Asadal.

834
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,357
Asanyeo.

835
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,903
My beautiful love.

836
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:02,739
You cannot fathom
how much I have missed you.

837
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:03,990
Asadal.

838
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,160
Seeing your face again,

839
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,662
I am…

840
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,081
I am…

841
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,965
My love.

842
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,634
Why are you so downcast on this fine day?

843
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:27,264
I am simply too overwhelmed
to finally see you.

844
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:28,765
Asanyeo.

845
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,727
My poor wife.

846
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,439
Asadal…

847
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,608
Please…

848
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,569
Please come see me.

849
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,075
What are you talking about?

850
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,245
I am here right now, am I not?

851
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,167
Until you come see me, my love…

852
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,214
I shall continue to wait

853
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,800
and pine for you.

854
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,680
So please…

855
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,475
Please…

856
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,257
Jooran.

857
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,387
Oh, wow.

858
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,644
I think I got too into character.

859
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,398
How was my acting?

860
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,028
"How was it?"

861
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:09,574
I thought Asanyeo
had jumped right out of the script.

862
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,451
My goodness.

863
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,287
When did you get this good?

864
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,424
Now, did everyone get their script

865
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,968
for The Legend of the Twin Pagodas?

866
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,053
Yes, ma'am.

867
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:34,849
Because we don't have much time
for this production,

868
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:38,103
we'll only be opening the audition
for the roles of Asadal and Asanyeo.

869
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:42,399
Doaeng and I will select
the actors for the rest of the roles.

870
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:47,779
Then we'll be holding
the audition for Asadal in two weeks.

871
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,447
Director.

872
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,825
Let's speed things up a bit.

873
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,661
The only people
who could play Asadal among us…

874
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,331
- are Jeongnyeon and Youngseo.
- She's right.

875
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,584
And it's more fun for us
to see them compete.

876
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,002
- Right?
- Is that so?

877
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:09,342
Then Jeongnyeon and Youngseo
will be auditioning for Asadal.

878
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,678
Can you prepare everything in two weeks?

879
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,888
-Yes.
-Yes.

880
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,015
Then moving on to Asanyeo--

881
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,267
Let's speed this up too.

882
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,018
-I could take--
-Yeah! Jooran and Chorok.

883
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,687
I wanted to say me.

884
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,105
Is that so?

885
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,149
Would that be okay for Jooran and Chorok?

886
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,067
Yes, I'd be happy to.

887
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,361
What about Jooran?

888
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,783
Do you need more time
to prepare for the audition?

889
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,287
That's not it.

890
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,167
Director.

891
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,170
I don't think I'll be able to audition.

892
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:49,299
What is it? Is something going on?

893
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,302
The Legend of the Twin Pagodas

894
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:56,139
I'll have to leave the troupe soon.

895
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,685
Leave the troupe? Why is that?

896
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,521
I'm getting married.

897
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,647
What?

898
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,816
- Married?
- She's getting married?

899
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,201
Then what do we do?

900
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,161
It's so sudden.

901
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,503
You're getting married?

902
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,004
What is this about?

903
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,632
You've never talked about this before.

904
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,301
It was decided quite recently.

905
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,431
Okay.

906
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,225
Of course you can get married.

907
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,145
But do you have to leave right now,
giving up on the audition?

908
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,981
You could leave after this production.

909
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:51,194
No, I'll have to leave within the week.

910
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,529
That soon?

911
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,197
The groom's family

912
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,200
wants me to focus on taking care
of my husband once I'm married.

913
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,161
And my parents want that too.

914
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,038
That's what the adults want.

915
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,165
What about you?

916
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:09,003
You have to make your own choices
for your life.

917
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,594
I think my time at Maeran is over.

918
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,013
From now on,

919
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,599
I'll live out the reality I've been given.

920
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,477
That's my choice.

921
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,918
When are you leaving?

922
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,879
Early tomorrow morning.

923
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,881
That soon?

924
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:04,350
Do you… really have to leave?

925
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,151
It'll only get harder to leave
the longer I stay.

926
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,739
I didn't know
I could be this cruel either.

927
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,824
It's not because you're cruel.

928
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,329
It's because
you might not go through with it…

929
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:28,791
…if you put it off.

930
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,420
Youngseo.

931
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:37,717
I was able to be my best on stage
because of you.

932
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:42,597
I never would have had the chance
if it weren't for you.

933
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,067
That's my line.

934
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,238
Thanks for everything.

935
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,785
Thank you, Jooran.

936
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,502
You were the best partner
I could ever have.

937
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,118
Jooran's leaving early tomorrow morning.

938
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,417
She'll be waiting in the rehearsal room.

939
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:51,118
You thought you could say goodbye
with just a note?

940
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:58,501
I'm glad I got to see your face
before I left.

941
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,422
What are you smiling for?

942
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,426
I'm not here
because I wanted to see you off.

943
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:13,891
I had to see you leave with my own eyes
to forget you completely.

944
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:15,935
Yes.

945
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:17,728
I know.

946
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,439
I can't wish you well.

947
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,402
I want you to feel guilty.

948
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:27,947
That's the only way…

949
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,783
you won't just forget about me.

950
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:33,786
Am I wrong?

951
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,373
You're going to forget about me…

952
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,334
and everything we went through here

953
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,670
and live on.

954
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,130
No.

955
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,590
I won't.

956
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:48,009
I don't believe you.

957
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,638
I won't believe anything you say
from now on.

958
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,899
I can't believe you.

959
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,739
How could you?

960
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,950
You're so…

961
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:26,756
Jeongnyeon.

962
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,259
Forget all about me and live your life.

963
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,472
I'll remember everything for us.

964
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:42,063
I promise
I'll live my whole life feeling guilty.

965
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:44,440
I promise to always suffer…

966
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,860
…every time I think of you.

967
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,215
Goodbye, Jeongnyeon.

968
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,806
My one and only prince.

969
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:59,283
Jeongnyeon: The Star Is Born

970
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,243
{\an8}What's going on?

971
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,328
{\an8}We're selling the property?

972
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:06,082
{\an8}Do you really need to go this far
for one last show?

973
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,583
{\an8}What can we do?

974
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,794
{\an8}We'll keep performing.

975
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:14,215
{\an8}This new production
will give birth to a new prince,

976
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:17,051
{\an8}which will mark the beginning
of a new era for my troupe.

977
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:18,719
{\an8}Some might call me crazy.

978
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,722
{\an8}But to me,

979
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:25,643
{\an8}those stars are my dreams
that help me survive.
