{\an8}Chorok.

27
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,201
{\an8}You need to prepare
for this thoroughly, understand?

28
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,535
{\an8}Yes, ma'am.

29
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,745
{\an8}Another thing.

{\an8}Jeongnyeon and Youngseo.

31
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,126
{\an8}I won't be choosing the scene

32
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:29,506
{\an8}So you can each choose the scene
you would like to perform.

33
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,716
{\an8}Yes, ma'am.

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,801
{\an8}Now then,

35
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,303
{\an8}let's warm up our voices.

00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,721
{\an8}Who will start the song?

37
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,598
{\an8}I'll do it.

38
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,851
{\an8}All right then. Begin.

39
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,606

<i>Is firstly your looks</i>

44
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,834
My beautiful love.

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,046
You cannot fathom
how much I have missed you.

46
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,669
My love.

47
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,046
Why are you so downcast

48
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,465
on this fine…

49
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,510
My love.

50
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,348
Why are you so downcast on this…

51
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,436
My love.

52
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,490
Looking for this?

53
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,119
What are you doing here?

54
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,538
Well…

55
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,834
I'm just here to take a look
at what's soon to be my property.

56
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,796
Look here.

57
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,173
- We should make this into a pond.
- Yes, sir.

58
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,925
How's the maintenance?

59
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,677
What are you on about?

60
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,387
The director is not selling this place.

61
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,099
Ah. Perhaps not right now.

62
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,142
But she'll come around.

63
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,311
Get out right now.

64
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,649
You think the director didn't report you
because she forgave you?

65
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,610
Get the hell out before I call the police.

66
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,862
Sure. Call the police.

67
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,990
If you drive me away,

68
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,201
you'll be driving away the only savior
who would ever buy this place.

69
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,078
Think about it.

70
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,373
Who else would buy a property
so heavily in debt?

71
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,627
Tell your precious director

72
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,879
not to drag this out.

73
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:01,175
Hongmae… isn't that patient.

74
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,304
Let's go.

75
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,267
Goodness gracious.

76
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,149
What's going on?

77
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,233
We're selling the property?

78
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,948
This is because of the debt
from the joint performance, isn't it?

79
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,785
Maeran took on all of the debt
from that performance.

80
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,748
We're trying to get the production budget
for the next performance…

81
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,795
…but the investors won't meet with us
because they already heard about it.

82
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,883
The director's trying to keep things
on the down low,

83
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,009
so you never heard this, all right?

84
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,221
Don't worry.

85
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,558
She'll do anything she can
to keep the production going.

86
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,186
Doaeng!

87
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,690
Oh, my gosh! Please come!

88
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,985
In the lounge… The lounge…

89
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,321
Get a move on!
Make sure to take that too!

90
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,823
- Hurry up!
- Wait…

91
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,950
What do you think you're doing?

92
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,285
Get out of the way!

93
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,204
Who are you?

94
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,623
Why don't you go ask your director?

95
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,167
Who do you think you are,
causing all this ruckus?

96
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,710
- Who do we think we are?
- Jeongnyeon.

97
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,296
Director!

98
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,090
- Let them pass.
- What?

99
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,299
Let them pass.

100
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,594
- All right, let's head out.
- Hurry up.

101
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,596
- Okay.
- Make sure to get everything!

102
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,474
- Get that too!
- Watch your step!

103
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,184
- Hold on…
- Come on, hurry up.

104
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,519
Grab the pots too.

105
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,854
- Let's get a move on!
- All right, more!

106
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,022
What are you doing?

107
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,526
What is this? Take this too!

108
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,610
That too.

109
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,862
Hurry up, take that!

110
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,617
- Hurry up!
- Please don't!

111
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,328
- Follow me.
- Please stop.

112
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,299
Are you here to see Mom?

113
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,761
I was on my way to say goodbye to you.

114
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,181
Where are you going? What's with the bag?

115
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,350
I'm leaving home.

116
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,894
I'm getting married.

117
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,690
- Married?
- Yes.

118
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,151
As soon as I get to the States.

119
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,319
I'm also…

120
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,281
quitting singing.

121
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,617
I just told Mom all this.

122
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,828
Wait…

123
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,539
I was always so jealous of you.

124
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,460
At least you liked doing <i>gukgeuk.</i>

125
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,300
People like you…

126
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,678
are the ones
who can reach the heights of artistry.

127
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,680
Not me.

128
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,686
Take care.

129
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,070
You left as though
you'd never come back here.

130
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,114
And now you crawl back in…

131
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,368
to tell me that you want
your share of the inheritance?

132
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:18,414
I heard that Grandpa left me
a share of the inheritance.

133
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,501
I'd like that right now.

134
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,087
Please.

135
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,174
You're the same as your sister.

136
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,761
Did you two coordinate this
to drive me crazy?

137
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,222
You.

138
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,015
Do you know your sister's getting married?

139
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,643
She just told me outside.

140
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,769
Sure.

141
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,272
I can tolerate her getting married.

142
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,652
But… she's quitting singing?

143
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,279
That thankless girl!

144
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,949
What did I do to deserve all this?

145
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,784
Do you have…

146
00:08:56,118 --> 00:09:00,164
Do you have any idea how I raised you two?

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,502
The great Han Kijoo!

148
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,921
But what's the point?

149
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,257
She couldn't have a son!

150
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,300
All she could manage were two daughters!

151
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,636
I was sick and tired

152
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,471
of being treated like a sinner,

153
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,140
so I took even more care
in raising you two.

154
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:22,478
So… how could you two…

155
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,317
It's not easy for me
to ask this of you either.

156
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,444
I know!

157
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,906
What is that theater troupe to you?

158
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,827
Aren't you worried about your mother?

159
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:44,166
Or are you only worried
about your precious director?

160
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,306
If you give me my inheritance…

161
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,811
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

162
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,731
What are you talking about?

163
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,483
If you tell me to…

164
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,280
…I'll leave the troupe
and even quit <i>gukgeuk.</i>

165
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,659
Are you serious?

166
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,910
Yes.

167
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,373
As long as we can put on
this upcoming performance,

168
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,418
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

169
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,586
So please…

170
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,799
I'm begging you.

171
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,732
Jeongnyeon!

172
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,817
I heard you're working
on <i>The Legend of the Twin Pagodas.</i>

173
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,404
- I'll talk to you later, okay?
- Jeongnyeon!

174
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,615
We're so excited
about your next production.

175
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,699
Yes, we are.

176
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,826
It's the birth of a new prince.

177
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,995
A new prince?

178
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,580
You, silly!

179
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,831
We were rooting for you from <i>Bangjajeon--</i>

180
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,585
I mean, from <i>Chunhyangjeon.</i>
We knew you'd be a huge star.

181
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,714
You were such a refreshing talent
that we were sure you'd be our new prince.

182
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:18,594
I thought you guys would stop coming
because Okgyeong isn't here anymore.

183
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,180
We weren't just in love with Okgyeong,

184
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,391
but with everything
Maeran had created so far.

185
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:27,186
Maeran will forever be our dream.

186
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,064
Maeran, forever!

187
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,192
Forever!
Maeran! Maeran! Maeran!

188
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,821
Maeran! Maeran!

189
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,838
Just leave it be, ma'am. I'll do it.

190
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,341
It's fine. I can do it by myself.

191
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,849
Director,

192
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,977
I have something to tell you.

193
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,873
Where did you get this money?

194
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,542
My mother helped out.

195
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,920
Take it back.

196
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,174
I really appreciate the gesture,

197
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,717
but you don't have to do this.

198
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,471
How did you even get this money
with your pride?

199
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:48,434
I can lay down my pride in a heartbeat
for something that truly matters.

200
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,398
What matters most right now
is to get our production going.

201
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,281
Youngseo.

202
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,616
I promise…

203
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,993
I'll do whatever it takes

204
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,204
for our production
to see the light of day.

205
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,571
What's the point of all this?

206
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,534
What's the point of cleaning?

207
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,329
This building's about to be taken away.

208
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,548
Sure, that may be true.

209
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,885
But we still need to do what we can now.

210
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,595
What can we do?

211
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,764
Put on our production?

212
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,851
How can we when we don't have the money?

213
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,063
There's no point in trying.
It's all useless.

214
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:21,068
If you think this is all useless,
then don't bother and just go.

215
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,028
Why are you here arguing with me?

216
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,823
Because I can't just do nothing.

217
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,286
Because I'll drive myself mad
if I don't do anything.

218
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,914
We'll keep performing.

219
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,459
You were the one who said…

220
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,088
that even if everyone else left,

221
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,968
you'd hold your ground here
and not go anywhere.

222
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,013
I'm the same.

223
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,681
I'm not going anywhere,

224
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,601
and I'll keep performing with you.

225
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,355
Everywhere we stand will be our stage.

226
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,734
So what more do we need?

227
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,694
But…

228
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,617
we may not be able
to perform in a theater for a while.

229
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,246
Then we better prepare
for the performance of a lifetime.

230
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:20,502
We'll put on a performance
that our audience will never forget.

231
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,005
How about it?

232
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,052
Sounds great.

233
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,348
Let's do it.

234
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,194
I know you have enough on your plate
dealing with the debt collectors.

235
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,404
But Director.

236
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,783
How about you try visiting a cooperative?

237
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,493
A cooperative?

238
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,162
It's an organization
created by the common people,

239
00:15:55,245 --> 00:16:01,043
and word is going around
that it's a safe place to get a loan.

240
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,838
Apparently, they loan you money
with very low interest.

241
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,550
How about we reach out to them?

242
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,721
"Credit union"

243
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,723
You're trying to settle your debts

244
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,433
and work on a new production?

245
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,559
Yes.

246
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,062
Forgive me for saying this,

247
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:25,859
but I heard
that this production may be Maeran's last.

248
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,990
Do you really need to go this far
for one last show?

249
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,074
That's not true.

250
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:37,705
This production is crucial
for my troupe members.

251
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,627
This new production
will give birth to a new prince,

252
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,841
which will mark the beginning
of a new era for my troupe.

253
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:55,931
This upcoming production
will be our troupe's new milestone.

254
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,935
And for that,
I need to clear our current debt.

255
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,773
Please think of this…

256
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,569
as an investment in our future…

257
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,573
not our present.

258
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,370
An investment in your future…

259
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:26,128
"Credit union: signing up,
savings, and loan consultation"

260
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,671
The debt is taken care of.

261
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,298
They'll lend us the money.

262
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:30,966
That's great.

263
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,806
Now we just have to come up
with a production budget.

264
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,475
Director.

265
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:47,775
How about we postpone this production?

266
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,902
But the whole troupe's
looking forward to it.

267
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,070
How could we?

268
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,030
I'm not saying we cancel it altogether.

269
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,158
I'm saying we postpone it
until we find a better time for it.

270
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,326
Director.

271
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,496
Maeran needs to continue
for the members to thrive too.

272
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,086
Not my hands! Please spare my hands!

273
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,005
I need these hands
to make the stone pagoda, so please…

274
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,174
To make the stone pagoda--

275
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,176
No, to build the stone pagoda.

276
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,053
To make the stone pagoda…

277
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,513
Jeez, what do I do?

278
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,056
What is it?

279
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,891
Is something not going well?

280
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:21,975
Director.

281
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:31,151
Asadal's such a free-spirited character
that my accent keeps slipping out.

282
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,279
But a male lead
isn't supposed to have an accent.

283
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,073
So I'm a bit worried.

284
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,576
I don't know.

285
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,746
I don't see why not.

286
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,749
Asadal is from Baekje.

287
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,127
But it's the male lead.

288
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,461
Would that really be okay?

289
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,674
This is your version of Asadal.

290
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,429
I think it'd be good to show
an Asadal only you could portray.

291
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,979
Yes, ma'am.

292
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,864
It's hard to focus
with everything going on, isn't it?

293
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,741
I know how uneasy you must be.

294
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,920
From beyond the stars…

295
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,089
What?

296
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,301
The night I first watched
<i>a gukgeuk</i> performance,

297
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,097
I couldn't sleep
because my heart was racing too much.

298
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,807
Then my sister said this.

299
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,270
"Just forget it."

300
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,523
"Those people are from beyond the stars."

301
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,196
And boy, was she right about that.

302
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,158
To a couple of country bumpkins
from Mokpo,

303
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,328
that dazzling performance
was from beyond the stars, all right.

304
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,917
Some might call me crazy
for chasing after the stars

305
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,962
when I should be busy
finding a way to live.

306
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,341
But to me,

307
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,052
those stars are my dreams…

308
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,679
that help me survive.

309
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,183
Your dreams?

310
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,060
And I'm not alone.

311
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:32,397
The crowd of girls outside our gates
who can't wait to watch our show

312
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,274
and all our troupe members

313
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,695
can get through anything
if it means we have <i>gukgeuk</i> in our lives.

314
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,034
I've got a team to perform with

315
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,536
and an audience to watch me.

316
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,621
So why should I be anxious?

317
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,750
If we still have our people with us,

318
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,336
we've got everything.

319
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,799
You're right.

320
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,137
We still have our people.

321
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,767
So, Director.

322
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,478
I hope you don't suffer
by yourself too much.

323
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,524
We're a lot stronger than you think.

324
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,653
Yes.

325
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,465
Everything looks good.

326
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:45,554
We'll be vacating the premises
after the production as the contract says.

327
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,722
As you wish.

328
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,726
So what changed your mind?

329
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,564
I thought your pride
would never allow you to agree to this.

330
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,194
My real pride…

331
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:07,117
lies in being able to give
my troupe members a proper production.

332
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,262
Where did you go early this morning?

333
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,139
Today's the audition.

334
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,392
Did you go to the temple again?

335
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,519
You knew I was going to the temple?

336
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,646
Of course I did.

337
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,523
Then…

338
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:42,611
were you able to find
your own Asadal there?

339
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,780
Yes.

340
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,492
My Asadal is…

341
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,536
someone who seeks the truth.

342
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,498
<i>Someone who seeks the truth?</i>

343
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,292
<i>He must be an artist</i>

344
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,629
<i>who carves out the revered Buddha
in pursuit of truth.</i>

345
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,840
Good thinking.

346
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,217
Really?

347
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,848
But…

348
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,395
Jeongnyeon probably
thought of something better.

349
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,444
I know I shouldn't get too hung up
on the competition.

350
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,907
But I really want to win.

351
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,743
It's okay to be hung up
on the competition.

352
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,662
And it's all right to want to win.

353
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,999
Right now is a time for you
to show your everything to win.

354
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,044
Youngseo…

355
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,173
I've had my share of suffering

356
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,467
staring at the back
of someone ahead of me.

357
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,514
So I know better than anyone

358
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,059
how anxious and frustrated you must be.

359
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:57,978
Then…

360
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,148
how did you overcome it?

361
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,651
The path of an artist is very long.

362
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:11,366
You'll be going through
countless ups and downs in your life.

363
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,703
And as you endure all that…

364
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,956
you'll find yourself

365
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:23,253
at the highest summit
looking out further than anyone.

366
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,509
You have what it takes
to become such an artist.

367
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,849
I'll be looking forward to your audition.

368
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:54,618
- Jeongnyeon! Jeongnyeon!
- Youngseo! Youngseo!

369
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:58,371
- I'll be rooting for you, Youngseo!
- No, Jeongnyeon will win.

370
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,999
- This way, gentlemen.
- Hi, please pick up your pace!

371
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,126
- Did you see that?
- Oh, my goodness!

372
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,629
- Until here, gentlemen!
- Why?

373
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,631
Please wait outside.

374
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,926
- Just let us in!
- No, you have to wait here.

375
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:15,013
Let me introduce our judges for today.

376
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,932
The choreographer,
Ms. Cho Suyeon.

377
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,684
Our drummer, Mr. Lee Yonggeun.

378
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,938
And last but not least, Ms. Baek Doaeng,

379
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,106
who will be directing our production
of <i>The Legend of the Twin Pagodas.</i>

380
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:29,736
And aside from these judges I mentioned,

381
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:35,408
we'll have the Maeran troupe members
attending as special judges.

382
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,619
Now then,

383
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:42,415
let's begin the audition
for this production's male lead.

384
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,008
Have you decided on your scenes?

385
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,093
Yes.

386
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,137
I chose Act 4 Scene 2,
when Asadal finishes the stone Buddha.

387
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:57,973
And Jeongnyeon?

388
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,475
I also chose that scene.

389
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,650
All right.

390
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,860
Whoever pulls the stick
with a mark goes first.

391
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,992
I'll be going first.

392
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,160
You may begin when you're ready.

393
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,959
My teacher taught me

394
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,795
the ways of the hammer and chisel.

395
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,676
And my beautiful and resilient wife

396
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,679
taught me the joys of life.

397
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,728
I honored the princess's call
and left my beloved homeland

398
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,438
to come to Seorabeol.

399
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,026
And here…

400
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,281
I only tended to Buddha's teachings.

401
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,412
But what did Seorabeol give me?

402
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,917
<i>I have had to endure</i>

403
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,379
<i>Fits of jealousy
And countless accusations</i>

404
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,924
<i>I fortunately met a friend</i>

405
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:21,723
<i>Whom I could rely on</i>

406
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,310
<i>But he has deceived</i>

407
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,688
<i>And</i>

408
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:33,693
<i>Betrayed me</i>

409
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,281
<i>Despite all my hardships</i>

410
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,576
<i>I finish the pagoda</i>

411
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,454
<i>And rush home</i>

412
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:50,710
<i>But all that welcomes me</i>

413
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,962
<i>Is a pair of shoes</i>

414
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:58,968
<i>That belonged to my wife
Who has passed</i>

415
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:04,724
<i>My dear Asanyeo</i>

416
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,395
<i>As beautiful as the clouds in the sky</i>

417
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:13,066
<i>And the flowers of the field</i>

418
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:17,737
<i>You left</i>

419
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:21,199
<i>Without saying</i>

420
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:25,995
<i>A word of goodbye</i>

421
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,125
<i>Pitter patter</i>

422
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,003
<i>Pitter patter</i>

423
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:40,760
<i>My dear wife's</i>

424
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,764
<i>Dainty feet</i>

425
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,309
<i>Are stepping</i>

426
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:54,441
<i>To the heavens</i>

427
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,862
<i>Pitter patter</i>

428
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:02,198
<i>Pitter patter</i>

429
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:08,538
<i>She is passing over</i>

430
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:11,958
Hark.

431
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,461
<i>Buddha sits yonder.</i>

432
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,922
<i>With my chisel in one hand</i>

433
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,466
<i>And my hammer in another</i>

434
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,468
<i>I strike here</i>

435
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,970
<i>And bang!
Goes the stone</i>

436
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,599
<i>I strike there</i>

437
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,893
<i>And crash!
It shatters</i>

438
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,811
<i>My fingers</i>

439
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:37,150
<i>Reveal Buddha's mantra</i>

440
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,694
<i>And my hammer</i>

441
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,824
<i>Unveils Buddha's precious face</i>

442
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,619
<i>My hammer</i>

443
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:52,957
<i>Unveils Buddha's precious face</i>

444
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,543
<i>My hammer</i>

445
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,463
<i>Unveils Buddha's</i>

446
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:04,344
<i>Precious face</i>

447
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:29,077
If Youngseo's that good,
is there even a point to this audition?

448
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,330
Who could be
a more perfect fit for Asadal?

449
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,957
I agree.

450
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,042
She's always been technically perfect,

451
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,419
but now, even her emotions have deepened.

452
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,761
This is the Asadal that I've found.

453
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,846
Yes.

454
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,683
I knew what kind of Asadal you found
the moment you began.

455
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,520
It was absolutely amazing.

456
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,607
It's my turn now.

457
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,903
Watch me
as I have the time of my life out there.

458
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,797
My teacher taught me

459
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,592
the ways of the hammer and chisel.

460
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,970
And my beautiful and resilient wife

461
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,390
taught me the joys of life.

462
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,728
I honored the princess's call

463
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,564
and left my beloved homeland…

464
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,109
to come to Seorabeol.

465
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,404
And here…

466
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,074
I only tended to Buddha's teachings.

467
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,369
But…

468
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,915
what did…

469
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,004
Seorabeol give me?

470
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,551
- How do we get in?
- Seriously.

471
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,096
What was that?

472
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,807
- What's going on?
- Hurry. Let's go in!

473
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,778
Is it over?

474
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,078
Everyone, please settle down.

475
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,289
We'll soon announce the results.

476
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,085
Director.

477
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,545
You don't need to announce anything.

478
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,424
We all know the result.

479
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,971
Jeongnyeon…

480
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,098
…is our new prince.

481
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,612
Would that be okay with you?

482
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,658
Yes.

483
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,548
Congratulations, Jeongnyeon.

484
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,513
You're our new prince.

485
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,675
Eunjae.

486
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,554
What are you doing out here?
Where's your aunt?

487
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,119
What are you doing here?

488
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,791
So you want to drown yourself in alcohol?

489
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,667
Why are you here?

490
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,587
I have nothing to do with Maeran anymore.

491
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:00,264
Will you spend the rest of your life
drowning in alcohol?

492
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:01,849
Yes.

493
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,559
I will.

494
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,978
Nobody cares about me.

495
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,066
Yoon Jeongnyeon came
and told me the other day.

496
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,027
That I'm just an empty shell.

497
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,073
She may be able to live on
with a messed-up throat

498
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,992
and Okgyeong abandoning her…

499
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,287
but I can't.

500
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:28,042
I'm not as strong as she is.

501
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,005
I failed as a <i>gukgeuk</i> actor…

502
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,300
and got abandoned by Okgyeong.

503
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,512
It's over for me!

504
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,682
You abandoned me too!

505
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,934
I'm going to keep living like this
until I die…

506
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,395
…so get out of my face!

507
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:07,874
Every girl who aimed to become
a female lead in our troupe

508
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,293
said the same thing.

509
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,631
"I wanted to join
after watching Seo Hyerang's acting."

510
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,467
"I want to surpass her someday."

511
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,761
To them,

512
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,098
your acting was always their benchmark.

513
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:30,521
You were a huge part…
of someone else's life.

514
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:37,278
So let go of Okgyeong,
who was but a brief part of yours.

515
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,199
Live your own life.

516
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,661
You still have Eunjae who needs you.

517
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,984
You want me to play Dalbi?

518
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,528
I've discussed it with the director,

519
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,989
and we think
you're the perfect fit for Dalbi.

520
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,785
Dalbi may just seem like an antagonist
jealous of Asadal's talent,

521
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,664
but he's also his greatest ally
who treasures his talents.

522
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,000
And the one person
who can act out that complex character

523
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,210
is you.

524
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,129
How about it?

525
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,756
Are you interested?

526
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,132
Yes.

527
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,927
- I'd love to.
- All right.

528
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,929
Then let's put on a great show.

529
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,185
Until you come see me, my love,

530
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,063
I shall continue to wait

531
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,690
and pine for you.

532
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,316
So please…

533
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,068
Please…

534
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,621
It's more sophisticated
the more you think about it.

535
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,708
A prince or a princess
isn't the main character.

536
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,334
And it's not a happy ending.

537
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,752
And on top of that,

538
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,921
the main lead isn't a hero or a prince,

539
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,798
but an everyday peasant.

540
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:25,636
Our production will go down in history.

541
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,723
But will the audience like it?

542
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,974
Of course.

543
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:35,021
These kinds of sophisticated plays
are just the thing for younger audiences.

544
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,774
And everyone in our troupe
is amazing at acting.

545
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,401
Including our main female lead.

546
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,111
So that's what you wanted?

547
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,821
To show off?

548
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,406
- My goodness.
- Leave her be.

549
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,699
She's been like this for a week.

550
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,284
Why would you say that?

551
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,077
Why are you embarrassed?

552
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,997
All right,
keep going, keep going.

553
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,373
I said keep going.

554
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,917
No, I'm good.

555
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,008
What are you looking at, ma'am?

556
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,971
I was reminiscing
about when we bought this land

557
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,973
and built this whole place.

558
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:17,021
I carefully chose
every single tile and brick

559
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,607
and built this place
alongside the workers.

560
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,861
I even came here to sleep every night

561
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,405
even though our roofs weren't up yet.

562
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,823
Oh my.

563
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,450
You even slept here?

564
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,371
You must have really loved this place.

565
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,248
I was so happy.

566
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,501
Not once did I feel tired…

567
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,420
or exhausted.

568
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,508
I heard…

569
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,804
that we've sold the property.

570
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,015
I can't imagine how painful it must be.

571
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,227
It's not painful.

572
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,314
I realized something
after what you said the other day.

573
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:05,069
The foundation of Maeran Gukgeukdan
isn't these buildings,

574
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,405
but its people.

575
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,659
We've got you,

576
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,785
Youngseo,

577
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,954
and all the other troupe members.

578
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,250
As long as we have
the people to perform with,

579
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,670
we can always start over.

580
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,089
You're absolutely right.

581
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,010
So…

582
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:34,807
have you thought about how you'll drive
the performance as the male lead?

583
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,518
Yes.

584
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,729
But I'm a bit worried.

585
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,276
I can't just do as I please
on stage anymore,

586
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,570
nor should I.

587
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,701
I guess this is the weight I must endure

588
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,161
as a prince or something.

589
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:07,214
It's probably something
you'll have to keep enduring from now on.

590
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,383
But if it's you,

591
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,053
I'm sure you'll find your own way

592
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,015
to not get crushed under all that weight.

593
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,560
You just need to remember one thing.

594
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,730
Our upcoming production

595
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,649
is yours and yours alone.

596
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,485
And all you need to do…

597
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,989
is enjoy your moment on stage

598
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,074
to the fullest.

599
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,289
Yes, ma'am.

600
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,506
The Legend of the Twin Pagodas
The debut of the rising stars!

601
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,717
"Asadal, Yoon Jeongnyeon."

602
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,177
I told you.

603
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,679
I'm never wrong about these things.

604
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,933
Remember how I said Yoon Jeongnyeon
would become the male lead?

605
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,309
You weren't the only one.

606
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,561
I knew that too.

607
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,231
Heo Youngseo…

608
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,024
Her face is so regal.

609
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,443
What the…

610
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,028
You're fangirling over Heo Youngseo?

611
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,613
Yes, I've always been her fan.

612
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,448
- What about Okgyeong?
- Her too.

613
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,574
What about Jeongnyeon?

614
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,909
Her too.

615
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,495
- You can't have three. Choose two.
- Yeah, choose two.

616
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,579
Where did that rule come from?

617
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,206
Right here.

618
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,124
You're so childish.

619
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,085
Auntie.

620
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,003
What are we watching today?

621
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,465
We're here to watch a <i>gukgeuk </i>performance

622
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,717
called <i>The Legend of the Twin Pagodas.</i>

623
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,017
Eunjae.

624
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,185
Yes, Auntie?

625
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,230
You don't have to call me Auntie…

626
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,316
at home or even outside anymore.

627
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,485
Then?

628
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,904
Call me Mommy.

629
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,657
I'm…

630
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,535
your mom, after all.

631
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,662
Can I really?

632
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,163
Of course.

633
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,833
Of course you can.

634
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,298
Eunjae.

635
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,925
I'm so sorry for making you lie…

636
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:18,762
all this time.

637
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,599
It's okay, Mommy.

638
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,022
Should we sit here?

639
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,369
Excuse me, you could take these seats.

640
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,000
- It's her!
- The soprano!

641
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,919
- My goodness, it's Han Kijoo!
- You're Han Kijoo, right?

642
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,006
- Hello!
- Oh, my goodness!

643
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,344
- I'm a huge fan.
- Gosh.

644
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:03,974
I feel like
I recognize her from somewhere.

645
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,851
Is she one of my fans?

646
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,937
That must be it.

647
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,190
I have fans everywhere I go.

648
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,692
- Of course!
- Yes, you do!

649
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,616
Here, let me.

650
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,457
Hey, am I trembling?

651
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,338
What? I ran out.

652
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,964
Just use mine.

653
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,384
But yours is expensive.

654
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,886
This is going to be our last show,
so it's okay.

655
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,304
Just use it all up.

656
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,061
Hey, we agreed
not to say things like that.

657
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,064
Right. We did.

658
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,234
Why did I have to run my mouth?

659
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,444
Wait, you guys knew about that?

660
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,987
We caught on.

661
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,865
Wait, you knew too?

662
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,493
Of course I did.

663
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,996
I didn't say a word about it
because I didn't want to bum you out.

664
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,791
It's fine. I knew too.

665
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,668
How could I not
with all that's been going on?

666
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,462
You all knew it too, right?

667
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,673
- Yeah, we did.
- We knew.

668
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,882
Really?

669
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,135
I wasted all my energy
on keeping it secret.

670
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,179
How did you guys keep it to yourselves?

671
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,264
How could we not

672
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,307
when the director's doing her best
to keep everything running?

673
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,101
And even if it's our last--

674
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,520
- Hey! Don't say that!
- Don't!

675
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,021
- Don't say that.
- Stop saying that.

676
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,189
Okay, okay.

677
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,858
I was just saying,

678
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,986
whether it's our last or not,
nothing changes.

679
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,156
Every performance matters.

680
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,159
My goodness, look how much Chorok's grown.

681
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:49,079
She's right. Every performance matters.

682
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,665
We just have to have
the time of our lives out there

683
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,084
like we did
during our trainee performance.

684
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,170
Hey, that's a good quote.

685
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,213
Let's use it as our slogan.

686
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,715
- Our slogan?
- That's good.

687
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:00,799
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

688
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,136
Now that you mention it, let's huddle up!

689
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,805
Hey, gather together.

690
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:12,186
All right, let's have
the time of our lives out there!

691
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,605
The time of our lives!

692
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,276
Why aren't you guys done getting ready?

693
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,653
Hurry up. We're about to begin.

694
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,531
Yes, ma'am!

695
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,411
Jeongnyeon.

696
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,871
Here.

697
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,873
What's this?

698
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,082
I don't know.

699
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,168
Someone told me to give it to you.

700
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,193
<i>Dear Jeongnyeon.</i>

701
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,571
<i>Jeongnyeon, did you know?</i>

702
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,867
<i>To me, you were my dream, my longing,</i>

703
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,161
<i>and my one and only prince.</i>

704
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,665
<i>I've now returned
to where I originally was,</i>

705
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:18,252
<i>but I can never return
to the time when I hadn't met you.</i>

706
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,963
<i>Thank you.</i>

707
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:25,884
<i>Now you'll be everyone's prince.
I'm rooting for you.</i>

708
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,553
<i>From Jooran.</i>

709
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,590
How many times is this?

710
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:17,811
Greetings.

711
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,776
Greetings.

712
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,821
I am Dalbi, a stone sculptor.

713
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,909
The king of Silla has issued an order
for a stone pagoda in Bulguksa,

714
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,953
so I have been working on it
for three whole years.

715
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,371
But as you can see,

716
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,790
all I have built is the base.

717
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,587
But something
that drives me even more insane

718
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,757
is another stone sculptor
building his stone pagoda…

719
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,929
Asadal.

720
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,849
Just when I think
I am one step ahead of him,

721
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,769
he is always two steps ahead of me.

722
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,187
I despise him.

723
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:04,608
I also despise the heavens
for gifting him with such talent.

724
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:08,195
I wish the stone pagoda he is building
would fall to pieces!

725
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,449
But the strangest thing is…

726
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,621
another side of me…

727
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:24,336
cannot wait to see
what kind of masterpiece he will create.

728
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,801
I do not understand myself either.

729
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,976
Enjoy the performance.

730
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:53,615
<i>Hooray and rejoice</i>

731
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:58,161
<i>Give thanks and rejoice</i>

732
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,999
<i>Thanks to the great mercy of Buddha</i>

733
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:07,295
<i>And his divine compassion</i>

734
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,548
<i>All is well in our country</i>

735
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,425
<i>All is well</i>

736
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,094
All right, get back to work!

737
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,390
Where's Asadal?

738
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,686
Well…

739
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,981
He has stepped out for a drink, sir.

740
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,816
Again?

741
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,527
We are sculptors
carving out Buddha's divine will.

742
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,779
It isn't right for him
to succumb to drinking.

743
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,907
And what of that stone base?

744
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,827
Oh, right.

745
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,912
Lord Asadal made it, sir.

746
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,582
Overnight?

747
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,460
Let me take a look.

748
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:56,219
<i>The corner pillars are polished smooth</i>

749
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,513
<i>And the inner pillars
Between the slabs</i>

750
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:02,768
<i>Are firm and stable</i>

751
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:07,939
<i>Look at its neat and tidy form</i>

752
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,360
<i>How in the world</i>

753
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:16,615
<i>Did he create this overnight?</i>

754
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:21,953
<i>Look at its neat and tidy form</i>

755
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,249
<i>How in the world</i>

756
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:31,046
<i>Did he create this overnight?</i>

757
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,595
You're up next.

758
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,642
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

759
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,402
This drink tastes great.

760
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,616
Shall I drink over here?

761
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,618
I feel good.

762
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:05,122
Did you really build this overnight?

763
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,916
That I did.

764
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,837
I only had a vision for the base,

765
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,755
so that is all I built last night.

766
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,389
- Had a vision?
- How else could one build a pagoda

767
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,851
but by seeing the vision of it
in the stone?

768
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,691
Then are you saying

769
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,902
you did not work on the pagoda
unless you were inspired?

770
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,324
Of course.

771
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:46,580
You can chip away at the stone
all you want.

772
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:50,167
But without inspiration,
you are only left with a piece of boulder.

773
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,504
But you must know this already.

774
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,048
Oh, goodness me!

775
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:05,348
Hey! Get me more to drink!

776
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,142
I'm cold.

777
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,061
All I have made over the last three years…

778
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,816
is this piece of boulder.

779
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:21,781
But Asadal created
this masterpiece overnight.

780
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:27,954
How could the heavens
only gift him with this great talent,

781
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,333
but curse me with only the eye
to recognize such talent?

782
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,969
Gosh! My goodness!

783
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,597
Goodness!

784
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,349
Wait, wait, wait!

785
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,476
Not my hands!

786
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,478
Please spare my hands!

787
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,898
I need these hands
to build the stone pagoda, so please…

788
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,608
How dare you!

789
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,863
I shall surely teach you a lesson today.

790
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,033
Men!

791
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,952
Beat some sense into this drunkard!

792
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,120
- No, please!
- Sir, wait!

793
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,125
Wait, you are Dalbi, are you not?

794
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,379
Dalbi?

795
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,845
Do not meddle in our affairs.

796
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,567
Sir.

797
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:43,571
The king himself is counting down the days
until Asadal's stone pagoda is finished.

798
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,661
So things will be bad
if this scoundrel gets injured.

799
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,663
The king, you say?

800
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,959
That won't do.

801
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,671
You drunkard.

802
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,257
Consider yourself lucky.

803
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,510
Let's go, men!

804
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,095
Yes, sir!

805
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:18,732
What in the world have you done this time?

806
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,775
I cannot believe you.

807
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:21,860
The pagoda!

808
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,612
What? The pagoda?

809
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,867
<i>With my chisel in one hand</i>

810
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,119
<i>And my hammer in another</i>

811
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,455
<i>I strike here</i>

812
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,539
<i>And bang!</i>

813
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,623
<i>Goes the stone</i>

814
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,709
<i>I strike there</i>

815
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:38,835
<i>And crash!</i>

816
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:39,919
<i>It shatters</i>

817
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,214
Have you lost your mind?

818
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,221
<i>This hammer in my hands</i>

819
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:54,809
<i>Reveals Buddha's words</i>

820
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,397
<i>And this chisel in my hands</i>

821
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:03,818
<i>Proves his mantra</i>

822
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,156
<i>Asadal's hammer</i>

823
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:12,702
<i>Reveals Buddha's words</i>

824
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,165
<i>And Asadal's chisel</i>

825
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:22,003
<i>Proves his mantra</i>

826
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,672
Listen, Dalbi. Just listen to me.

827
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,216
I know it now!

828
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:30,428
I know exactly how to finish
my stone pagoda!

829
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,099
You were inspired.

830
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,518
Once I finish this pagoda,

831
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,896
I shall return to Baekje
and see my beloved wife.

832
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,440
It won't be long
until his pagoda is finished.

833
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,984
My beautiful moon goddess,

834
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,361
my Asanyeo.

835
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:50,198
The world will soon witness the birth
of a never-before-seen masterpiece!

836
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,533
Just two weeks!

837
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,785
I shall see her again in just two weeks!

838
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,663
My dear wife, Asanyeo!

839
00:56:56,746 --> 00:57:00,208
Only Asadal can complete
the greatest pagoda for Silla.

840
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,794
Asadal cannot meet Asanyeo!

841
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:10,718
<i>My Asanyeo is like a lotus flower</i>

842
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:16,349
<i>My Asanyeo is like the moonlight</i>

843
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:23,231
<i>Her dear face</i>

844
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:29,487
<i>Is like precious jade</i>

845
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,471
Excuse me, where is my Asadal?

846
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:58,183
When his stone pagoda is finished,

847
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:01,102
this pond will reflect its top.

848
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,355
You will need to wait until then.

849
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,441
I shall, sir.

850
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,235
I shall wait right here.

851
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,822
So please tell my Asadal
that I shall be waiting for him…

852
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,325
right here.

853
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,419
I pity you quite a lot.

854
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:28,546
Pardon?

855
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,591
Asadal fell in love
with Princess Miryeong.

856
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,178
Once his pagoda is completed…

857
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:41,017
he is to be wed to the princess.

858
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:01,955
<i>My beloved</i>

859
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:07,335
<i>Asadal</i>

860
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:15,260
<i>How I miss you so</i>

861
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,013
<i>I finally met you</i>

862
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:23,309
<i>After eons of searching</i>

863
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:27,480
<i>And countless reincarnations</i>

864
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:34,821
<i>Just as star-crossed lovers</i>

865
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:40,410
<i>Finally meet</i>

866
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:44,747
<i>Just as the sword blade and handle</i>

867
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:50,461
<i>Come together to form a mighty sword</i>

868
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:54,799
<i>I thought we would</i>

869
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:59,012
<i>Live in love</i>

870
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:03,224
<i>For all time</i>

871
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,573
Asanyeo!

872
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,578
Asanyeo.

873
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:24,954
What happened?

874
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,832
Why are you here?

875
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:34,839
Were you not about to be wed
to Princess Miryeong?

876
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:37,258
To be wed? What are you talking about?

877
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:43,181
Lord Dalbi told me to wait here
until this pond reflected your pagoda…

878
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,059
and that on the day it is completed,

879
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,604
you would be wed to the princess.

880
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:52,148
That is utter nonsense.

881
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:58,029
I was pining for the day
we would get to meet again.

882
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:06,663
How dare that Dalbi…

883
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,206
No, my love.

884
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:13,670
There is no point to it anymore.

885
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:20,218
Please do not hold a grudge…

886
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:22,512
against anyone or anything.

887
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:34,440
<i>My beloved</i>

888
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:39,070
<i>Asadal</i>

889
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:45,702
<i>How I</i>

890
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,412
<i>Miss you so</i>

891
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:51,207
<i>I finally met you</i>

892
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:55,712
<i>After eons of searching</i>

893
01:01:55,795 --> 01:02:00,591
<i>And countless reincarnations</i>

894
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:07,098
<i>You shall be my love</i>

895
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:11,436
<i>When we meet again</i>

896
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:15,732
<i>You shall be my husband</i>

897
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:22,655
<i>When I am reborn</i>

898
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,211
Asanyeo…

899
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,138
Asanyeo, Asanyeo…

900
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,223
Please get up.

901
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,813
Let us go home.

902
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,066
Let us go back…

903
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:02,361
to Baekje.

904
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,947
My beloved homeland…

905
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,659
I shall return…

906
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,954
to my country.

907
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,585
My goodness.

908
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:45,321
Asanyeo!

909
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,968
That Asadal actor is amazing, isn't she?

910
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,553
Yes.

911
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,054
Her name is Yoon Jeongnyeon.

912
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,430
She's my student.

913
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:16,978
She really is a once-in-a-lifetime talent.

914
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,824
My teacher taught me

915
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:31,826
the ways of the hammer and chisel.

916
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,912
And my beautiful and resilient wife

917
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,249
taught me the joys of life.

918
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,627
I honored the princess's call

919
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:45,715
and left my beloved homeland
to come to Seorabeol.

920
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:48,634
And here…

921
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,471
I only tended to Buddha's teachings.

922
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,683
But…

923
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,692
what did…

924
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:09,113
Seorabeol give me?

925
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,998
<i>I have had to endure</i>

926
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:22,293
<i>Fits of jealousy
And countless accusations</i>

927
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:25,463
<i>I fortunately met a friend</i>

928
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:31,719
<i>Whom I could rely on</i>

929
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:34,889
<i>But he has deceived</i>

930
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:38,100
<i>And</i>

931
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:42,563
<i>Betrayed me</i>

932
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,652
<i>Despite all my hardships</i>

933
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:50,696
<i>I finish the pagoda</i>

934
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,574
<i>And rush home</i>

935
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:58,454
<i>But all that welcomes me</i>

936
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,500
<i>Is a pair of shoes</i>

937
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:07,964
<i>That belonged to my wife
Who has passed</i>

938
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:14,303
<i>My dear Asanyeo</i>

939
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,390
<i>As beautiful as the clouds in the sky</i>

940
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:22,186
<i>And the flowers of the field</i>

941
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:25,398
<i>You left</i>

942
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,693
<i>Without saying</i>

943
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:33,781
<i>A word of goodbye</i>

944
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,333
<i>Pitter patter</i>

945
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,420
<i>Pitter patter</i>

946
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:53,843
<i>My dear wife's</i>

947
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:56,929
<i>Dainty feet</i>

948
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,182
<i>Are stepping</i>

949
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:06,522
<i>To the heavens</i>

950
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:09,316
<i>Pitter patter</i>

951
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,695
<i>Pitter patter</i>

952
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:19,368
<i>She is passing over</i>

953
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:39,930
Asadal.

954
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:43,726
It is I, Dalbi.

955
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:48,064
Let us go back.

956
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,607
Your health has waned greatly.

957
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:53,486
It is Buddha.

958
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,039
Hark!

959
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:08,918
Buddha sits yonder!

960
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:23,682
It is…

961
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,146
…Buddha.

962
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,566
Buddha?

963
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,952
<i>With my chisel in one hand</i>

964
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,495
<i>And my hammer in another</i>

965
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,497
<i>I strike here</i>

966
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,499
<i>And bang!
Goes the stone</i>

967
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:51,252
I was wrong, Asadal!

968
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,795
Please blame me!

969
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:57,842
<i>I strike there</i>

970
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,177
<i>And crash!
It shatters</i>

971
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,929
Just kill me instead.

972
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:03,556
At this rate, you'll die!

973
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,474
<i>My fingers</i>

974
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:09,979
<i>Reveal Buddha's mantra</i>

975
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:15,192
<i>And my hammer</i>

976
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:21,949
<i>Unveils Buddha's precious face</i>

977
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:24,743
<i>My hammer</i>

978
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:31,834
<i>Unveils Buddha's precious face</i>

979
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,712
<i>My hammer</i>

980
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:37,882
<i>Unveils Buddha's</i>

981
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:44,722
<i>Precious face</i>

982
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:17,231
- Jeongnyeon!
- You were incredible!

983
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,776
- Asadal is the best!
- Seriously the best!

984
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,530
Yoon Jeongnyeon!

985
01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:03,819
Yoon Jeongnyeon!

986
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:10,200
Yoon Jeongnyeon!

987
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:16,832
Yoon Jeongnyeon!

988
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:22,671
Yoon Jeongnyeon!

989
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:35,392
The Legend of the Twin Pagodas
The debut of the rising stars!

990
01:12:55,537 --> 01:13:00,334
Yoon Jeongnyeon!

991
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:50,759
JEONGNYEON: THE STAR IS BORN

992
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,761
{\an8}<i>Female</i> gukgeuk.

{\an8}<i>or Bangja and Yi Mongryong,</i>

995
01:13:56,306 --> 01:13:58,851
{\an8}<i>all roles are played by women.</i>

996
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,853

998

999
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:12,030
{\an8}<i>They were the stars

1001
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,745
{\an8}<i>would go on
