ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.

22
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,980
THE SHOW CONTAINS JAPANESE EXPRESSIONS
TO REFLECT THE TIME PERIOD.

23
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,860
You're not the only one
with a temper or pride.

24
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,737
From now on,

25
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,907
I'll make sure to pay you back
for whatever you do to me.

26
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,034
I don't have any reason…

27
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,245
to be patient with you.

28
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,207
Oh yeah? What could you possibly do?

29
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,545
You really were raised like a princess,
weren't you?

30
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,673
You're getting worked up
over something as tiny as this.

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,969
Look at you throwing a fit
because someone saw you get scolded.

32
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,388
You have no idea how I feel.

33
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,186
Do you know what it feels like
to be denied by your own mother?

34
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,523
You wouldn't.
You don't have a care in the world.

35
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,233
Watch it.

36
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,529
You think you're the only one
who suffers in life?

37
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:57,242
Think of all the benefits you received
from having a famous mother.

38
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,993
What did you possibly lose out on?

39
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,245
My skills…

40
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,541
are purely the result of my own efforts.

41
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,042
It has nothing to do with my mother!

42
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,127
Hey.

43
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,546
You have no idea how much I struggled

44
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,714
to be recognized for my hard work.

45
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,133
This is what I meant

46
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,969
when I said you were raised
like a princess all your life.

47
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:21,933
Most trainees from Maeran
have jobs in town because they need money.

48
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,312
Did you ever have to worry about
not having enough money?

49
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,899
Your starting point
is already miles ahead of others!

50
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,609
And you have the audacity

51
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,029
to say that you got your skills
purely from your own efforts?

52
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,783
Forget it.

53
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,120
What's the point of telling you all this?

54
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,374
If you tell anyone
about what you saw today…

55
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,419
I'm going to kill you.

56
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,674
I don't care about you that much.

57
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,054
This is the last time we'll ever meet,

58
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,891
so let's just mind our own business.

59
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,617
The people at the party
must have really liked you.

60
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,869
They decided to invest more in us.

61
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,373
So we'll up your stage decor
and hire a better ensemble for your band

62
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,459
for you to have a bigger debut.

63
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,172
That was a great shot.

64
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,216
Thank you.

65
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,427
- It was a great performance.
- Thank you.

66
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,764
My Youngin here
is recognized for her skills

67
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,307
even in the States.

68
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,391
I see.

69
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,019
She makes me proud every day.

70
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,438
Oh my. Was I bragging
about my daughter too much?

71
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,190
It's fine.
You were just stating facts.

72
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,025
Thank you.

73
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,443
{\an8}Act 5

74
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,153
{\an8}Seoul Jongno Broadcasting Station

75
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,490
{\an8}Come in.

76
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,664
{\an8}Good morning.

77
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,290
{\an8}Oh! Jeongnyeon.

78
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,417
{\an8}You should have called me first.

79
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,462
{\an8}You told me to come on time
for the interview.

80
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,964
{\an8}Oh, was that today?

81
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,925
{\an8}I guess I thought it was tomorrow.

82
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,094
{\an8}- Come and have a seat.
- Okay.

83
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,018
{\an8}So what were you hiding...
I mean, putting away?

84
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,311
{\an8}You're making me curious.

85
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,938
{\an8}Oh, this? It's nothing important.

86
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,482
{\an8}Actually, the show writer
will be here soon.

87
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,985
{\an8}Do you want some snacks?

88
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,321
{\an8}Someone gifted me cookies from the States.

89
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,296
You should try some.
You can't get them anywhere in Korea.

90
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,510
Jeongnyeon.

91
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,943
Why do you have pictures of my mother?

92
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:23,364
You remember I told you
we needed some shots from your hometown?

93
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,824
These are just part of those shots.

94
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,826
You call that an excuse?

95
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,997
You said that
you'd just take shots of the scenery.

96
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,541
But all you have
are pictures of my mother.

97
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,168
So where are those scenery shots?

98
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,211
Answer me.

99
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,464
Why would you take pictures of my mother?

100
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,383
Fine.

101
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,427
You were going to find out
sooner or later.

102
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,435
{\an8}"Prodigy rises
in national <i>pansori </i>contest"

103
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,312
{\an8}This is your mother,
Chae Gongseon.

104
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,944
{\an8}Prodigy disappears
Her first recording becomes her last

105
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,363
{\an8}Chae Gongseon
of The Blooming Autumn Field disappears

106
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:07,950
I heard she sang <i>pansori </i>before, but…

107
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,328
Your mother
was no ordinary <i>pansori </i>singer.

108
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,829
She appeared out of nowhere

109
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,415
and won a title in the national contest

110
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,627
after competing
with the greatest masters in the nation.

111
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,004
<i>Your mother did that.</i>

112
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,341
<i>I was there when she sang at the contest.</i>

113
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,719
<i>It was the moment that solidified her</i>
<i>as the undisputed genius of </i>pansori.

114
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,597
I've never seen anything like it,
before or since.

115
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,726
And then…

116
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,730
you saw me at the coffee shop?

117
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,983
I couldn't believe my ears at first.

118
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,403
Your voice was the spitting image
of Chae Gongseon.

119
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,487
Then…

120
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,907
you approached me…

121
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:54,831
knowing I was her daughter
from the beginning?

122
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,666
Yes.

123
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,420
And…

124
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,048
you lied to my face?

125
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,927
What else are you hiding from me?

126
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,723
Wait…

127
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:19,313
The person who told the director
I was working at the coffee shop…

128
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,316
Was it you?

129
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,696
Answer me!

130
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,073
Yeah, it was me.

131
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,245
You're a total con man.

132
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,666
You completely deceived me

133
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,586
and had the nerve to tell me
that you'd like to invest in my talent?

134
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,670
You do have talent.

135
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,006
And I meant it
when I said I'd make you a star.

136
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,175
Just listen to my plan.

137
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,844
After we create some buzz with your debut,

138
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,930
we'll let it slip to the press
that you're Chae Gongseon's daughter.

139
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,433
That's when your mother
will appear on our show

140
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,685
and sing the legendary
<i>Blooming Autumn Field!</i>

141
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,690
So I'm just your bait
to get to my mother, huh?

142
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,943
But do you think things will go your way?

143
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,821
Television?

144
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,200
I'm done here!

145
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,579
If you walk out now,
you'll have to pay for breach of contract.

146
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,667
It's all written
in the contract you signed.

147
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,462
It holds you to a promise

148
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,589
that you'll pay damages
if you don't deliver on your end.

149
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,342
I never saw that on there.

150
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,845
You should have read the contract
more carefully.

151
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,433
If you can't pay damages,
then you'll get on our show and sing.

152
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,727
That was the agreement.

153
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,582
Dongbang Record Shop

154
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,256
The Blooming Autumn Field

155
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,133
It's been a while
since someone looked for this record.

156
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,848
You know of Chae Gongseon?
You seem quite young.

157
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,686
Was she famous?

158
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,063
She was beyond famous.

159
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,734
They sold
more than 100,000 copies of this record.

160
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:32,655
When people heard her name,
they immediately thought of this song.

161
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:39,036
Everyone was dying to hear her
sing this song for themselves.

162
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,871
Could you…

163
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,916
play this record right now?

164
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,360
<i>Do you know
what's at the end of this path?</i>

165
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,323
I poured out everything I had

166
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,409
into <i>pansori.</i>

167
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,330
And in the end,

168
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,915
I had nothing left.

169
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,588
Maeran Gukgeukdan Jamyunggo

170
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,385
Did you see that?

171
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,137
- I think our troupe is a whole lot better.
- I agree.

172
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,307
Our singing and choreography
are levels above theirs.

173
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,269
If we performed like that,
the director would kick us all out.

174
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,022
"Do you call that acting?"

175
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,024
What did you say?

176
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,568
That was hilarious. Do it again.

177
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,948
What is it?

178
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,743
Uh… it's nothing.

179
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,111
Were you with those friends again?

180
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,405
Aren't you going to check the script?

181
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,366
Nothing's new anyway.

182
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,870
The same narrative.

183
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,206
The same characters
but with different names.

184
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,252
The audition may change
who'll take the antagonist or minor roles,

185
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,171
but I'll take the male lead,

186
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,756
and you'll take the female lead.

187
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,134
Who else is good enough
to take the leads than us?

188
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,263
You're being weird nowadays.

189
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,808
Hyerang.

190
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,853
Should I quit <i>gukgeuk?</i>

191
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,856
Are you being serious?

192
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,868
I was just kidding.

193
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,707
How could I ever leave you?

194
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,282
Were you keeping watch in case I ran?

195
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,828
I guess paying damages
really does scare you.

196
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,918
I didn't stay for the damages

197
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,212
or my mother.

198
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,674
This is my performance.

199
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,803
I'm not going anywhere

200
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,639
until I finish my performance.

201
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,935
Is the band ready?

202
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,354
Costumes! Is that jacket okay?

203
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,439
All right, we're rolling!

204
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,026
Let's pan the camera out from the piano.

205
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,946
Coming to you
from the beautiful Mugunghwa Park.

206
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,531
With the end of the year approaching…

207
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,994
All right, you're good to go.

208
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,256
We'll keep one each
to remind us of our oath.

209
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,341
Oath? What oath?

210
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,176
That we'll always be friends.

211
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,598
And that we'll continue doing <i>gukgeuk</i>
until we're old and frail.

212
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,316
Jeongnyeon.

213
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,818
You can take it easy
since this is just a rehearsal.

214
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,070
But when we go live later,

215
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,239
you have to sing until the end
even if you make mistakes.

216
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,574
- All right.
- Okay?

217
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,576
- Let's start the rehearsal! Three!
- Okay.

218
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,702
Two!

219
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,871
One! Cue!

220
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,647
<i>The sun is setting on the Mokpo docks</i>

221
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:44,360
<i>A lady looks for her love</i>

222
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:50,574
<i>Her cheeks</i>

223
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,078
<i>Are as rosy as the setting sun</i>

224
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,333
<i>Walking by gracefully</i>

225
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,338
<i>She lives by the blue ocean</i>

226
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,799
<i>When will he return…</i>

227
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,008
She's good.

228
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,636
If this performance goes well,
it's all thanks to you.

229
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,097
She's doing everything
I told her to do, but…

230
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,974
But?

231
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,895
I don't think
I've ever seen her true self yet.

232
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,982
She's good enough for me right now.

233
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,402
<i>At the slightest sight of his ship</i>

234
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:32,157
<i>What am I to do with this longing?</i>

235
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,286
<i>She goes on pacing</i>

236
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:47,589
<i>Lady of the Mokpo docks</i>

237
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:11,071
<i>The sun is setting on the Mokpo docks</i>

238
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,951
<i>A lad looks for his love</i>

239
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,202
Cut!

240
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,372
Cut, cut!

241
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,000
Jeongnyeon, you're a lady.

242
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,503
Once you're on stage,
you should be sensuous and alluring.

243
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,505
Did you forget everything you practiced?

244
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,590
But…

245
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,635
the second verse
is when the man responds to the woman.

246
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,679
This isn't a <i>gukgeuk </i>performance!

247
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,807
Don't be silly,
lowering your voice like a man!

248
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,477
Just do as I tell you!

249
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,228
And if you're going to have gestures,

250
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,648
just use your hips and shoulders
like you did in the first verse.

251
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,026
Don't use those big gestures
like they do in <i>gukgeuk.</i>

252
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,613
Don't you know how to entice the audience?

253
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:57,701
Like a courtesan pouring drinks
and luring customers?

254
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,288
Am I a courtesan?

255
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,002
Is this how you're going to act?

256
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,254
Hey, you.

257
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:13,717
You can't go around being this arrogant
as if you're still in Maeran.

258
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,303
All you're good for is singing
when I tell you to sing

259
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,680
and smiling when I want you to smile.

260
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,641
Then am I your puppet?

261
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,812
If I can't perform the way I want to,

262
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,064
then I quit!

263
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,273
Hey!

264
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,068
I'll talk to her.

265
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,085
<i>Do not ever forget</i>

266
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,463
that you are artists
and make sure to act accordingly.

267
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,135
An artist…

268
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,647
Jeongnyeon.

269
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,526
I've had enough of this.

270
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,778
What's the point of performing

271
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,447
if my hands are tied
to his puppet strings?

272
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,035
He might as well
have a doll sing in my place.

273
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,579
Then what about your promise?

274
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,166
Promise?

275
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,502
Mr. Park tricked me from the start.

276
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,588
Are you telling me
that since I signed the contract,

277
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,214
I should keep my end of the bargain?

278
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,008
I'm not talking about your contract.

279
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,428
The moment you announced
that you'll sing on that stage,

280
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,638
you made a promise to your audience.

281
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,266
It's not a promise you can break

282
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,894
simply because
you don't feel like keeping it.

283
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,737
Forget about Mr. Park.

284
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:01,575
This performance
belongs to you and you alone.

285
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,286
Remember what I said before?

286
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,664
You need to own the song.

287
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,667
I'll be watching your performance
until the end,

288
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,421
so just focus on showing me
the kind of show

289
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,965
you want to perform.

290
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,994
<i>The sun is setting on the Mokpo docks</i>

291
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,624
<i>- A lady looks for her love</i>
- She's pretty good.

292
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:56,213
<i>- Her cheeks…</i>
- What a voice. Incredible.

293
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,339
You guys!

294
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,841
- Guys, guys, guys!
- What? What is it?

295
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,051
You guys!

296
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,262
Jeongnyeon is on television right now!

297
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,347
- What?
- Come on!

298
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,474
On television?

299
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,476
- Let's go!
- No way!

300
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,229
Hey! Jeongnyeon's on television!

301
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,313
Move!

302
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,481
- Come on, let's go!
- Careful!

303
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,692
- Here! Jeongnyeon!
- Move!

304
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,943
Really?

305
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,571
"Yoon Jeongnyeon Rising singer"

306
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,658
That's Jeongnyeon.

307
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,910
Raise the volume.

308
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,623
<i>She lives by the blue ocean…</i>

309
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,749
My gosh.

310
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,002
She's singing so well.

311
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,796
She looks so pretty all dolled up.

312
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,256
I barely recognize her.

313
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,674
Pretty, my foot.

314
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,680
<i>My heart flutters</i>

315
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:53,770
<i>At the slightest sight of his ship</i>

316
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:59,192
<i>What am I to do with this longing?</i>

317
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:04,031
<i>She goes on pacing…</i>

318
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,866
This is great.

319
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,076
Camera 2, get her face again.

320
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:14,416
<i>Lady of the Mokpo docks</i>

321
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,919
Amazing.

322
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,212
Bravo, bravo.

323
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,386
What? What is she doing?

324
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,059
Huh? What's she doing?

325
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,310
Why is she taking off her shoes?

326
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:38,106
<i>The sun is setting on the Mokpo docks</i>

327
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:43,028
<i>A lad looks for his love</i>

328
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,407
<i>As dashing as the sea breeze…</i>

329
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,159
I guess the second verse is sung by a guy.

330
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,537
But that's not pretty at all.

331
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,747
But it's funny.

332
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,833
<i>I like that her acting matches the song.</i>

333
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,543
What are you talking about?

334
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,380
She doesn't know a thing about pop...

335
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,385
Keep watching.

336
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,473
She's done it again.

337
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,396
<i>My heart flutters</i>

338
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,939
<i>At the slightest sight of her skirt…</i>

339
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,607
What is this, Mr. Park?

340
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,858
This is a disaster!

341
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,527
We can't even stop this since it's live!

342
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,028
What are you going to do?

343
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,281
She's doing whatever she wants out there!

344
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,366
I apologize.

345
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,119
She's new,
so she must not be familiar with our ways.

346
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,121
You said this would be a hit.

347
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,123
So what is this disaster?

348
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,292
Do something!

349
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:47,300

00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:09,322
<i>who hails from the very city of Mokpo…</i>

354
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,657
All right, that's enough.

355
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,409
But why?

356
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,952
- Turn it off.
- Do we have to?

357
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,329
That was fun.

358
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,373
I guess
television programs are pretty fun.

359
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,292
Jeongnyeon was pretty good.

360
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,960
We'll see her on television again, right?

361
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,671
I don't think we will.

362
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,755
Why not?

363
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,549
She sang the second verse
however she wanted.

364
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,720
That can't have been
what the studio told her to do.

365
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,722
Does that mean
she'll get kicked out again?

366
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,932
That's the least of her worries.

367
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,435
She'll probably have to pay damages.

368
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,520
Oh no.

369
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,148
All right, get up!

370
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,902
- Back to rehearsals.
- Okay.

371
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,833
I'm sorry.

372
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,671
I couldn't perform…

373
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,550
as a pop singer…

374
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,346
the way you taught me to.

375
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,476
No.

376
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,561
Don't be sorry.

377
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,856
That was the best performance
I've ever seen.

378
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,485
Really?

379
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,905
That would never have happened
if you only stuck to what I taught you.

380
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:38,161
That performance
was something only you could do.

381
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,081
So you should be proud of it.

382
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:47,003
I think I get what you were talking about.

383
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,298
From now on,

384
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,009
I won't deceive myself.

385
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,721
I can't live my life…

386
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,225
as anyone but me.

387
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,186
Remember…

388
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,607
don't make any choices that aren't you
under any circumstances.

389
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,195
Thank you for a wonderful performance.

390
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,701
Out of all the singers I've ever seen…

391
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,417
…you were number one.

392
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,524
So you're saying

393
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:54,738
that Jeongnyeon was only working
at the coffee shop for your sake?

394
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,490
Yes, ma'am.

395
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,159
And she didn't tell me any of this

396
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,536
to protect you?

397
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,747
Yes.

398
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,958
I'm the one who should be kicked out.

399
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,878
I'll of course take
whatever punishment you give me.

400
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,672
But please let Jeongnyeon come back.

401
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,843
Why were you working at the coffee shop?

402
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,305
My sister has tuberculosis.

403
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,642
I wanted to help pay for her medication.

404
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,649
All right.

405
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,151
You may go.

406
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,583
Do you know why I wanted
Jeongnyeon to join our troupe?

407
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,213
Others may say I lack nothing

408
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,675
since I've reached the peak of success
with <i>gukgeuk </i>performance.

409
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,137
But I was getting quite tired.

410
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,766
The same kinds of performances

411
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,518
with similar roles…

412
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,813
…and acting
that is no different from the next.

413
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,401
And since I had no rival to challenge me,

414
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,570
I had nothing to stimulate me whatsoever.

415
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,575
But when I heard Jeongnyeon sing…

416
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,581
I thought that one day
she'd be able to challenge my position.

417
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,709
That she'd quickly hone her skills

418
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,712
and come to threaten my place.

419
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,172
So…

420
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,926
you were looking for something
to stimulate you?

421
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,974
Our troupe needs someone like Jeongnyeon
as much as I do.

422
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,561
If we don't keep acquiring
young talent like her,

423
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,187
we'll become complacent,

424
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,356
and one day become completely stagnant.

425
00:28:55,942 --> 00:29:00,196
You must know this more acutely than I do.

426
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,201
Hey, Yoon Jeongnyeon!

427
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,247
How are you going to fix this?

428
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,583
All the investors who trusted me

429
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,877
as well as the studio itself
will tear me to shreds!

430
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,462
So what are you going to do about this?

431
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,422
I was trying to keep my promise.

432
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,631
What?

433
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,675
That was my promise from the beginning.

434
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,179
That I'd perform
as much as my talent allows.

435
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,267
So what's wrong
with performing my heart out?

436
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,435
Why, you little…

437
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,396
Are you joking right now?

438
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,481
I don't care.

439
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,441
You're going to sing
the way I tell you to!

440
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,485
I'm not going to do that.

441
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,154
Then get your mother to come on our show!

442
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,573
Or pay up for damages!

443
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,283
And how much is that?

444
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,957
- Director.
- What are you doing here?

445
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,086
I heard that one of my trainees was here,

446
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,463
so I came to fetch her.

447
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,882
And by the way,

448
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,927
I know her mother very well.

449
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,763
You can count on me when I say
she'll never come on your show.

450
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,391
So I'll pay for her damages

451
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,393
and take her back.

452
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,438
Now, how much should I pay you?

453
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:43,508
I heard that you were working
at the coffee shop

454
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,802
in Jooran's place.

455
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,640
Do you still want to do <i>gukgeuk?</i>

456
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:53,977
Yes.

457
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,729
I do.

458
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,441
I really do.

459
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,279
It was my misunderstanding

460
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,823
that you had used Maeran's fame
for your personal gain.

461
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,285
So I shall take you back.

462
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,043
But you'll still be punished
for getting paid to sing

463
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,588
at the coffee shop.

464
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,301
I'll take whatever punishment you give me.

465
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,096
Director.

466
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,640
Did you also accept me at first…

467
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,561
because of my mother?

468
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,066
Why would you ask that?

469
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,068
I only just found out…

470
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,407
that my mother used to be
a famous <i>pansori </i>singer.

471
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,536
But others who have heard me sing…

472
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,916
said it immediately reminded them of her.

473
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:03,212
So you know
that your mother is Chae Gongseon?

474
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:05,965
Yes.

475
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,096
Finding out I was in my mother's shadow
without even knowing…

476
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,601
It's frustrating.

477
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,229
I feel like whatever I do in my life…

478
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,902
I'll get compared to my mother.

479
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,905
What a silly thought.

480
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,407
You are you.

481
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:36,621
There's no need for you to compete
with a mere idea of your mother.

482
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,043
And it doesn't matter
why I accepted you in the beginning.

483
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:47,131
What matters is what you will do
with the chance you've been given.

484
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,718
I only want one thing from you.

485
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,304
To not give up…

486
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,809
and walk your own path until the very end.

487
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,828
How about a dance for the chancellor...

488
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:17,912
Wait a minute.

489
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,039
I think it'd be better

490
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,667
if you had bigger movements
as you approach Mokryeon.

491
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,627
- What do you all think?
- I think that's good.

492
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,296
Hey, kids!

493
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,340
- I'm back.
- Jeongnyeon!

494
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,635
Jeongnyeon!

495
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,472
How are you here?

496
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,182
Did the director take you back in?

497
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,185
I… heard you told her everything.

498
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:45,565
How could you be so reckless?
You could have been kicked out too.

499
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,859
It's what I should have done
from the beginning.

500
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,236
I'm sorry, Jeongnyeon.

501
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,032
Are you crying again?

502
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:59,495
You must have been so distressed
because of me.

503
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,081
But thanks to you,

504
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,916
the director…

505
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,295
has decided to forgive me.

506
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,756
Really?

507
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,924
Then you'll be staying with us
like before?

508
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,885
I'm telling you, I am!

509
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,137
That's so great, Jeongnyeon!

510
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,847
Hey, let me through.

511
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,476
You're looking better
now that you've been on television.

512
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,894
You've gotten prettier.

513
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,979
We all watched you sing on television.

514
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,356
Where did you learn to sing like that?

515
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,859
I almost didn't recognize you.

516
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,028
- You all watched it?
- Yeah.

517
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,447
Move it. Come on.

518
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,949
What was all that about?

519
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,702
You're supposed to sing pop songs
like a delicate lady.

520
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,412
But you even took off your shoes.

521
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,623
It wasn't pretty at all.

522
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,834
But it seems like
you watched the whole thing.

523
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,961
- Admit it.
- You watched it.

524
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,798
I had to because everyone else did.

525
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:55,968
Admit it. Weren't you bored
because you had no one to pick on anymore?

526
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,513
Aren't you glad I'm back?

527
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,349
Nope.
It was nice and quiet.

528
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,644
Did you just speak with an accent?

529
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,897
- Did you?
- You did!

530
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,608
- I didn't!
- My goodness, my little Chorok.

531
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,027
Did you miss me that much?

532
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,321
I didn't have an accent.

533
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,864
I missed you too.

534
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,866
I missed you!

535
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,827
Come on, loosen up!

536
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,705
So what were you guys doing?
Let me in on it!

537
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,939
Is this really okay?

538
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,192
Taking a photo must be really expensive.

539
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,946
When else
are we supposed to take pictures?

540
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,825
Today's the day
you recorded your very first recording.

541
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,911
We need to take a photo on a day like this

542
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,289
so it will be commemorated
by generations to come.

543
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,750
Come on, I don't need any of that.

544
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,545
All I need are you and my father.

545
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,923
The camera's ready.
Please sit down.

546
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,429
Here we go.

547
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,306
One, two, three.

548
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,479
Life really is unpredictable, isn't it?

549
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:36,277
I thought our relationship
died out years ago.

550
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,490
Who would've guessed…

551
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,036
that I would take your daughter in twice?

552
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,155
Hey.

553
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,117
There's something

554
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,703
I found out recently.

555
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,624
My mother…

556
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:37,672
was apparently a famous master of <i>pansori.</i>

557
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,549
Turns out…

558
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,678
that I also had an early starting point.

559
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:49,350
I thought having a famous mother
like you would be amazing.

560
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,936
But now I see that's not necessarily true.

561
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,732
I felt so small

562
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,818
and…

563
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,362
miserable.

564
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,531
So…

565
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,285
about what I said to you the other day.

566
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,705
- I apolo...
- I don't need your apology.

567
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,958
I hate rehashing what has already passed.

568
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,969
So she's still an expert
at cutting people off, huh?

569
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,987
January 18 Jamyunggo audition

570
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,545
What was that?

571
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,177
Dang it, I'm going to be late.

572
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,139
Jeongnyeon!

573
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:15,936
Okgyeong!

574
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,192
I'm back after experiencing
the world outside.

575
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,526
How was it?

576
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,906
It's more fun to perform
in front of an audience than a camera.

577
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,911
I'm so thankful
that the director took me back in.

578
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:37,041
She probably had no other choice
than to take you back.

579
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,876
Sorry?

580
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,836
I'm just glad you're back.

581
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,131
But weren't you going somewhere?

582
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,216
Oh, my goodness!

583
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,717
I have no time to chitchat!

584
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,552
I'll be off then!

585
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:58,979
If it's too heavy,

586
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,941
put it down when nobody's looking.

587
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,818
I'll tell you if someone's coming.

588
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,821
I'm okay.
This isn't that hard since I'm with you.

589
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,781
Really?

590
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,664
Put them down.

591
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,881
These are the director's punishments
for you two.

592
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,383
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

593
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,260
Until auditions are over,

594
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,263
you'll be cleaning the rehearsal hall
and doing the dishes and the laundry.

595
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,472
Hong Jooran,

596
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,558
you'll be cleaning the toilets
and the dormitories.

597
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,644
And the director forbids you
from joining any training

598
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,229
until you finish these chores.

599
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,275
- Okay.
- Okay.

600
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:50,948
Good job.

601
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:56,162
- Sorry?
- You protected your friend until the end.

602
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,997
Good job.

603
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:16,182
<i>Han strikes from up north</i>

604
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,392
<i>And Nakrang attacks from the east</i>

605
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,728
<i>Alas, how my land suffers</i>

606
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:25,441
<i>The north wind quakes our earth</i>

607
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:30,404
<i>And the east wind brings forth a storm</i>

608
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,657
How could anyone say that all is well?

609
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,410
You have no energy in your voices.

610
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,622
Again.

611
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:44,793
<i>Han strikes from up north</i>

612
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,253
<i>And Nakrang attacks…</i>

613
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,005
Jooran, Jeongnyeon

614
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,883
- Hey, Jeongnyeon.
- Hey.

615
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,261
- Come, come.
- I'm so tired.

616
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,097
Did you just finish?

617
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,142
I'm fine with getting punished,

618
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,354
but I don't think I'll pass the audition.

619
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,397
Why do you say that?

620
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,943
I can't attend any training
because I'm cleaning all day.

621
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,946
Then you could just train by yourself.

622
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,994
You're just making excuses
because you think you'll mess up anyway.

623
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,624
What did you say?

624
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,335
With that kind of mindset,
you definitely won't pass the audition.

625
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,879
It'll save you time
not to audition at all.

626
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:39,640
You can't say anything
in front of that brat!

627
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,476
My goodness!

628
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,397
Wait.

629
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,608
Did she just get mad at me
for not doing my best?

630
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,777
Jamyunggo

631
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,912
<i>I ride my steed</i>

632
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,206
<i>And shoot my arrow</i>

633
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:08,210
<i>- Who dares stand in my way?
- Who dares stand in my way?</i>

634
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:12,214
<i>- Who dares stand in my way?
- Who dares stand in my way?</i>

635
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,362
<i>Who is this Princess of Nakrang?</i>

636
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,324
<i>The enemy princess who protects…</i>

637
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,242
<i>The enemy princess…</i>

638
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,668
Oh, my goodness!

639
00:43:56,508 --> 00:44:01,889
<i>Their treasure is guarded by a woman</i>

640
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:02,973
<i>How incompetent…</i>

641
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,646
Oh, no. Move!

642
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,444
It's my calendar.

643
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,947
Jamyunggo audition

644
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,032
Jeongnyeon.

645
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,242
- What?
- Here.

646
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,043
You should eat.
You didn't even have dinner.

647
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,629
My goodness.

648
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:37,257
Thanks for looking out for me.
You're the best.

649
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,595
Do you still have a lot to do?

650
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,640
Yeah, after I finish
cleaning the bean sprouts,

651
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,767
I have to organize the prop room.

652
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,396
I need to finish everything tonight
so I can audition tomorrow morning.

653
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,482
- What about you?
- I just have some ironing left.

654
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,901
Let me help you with the prop room
after I'm done.

655
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,236
It's fine.

656
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,113
You have your audition tomorrow too.

657
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,365
You should focus on practicing
when you're done.

658
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,491
Then what about you?

659
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,284
I'll be fine.

660
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,412
If I stay up all night,

661
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,455
I'll make it to the audition.

662
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,208
So if I help you, you'll finish faster.

663
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,335
No, I told you to practice.

664
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,130
If you still come even after this,

665
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,673
I'll really be angry with you.

666
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,551
You got that?

667
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,303
I got it.

668
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,978
I don't even know where to start.

669
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:35,941
Let's do this.

670
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,419
My goodness,
this is going to take forever.

671
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:00,632
We will now begin
the audition for <i>Jamyunggo.</i>

672
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,843
We have the following judges.

673
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,179
The scriptwriter, Mr. Kwon Yeongseop,

674
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,598
the choreographer, Ms. Cho Suyeon,

675
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,602
and our drummer, Mr. Lee Yonggeun.

676
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,190
When we call your name,
you'll enter and begin your audition.

677
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,274
Yes, ma'am.

678
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,924
The audition!

679
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,599
What the… Why isn't this opening?

680
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,683
What?

681
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,895
Hello?

682
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,564
I'm stuck in here!

683
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,776
Hello?

684
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,945
Is anyone out there?

685
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,489
Which role will you be auditioning for?

686
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,949
Gomigeol, ma'am.

687
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,910
{\an8}You're auditioning for the antagonist
and not the lead?

688
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,453
Yes.

689
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,249
All right. Begin.

690
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,294
<i>Youngseo's auditioning for Gomigeol.</i>

691
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:23,423
She's auditioning for the antagonist
and not the lead?

692
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,094
She must be going for it
because she obviously won't get the lead.

693
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,804
And is it easy to get the antagonist?

694
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:32,099
They'll never pick her over Doaeng.
She's much more experienced.

695
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:39,606
Hodong and Mokryeon have promised to wed?

696
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,484
That won't do. That simply won't do.

697
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,196
Goguryeo and Nakrang
are to remain enemies.

698
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:52,119
They need to keep fighting
and wear each other down

699
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,704
for the great Han…

700
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,875
to strike both at the same time.

701
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,546
Things will be bad
if they form an alliance.

702
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,508
What should be done about this?

703
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,267
You are as pretty as ever.

704
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:21,481
If it wasn't for Mokryeon,
I would have you as my concubine.

705
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:23,859
Dear Precious.

706
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,363
Have you heard
that Mokryeon and Hodong are to be wed?

707
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,283
They are nothing but rumors.

708
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:40,500
You poor, pretty little thing.

709
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:46,882
Deliver this letter
to Princess Mokryeon in secret.

710
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:50,385
I desire to have Mokryeon,
and you desire to have Prince Hodong.

711
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,929
If you deliver this letter…

712
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:57,726
the two will never be able to wed.

713
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,859
As expected of a seasoned antagonist.

714
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,402
This was always your role, wasn't it?

715
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,487
Yes.

716
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:16,703
Is Jeongnyeon here?

717
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:18,789
Not yet.

718
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,749
She said she'd come
after cleaning the prop room.

719
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:21,959
What's taking her so long?

720
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,085
Did she fall asleep?

721
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,005
I think I'll have to go fetch her myself.

722
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,217
Next is Hong Jooran!

723
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,719
Oh, no.

724
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,639
Pilsun.

725
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:38,266
I'm sorry, but could you fetch Jeongnyeon
from the prop room?

726
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,434
I can't go myself right now.

727
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,895
I don't know when they'll call me in.
I can't go.

728
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,772
Oh, you're right.

729
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,108
Hong Jooran. Are you coming in or not?

730
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,944
Could you give me some time?

731
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,946
- I just need to go and fetch...
- You should go in.

732
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,490
I'll fetch Jeongnyeon.

733
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,411
- Thanks, Youngseo!
- Hurry up and come in!

734
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,371
Yes, sir.

735
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,424
There, that's it.

736
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,058
What now?

737
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,643
What the heck?

738
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,271
My blasted butt!

739
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,402
You there! Heo Youngseo!

740
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,697
Oh my, it's good to see you!

741
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,157
What are you doing there?

742
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,075
That's not important.

743
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,578
Pull me out.

744
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,416
Hey!

745
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,294
We have a door!
Why would you come out the window?

746
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,671
Why else? The door is locked!

747
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,590
Come on! Pull harder!

748
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,467
Your arms are so weak!

749
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:00,682
I'm out.

750
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,809
I'm out!

751
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,894
I'm out!

752
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,312
Get off!

753
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,438
You're crushing me!

754
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:10,400
Thank you so much, Youngseo!

755
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,861
You really saved me!

756
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:16,156
Hey, we don't have time for this!

757
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,241
The audition's about to end!

758
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,912
My goodness! The audition!

759
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,038
Oh, come on!

760
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,209
The last one…

761
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,543
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

762
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:31,797
Is Jeongnyeon here?

763
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,174
If she's not here,
then we'll end the auditions.

764
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,177
No, please. She's coming.
Please wait just a bit.

765
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,430
I'm here!

766
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,307
Jeongnyeon!

767
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:45,727
Come on.

768
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,190
I'm here for my audition.

769
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,567
Hurry up and come in.

770
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,124
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

771
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,501
Which role will you be auditioning for?

772
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,961
The soldier, ma'am.

773
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,088
The soldier?

774
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:16,007
You mean the soldier
who informs everyone of the war?

775
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,469
- Yes.
- And you're aware that it's a small role?

776
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,846
I'm aware.

777
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,430
All right then.

778
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,433
You may begin.

779
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,686
Let's start from the scene
with all the soldiers.

780
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,271
I'll read the other lines.

781
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,356
My goodness,

782
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,608
I guess we are going to bed starving
once more.

783
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,863
Provisions are running short,

784
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,740
so they are only able to give us
one meal a day.

785
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,453
I wonder how my parents are faring
back at home.

786
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,664
I am worried sick for them.

787
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,207
It is the same for me.

788
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,877
My son had just started walking
around the time I left home.

789
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,130
He probably cannot recall my face anymore.

790
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,007
How can anyone expect us
to fight in battle

791
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,218
when we are all absolutely starving?

792
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,305
Do the high and mighty nobles
at the capital

793
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,099
have any idea of our plight?

794
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,310
Watch what you say.
Someone might hear you.

795
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,312
Then let them hear.

796
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,481
I do not go to battle
for those in the palace.

797
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:19,237
I go to battle for my family
back in my hometown!

798
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,908
Let's move on to the next line.

799
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,786
General!

800
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,997
The soldiers of Goguryeo

801
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,000
are swarming in!

802
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,921
All right, that's enough.

803
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,760
You know you need to prepare for any role
no matter how small it may be, right?

804
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,012
Yes, of course.

805
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:45,764
You may go then.

806
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,279
How was it? Did you do well?

807
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,782
I don't know.

808
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,826
I did my best though.

809
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,508
Thanks for earlier.

810
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,427
You really saved me.

811
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,512
I didn't do it for...

812
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,264
For me, I know.

813
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:29,766
I know, okay?

814
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,186
But I still wanted to thank you.

815
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,694
So…

816
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:42,904
why did you help me?

817
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,657
I need to check something.

818
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:49,286
- Check what?
- Your acting in <i>Chunhyangjeon.</i>

819
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,331
I need to know whether that was
a stroke of luck or your skills.

820
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,626
So I need to see you acting again.

821
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,670
I don't get it.

822
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,131
Forget it.

823
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:07,470
So why couldn't you open
the prop room door?

824
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,680
I have no idea.

825
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:13,560
I think someone locked it
without knowing I was in there.

826
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,820
See? It's locked.

827
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,490
So that's when it was locked?

828
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,869
Was it on purpose
knowing Jeongnyeon would be in here?

829
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,370
Of course it was on purpose.

830
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:33,747
Really?

831
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:38,293
Hey, we need to keep this a secret, okay?

832
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,254
Keep what a secret?

833
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,339
Oh, my goodness!

834
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:46,634
You guys locked Jeongnyeon in
so she'd miss the audition, didn't you?

835
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,094
- No!
- It wasn't us!

836
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,680
We also just heard
that she was locked in here.

837
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,059
- Right! It really wasn't us this time!
- It wasn't us.

838
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,978
Then what were you talking about just now?

839
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,855
We were just…

840
00:55:58,938 --> 00:55:59,939
I guess I have no choice.

841
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,942
Let's continue this conversation
with the director.

842
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,611
- No!
- You can't!

843
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,072
I'm telling you, it wasn't us this time.

844
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:10,742
It was actually…

845
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:11,826
You can't!

846
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,096
Who else knows about this?

847
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,223
Just me and those three.

848
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,185
All right. Thanks for telling me.

849
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:46,611
Now we need to decide
who will play Gomigeol.

850
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:53,159
I think Doaeng's take on Gomigeol
was very manly and charismatic.

851
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:57,038
I could see
why she's the go-to actor for antagonists.

852
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,083
I have no doubt
that Doaeng's acting is amazing.

853
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:04,629
But I think Youngseo's acting
was quite on par with hers.

854
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,383
It was a refreshing take on the role.

855
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:11,928
Gomigeol who's not just a bad guy,
but also a strategist.

856
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,056
What is your opinion, Mr. Kwon?

857
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,225
As you two have already mentioned,

858
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:21,521
each actor had
their own very different strengths.

859
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,983
Since we can't come to a conclusion,

860
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,235
I think the director will have to decide.

861
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,159
<i>I will now announce</i>

862
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:37,078
the results of the <i>Jamyunggo </i>auditions.

863
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:41,499
First, as our male lead, Prince Hodong,

864
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,543
Moon Okgyeong.

865
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:51,050
As Princess Mokryeon, Seo Hyerang.

866
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,721
Next is Gomigeol.

867
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:58,975
As Gomigeol…

868
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,313
Heo Youngseo.

869
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,324
But Doaeng has always played
the antagonist.

870
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:17,494
Some people even buy tickets
for all showings just to see Doaeng.

871
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:20,580
Would they still come
if they knew that Youngseo was Gomigeol?

872
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,915
Right.

873
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,583
As Precious,

874
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,168
Hong Jooran.

875
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,256
As Prince Hodong's friend…

876
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,341
What?

877
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,385
I didn't even know
you auditioned for Precious.

878
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,596
I didn't know I'd get the role either.

879
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,184
You're amazing.

880
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,854
As Soldier 1…

881
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,482
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

882
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,234
I did it!

883
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,318
My gosh!

884
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,281
As Soldier 2, Shin Woncheol.

885
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,325
- As Soldier 3, Woo Migeum.
- Yes.

886
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:59,744
As Soldier 4, Oh Pilsun.

887
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,247
All right.

888
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:06,084
We'll start our read-through
of the script tomorrow.

889
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,418
Come prepared.

890
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,503
Yes, ma'am!

891
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,473
This is amazing.

892
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,229
Remember what I told you

893
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:30,692
when you were being so stubborn
about becoming a <i>gukgeuk </i>actor?

894
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,069
That you and I

895
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,446
will no longer be aunt and niece
once you're in Maeran.

896
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,699
I know you had no choice.

897
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,786
Youngseo's singing is far above my level.

898
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,997
Do you think your talent

899
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,250
only lies in playing the antagonist?

900
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,379
It was normal for other girls

901
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,090
to only analyze their own roles
for a performance.

902
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:58,136
But even when you were a trainee,
you analyzed all the roles in the script.

903
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,888
You knew how to look
for the hidden messages

904
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:04,017
within each line and even the play itself.

905
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,895
You have the talent
to become a stage director.

906
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:09,939
Auntie.

907
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,278
If you're up for it,

908
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,073
help me direct <i>Jamyunggo</i>
as the assistant director.

909
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,912
You can start a new journey
to become a director.

910
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:34,172
General! The soldiers of Goryeo are...

911
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,548
No, Goguryeo.

912
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,634
The soldiers of Goguryeo are…

913
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,512
I keep having an accent.

914
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,765
The soldier isn't Bangja.

915
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:45,600
He's not supposed to have an accent.

916
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,187
By the way,

917
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:52,190
why did you audition
for a small role like the soldier?

918
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,442
With your skills,
you could have had a bigger role.

919
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,738
Youngseo told me last time

920
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,948
that the reason I played Bangja so well

921
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:03,576
was because she matched my performance.

922
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,997
And that kept bothering me.

923
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,418
So instead of going for the big roles,

924
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,087
I thought I'd go for a smaller one

925
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,674
and focus on learning
how others act instead.

926
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,301
I see your point.

927
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,596
{\an8}There's a reason why the director
only lets trainees play extras.

928
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:26,974
Let's talk about you.

929
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,435
You said you'd audition
for an extra last time,

930
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,688
so how did you get the role of Precious?

931
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,607
Nobody even knew
that you auditioned for Precious.

932
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,904
You're the one
who actually made me go for it.

933
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,532
- Me?
- All this time,

934
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:47,328
I didn't think I'd be able to play
anything other than an extra.

935
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,206
Then you told me the other day

936
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,833
that I can't know until I actually try.

937
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:58,172
And I started wanting more
after seeing you play Bangja.

938
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:02,260
Well, I'm honored to hear
that I helped you.

939
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,513
I have a dream too.

940
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:06,597
A dream?

941
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:08,766
What is it?

942
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:13,813
I want us to stand on stage
face-to-face one day

943
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,440
with you as the male lead

944
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,234
and me as the female lead.

945
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,571
Just like Okgyeong and Hyerang right now?

946
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:22,947
Yeah.

947
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,700
I'd love to!

948
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,618
Wait a minute.

949
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:32,457
Then I'll have to work a bit harder
to achieve that.

950
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,335
It's a promise.

951
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:38,880
Here, pinky promise.

952
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,465
This again.

953
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:43,384
You really love stuff
like oaths and promises, don't you?

954
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,386
Come on.

955
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:47,722
Fine.

956
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:17,168
<i>Jamyunggo</i> is our troupe's
signature performance.

957
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,545
And we'll be raising the scale
for this rendition

958
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:23,549
by renewing everything from stage design,
costumes, props, and the like.

959
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,843
It'll be our best performance yet.

960
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,596
I'm expecting phenomenal acting from you

961
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:31,474
worthy of this monumental performance.

962
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:32,892
Yes, ma'am.

963
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:36,103
Doaeng will be
the assistant director of this show,

964
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:39,524
and she'll be helping me oversee
the entire stage directing.

965
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,234
Yes, ma'am.

966
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,488
Let's start from Bau's line.

967
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,534
The children are singing.

968
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:51,661
How merry.

969
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:56,415
This is all thanks to our great king.

970
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:02,505
Can you really say that all is well?

971
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:11,305
<i>Han strikes from up north</i>

972
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,599
<i>And Nakrang attacks from the east</i>

973
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,310
<i>Alas, how my land suffers</i>

974
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:21,065
<i>The north wind quakes our earth</i>

975
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:25,778
<i>And the east wind brings forth a storm</i>

976
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,781
How could anyone say that all is well?

977
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:31,909
My Prince.

978
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,828
Precious has returned.

979
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:38,541
Your Precious has returned
from her espionage mission.

980
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,001
Stop.

981
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,254
Precious had to come back
because she was fatally wounded.

982
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:44,839
She can't sound cheerful.

983
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:46,632
Yes, ma'am.

984
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:47,884
Let's move on to Gomigeol.

985
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:50,511
Dear Precious.

986
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,264
Gomigeol.

987
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:56,559
You are another country's chancellor.
What are you doing in our prince's hall?

988
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,853
My dear Precious,

989
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,147
you are as pretty as ever.

990
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:06,235
If it wasn't for Mokryeon,
I would have you as my concubine.

991
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:08,613
Dear Precious.

992
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:12,158
Have you heard
that Mokryeon and Hodong are to be wed?

993
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,911
They are nothing but rumors.

994
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,668
You poor, pretty little thing.

995
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,590
Deliver this letter
to Princess Mokryeon in secret.

996
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:29,300
I desire to have Mokryeon, and you…

997
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:32,386
desire to have Prince Hodong.

998
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:36,891
If you deliver this letter,
the two will never be able to wed.

999
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:37,975
Youngseo.

1000
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,728
Are you going to keep that tone?

1001
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:42,939
Uh… yes.

1002
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,815
Is that so?

1003
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:49,737
All right, next.

1004
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,075
Next!

1005
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:56,535
Nakrang soldier!
Jeongnyeon, what are you doing?

1006
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,537
What? Oh, sorry!

1007
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,334
General!

1008
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:07,505
The soldiers of Goryeo are swarming in!

1009
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:11,050
It's Goguryeo, not Goryeo!

1010
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,052
How could you mess up such a simple line?

1011
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:17,515
Quiet.

1012
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,266
That's enough.

1013
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,352
Enough!

1014
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:31,362
You poor, pretty little thing.

1015
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:35,574
Now, deliver this letter
to Princess Mokryeon in secret.

1016
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:41,622
I need to be more intimidating.

1017
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:46,794
Now,

1018
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,089
deliver this letter
to Princess Mokryeon in secret.

1019
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,675
What are you doing?

1020
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,057
That's not your Gomigeol.

1021
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,559
It's Doaeng's.

1022
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,020
You did this at the read-through too.

1023
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,772
It's not like you to mimic
someone else's acting.

1024
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:08,941
What do you know?

1025
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:12,945
Those who consider Doaeng's take
as the right Gomigeol…

1026
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:15,865
may not want to see my version.

1027
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,619
Don't you remember what you said to me
during <i>Chunhyangjeon?</i>

1028
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,957
You gave me such a hard time
because I didn't have my own Bangja.

1029
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,208
And now you're telling me

1030
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:29,295
you're going to mimic
Doaeng's take on Gomigeol?

1031
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,175
Worry about your own acting.

1032
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:38,345
Who are you lecturing
when you can't even say a simple line?

1033
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:44,435
You're right.

1034
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:48,731
I've got my own problems.

1035
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,402
Sorry for overstepping.

1036
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,490
I'm just saying,

1037
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:01,368
I'd like you to enjoy
playing your own Gomigeol.

1038
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,871
Just wanted you to know that.

1039
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:08,793
How in the world
am I supposed to enjoy it?

1040
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,049
Okgyeong told me the same thing,
to enjoy it.

1041
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:17,218
I guess it's possible for the two of you.

1042
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,845
But I'm always so nervous before a show,

1043
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,138
so how am I supposed to enjoy anything?

1044
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,307
Sure.

1045
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:27,103
Maybe you can enjoy everything
on stage or off stage.

1046
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,437
But I'm different.

1047
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,566
I have to prove myself
every time I'm on stage.

1048
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:35,152
What in the world are you trying to prove?

1049
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:37,196
That I'm worthy enough
to be Han Kijoo's daughter!

1050
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,615
My mom has to acknowledge that!

1051
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:48,833
So that's it.

1052
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,045
That's your real weakness.

1053
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:55,798
From what I see,

1054
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,509
you're not able to focus on your acting.

1055
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:01,971
You're too hung up on
getting approval from your mother.

1056
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,890
Don't you dare assume things about me.

1057
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,267
Actually,

1058
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,686
a soldier is perfect
for your level of skill.

1059
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:10,771
At least my soldier…

1060
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,983
is my own take and interpretation.

1061
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,401
It's mine!

1062
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,987
Yoon Jeongnyeon's acting!

1063
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:21,448
It's different
from your sad copy of an act.

1064
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:23,242
You better wait.

1065
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:24,952
Wait and see how I put you in your place.

1066
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,705
You'll only be playing roles
like that soldier

1067
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:29,832
as you stand behind me forever.

1068
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:32,710
You're going to put me in my place?

1069
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:35,045
Let's see who actually gets to do that.

1070
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,132
Who knows?

1071
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,677
Maybe one day…

1072
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:46,974
I'll stand in front of you.

1073
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:20,007
The Blooming Autumn Field

1074
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:27,014
JEONGNYEON: THE STAR IS BORN

1075
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:29,266
{\an8}<i>The basis of good acting is confidence.</i>

1076
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,518
{\an8}<i>I just need to show everyone
my own soldier.</i>

1077
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,437
{\an8}What are you talking about?

1078
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,147
{\an8}Would you look at this punk?

1079
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:39,526
{\an8}<i>I had my reasons for taking the soldier.</i>

1080
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:40,861
{\an8}<i>Get out of your head.</i>

1081
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,113
{\an8}The audience is not here
to see you tonight.

1082
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:45,366
{\an8}<i>Jeongnyeon is supposed to be
a simple soldier.</i>

1083
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,077
{\an8}General…

1084
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,246
{\an8}…the soldiers of Goguryeo are…

1085
