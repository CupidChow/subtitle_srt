8
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,060
Act 2

9
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:17,066
I think
I made a mistake when dancing earlier.

10
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:18,526
I completely blanked out.

11
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,528
I really wish I could make it.

12
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,780
- What if I get disqualified?
- Don't worry.

13
00:00:22,863 --> 00:00:24,657
Oh, wow.

14
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,285
Girls from Seoul really are different.

15
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:29,578
Their clothes are so nice.

16
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:33,833
See that girl?

17
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,251
Moon Okgyeong brought her over.

18
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,461
Moon Okgyeong? But why?

19
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:39,296
Maybe she's close with her.

20
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:42,633
But she seems so shabby.

21
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:45,261
Maybe her family's really rich.

22
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:47,263
Right? We should go talk to her.

23
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:55,104
Hey, how do you know Moon Okgyeong?

24
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:57,314
Her mom's a dancer

25
00:00:57,398 --> 00:00:59,859
and my dad runs
a restaurant in Myeongdong.

26
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:01,318
What does your family do?

27
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:03,529
My family?

28
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:06,991
What's this smell?

29
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:10,035
It smells like rotting fish.

30
00:01:17,793 --> 00:01:20,045
It's coming from her.

31
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:23,048
From me?

32
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:25,926
What are you, a fishmonger?

33
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:32,725
You have an amazing nose.

34
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:34,727
You're right.

35
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,063
My family sells fish in Mokpo.

36
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:39,440
W-What?

37
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:41,066
You're a fishmonger?

38
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,151
Yeah.

39
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:44,403
Then how are you so close
to Moon Okgyeong?

40
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:46,572
I met her
while selling fish at the market.

41
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:49,909
My, my.

42
00:01:49,992 --> 00:01:52,244
I thought you were from a rich family.

43
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:55,873
But you were just a fishmonger
at some market.

44
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:59,043
What's wrong with being
a fishmonger at a market?

45
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,671
You better get your game on…

46
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:07,218
if you don't want to lose
to some lowly fishmonger.

47
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:10,513
Watch out, you hear me?

48
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:12,181
Who do you think you are?

49
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:15,601
Next! No. 90, 91, and 92.

50
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:16,769
Please come in.

51
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:18,479
- Yes.
- Okay!

52
00:02:18,562 --> 00:02:20,606
- What was that?
- Come on!

53
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:48,759
Stop.

54
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:53,013
- No. 92.
- Yes?

55
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:55,182
You keep missing the beat.

56
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:57,268
What's with your arm?

57
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:58,352
I…

58
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,647
I sprained my shoulder.

59
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,069
Next is acting.

60
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:09,363
We will provide you with a topic,

61
00:03:09,446 --> 00:03:13,075
and you will come out one by one
to show us your acting skills.

62
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:14,743
A topic?

63
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:16,620
Is there a problem?

64
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:17,830
No.

65
00:03:18,706 --> 00:03:21,417
It's just that I thought
there would be a script.

66
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,421
Any actor needs to be able
to act without a script.

67
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:28,924
Anything could happen on stage
to disrupt a performance.

68
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,468
When that happens,
are you going to space out and do nothing

69
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:33,012
because that wasn't in the script?

70
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:35,055
Now then…

71
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,892
your topic is sadness.

72
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:42,521
Sadness?

73
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:45,107
Are you sure
she came with Okgyeong?

74
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,943
I'm telling you, I'm sure.

75
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,612
I can't believe it.

76
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:52,615
What's going on?

77
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:54,658
You know how we're selecting new trainees?

78
00:03:54,742 --> 00:03:57,119
There's someone special in the mix.

79
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:59,163
Who is she? Is she good?

80
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:02,291
Apparently Okgyeong
personally brought her over.

81
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,251
Okgyeong did?

82
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:06,754
Everyone's curious to know who she is.

83
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,297
No.

84
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:10,549
More like fuming.

85
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:12,551
Let's see how great she is.

86
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:15,346
My Cheolsu…

87
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:16,847
Open your eyes.

88
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:19,975
How could you leave behind your mother?

89
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:24,563
I never had the chance
to give you a better life.

90
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:28,734
Oh no, my Cheolsu!

91
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:30,402
Open your eyes!

92
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:31,487
That's enough.

93
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:38,744
No. 91.

94
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:41,538
But you said you loved me the other day.

95
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:43,248
You're awful.

96
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:45,209
How could you do this to me?

97
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:46,293
All right.

98
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:53,217
No. 92.

99
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,096
No. 92!

100
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:00,015
Yes.

101
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:24,415
Father, get up.

102
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:28,585
Get up, Father!

103
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:39,013
Jungja…

104
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:40,097
Yes.

105
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,391
It's me, Jungja.

106
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:07,458
Father…

107
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,876
Father!

108
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,003
Father, no!

109
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:14,423
<i>Father! Father!</i>

110
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:17,801
Father!

111
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,241
That's enough.

112
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,289
You could have said something

113
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:49,208
or cried out loud.

114
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,542
Why didn't you?

115
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:54,421
I was…

116
00:06:55,297 --> 00:06:56,381
I was thinking of…

117
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:00,219
when my father passed away.

118
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:06,266
When he died, I was so crushed

119
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:08,727
that I couldn't say anything…

120
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:12,356
or make any noise.

121
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:16,652
All right.

122
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:20,280
We'll now move on to singing.

123
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:25,327
<i>Come here</i>
<i>Let me give you a piggyback ride</i>

124
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:31,125
<i>My love, my love, you are my love</i>

125
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:36,338
<i>Oh love, you are my love</i>

126
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:41,176
<i>Yes, you are my love</i>

127
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,594
Enough.

128
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:48,058
Next, No. 91.

129
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:52,855
<i>When you die</i>

130
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:57,526
<i>Become an icicle in the mountains</i>

131
00:07:57,609 --> 00:08:02,364
<i>For I will die</i>

132
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:07,161
<i>And become the spring breeze</i>

133
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:08,245
Enough.

134
00:08:08,328 --> 00:08:10,330
No. 92.

135
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:24,636
<i>The autumn moon</i>

136
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,183
<i>Is in</i>

137
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:33,562
<i>Full bloom</i>

138
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:38,901
<i>And it glows</i>

139
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:45,449
<i>Upon</i>

140
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:48,619
<i>The marble</i>

141
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:53,916
<i>Carved from coral reefs</i>

142
00:08:56,668 --> 00:09:03,258
<i>A wild goose</i>

143
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:07,221
<i>Flies</i>

144
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:11,433
<i>Underneath the moon</i>

145
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:13,977
<i>Crying</i>

146
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:22,194
<i>Dear goose</i>

147
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:27,574
<i>Should you</i>

148
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:32,204
<i>Pass my hometown</i>

149
00:09:34,623 --> 00:09:38,835
<i>I implore you</i>

150
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,048
<i>Please</i>

151
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:47,052
<i>Take this letter</i>

152
00:09:47,135 --> 00:09:51,556
<i>To my</i>

153
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,354
<i>Poor father</i>

154
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:25,465
What if we don't make the list
because we were grouped with her?

155
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:28,427
I'm just glad I didn't sing after she did.

156
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,637
I would have danced better…

157
00:10:31,388 --> 00:10:33,223
if it weren't for my shoulder.

158
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:37,269
I hope
I'm not disqualified because of that.

159
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:45,944
I will now announce those who passed.

160
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:48,071
Oh my.

161
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,450
No. 23, Jin Yeonhong.

162
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:54,328
That's me! I made it!

163
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:58,874
No. 90, Seo Boksil.

164
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,209
Oh! Seo Boksil! That's me!

165
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,337
I made it too!

166
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,713
Park Chorok.

167
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:09,176
Good job, girls!

168
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:14,890
That's all of the official trainees.

169
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:19,936
But this year, we're making an exception

170
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,773
and accepting one understudy.

171
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:24,358
Understudy:
Someone who fills a vacant role

172
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:26,193
Eh? An understudy?

173
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:27,527
So there's an extra trainee?

174
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:28,904
No. 92, Yoon Jeongnyeon.

175
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:30,322
Yoon Jeongnyeon?

176
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:33,867
- Who's that?
- Wait, isn't that her?

177
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,077
An understudy?

178
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:41,541
That still means I passed, doesn't it?

179
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,626
That'll be all.

180
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,378
Those of you who passed,

181
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:46,546
please move into the dormitories
by this afternoon.

182
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,090
The rest of you are free to go.

183
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:51,343
- Great work, everyone.
- I passed.

184
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:54,930
Jungja, I passed!

185
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:57,140
No. 92, Yoon Jeongnyeon?

186
00:11:57,766 --> 00:11:58,767
Follow me.

187
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:23,125
Do you know
why you've been chosen as an understudy?

188
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:25,043
Isn't it…

189
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:28,922
because I didn't dance too well?

190
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:33,552
But that's because I injured my shoulder.

191
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,429
I'm usually better than that.

192
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:37,013
That's not it.

193
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:40,350
Remember that Moon Okgyeong brought you.

194
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:42,519
If I had just accepted you,

195
00:12:43,186 --> 00:12:45,021
everyone in our troupe
would think I did so…

196
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:49,151
simply because she brought you.

197
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:52,154
So now,

198
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,906
you'll have to prove yourself.

199
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:57,868
Show everyone that you were accepted…

200
00:12:58,785 --> 00:13:03,206
not because of Moon Okgyeong
but purely for your skills alone.

201
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:05,333
If you can't do that,

202
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:08,420
you're not worthy of joining Maeran.

203
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:13,425
I'll do it.

204
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:17,721
I'm sure I can prove to everyone
that I got accepted with my skills.

205
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:20,849
As long as you're an understudy,
you're not an official trainee.

206
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,059
You may stay,

207
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:27,731
but remember that you'll have to leave
the moment I tell you to.

208
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:33,570
You said you're from Mokpo?

209
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:34,946
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,033
What might your mother's name be?

211
00:13:39,576 --> 00:13:42,245
Her name is Seo Yongrye.

212
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:46,500
Are you sure that's her name?

213
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,753
Yes, I am.

214
00:13:51,254 --> 00:13:52,255
Is that so?

215
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:57,344
Okay then. You may go.

216
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:21,826
I passed!

217
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,205
You did it.

218
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:28,583
Of course,
I could be asked to leave at any time…

219
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,211
but I still passed.

220
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:33,255
This is all…

221
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:37,968
thanks to you, Okgyeong.

222
00:14:39,469 --> 00:14:42,847
I'll make sure to repay you
one way or another.

223
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:45,141
Just focus on your training
and improve quickly.

224
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,103
Be good enough to fight for my position.

225
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:50,981
Oh, I could never.

226
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:52,065
No.

227
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:53,775
That's your next step.

228
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:55,986
Can you do it?

229
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,530
Yes.

230
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,797
About the new trainee,

231
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,132
Yoon Jeongnyeon…

232
00:15:17,757 --> 00:15:18,842
Did you train her?

233
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:20,552
Yes.

234
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:24,472
You don't even like training
the troupe members.

235
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:27,225
And you personally trained the girl?

236
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:30,645
How do you even know her?

237
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,564
I just met her in Mokpo.

238
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:34,899
The moment I heard her sing,

239
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,944
I knew I had to bring her here.

240
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:40,989
I guess you really liked her.

241
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:45,660
What did you think of her singing?

242
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:50,874
She reminded me of my friend
who I trained with.

243
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:56,671
Everyone said
that she was blessed by the heavens.

244
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:59,507
Then she must be
an incredible singer by now.

245
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:02,510
I don't know about that.

246
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:13,647
They said it's the last room
on the right side.

247
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,613
It must be here.

248
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:26,618
They assigned you that room?

249
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:28,995
Yes.

250
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,790
They said everywhere else was full.

251
00:16:31,873 --> 00:16:34,250
Do you know who your roommate is?

252
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:37,170
No. Who is it?

253
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:38,254
She's--

254
00:16:38,338 --> 00:16:40,215
You know, you're very lucky.

255
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,300
- That room has so much space.
- Hey.

256
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:46,471
Right. They can't let someone
so close to Okgyeong use just any room.

257
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:49,766
Other girls have two to three roommates,
but you only get one.

258
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:51,518
How nice is that?

259
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:53,144
Goodnight then.

260
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:57,315
Goodnight.

261
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:34,352
I wanted to introduce myself to her,
but she's still not here.

262
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:45,864
She's so organized.

263
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:51,411
It'll be hard to manage
if she's the overly tidy type.

264
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:57,459
Is that why the other girls
were being like that?

265
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,214
My goodness.

266
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:08,928
Oh my, this is nice!

267
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:19,606
<i>Mother,</i>
<i>I'mgoingto earn lotsof money</i>

268
00:18:19,689 --> 00:18:20,857
<i>and treat you to nice things.</i>

269
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,236
Trust me, I'll make sure you and Jungja
never touch any house chores.

270
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,947
Thanks for the thought.

271
00:18:28,031 --> 00:18:29,365
Right, thanks.

272
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:32,160
I guess Jeongnyeon is all grown up now.

273
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,330
I guess so.

274
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:40,001
Then I'll have to make sure
to be healthy and well

275
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,463
until my little girl treats me.

276
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:48,551
I just have to make it big.

277
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:20,083
Chunhyangjeon

278
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:51,531
What's this?

279
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:55,326
Was she even here last night?

280
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:01,958
That's her, Yoon Jeongnyeon.

281
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:04,335
The bumpkin from Mokpo

282
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,297
who got a zero for dancing
but a hundred for singing.

283
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,384
If she's such a genius singer,
she'd go head-to-head with Her Highness.

284
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:13,887
Don't be ridiculous.

285
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:17,765
Heo Youngseo is good enough to take
the male lead for an official performance.

286
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,810
But Yoon Jeongnyeon
is still just an understudy.

287
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:23,313
Jooran, could you finish up here?

288
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:25,023
- Okay.
- Let's go.

289
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:31,070
Yeonhong! Hurry!

290
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:44,250
Oh, my gosh!

291
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,632
Nice to meet you. I'm Hong Jooran.

292
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:55,637
I'm Yoon Jeongnyeon.

293
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,972
You don't have to bow to me like that.

294
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,392
I'm also just a newbie trainee here.

295
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,479
Yeah?

296
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:07,148
Mm. Nice to meet you.

297
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:09,567
You haven't really been
around the troupe, have you?

298
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:12,445
Should I show you around?

299
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:16,115
Yes.

300
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:18,368
Let's go.

301
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:27,126
The troupe is largely divided
into dormitories and training areas.

302
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,422
And the dormitories are also divided
into senior and junior quarters.

303
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,093
That's where the cafeteria
and kitchen are.

304
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,929
That's the business office.

305
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,681
Business office?

306
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,766
It's where they take care of the ledger.

307
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,519
It doesn't have a lot to do with us.

308
00:21:45,395 --> 00:21:48,982
And that's where the toilet
and the showers are.

309
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:51,609
It's better to go early
because it's always packed.

310
00:21:57,699 --> 00:22:01,744
Make sure to use the back gate
and not the front gate.

311
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:03,162
Why?

312
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:13,798
It's open!

313
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:20,847
Oh, my goodness!

314
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,726
As you can see, there are fans
just waiting for the gate to open.

315
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:27,186
If they catch you,
they'll pester you to no end,

316
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,772
asking you to steal something
of Okgyeong or Hyerang…

317
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:31,816
or deliver gifts.

318
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:35,194
My goodness. This is just insane.

319
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,114
- We love you, Hyerang!
- Let's go.

320
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:44,579
This is where we rehearse dancing.

321
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:57,925
So this is why their dancing was spot-on.

322
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,511
It's because they practiced this much.

323
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:01,763
Right?

324
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:06,517
Our troupe's choreography is known
for its precise and beautiful moves.

325
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:08,061
Oh, wow.

326
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:09,979
This is so cool.

327
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:13,066
It's almost time for the tide.
We should be on our way.

328
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:16,277
Please wait
until I pay my respects to my father.

329
00:23:17,236 --> 00:23:20,281
- I shall go with you then.
- They're rehearsing for <i>Simcheongjeon.</i>

330
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:23,743
This is where Director Kang
trains the trainees every morning.

331
00:23:23,826 --> 00:23:26,579
You may go pay your respects,
but hurry.

332
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:47,934
Who is she?

333
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:49,435
She's Seo Hyerang.

334
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,313
She's the female lead
for all our official performances.

335
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:58,069
If Okgyeong is the Prince of Maeran,
then Hyerang is the princess.

336
00:23:58,152 --> 00:24:01,239
The critics and even other theater troupes

337
00:24:01,322 --> 00:24:03,699
are mesmerized by her dancing skills.

338
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:06,577
You like her, don't you?

339
00:24:07,537 --> 00:24:10,623
She's the best female lead there is.

340
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,211
Do you aspire to be a female lead?

341
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:17,547
What?

342
00:24:18,005 --> 00:24:19,257
I could never.

343
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,717
What's wrong with having a dream?

344
00:24:22,301 --> 00:24:24,053
Right now, there's no way.

345
00:24:24,595 --> 00:24:26,430
I've only ever performed as an extra.

346
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:27,974
But still…

347
00:24:28,057 --> 00:24:29,475
Let's leave her to rehearse.

348
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:38,192
I heard you singing
<i>The Blooming Autumn Field</i> yesterday.

349
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,902
You were amazing.

350
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:43,990
I could never sing like that
no matter how much I practiced.

351
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:45,867
- I'm jealous.
- She's the one

352
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,743
Okgyeong brought over.

353
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:49,829
- It's nothing.
- It's her, isn't it?

354
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,875
- But thanks for the compliment.
- She thinks she's all that.

355
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:55,960
Be careful.

356
00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:00,840
Some members are jealous
thinking you got in through Okgyeong.

357
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:05,887
It's not like
I didn't know this would happen.

358
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:07,680
Jooran.

359
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:09,557
Sugyeong is looking for you.

360
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,808
I'm coming.

361
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,311
I'll be right back.

362
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:15,146
- Stay here, okay?
- Okay.

363
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:22,361
<i>The mountains</i>

364
00:25:22,445 --> 00:25:27,533
<i>Are steep</i>

365
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:33,539
<i>And the forests</i>

366
00:25:33,623 --> 00:25:37,168
<i>Are thick</i>

367
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:45,343
<i>Snow piles up</i>

368
00:25:45,426 --> 00:25:48,179
<i>In the valleys</i>

369
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:53,851
<i>And the wind</i>

370
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,649
<i>Tears through the peaks</i>

371
00:26:00,316 --> 00:26:03,736
<i>No parrots or ducks to be seen</i>

372
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:09,992
<i>For how can birds sing</i>

373
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,330
<i>With no greens, flowers, or fruits?</i>

374
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:20,962
<i>The fallen soldiers of Jeokbyeok River</i>

375
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:24,382
<i>Have come back as birds</i>

376
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:31,264
<i>They cry out of spite for their lord</i>

377
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:38,854
<i>And out of longing for their homes</i>

378
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:46,779
<i>All these soldiers</i>

379
00:26:46,862 --> 00:26:49,949
<i>Wallowing in despair</i>

380
00:26:50,032 --> 00:26:52,076
<i>How long has it been…</i>

381
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,789
Who's out there?

382
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,926
Oh my!

383
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,978
Who is she?

384
00:27:19,061 --> 00:27:22,565
She has an amazing voice.

385
00:27:25,985 --> 00:27:30,114
I've never heard such a rich sound.

386
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:38,950
Today's an exception
since it's your first day,

387
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,537
but you all must be in uniform
whenever you're in training.

388
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,248
Don't even think about coming to train…

389
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,293
without your uniform on.

390
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,922
There are two things
you must keep in mind in Maeran.

391
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,049
Train diligently.

392
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:59,178
And never use Maeran's fame
for personal gain.

393
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:04,308
I especially forbid anyone
from selling their singing

394
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,643
as our troupe member.

395
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:10,272
Do not ever forget that you are artists
and make sure to act accordingly.

396
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,399
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

397
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:13,484
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:19,031
<i>Come here</i>
<i>Let me give you a piggyback ride</i>

399
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:24,828
<i>Come here</i>
<i>Let me give you a piggyback ride</i>

400
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:30,084
<i>My love, my love, you are my love</i>

401
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:35,297
<i>My love, my love, you are my love</i>

402
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:40,386
<i>Oh love, you are my love</i>

403
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:45,766
<i>Oh love, you are my love</i>

404
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:50,187
<i>Yes, you are my love</i>

405
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:55,943
<i>Yes, you are my love</i>

406
00:28:56,527 --> 00:29:00,197
Since we're joined by new trainees,

407
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,241
let's get to know them, shall we?

408
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,702
To start, Yoon Jeongnyeon.

409
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:08,539
Come to the front.

410
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,673
What would you sing?

411
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,468
I'll sing <i>The Song of Four Seasons.</i>

412
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:22,970
That's a good song.

413
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,807
Where's Youngseo?

414
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,810
Come to the front.

415
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:35,858
You're…

416
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,193
- Who'll go first?
- You're that girl from earlier…

417
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,279
I don't mind either way.

418
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,449
Then let's have Jeongnyeon go first.

419
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,549
<i>The flowers</i>

420
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,053
<i>Are abloom</i>

421
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:10,267
<i>It is spring indeed</i>

422
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:16,315
<i>Spring is here</i>

423
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:21,403
<i>And yet I am alone</i>

424
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:27,868
<i>My youth has passed me by</i>

425
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:32,998
<i>And has whitened my hair</i>

426
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:39,088
<i>- Since--
- Since my youth has left me</i>

427
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:44,051
<i>It's left me long ago</i>

428
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:49,598
<i>What good is there</i>

429
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,477
<i>In welcoming spring</i>

430
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,396
<i>When it'll leave me too?</i>

431
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,651
<i>The colorful leaves</i>

432
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:06,115
<i>That autumn brings</i>

433
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,784
<i>Are far better</i>

434
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:15,791
<i>Even with its chilly breeze</i>

435
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,211
<i>When autumn bows out</i>

436
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,216
<i>And winter comes</i>

437
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,803
<i>The white snow</i>

438
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:32,558
<i>Will fall</i>

439
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,227
<i>From the heavens</i>

440
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:40,357
<i>Covering everything</i>

441
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,901
<i>In white</i>

442
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,862
<i>Then everywhere I look</i>

443
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:51,076
<i>Will shine bright white</i>

444
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,330
<i>The world shall match my head</i>

445
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:59,376
<i>Andbemyfriend…</i>

446
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,460
That's enough.

447
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,343
Jeongnyeon.

448
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,221
What did you think of Youngseo's singing?

449
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:14,892
It was good.

450
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,685
Explain further.

451
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:22,232
Her voice was very rich yet clear.

452
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,236
It felt as if the sound was coming
from deep inside her.

453
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,823
That's the sound
that comes right from your guts.

454
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:35,162
The sound is easier to control
because it carries strength.

455
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:36,955
Then Youngseo.

456
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,541
What did you think
of Jeongnyeon's singing?

457
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,172
It was…

458
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,301
the most unique voice I've ever heard.

459
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:50,928
You're right.

460
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,389
Jeongnyeon was born with a good voice.

461
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,308
But remember.

462
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,020
You may have been born
with a natural talent.

463
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:04,566
But if you don't hone it,
you will never improve.

464
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,193
Is that understood?

465
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:08,445
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,536
Wait!

467
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,877
That was some great singing.

468
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:25,379
Actually…

469
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:27,547
I was…

470
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,803
the one outside the room
when you were rehearsing.

471
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,390
I thought my singing was pretty decent,

472
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,016
but I was a small fish in a pond.

473
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,187
It was my first time getting scared
after hearing someone sing.

474
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:45,482
I swear, you had my knees going weak.

475
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,652
I'm Yoon Jeongnyeon.

476
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,445
You're Heo Youngseo, right?

477
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:54,700
It's an honor to go head-to-head with you.

478
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,328
I hope we can be friends.

479
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:01,498
You…

480
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,168
Do you know who Master Yu Gyeonghak is?

481
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,216
No, I don't.

482
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,593
He's a master of <i>pansori</i>
recognized by the country.

483
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:19,099
I learned <i>pansori </i>from him,
undergoing intense training for 10 years.

484
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:21,101
And you think…

485
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,603
a fishmonger like you
can go head-to-head with me?

486
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,606
Don't be ridiculous.
You and I are not on the same level.

487
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,986
You're an amazing singer…

488
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,780
but you have a real attitude problem.

489
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:35,699
That's right, so stop bothering me.

490
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,827
I don't intend to be friends with you.

491
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,584
What was that?

492
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,801
You already had
an argument with Youngseo?

493
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,429
That little brat.

494
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,599
Her singing's amazing,
but what's with her attitude?

495
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,852
Everyone calls her "Her Highness"
and stays clear of her.

496
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,730
- "Her Highness"?
- Yeah.

497
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,566
Youngseo is the royal of the royals.

498
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,694
Her mother is Han Kijoo,
the famous soprano,

499
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:16,031
and her older sister is known
for being an opera genius.

500
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:18,575
No wonder.

501
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,703
Then she must have played
important roles on stage.

502
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:22,913
Not really.

503
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,956
She's only ever performed as an extra.

504
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,249
What?

505
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,918
But she's so good.

506
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:31,671
We all have to follow
what Director Kang tells us to do.

507
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,216
Do you remember Doaeng
who managed the audition?

508
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,093
Yeah.

509
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,470
She's Director Kang's niece.

510
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,348
- Really?
- Yeah.

511
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,892
And whenever we had a new production,

512
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,144
she also had to properly audition
like the others.

513
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,732
So the director doesn't go easy
on anyone, huh?

514
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:51,858
That's what I'm saying.

515
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,819
Well, I'm done for.

516
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,279
If I'm stuck playing an extra,

517
00:35:56,363 --> 00:36:00,033
when am I ever going to make it big
and earn some big money?

518
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:03,703
I need to bag a fortune fast
and get back to Mokpo.

519
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,831
You have such a clear goal.

520
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,249
Of course.

521
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,210
That's why I'm so pressed for time.

522
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:21,763
Is she ever going to show her face?

523
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,655
No way.

524
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:43,034
Are you… my roommate?

525
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,122
Are you?

526
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,834
Hey.

527
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,963
At least respond
if we're going to be roommates.

528
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,632
I told you not to bother me.

529
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:00,927
All right, I get it.

530
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,640
Let's just pretend
we don't see each other, shall we?

531
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,520
Like I care.

532
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,745
That one has been really popular
these days.

533
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,789
It makes a very lush and elegant bouquet.

534
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:35,045
Then could you make me a bouquet
with this one and this one?

535
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,129
Of course.

536
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,797
Right.

537
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,091
The person receiving it is quite picky,

538
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,135
so please take extra care
with the wrapping.

539
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,345
All right.

540
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:47,599
It's been a while, miss.

541
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,101
- Where's Mother?
- She's in the drawing room.

542
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:54,105
Your sister and father went out
a little while ago.

543
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,609
Madam has been suffering
from jet lag for a few days,

544
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,569
but she seems better today.

545
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:01,363
Really?

546
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,906
Yes.

547
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,327
Mother, it's me.

548
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,848
That's my girl.

549
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:33,311
That was your sister's newest recording.

550
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,397
Tell me, what do you think?

551
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:38,692
It's good.

552
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:42,112
I think her voice has gotten richer.

553
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,196
Yes.

554
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,824
It's gotten much richer.

555
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,660
Even those haughty American critics

556
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,664
have praised Youngin
for being a natural talent.

557
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:57,335
Then she'll no longer be your student,
but your competitor.

558
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,588
Are you still that happy?

559
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,756
Of course.

560
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,094
Youngin is my pride…

561
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,597
and life's work.

562
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:17,230
Congratulations on coming back to Korea.

563
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:18,732
This is for you.

564
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,526
Thank you.

565
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,780
You're looking well.

566
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,657
How are you holding up in the troupe?

567
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,075
I'm doing fine.

568
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,828
There's going to be
a trainee performance in a few days,

569
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,705
and I'm in the lead role.

570
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:37,125
But it's still a trainee performance.

571
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,170
Do you think I have the time
to attend such events?

572
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,756
No.

573
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:47,636
I'm still not happy with the fact
that you gave up on opera

574
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,429
to pursue <i>gukgeuk.</i>

575
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:51,973
But…

576
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,516
since you've made your choice,

577
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,269
you need to be the best.

578
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:58,855
I know.

579
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,442
I'll make sure to play the main role
in official performances soon.

580
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:06,738
I wouldn't have gone down this road
if I wasn't sure I'd become the best.

581
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,907
Good.

582
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,910
Don't ever be satisfied
with playing extras.

583
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,204
Remember…

584
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,500
you are my daughter.

585
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:21,795
Yes.

586
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:24,089
Since you're here,

587
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:27,300
how about we listen to
<i>The Blooming Autumn Field?</i>

588
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,151
It never disappoints.

589
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:50,407
I always thought
opera was far superior to <i>pansori.</i>

590
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,243
But there are exceptions
like these sometimes.

591
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,873
Gongseon's singing
was truly the essence of <i>pansori.</i>

592
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,087
Did you know Chae Gongseon personally?

593
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,005
I did.

594
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:10,343
I met her a few times
when I visited Master Im Jin.

595
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:16,015
I was absolutely shocked
when I first heard her sing this song.

596
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,311
It almost made me regret
not taking up <i>pansori.</i>

597
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,108
I think of her now and then,

598
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:29,320
and I wonder
why she disappeared all of a sudden.

599
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,376
You made it.

600
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,086
- Oh my.
- But your outfit…

601
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,005
What?

602
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,466
What is it? Do I smell?

603
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,009
No, I mean--

604
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,261
Didn't you get your uniform?

605
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,692
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

606
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,861
Yes?

607
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,322
Why aren't you in your uniform?

608
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:15,074
I haven't gotten mine yet.

609
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,577
Who handed out the uniforms?

610
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:19,788
I did, ma'am.

611
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:23,208
I got four uniforms,
and I put one in front of her room.

612
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,375
What?

613
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,420
But I never got it.

614
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,088
I'm sure I put one there.

615
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,009
I swear it wasn't there.

616
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:36,387
Could I just attend
the training with these--

617
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:40,016
How do you expect to train
when you can't even dress properly?

618
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,060
Go find your uniform!

619
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,656
I never saw it. What is she talking about?

620
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:14,259
<i>Yet I am alone</i>

621
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,303
<i>My youth has…</i>

622
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:19,472
Wait.

623
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,185
You don't get to join the training
if you're late.

624
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,982
Wait outside until the training is over.

625
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,066
What?

626
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,153
But it wasn't my fault.

627
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,333
Let's take it from "Spring is here."

628
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,002
Start.

629
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:53,882
<i>Spring is here</i>

630
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:58,928
<i>And yet I am alone</i>

631
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:05,018
<i>My youth has passed me by</i>

632
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:10,064
<i>And has whitened my hair</i>

633
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:15,778
<i>Since my youth has left me</i>

634
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,739
Right?

635
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,240
- Wasn't it hilarious?
- Yeah.

636
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:21,659
I'll need to practice more.

637
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,037
Hey!

638
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,330
Park Chorok!

639
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,790
What's with her?

640
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:31,753
- You think it's because of that?
- Oh, you're right.

641
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:34,505
What do you think you're doing?

642
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:35,715
What are you talking about?

643
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,508
So your great idea

644
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:40,261
was to make me look like an idiot
with my uniform?

645
00:44:41,054 --> 00:44:42,221
You're funny.

646
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:43,556
Do you have proof that I did?

647
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,684
You'd know better than anyone
that it was you.

648
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:47,936
Hey.

649
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,356
What are you doing
blaming others for your mistake?

650
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,024
You think you can act out

651
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,360
just because you're close
to Moon Okgyeong?

652
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,071
You're not even a real trainee.

653
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,617
I can't believe this.

654
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,453
What are you, children?

655
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:10,166
If you hate me that much,
you should win against me with skills,

656
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,377
not with such cheap tactics!

657
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,586
What did you say?

658
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,926
Hey, country bumpkin.

659
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:23,638
You think you're all that

660
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,640
when all you've done
is sing at some fish market?

661
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:30,144
Then how about you try to get
an audition script from Doaeng?

662
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:33,106
The one for the official performance
in a few months.

663
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,441
You can do that, right?

664
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,276
What? But that script is…

665
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,528
If you succeed,

666
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,863
I promise to do one thing
you tell me to do.

667
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:43,449
But if you fail,

668
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:46,369
admit that you're a nobody with no skills
who got in through Okgyeong,

669
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,246
and leave the troupe.

670
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,330
How about it?

671
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:50,915
Jeongnyeon.

672
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:52,083
All right.

673
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,876
But on one more condition.

674
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,920
If I get the script,

675
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:59,799
you'll apologize for saying
that I'm a nobody with no skills.

676
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,052
In front of everybody
that's here right now!

677
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:04,971
Also,

678
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:09,851
don't even utter another word
about me getting in through Moon Okgyeong.

679
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:11,853
Sure.

680
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,188
Just make sure to get the script.

681
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,984
Don't worry, I will.

682
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:22,321
You just wait
until I show you that blasted script.

683
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,992
Do you even know
how rare that script is?

684
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,368
They only print a set amount,

685
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:29,328
and give just one copy
to those auditioning

686
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,580
with their names on it.

687
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:31,706
If you didn't get a script,

688
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,084
you can't audition no matter
how much you've memorized the lines.

689
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:37,670
That's why I'd have to beg on my knees.

690
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,091
You can't get one even if you beg.

691
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,385
Doaeng's the one
managing the audition scripts

692
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,512
and she gives no exceptions.

693
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:51,642
They never give out audition scripts
to new trainees.

694
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:55,396
You have to train for at least six months
to even get a chance.

695
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,273
That's the director's rule.

696
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:00,610
Chorok tricked you.

697
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,698
Don't you worry.

698
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:06,783
I'll do…

699
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,535
whatever it takes

700
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:11,537
to get that script.

701
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,210
What are you saying?

702
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,089
You've only just joined the troupe…

703
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,173
"Jamyunggo"

704
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,717
…and yet you're asking
for an audition script?

705
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,260
Are you serious?

706
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,387
Wait a minute.

707
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:31,182
You're not even an official trainee yet.

708
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:35,645
That means you can't even play an extra
for official performances.

709
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:37,605
I think…

710
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,274
even new trainees…

711
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:45,404
deserve to at least audition
for official performances.

712
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:51,202
You don't even know
where to look when you're on stage,

713
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,287
let alone how to cooperate
with fellow actors.

714
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,081
So how could we possibly let you audition?

715
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,542
You need to watch and learn
from your seniors first.

716
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,628
Even if I may fail,
I think the process of auditioning…

717
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,674
is all part of learning.

718
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,426
And for the troupe
to ban trainees from auditioning…

719
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:14,142
is quite unfair.

720
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,358
Fine.

721
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:24,485
Then how about this?

722
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,704
I'm Yoon Jeongnyeon,
and I look forward to learning with you.

723
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:36,664
What's she doing?

724
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:42,712
Jeongnyeon.

725
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:48,551
Now,

726
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,180
we'll begin the rehearsal

727
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,599
for the trainee performance
of <i>Chunhyangjeon.</i>

728
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:59,228
"Chunhyangjeon"

729
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:00,313
But…

730
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,233
this isn't the script
for the official performance.

731
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,778
We hold two trainee performances
every year.

732
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:10,031
And that's the script
for a performance in 10 days.

733
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,365
Get yourself a role in it.

734
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,535
I'll decide whether to ask the director

735
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,996
to give you
the official performance script

736
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,372
after I see you perform.

737
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,712
Let's start with the scene
when Chunhyang gets imprisoned.

738
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,383
Wait.

739
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,054
I need a role.

740
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,682
How could you ask for a role
when you've only just joined?

741
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:39,810
We've already assigned all the roles.

742
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:43,272
Be thankful that we're even letting you
watch the rehearsal.

743
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:46,734
I deserve to get a role
since I'm also a trainee.

744
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,736
I don't care if it's an extra.

745
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,655
Just let me perform.

746
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,198
Listen, Yoon Jeongnyeon.

747
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:53,449
Know your place.

748
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,077
We've been practicing this
for over three months.

749
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,287
We're going on stage in 10 days

750
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:00,248
and you have the audacity
to demand a role?

751
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,208
Plus, you're not an actual trainee.

752
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,961
You're nothing but an understudy.

753
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,588
You don't deserve to perform with us.

754
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,132
I don't care how small.

755
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:12,635
Give me a role.

756
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,429
Just let me be on stage.

757
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:17,890
So you don't care no matter the role?

758
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:19,976
Yes.

759
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,060
Then…

760
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:24,647
you'll play Bangja.

761
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:28,442
But Youngseo…

762
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:31,028
Sunsim dropped the role
because she got sick,

763
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:33,489
and Migeum said she couldn't
take the role on the first day.

764
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,118
We needed someone
to fill in for that one day.

765
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,328
Just what we needed.

766
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,330
But she's never even been on stage.

767
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:43,708
You can't have her play Bangja,
let alone an extra.

768
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,126
Who does she think she is?

769
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,544
Will you do it?

770
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,756
I will.

771
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:55,970
"Bangja."

772
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,358
Are you that happy?

773
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,694
Of course!

774
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:15,990
It's only a matter of time
before I get that audition script.

775
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,409
I thought you'd be nervous.

776
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,995
It's just a trainee performance.

777
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,580
What's there to be nervous about?

778
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:23,873
I just gotta do it.

779
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:26,959
You're actually scared, aren't you?

780
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,428
You see right through me.

781
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:42,558
It's natural to get nervous
for your first performance.

782
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:45,644
Especially since our audience
doesn't go easy on us

783
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:48,314
just because we're trainees.

784
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,984
What's so funny?

785
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:56,197
That means they're taking us seriously.

786
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,949
I'd be mad

787
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:02,828
if they just cheered us on
no matter what we did

788
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:04,955
just because we're trainees.

789
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,291
It's right to get criticized
if you do poorly

790
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:10,044
and get praised if you do truly well.

791
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:12,630
I knew it.

792
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,215
I love this side of you.

793
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:21,138
Who are you writing to anyway?

794
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,141
My older sister.

795
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,060
I have an older sister too.

796
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,313
You're such a nice sister.

797
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:32,191
I'm too embarrassed
to write any letters to mine.

798
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:35,820
My sister can't leave the house
because she's too sick.

799
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,614
This is probably the only thing
she looks forward to.

800
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,792
You should write one to your sister too.

801
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,337
What? No, it's too embarrassing.

802
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,090
Come on, just try.

803
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:59,385
Your sister must be dying to know
how you're doing.

804
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,095
I'm sure she'd be happy to hear from you.

805
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:04,765
Would she?

806
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,230
Then…

807
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:13,232
…shall I give it a try?

808
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,781
Ah, put this on the letter
once you're done.

809
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,161
Oh, wow.

810
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:28,622
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes, it's beautiful.

811
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,168
What are all these?

812
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:37,298
I picked them from the mountains
and dried them myself.

813
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,383
- You made these?
- I did.

814
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:41,802
You're amazing.

815
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,889
There's more, so tell me if you need it.

816
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,766
- Can I really use one?
- Of course.

817
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,027
Next, let's start with Bangja.

818
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,155
Jeongnyeon.

819
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,117
Jeongnyeon.

820
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:07,036
- What?
- It's your turn.

821
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:09,872
Oh, it's me.

822
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,465
Here it is, Young Master.

823
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:20,549
Again.

824
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:26,639
Here it is, Young Master.

825
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:29,475
This is what I was telling you about.

826
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,101
- The famous--
- Again.

827
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:34,897
Here it is, Young Master!

828
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,274
This is what I was telling you about--

829
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,359
Again.

830
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,404
Look at her.

831
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,452
What is it?

832
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,706
Tell me what's wrong so I can change it.

833
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,459
What am I supposed to do
if you don't tell me?

834
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:56,752
Are you saying…

835
00:54:57,753 --> 00:55:00,005
that you were really Bangja just now?

836
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:03,342
Who else would it be?

837
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,987
Here it is, Young Master.

838
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,947
This is what I was telling you about.

839
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,242
The most famous pavilion in all the land,
Gwanghallu Pavilion.

840
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,326
What do you think?

841
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,496
Isn't it as amazing as I said it'd be?

842
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:37,251
<i>Bangja is being sent over</i>

843
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:41,380
<i>To fetch Chunhyang</i>

844
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:46,218
<i>What a splendid, well-groomed
And mannered man</i>

845
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:51,181
<i>What a mischievous, playful
And cunning man</i>

846
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:55,644
<i>Just like the mythical messenger bird</i>
<i>To the goddess</i>

847
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:59,898
<i>What an eloquent, witty
And bright man</i>

848
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:04,862
<i>With his hat secured on his back</i>

849
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:09,491
<i>With his tunic, socks, and sandals</i>

850
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:16,498
<i>With his robe tied around back</i>

851
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:21,587
<i>He places one foot here</i>
<i>And one foot there</i>

852
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,756
<i>One step, then another</i>

853
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:28,177
<i>He's on his way over</i>

854
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,909
I understand…

855
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,536
what you meant earlier.

856
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:58,916
I'll do better tomorrow, so--

857
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,459
How will you be better?

858
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,878
Are you going to mimic what I showed you?

859
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,965
Oh, right.

860
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,760
Even mimicking takes talent.

861
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,180
You're not at all ready to become Bangja.

862
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:17,685
You have no idea
how to walk or talk as Bangja.

863
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:19,478
That's because…

864
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:22,648
it's only been a day.

865
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:24,483
If you're unsure,
it's not too late to quit.

866
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,611
You…

867
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:31,865
gave me Bangja on purpose, didn't you?

868
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:37,496
You have no right to be here

869
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,082
and yet here you are
all thanks to Moon Okgyeong.

870
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:43,877
On top of that, you're disregarding
all the rules we have around here.

871
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:48,340
Everyone else had to work for their place,
so what makes you special?

872
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:51,343
Are you really all that?

873
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:52,928
Is that why…

874
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,140
you pretended to give me a chance?

875
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,851
To get back at me?

876
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:01,854
I simply offered the role.
You were stupid enough to take it.

877
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:04,273
So choose.

878
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,900
Will you embarrass yourself on stage

879
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,611
or know your place and quit now,
before it's too late?

880
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:13,157
You think I'll quit that easily?

881
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:15,743
There's no way I will.

882
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:18,829
Then it's decided.

883
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,415
You'll embarrass yourself on stage

884
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,459
and quit the troupe
as the audience boos you out.

885
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,921
You…

886
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:30,466
underestimated me.

887
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,262
Make sure to watch closely.

888
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,682
I'll show you what I'm made of.

889
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:49,132
I'll wipe that grin off her face!

890
00:58:52,594 --> 00:58:54,596
Youngseo's like that to everyone.

891
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,932
What makes me even more angry

892
00:58:57,474 --> 00:58:59,017
is that nothing she said to me…

893
00:58:59,768 --> 00:59:01,228
is wrong.

894
00:59:02,145 --> 00:59:06,024
I'm not at all ready to become Bangja.

895
00:59:08,694 --> 00:59:13,532
I have no idea what it means to be him.

896
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:15,200
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

897
00:59:17,202 --> 00:59:19,830
Okgyeong wants you at her house.

898
00:59:21,498 --> 00:59:22,749
Me?

899
00:59:32,426 --> 00:59:34,386
Why did you come along?

900
00:59:35,053 --> 00:59:38,098
This is my only chance
to see Okgyeong's place.

901
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:40,809
And Hyerang also lives here.

902
00:59:41,893 --> 00:59:43,395
They live together?

903
00:59:43,478 --> 00:59:45,605
They must be really close.

904
00:59:45,689 --> 00:59:49,276
They've been close
ever since Maeran began.

905
00:59:53,363 --> 00:59:55,782
All right. I'm ready.

906
00:59:55,866 --> 00:59:56,867
Ring the bell.

907
01:00:11,798 --> 01:00:13,091
Where are we going?

908
01:00:13,175 --> 01:00:14,760
Mm… it's a secret.

909
01:00:19,931 --> 01:00:21,850
What are you two doing here?

910
01:00:21,933 --> 01:00:25,395
Okgyeong called me over
to tell me something.

911
01:00:25,479 --> 01:00:26,521
She did?

912
01:00:28,315 --> 01:00:31,276
She must really be doting on you.

913
01:00:32,944 --> 01:00:36,281
She's never taken such an interest
in any other troupe members.

914
01:00:37,407 --> 01:00:40,702
Make sure to watch your actions
for her sake.

915
01:00:42,412 --> 01:00:45,207
- We'll be eating dinner out.
- Yes, ma'am.

916
01:01:02,516 --> 01:01:03,683
Hey, Jeongnyeon.

917
01:01:03,767 --> 01:01:06,019
- Oh! Hello.
- Hey, Jooran.

918
01:01:06,103 --> 01:01:07,104
Hello.

919
01:01:07,187 --> 01:01:08,438
Come have a seat.

920
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,878
What… What was that?

921
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:34,047
That was a movie.

922
01:01:35,424 --> 01:01:37,050
It's cool, isn't it?

923
01:01:37,134 --> 01:01:38,427
Yes.

924
01:01:39,678 --> 01:01:44,057
The screening for <i>Chunhyangjeon </i>last year
had 150,000 people in the audience.

925
01:01:47,102 --> 01:01:49,354
Movies are soon going to
take over the industry.

926
01:01:50,981 --> 01:01:53,316
Just as how <i>gukgeuk</i>
is so popular these days,

927
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:56,027
in a little while,

928
01:01:56,111 --> 01:01:57,988
movies are going to be just as popular.

929
01:01:58,572 --> 01:02:02,492
Then would we be losing
our audience to movies?

930
01:02:02,576 --> 01:02:03,660
That's not good.

931
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:11,710
So how are you doing
in the troupe, Jeongnyeon?

932
01:02:11,793 --> 01:02:13,170
I heard you got the role of Bangja.

933
01:02:14,713 --> 01:02:18,258
I actually had something
to ask you about that.

934
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:22,596
Is there a secret to playing male roles?

935
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:24,973
A secret to playing male roles?

936
01:02:25,056 --> 01:02:26,183
Yes.

937
01:02:26,266 --> 01:02:29,478
As a girl, I can't seem
to play the male role right.

938
01:02:29,561 --> 01:02:34,441
I get so awkward and embarrassed
that I keep freezing up.

939
01:02:35,734 --> 01:02:38,904
Since you're the best
at playing male roles,

940
01:02:39,821 --> 01:02:42,699
I thought you might have a secret
to help me get it right.

941
01:02:43,992 --> 01:02:46,244
I think you have the wrong idea.

942
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:47,329
What?

943
01:02:47,412 --> 01:02:49,998
I have no secret to playing male roles.

944
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:51,791
I just…

945
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:54,628
convince the audience
of what my character is going through

946
01:02:54,711 --> 01:02:56,379
and what they're feeling.

947
01:02:57,422 --> 01:02:59,424
What's important right now

948
01:02:59,508 --> 01:03:04,304
is how you'll convince the audience
of your own interpretation of Bangja.

949
01:03:05,096 --> 01:03:06,640
I'm getting more confused.

950
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:09,184
That's understandable.

951
01:03:09,893 --> 01:03:12,604
Acting is something
you should experience with your body,

952
01:03:12,687 --> 01:03:14,731
not something to sit and ponder about.

953
01:03:14,814 --> 01:03:16,274
Then what do I do now?

954
01:03:17,108 --> 01:03:22,239
I have less than a week left,
and I have no idea where to even start.

955
01:03:23,698 --> 01:03:25,575
Should I show you a shortcut?

956
01:03:27,327 --> 01:03:28,328
Yes.

957
01:03:31,915 --> 01:03:32,999
"Jamyunggo"

958
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:35,001
I actually called you here
to give you this.

959
01:03:38,922 --> 01:03:40,173
T-This is…

960
01:03:40,257 --> 01:03:42,133
It's the audition script
for the official performance.

961
01:03:43,009 --> 01:03:45,345
You're now going to prepare
for this audition.

962
01:03:46,388 --> 01:03:50,016
I didn't bring you to Seoul
just so you could perform with trainees.

963
01:03:50,517 --> 01:03:52,227
I consider you as my successor--

964
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:53,645
No…

965
01:03:53,728 --> 01:03:57,023
as my rival for male leads in the future.

966
01:04:01,987 --> 01:04:03,655
But how could I…

967
01:04:03,738 --> 01:04:05,407
I know you can.

968
01:04:07,576 --> 01:04:09,202
You'll be rising to the top

969
01:04:10,161 --> 01:04:12,539
higher and faster than anyone else.

970
01:04:13,623 --> 01:04:15,375
So don't waste your time.

971
01:04:16,876 --> 01:04:20,839
Trainee performances are for those
who need to prove themselves.

972
01:04:22,257 --> 01:04:24,259
But you've already proven yourself to me.

973
01:04:26,303 --> 01:04:29,306
All you need to do is follow me.

974
01:04:30,807 --> 01:04:32,017
You will, won't you?

975
01:04:35,395 --> 01:04:37,480
<i>You have no right to be here</i>

976
01:04:37,564 --> 01:04:39,691
and yet here you are
all thanks to Moon Okgyeong.

977
01:04:39,774 --> 01:04:43,069
Everyone else had to work for their place,
so what makes you special?

978
01:04:43,153 --> 01:04:44,738
You're not even a real trainee.

979
01:04:44,821 --> 01:04:46,114
You think you can act out

980
01:04:46,197 --> 01:04:47,574
just because you're close
to Moon Okgyeong?

981
01:04:47,657 --> 01:04:49,576
How about you try to get
an audition script from Doaeng?

982
01:04:49,659 --> 01:04:52,871
The one for the official performance
in a few months.

983
01:05:31,034 --> 01:05:34,954
JEONGNYEON: THE STAR IS BORN

984
01:05:35,038 --> 01:05:37,749
<i>Everyone already thinks I have no skills</i>

985
01:05:37,832 --> 01:05:39,209
<i>and don't deserve to be here.</i>

986
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:40,794
<i>Yoon Jeongnyeon's not bad.</i>

987
01:05:40,877 --> 01:05:43,546
<i>But right now, there's no question
that Youngseo is the best.</i>

988
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:45,298
<i>Get a grip.</i>

989
01:05:45,382 --> 01:05:48,343
I won't let anyone ruin my performance.

990
01:05:48,426 --> 01:05:52,138
<i>You also had her play Bangja</i>
<i>so she'd leave the troupe.</i>

991
01:05:52,222 --> 01:05:55,809
<i>Someone who can orchestrate</i>
<i>the audience's reactions.</i>

992
01:05:56,309 --> 01:05:59,187
<i>The jester of the whole show.</i>

993
01:06:00,522 --> 01:06:01,981
<i>That's Bangja.</i>
