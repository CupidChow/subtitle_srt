00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,708
When are you going to give me the gospel?

20
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,293
Father should be here soon.

21
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,257
Your Holiness!

22
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,342
Your Holiness!

23
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,762
Your Holiness! Your Holiness!

24
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,890
Your Holiness, your dress is here!

25
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,393
What? What dress?

26
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,395
Well...

27
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,398
Oh, well... we've actually
had this dress ready for years.

28
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,484
But it had no owner until now.
Oh my goodness!

29
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,571
The day has finally come! Oh!

30
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,991
I mean, when you bring the Blessed Light,
you gotta look great!

31
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,243
Like bam! In this dress.

32
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,370
- Some light, please.
- Oh, wait, wait, um...

33
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,331
- I don't think I should wear that.
- What?

34
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:50,503
Ah, but when you'll be...
well, be in front of all the believers...

35
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,839
- Don't you want to look...
- Forget the dress for now.

36
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,592
I need the chip. Uh... Well, it's just...

37
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,303
The gospel, I mean, I'd like it first.

38
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,222
Now please ask Father
to hurry up, all right?

39
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,559
Yes, of course, your Holiness.

40
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,351
Get out.

41
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,647
Get out, go, get out.

42
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,483
All right, then. Later, then.

43
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,527
Oh!

44
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,323
Your Holiness.

45
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,452
Don't worry.

46
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,913
I promise your secret's safe.

47
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,331
What secret?

48
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,208
Come on, you know what I mean.

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,046
Please. The resurrection. I know.

50
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,715
I know...

51
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,384
I know that you never died.

52
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,220
I know!

53
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,308
See, I know that
because I was with you. Hm?

54
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,477
Well, anyway...

55
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,147
Don't worry.
Don't you worry about it, okay?

56
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,734
It'll be... our little secret.

57
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,736
Just between you and me.

58
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,536
Hmm?

59
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,129
Oh, ho-ho! <i>Sella!</i>

60
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,146
Ugh.

61
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,482
You're not going to work
tomorrow?

62
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,110
I'll just tell them
I'm going to a funeral.

63
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,214
What do you feel like eating?
There's coffee and dried fish snacks.

64
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,238
UFO FORUM

65
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,575
Ooh, yeah, I'll have that.
It sounds good. It's so good with coffee.

66
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,659
"Aah".

67
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,745
Mmm! Mmph!

68
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,747
Here.

69
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,873
Thank you.

70
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,211
What? You're on DC Inside?

71
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,464
Oh, this? Jihyo looked that up, I think.

72
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,300
She's on DC Inside, seriously?

73
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,969
I'm pretty sure it's a UFO forum.

74
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,887
A forum?

75
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,390
Yeah, she's been looking up
this kind of stuff a lot lately.

76
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,853
So is this related to what that guy said?

77
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,189
About the lady who can talk to aliens?

78
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,276
- Hey, gimme that.
- I was looking at that...

79
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,113
Oh, Jihyo, Jihyo, Jihyo...

80
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,782
What in the world were you thinking?
Seriously.

81
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,705
- What?
- This is super cute!

82
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,041
Did Jihyo always like this kind of stuff?

83
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,459
The Unicorns?

84
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,400
Where did it go?

85
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,777
God damn it.

86
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,070
Come on.

87
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,414
What are you doing?

88
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,249
What is that?

89
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,677
Hey.

90
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,324
Come here, let's talk for a minute.

91
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,600
Hey!

92
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,185
Hey I'm talking to you.

93
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,279
Hey! Stop for a second.

94
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,407
I said let's talk! Hey!

95
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,825
RESTRICTED ACCESS
DO NOT ENTER

96
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,910
Hey!

97
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,036
Damn it.

98
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,165
Stop. You can't go in there!

99
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,252
Ugh, seriously? Hey!

100
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,089
What are you doing right now?

101
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,028
Where is it?

102
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,906
It's on its way.

103
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,037
It's on its way? Huh?

104
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,040
What's the hold-up then, huh?

105
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,923
Listen to me, Father.

106
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,510
Don't you want to be saved?

107
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,015
Everyone's out there waiting.

108
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,478
Miss Hong Jihyo.

109
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,524
Do you know who...
the scariest person in the world is?

110
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,986
It's someone who believes in you.

111
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,072
Yeah, well, I appreciate these,
uh... words of wisdom,

112
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,782
or whatever you're saying, but listen...

113
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,952
When am I getting my chip back?

114
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,375
I understand that you've had many
things to say since earlier, all right?

115
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,587
However, I'm gonna need it
if I'm going to bring you salvation.

116
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,681
Open it.

117
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,935
Go for it.

118
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,021
It's the reason you're here, isn't it?

119
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,944
You met her Holiness earlier, am I right?

120
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,445
Did she mention anything to you?

121
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,614
What in the world is she thinking?

122
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,199
Was she really resurrected?

123
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,243
She never even died, right?

124
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,538
- Why did she lie to the congregation?
- God, you're annoying, seriously.

125
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,705
Hey!

126
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,457
Listen, I'm-

127
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,377
well, confused about
what I should believe right now.

128
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,504
I mean, um, what's-

129
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,131
Which side is right?

130
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,384
Who am I supposed to trust?

131
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,970
You're close to her Holiness.

132
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,471
Did she tell you anything?

133
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,348
Look, kid. Look.

134
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,600
Whatever you believe
is none of my business.

135
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,687
So you can deal with your identity
crisis by yourself, not through me.

136
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,564
See, I'm busy enough as it is.

137
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,442
Yeesh.

138
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,490
Oh!

139
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,805
UFO...

140
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,997
The Blessed Light.

141
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,226
Where is it?

142
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,025
Where did you hide it?

143
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,819
Ugh, seriously. You think it's a joke?

144
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,614
Where the hell is the chip?

145
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,037
Come on, did you really think...

146
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,748
you were... the Messiah?

147
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,291
What?

148
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,252
Miss Hong.

149
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,672
From the start...

150
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,757
there was nothing in your head.

151
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,008
Absolutely nothing.

152
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,013
Um, uh... um... what?

153
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,501
<i>Ho... hold on.</i>

154
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,586
The chip is bullshit?

155
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,217
Hmm.

156
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,011
But you operated on me.

157
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,055
You even drilled a hole in my head.

158
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,434
That's true. We opened you up.

159
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,853
There was nothing there, though.

160
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,983
This is ridiculous.
What are you even saying right now?

161
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:17,903
What is that?

162
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,627
Look. Press this here.

163
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,032
- Right, just...
- Taking off.

164
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,635
What could it be?

165
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,036
- Maybe on forward.
- Try it.

166
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,666
We were not able to find any evidence
that you encountered any aliens.

167
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,959
Evidence?

168
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,794
Mean... meaning what?

169
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,713
Now listen, I recalled everything!

170
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,923
Look, I remembered everything
in hypnotherapy. I did.

171
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,426
Back in middle school,
in the field... There, I...

172
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,679
You received hypnotherapy...

173
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,015
after you met me, isn't that right?

174
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,769
Then, you see...
it's highly possible

175
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,272
that you may have made up those memories.

176
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,231
Let's be honest here.

177
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,987
Clearly, I had already planted these ideas
in your head when you went under hypnosis.

178
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,115
All of it, Jihyo, was in your imagination.

179
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,078
Ugh, I fucking knew it.

180
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,749
Hey. Look closely.

181
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,667
That's your god.

182
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,379
"The Light" is here
to bring you salvation.

183
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,717
It can't...

184
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,968
Then...

185
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,680
Then, um... What? Well, then, wait.
What about the hallucinations, then?

186
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,892
And explain how all my electronics
all started malfunctioning, huh?

187
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,145
Miss Hong. Do you hear that?

188
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,732
Do you have any idea...

189
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,278
how many people out there
have said the exact same thing as you?

190
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,155
No, no. I'm not... No.

191
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,491
Those... those things really happened.
Really, they did!

192
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,159
They say that too.

193
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,327
Well, at least...

194
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,955
they firmly believe that it's true.

195
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,581
Miss Hong.

196
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,672
If you really had actually
had some encounter with UFOs...

197
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,843
and were somehow chosen by them,
then you...

198
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,179
You'd be able to call them, right?
Wouldn't you?

199
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,724
So... can you?

200
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,393
Can you call them?

201
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,438
Can you, then?
Can you call those aliens, Hong Jihyo?

202
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,694
I don't know. How would I know that?

203
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,364
You're no Messiah.

204
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,453
I'm disappointed too.

205
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:37,167
I truly believed. I really believed
that you, you were the Messiah.

206
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,546
No. I... I wanted to believe!

207
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,010
It's been so long.

208
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,722
For so long, I've been
looking for that damn Messiah.

209
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:51,806
Huh?

210
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,583
Get her!

211
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,666
Oh, shit!

212
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,794
Oh, shit! Shit!

213
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,756
- Damn it!
- Hurry!

214
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,439
We have an intruder. I repeat, intruder.

215
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,344
That means it doesn't exist.

216
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,309
None of it exists.

217
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,188
Like the Messiah, or the aliens...

218
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,858
You're saying it's all nonsense, then?

219
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,944
It can't be nonsense!

220
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,821
If all it amounts to
is just total nonsense...

221
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,617
If, after all of this,
if I say all of it's nonsense,

222
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,162
those people out there,
what happens to their lives?

223
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,623
Do you realize...

224
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,459
how long those people have
been waiting for the Messiah?

225
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,003
So they could achieve
their damned ascension?

226
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,422
So they could receive fucking salvation?

227
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:09,677
Do you fucking realize how long
they've believed and followed me? Do you?

228
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,888
Do it for me.

229
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,348
Do it.

230
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,434
We need a savior.

231
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,688
Bring salvation to those poor people.

232
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,357
Do it wholly, like the prophecy!

233
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,236
Wh... wh... why should I?
I'm nothing, remember?

234
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,280
Fake it for them.
Act it out. Put on a show!

235
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,366
Even if it's fake.

236
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,286
Do it. So they have a shot at happiness.

237
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,040
So they can die happy, okay?

238
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,001
No.

239
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:48,632
I won't. No. I won't, I won't, I can't.
I can't lie like that.

240
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,151
- I'm not doing it.
- You already did!

241
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,760
You're even better than I am.

242
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:56,056
Didn't you kick your friend out?
Wasn't that you, huh?

243
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:02,104
I didn't. I... I can't.
No, I didn't...

244
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:09,069
Don't you get it yet? It <i>was</i> you.
You came here on your own, right?

245
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,489
- I...
- So now we're in the same boat.

246
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,616
Look, if we admit that...

247
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,328
that all of this was a big lie,
what do you think they'll do?

248
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,042
Do you really think
that all those believers

249
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,545
will just let you go after this?

250
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,631
Jihyo.

251
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,642
I'm not asking you to kill yourself
like the rest of them. Just...

252
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,021
I just need you to play your part.

253
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,355
Go out there!

254
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,108
Go be their savior.

255
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,444
I won't.

256
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,906
Well, then... survive this.

257
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,911
Survive all of this, and go back.

258
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,622
Back to... your life.

259
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,292
Stay away.

260
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,007
Oh...

261
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,558
An intruder?

262
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,269
Then we'll have to hurry.

263
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,688
The Messiah is ready.

264
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,439
Let's begin.

265
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,546
It's quieter than I expected.
Figured it'd be swingin'.

266
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,881
- If you know what I mean.
- Wow, clean it up. Seriously.

267
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,927
I don't think we'll be able
to get through that, guys.

268
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,431
There any other roads, or...

269
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,267
So, uh, Mr...

270
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,645
Mr. Kim...

271
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,896
Wha...

272
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,941
What the...
Wait, where is he going?

273
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,779
Hey, hey, hey! My car!
Hey, hey! Where's he...

274
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,033
Uh, my car...

275
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,703
Ah, shit. My bag's in there.

276
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,124
Wait...

277
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,091
Wow!

278
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,428
Why is it every time Moonhole goes
to buy smokes, something goes down?

279
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,322
- Uh, uh, Philip, move!
- Aah!

280
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,309
- Damn it...
- Jesus.

281
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,935
What's this?

282
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,520
- Those muscles just for show?
- Gah!

283
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,109
Ah, fuck. It wasn't locked!

284
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,200
Ah...

285
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,286
Oh, cool!

286
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,208
What the... What's that?

287
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,876
Wait a minute.

288
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,046
Isn't that Moonhole?

289
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,215
- Oh!
- Huh?

290
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,817
- Wow, what?
- Damn it!

291
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,760
Get her! Shit!

292
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,597
- Hey, damn it, you little bastards!
- Stop right there! Stop! Hey!

293
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,516
Hey, Cap...

294
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,689
Hey!

295
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,448
Cap, you all right?

296
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,824
Aah!

297
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,326
Cap is Captain Korea.

298
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,994
Um, what?

299
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,167
What the... What just... How are you...

300
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,586
Why are you guys...

301
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,006
For fuck's sake, quit smoking,
would you? Come on.

302
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,770
Hey, our timing was pretty awesome, right?

303
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,718
What the hell? What the hell's going on?

304
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,682
Uh... What's wrong?

305
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,771
- It was all a lie.
- Huh?

306
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:17,651
Direct Kim was right. It was all a show.
UFOs aren't coming down here.

307
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,280
One thing at a time.
Slow down, okay? Slow down.

308
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,200
Jihyo.

309
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,622
Everyone's gonna die! Hurry!

310
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,232
<i>What's going on?</i>

311
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,859
<i>What is this?</i>

312
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,777
<i>What happened?</i>

313
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,658
<i>No.</i>

314
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,827
<i>Stop.</i>

315
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,665
<i>Don't. Pull yourself together, Hong Jihyo.</i>

316
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,989
REACH ASCENSION AND UNITY!
THE MESSIAH'S MEMORIAL SERVICE

317
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,296
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

318
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,424
<i>This isn't right.</i>

319
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,400
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

320
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,613
<i>What have I been doing until now?</i>

321
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,700
Behold!

322
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:55,207
Today, we harvest the holy fruits
of our lonely faith!

323
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,626
The time has finally come!

324
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,462
The Blessed Light will
come down to this Earth!

325
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,882
- And those who don't believe...
<i>- What were those people, after all?</i>

326
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:08,178
They will be greeted by the Light!

327
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,679
And they will be judged!

328
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,557
<i>- I was just being crazy.</i>
- The Blessed Light will be their judge!

329
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:17,562
The end of our journey was only possible
because of our magnanimous Messiah!

330
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,981
Let us worship her!

331
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,863
<i>Hong Jihyo.
I am... I'm their queen...</i>

<i>I'm the queen of crazy people!</i>

ABANDON YOUR CARBON BODIES
AND REACH ASCENSION AND UNITY!

334

Shit, man,
we'll get a silver button for this!

335
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,395
Ugh, seriously, no, come on, Jihyo!

336
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,106
Hold on. Is that Miss Troll?

337
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,816
Right?

338
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,401
Behold!

339
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,571
Now the Blessed Light...

340

Watch, witness as the Messiah brings
down the Infinite Light down to us!

341
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:59,539
Everyone shall witness the Light,
even those lost,

342
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,976
- those poor souls without faith.
- What's this guy...

343
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Right?

344
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,171
- The Light's will shall be so!
- This guy's fuckin' going for it.

345
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,133
Man, are you laughing right now?

Silver button!

347

This is weird. What's going on?

348
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:27,442
Everyone on this Earth
shall receive judgment

349
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,237
by the Light's divine power!

350

376
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,289
Mass suicide?

It was all a lie!

What? Messiah?

403

Why would you make up
such bizarre things to say?

404

You did it, your Holiness!

405

We can look for them together again.
Isn't that right?

Uh-huh! Uh-huh...

Uh... what's that?

Is... is it a blackout?

474
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,719
Is war breaking out?

475

No. No. That.

476

Yeah.

485
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,848
Me too.

486
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:20,823
Honey?

487
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,743
Honey!

488
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,831
Honey!

489
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,668
Honey.

490
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,252
Honey?

491
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,239
Why did you do it?

492
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,120
Why did you have to go that far?

493
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,914
I really believed it all.

494
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,626
I really believed everything
about this, you know?

495
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,628
All of us did.

496
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,798
Why did you have
to lie to all of us?

497
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,468
Why did you deceive us?

498
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,680
Your only merit
was keeping your mouth shut.

499
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,725
You never questioned me.

500
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,978
Always liked that about you, you know?

501
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,274
If you're going to shoot,

502
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,527
make it quick.

503
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,950
Take this.

504
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,662
It has your mom's number in it.

505
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,334
Call her, okay?

506
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,715
Promise you won't skip meals, all right?

507
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,172
- Oh!
- Oh!

508
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,629
- Oh, oh!
- Petite Auntie!

509
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,113
Oh, oh, oh!

510
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,580
Hang in there a bit longer.

511
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,919
Where... where were you two?

512
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,754
Moonhole, Moonhole, are you okay?

513
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,840
What the... what the hell happened?

514
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,553
Tell you later. Okay?

515
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,806
Jihyo...

516
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,647
Are you all right? What on Earth happened?

517
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,732
Oh, hello.

518
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,151
What the...

519
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,444
Si... Siguk?

520
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,117
Jihyo...

521
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,619
What's with...

522
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,662
Um, what's with your clothes?

523
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,498
Uh...

524
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,279
<i>Then...</i>

525
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:13,533
<i>I tried to explain what I saw
to everyone else, but...</i>

526
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,412
<i>but of course, no one believed me.</i>

527
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,083
<i>Even though they saw it
with their own eyes.</i>

528
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,962
<i>One person believed me, though...</i>

529
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,131
<i>Siguk...</i>

530
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,720
<i>I told him everything.
From beginning to end.</i>

531
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,473
He sat there and listened,

532
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,059
but when I looked up at his face,

533
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,143
I just knew it.

534
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,562
"Well...

535
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,564
it's all over now."

536
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,609
"Time to head back home."

537
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,279
That was the first time I thought...

538
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,948
that I wanted to go home.

539
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,868
Must've been scary.

540
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,787
How do you seem so fine?

541
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,539
I'm not really fine.

542
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,332
Do I look fine?

543
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,210
Well, uh...

544
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,380
So, then... what happened after that?

545
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:12,426
How are things with Siguk? Is he
still saying at your place with you?

546
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,016
Siguk went back, to... to his old house.

547
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,020
- But why there of all places?
- Meaning?

548
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,273
Why go back there?

549
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,484
You wanted to get out
of that place, right?

550
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,945
Well, I'm just used to it.

551
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,114
And I'm broke.

552
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,497
Why don't you start fresh
in a whole new place, then?

553
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,542
Just, well...

554
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,670
all that awful stuff happened.

555
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,719
Good things happened there, too.

556
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,309
Right.

557
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:09,648
Jihyo.

558
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,400
Hm?

559
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,195
Let's break up.

560
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,077
Didn't we...

561
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,040
I mean, didn't I do that already?

562
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,460
Formally speaking, we didn't.

563
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,170
I didn't agree to it then.

564
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,840
I agree now, so let's break up.

565
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,387
What changed your mind, then?

566
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,018
I'm not strong enough...

567
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,854
to live with a crazy girl.

568
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,743
- Jeez.
- Hey, now!

569
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,036
You admitted it, come on.

570
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,287
- Hey!
- Ow!

571
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,707
Jeez! You bastard.

572
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,130
Thank you so much.

573
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,714
For what?

574
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,221
Thanks for not making me do it.

575
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,476
I should've said it myself.

576
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,319
Make sure you take care
of yourself, all right?

577
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,453
But, Dad!

578
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:49,499
I don't have enough money for the deposit.
I'm broke. How could I live there?

579
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,501
I know, that's why I'm paying for it!

580
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,171
You don't even have a job.

581
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,341
Hey, but if you pay for it,
it'll be your place, not mine.

582
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,343
- Just give in, would you?
- What?

583
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,262
I know you want independence.

584
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,346
See that?

585
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,724
Thank you, Mom.

586
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,767
Don't thank me.

587
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,730
Just help your father become
more independent from you.

588
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,566
if he wants to pay, just go along.

589
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,403
Do you really have to be
so mature about everything?

590
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,703
Wow, this looks nice. Here.

591
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,306
- It's very nice.
- Isn't it?

592
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:32,375
- But, Mom, that deposit's 20 grand!
<i>- Empty nest syndrome.</i>

593
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,877
<i>That's the world of adults.</i>

594
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:37,631
Hold on, but, "Mom?"
Is that what you call her these days?

595
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,884
Mmm. Mm-hm.

596
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,639
Well, it's been about 15
years since we became family, so...

597
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:50,810
Honestly, it became too tricky
to talk to her without calling her that.

598
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,189
So I got used to it.

599
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:59,069
Anyway, you said everything
was normal again.

600
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,821
Well, it doesn't look
like that is totally true.

601
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,657
Is that so?

602
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,202
Well... if you look at it like that,
I guess so.

603
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,366
<i>This footage was taken
near Gyeonggi Province</i>

604
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,500
<i>where a gathering of the cult known
as the Divine Light Church was held.</i>

605

MASS SUICIDE ATTEMPT

GROUP HALLUCINATIONS
UFO WITNESSED

607
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,796
<i>Strange pipes were spotted.</i>

608
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,549
<i>It seems the inhalation of toxic fumes
that were released caused hallucinations.</i>

609
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:25,178
<i>Some claimed that they saw an unidentified
flying object floating above the field.</i>

610
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,847
<i>It's believed the hallucinations
were caused by this poison.</i>

611
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:28,931
JANG

612
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,517
<i>I met Him. I met Him at last.</i>

613
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,851
<i>Who did you meet, though?</i>

614
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:35,438
<i>The Light. We met the Light.</i>

615
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,399
<i>We finally met the Light.</i>

616
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,317
<i>They all seemed insane,
honestly, you know?</i>

617
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:42,362
<i>Their eyes were rolled back,
everyone was running around crying.</i>

618
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,125
<i>This incident could have easily
ended as a tragic mass suicide case.</i>

619
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,741
QUICK ARRESTS
CRIMINAL CHARGES ORDERED

620
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:50,745
<i>But luckily, there were no innocent
victims and everyone was safely rescued.</i>

621
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,206
<i>The police have arrested
the leaders of this movement,</i>

622
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,544
<i>and have begun a thorough investigation
into the power outage that affected...</i>

623
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,380
This was the exact moment, here.
Do you see this?

624
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:03,508
If it were a normal power outage,
this couldn't have happened.

625
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,553
In other words, the cause
of this blackout can only be seen

626
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,472
as a glitch caused by... alien interference.

627
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,766
As of right now, that's our assumption.

628
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,811
I shot this video.

629
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,396
Do you have any questions?

630
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,734
Yes! Minor Stocks Lover.

631
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:23,028
Uh... So when...

632
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,488
will you play the UFO video?

633
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:28,699
All right!

634
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,995
- I don't want to keep having to explain.
- This isn't free. You have to pay.

635
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,748
I mean, just think about it.

636
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,031
You can't take a video
when your phone's malfunctioning.

637
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,209
It was a glitch.

638
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:43,340
Sure. But you were just telling us
that you saw it.

639
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,485
- Why would we believe you?
- Man, seriously, don't keep bugging me!

640
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:50,096
Just come on! Do all things in this world
need an explanation?

641
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,658
- Okay, then tell us more...
- Hey, Petite, you're here!

642
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,909
- Hey.
- ...seeing a UFO in person.

643
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,333
But, so, why aren't aliens
trying to suppress humans?

644
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,521
Ah, now,
that's a very interesting question.

645
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,541
- We need daring questions.
- Who are these people?

646
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:03,045
- Newbies from our forum.
- Conditions of occurrence!

647
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,487
Phillip's gonna choose one of them
to become a mod.

648
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,446
Nice.

649
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,866
Instead, I'll have to explain things
like encounters of the first,

650
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,285
- second, third and fourth kind.
- Bora?

651
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,138
- The next video's ready.
- Upstairs.

652
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,002
- Let's watch the video first.
- Hmm.

653
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,540
- Donghyuk!
- Yeah!

Oh.

<i>The video we are showing you...</i>

I heard that was a fake.

Oh, well, the video's fake, sure.
But Bigfoot's real for sure.

678
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:29,279
Isn't that thing in the U.S.?
Are you gonna leave, then?

679
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,948
Well, we used to believe
UFOs were only there, too.

680
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,743
I guess that's true.

'76 SEOUL UFO INCIDENT
GRAY REPRODUCTION

689
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,487
Hey. Do you ever watch baseball anymore?

690
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,531
You were such a fan in middle school.

691
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,242
That's what I thought too.

692
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,163
But after the Unicorns disbanded,
I stopped liking it.

693
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,915
I think, honestly...

694
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,084
that I wasn't into baseball, I just...

695
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,253
It's the team I liked, you know?

696
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,881
Mm-hm. Uh-huh.

697
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:32,884
- I see. Huh.
- What?

698
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:33,967
Huh?

699
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:38,097
Uh, it's pretty obvious you got
something to say, so go ahead.

700
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,311
- Um, do you like lofts at all?
- Um, what?

701
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,396
Wanna live together?

702
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:49,067
Wait, what?
That came outta nowhere.

703
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,569
Wait a minute. I, uh...

704
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,322
I made a list of some places for sale.

705
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,120
Do you wanna read it?

706
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,584
Do you maybe...

707
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:08,795
wanna read it?

708
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,065
Hey, Moonhole!

709
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,610
What?

710
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,238
Move your scooter
while I'm still being nice about it.

711
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,489
Ugh, seriously.

712
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,001
Stop parking there!
It's for the customers!

All right, all right,
I'm coming, jackass!

Hurry up!

715
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,972
So... any hallucinations these days?

716
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,349
Hallucinations?

717
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,686
The alien with the Unicorns hat.

718
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,355
That's why you came
here in the first place.

719
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,695
That's right.

720
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,950
I remember the Unicorns.

721
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:27,373
And what about...
anything about when you were hypnotized?

722
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,207
Yeah.

723
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,836
What? What did you see that day?

724
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,797
Was that a hallucination too?

725
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:39,969
Uh...

726
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,725
I saw some sturgeon.

727
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:47,560
Saw some sturgeon?

728
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:53,232
You see, I saw this documentary.

729
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,736
Well, my dad had it on one night.

730
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,365
In the documentary, there were these
scientists studying ecosystems and...

731
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,076
and they were also rescuing sturgeon.

732
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,454
'Cause people just toss nets
back in the ocean...

733
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,499
I mean, the sturgeon,
they get all stuck in those.

734
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,753
And the scientists fish them out and
untangle the sturgeon that get stuck,

735
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,464
- and save them.
- And?

736
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:20,134
And... before they're released,

737
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:23,721
the scientists insert this electronic tag
in their back, you see.

738
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:27,475
<i>Then they're able to track
all of the sturgeon's movements.</i>

739
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,102
<i>Like a transmitter.</i>

740
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,439
Those scientists,

741
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,317
it's almost like they were saying,

742
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:41,531
"Sure. Go be where you wanna be.
It's fine. Mm-hm."

743
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:45,618
<i>"Do whatever you want.
Live freely, however you want."</i>

744
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:50,998
<i>I think they wanted to see and understand
how far these creatures could go...</i>

745
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,210
<i>after gaining their freedom.</i>

746
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,046
So you mean the sturgeon?

747
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,216
I mean the sturgeon.

748
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:03,928
So, then... how far did that sturgeon go?
