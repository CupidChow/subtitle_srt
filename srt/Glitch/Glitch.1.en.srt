I need more time on this.

You do know it's lunchtime?

24
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,913
We have another ten minutes before lunch.

25
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,499
But I say we eat first.
Isn't all this work we do to eat?

26
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,810
- Make a living...
- Ms. Oh.

27

Okay!

You're only in your mid-20s,
and you're getting married already?

42
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,704
What do you mean, "already?"

43
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,123
In the old days,
she would have already had a child.

44
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,750
That's how it was.

45
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,085
- Congrats.
- Yeah.

46

- Thank you. Thank you.
- And there she goes.

47
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,547
Wow.

48
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,300
Seeing her get married
really does make her an adult.

49
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,885
- Ms. Hong.
- Huh?

50
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,179
You do know
you're an adult too, right?

51
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,473
Is that so?

52
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,893
She must have gotten pregnant.

53
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,439
Otherwise, just why would they be
getting married after only three months?

54
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,690
Huh?

55
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,568
Really? She'd becoming
a mother right away?

56
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,112
You know Misun, right?

57
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,507
The girl who transferred
during our second year of college.

58
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,199
- Now she has a boy in school.
- Sh...

59
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,700
She does?

60
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,078
Wow, it's unreal.

61
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,206
Well, you have Siguk,
so what are you worried about?

62
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,250
Why are you bringing up Siguk now?

63
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,669
- Aren't you guys gonna tie the knot soon?
- Huh?

64
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,671
Uh, well...

65
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,258
Hey, what's wrong?
You'll both be all right.

66
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,469
Everyone I know
is living life to the fullest,

67
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,430
and I'm just getting old.

68
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,393
I really need to get it together.

69
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,363
Oh.

70
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,074
Hmm.

71
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,455
Oh God.

72
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,539
Oh God.

73
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,762
Oh, no...

74
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,514
Oops...

75

<i>Oh, that really scared me.</i>

<i>How long has it been?</i>

77
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,237
<i>Three years? Four?</i>

78
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,365
<i>I think this is the first time
that they've come so close.</i>

79
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,035
<i>Okay, let's stay calm, Hong Jihyo.</i>

80
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,828
<i>Stay calm.</i>

You have a discount

83
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,752
Yes, please.

88

<i>What I see isn't everything.</i>

89
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,283
<i>I shouldn't believe something
just because I see it.</i>

90
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,994
<i>I only need to believe in myself.</i>

something else you're looking for?</i>

Good morning, Mr. Park.

Ah, Ms. Oh. Hiya, good morning!

Hey, good morning.

Good morning, my ass.

100
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,645
I just got here and I'm already tired.

101
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,606
Wearing contacts?

102
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,690
Mm-mm.

103
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,236
How about we go for drinks later, Jihyo?
Tomorrow's Saturday, right?

104
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,613
Sure, I'll go with you
and watch you drink.

105
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,949
You don't drink anymore?

106
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,369
When I drink, I lose touch with reality.

107
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,663
That's right. Sober is your thing.

108
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,373
I just don't get it.

109
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,085
I'd give anything
not to be sober for 24 hours.

110
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,256
I already wanna go home.

111
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,092
I wanna stay here!

112
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,386
Don't talk to me about work.

113
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,513
I'm in a great mood
because my ID was checked.

114
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,392
I can't figure out why I'm such a loser?

115
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:06,063
You don't feel like that, Miju,
and you're just a hair-loss nurse.

116
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,899
To be precise, I separate hair follicles.

117
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,068
So what's your take on it?

118
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:16,073
What's up, Jihyo?
I'm talking to you. Are you texting?

- Siguk, yeah?
- No, it's Mr. Eom.

120
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,662
- Huh.
- Eom? But why?

121
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,750
I'm helping him install V-Ray
on his computer.

122
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,960
And that's it. What's up?

123
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,047
Jihyo.

124
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,549
Why are you always so damn cool?

125
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,303
Oh, here she goes with this crap
again. I'm sick and tired of it.

126
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,601
How come I wasn't born Jihyo
instead of Sehee?

127
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,645
Her body's hot, she has a pretty face,

128
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,272
and her father's friend
is the company director.

129
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,636
Well, here's to nepotism!

130
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,193
- Cheers.
- She has a boyfriend she'll marry.

131
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,945
Her mom's business is going so well!

132
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,323
Why are you so invincible?

133
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,326
She's my stepmom.

134
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:07,458
Why is everything so damn easy for you?

135

So, then I asked him,

215
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,184
"Why are loft apartments
the only spaces that you have?"

216
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,646
"Are the only available two-room homes
in Hongdae all loft apartments?"

217
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,773
"What knd of young person
doesn't care about vibes?"

218
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,858
"People live in loft apartments
for the vibes."

219
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,403
That sounds ridiculous to me.
Don't you think?

220
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,198
Young people don't care about vibes.
If I had the cash to worry about vibes,

221
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,042
- I wouldn't be looking for a two-room...
- Do you watch pro baseball?

222
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,912
- What?
- Do you like pro baseball?

223
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,956
How come you ask?

224
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,833
What team do you like?

225
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,504
Do you realise how many baseball players
die in accidents every single year?

226
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,716
Have you ever talked to me
or thought about baseball? Like...

227
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,802
It's a question
that's been stuck inside my memory,

228
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,096
and I'm not really sure why it is.

229

Your brain is off-limits to me.

230
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,398
I guess so.

231
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,358
Now, what are you up to?

232
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,777
Nothing at all.

233
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,196
- Then I'll finish what I was saying.

Then we will share the house?

254
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,547
Mm-hm.

00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,679

264
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,958
Um...

265
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,003
Could you two spare
some time this weekend?

266
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,258
Siguk would like to invite all of us
out for dinner.

267
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,761
Uh, how come now?

268
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,932
Uh, he wants to talk.

269
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,893
So Siguk can ask you? Huh?

270
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,775
Your father and I just so happen
to have some time this weekend.

271
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,736
If you two put it together,
then we'll join you.

272
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,115
Okay.

273
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,041
Ah! Finally, finally!

274
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,919
I was worried she'd never be able
to live like a normal person.

275
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,629
Thank goodness, really.

276
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,632
All right, calm down.
Why are you making such a fuss?

277
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,510
Just as long as she can live
like everyone else.

278
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,637
I don't ask for much!

279
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,102
<i>So, is this how these things go?</i>

280
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,605
<i>Graduate, find a job,</i>

281
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,232
<i>get married, have a baby.</i>

282
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,984
<i>Live like everyone else</i>

283
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,778
<i>and ignore the weird things
I sometimes see.</i>

284
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,656
Isn't that right, Jihyo, huh?
Aren't I right? Huh?

285
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,492
What?

286
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,412
You know, back in middle school,
you used to like all that stuff.

287
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,997
UFOs and aliens.

288
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,167
She was quite a unique girl, huh?

289
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,211
Why keep telling that story?

290
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,088
I never thought she'd grow up
to be such a normal girl.

291
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,175
Back then, she... she had
a special relationship with the world.

292
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,553
She started hanging out
with a strange kid.

293
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,263
- And then you started saying...
- Dad.

294
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,184
Anything else you wanna eat?

295
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,061
What? I...

296
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,813
No, no, this... This'll do.

297
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,736
How long have you been together?

298
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:43,742
We, uh...
Well, it's been about four years.

299
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,827
1,482 days, right?

300
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,207
- And marriage?
- I certainly have it in mind.

301
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,252
Then shouldn't you two
start living together?

302
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:05,931
Uh... it's been quite some time now
that we've been discussing this subject.

303
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,599
Actually, the truth is that I'm worried

304
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,394
because my home is a bit cramped
for the both of us to live there.

305
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,192
However, that issue was settled
very recently.

306
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,069
Why aren't you living together?

307
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,238
I'm not saying you
should get married right away.

308
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,365
Cohabitation's not bad.

309
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,034
You might think you know everything
about each other now,

310
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,620
but it's not a bad idea
to try to live together.

311
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,001
- Uh...
- You might end up saving time that way.

312
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,209
Starting things
by first testing the waters

313
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,837
- is not at all dishonorable.
- Oh. Yeah... Uh...

314
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,839
You are very wise, Mother!

315
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,804
Hey...

316
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,059
Hong Jihyo.

317
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,602
Hong Jihyo, where are you going?

318
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,647
To get a plate of <i>ganjang gejang.</i>

319
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,821
Did I do something wrong?

320
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,661
<i>Where are you?</i>

321
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,788
<i>Why aren't you coming back? Save me!</i>

322
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,583
<i>On my way.</i>

323
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,190
<i>- I'm watching you.
- I'm...</i>

324
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,894
<i>I'm watching you.
I'm watching you.</i>

325
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,384
I'M WATCHING YOU

326
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,178
<i>I'm watching you. I'm watching you.</i>

327
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,554
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

328
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,317
<i>I'm watching you.
I'm watching you.</i>

329
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,891
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

330
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,017
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

331
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,393
I'M WATCHING YOU

332
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,520
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

333
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,230
I'M WATCHING YOU

334
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,399
<i>I'm watching you. I'm watching you.</i>

335
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,650
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

336
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,069
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

337
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,154
<i>- I'm watching you.
- I'm watching you.</i>

338
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,114
<i>I'm watching you.
I'm watching you.</i>

339
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,491
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

340
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,618
<i>I'm watching you.
I'm watching you.</i>

341
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,869
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

342
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,245
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

343
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,089
<i>- I'm watching you.
- I'm watching you.</i>

344
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,291
<i>I'm watching you.
I'm watching you.</i>

345
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,626
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

346
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,628
<i>- I'm watching you.
- I'm watch...</i>

347
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,897
<i>- I'm watching you.
- I'm watching.</i>

348
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,781
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

349
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,568
<i>I'm watching.</i>

350
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,111
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

351
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:09,239
<i>- I'm watching.
- I'm watching you. I'm watching.</i>

352
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,717
<i>- I'm watching.
- I'm watching you.</i>

353
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,118
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

354
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,579
<i>- I'm watching you.
- I'm watching you.</i>

355
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,374
<i>- I'm watching.
- Watching you. Watching you.</i>

356
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,543
<i>- I'm watching.
- Watching.</i>

357
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,086
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

358
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,515
Where am I?

359
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,160
<i>Hey, that's so strange!</i>

360
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,620
<i>- A bit lower.</i>
- Hello?

361
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,540
<i>I'm going to tell everyone!</i>

362
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,624
<i>No!</i>

363
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,170
Hey, I know all about it.

364
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,506
About the UFO that went down in Seoul.

365
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,424
- You know, the UFO in Seoul.
- Hey.

366
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,635
How do you draw stuff like this?

367
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,638
What should we draw on the lady's face?

368
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,641
Back Yoonsun,
the one who got abducted by a UFO.

369
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,393
- Ugh. Why?
- Why not?

370
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,937
We should do the same thing to her.

371
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,274
She said she met an alien.

372
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,985
You wanna draw too, huh?
Forget it.

373
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,446
Just wait a second.

374
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,749
Huh?

375
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,876
Huh?

376
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,421
Oh?

377
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,806
Hey!

378
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,267
What are you doing here?

379
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,025
All right,
we have a few videos here.

380
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,654
In the first video,
you're enjoying a cigarette.

381
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,283
And I'm not sure what you're doing here.

382
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,369
Anyways, you did this, then...

383
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,830
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

384
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,125
Then, to see where you went next,
if you look at the second video...

385
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,587
Here. This is the lobby
of that building from earlier.

386
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,798
You stood there for a while
thinking about something.

387
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,216
And after that...

388
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,265
Here. This is all we have.

389
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,811
Why'd you go up there?

390
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,315
What were you doing
on the roof of that building?

391
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,653
Right...

392
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,324
Why was I up there?

393
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,744
I can't remember a thing.

394
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,125
Were you drinking too much?

395
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,502
Spirits aren't my thing.

396
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,672
If you didn't drink,
then why'd you black out?

397
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,508
Right, so then why...

398
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,843
Why did I do that?

399
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,599
Lady.

400
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,811
You could be charged with
breaking and entering.

401
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,982
You seem to think you can get off the hook
by beating around the bush,

402
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,400
but I'm no idiot.

403
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:40,575
I happen to have served in the Marines,
and play by the rules.

404
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:45,954
Oh.

405
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,415
Oh, no.

406
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,124
Mmm...

407
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,586
What is this?

408
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,726
It's not a piece of cake, is it?

409
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,936
Life, I mean.

410
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,315
You think you're the only one suffering,
but you're not.

411
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,319
You've no idea of the people I meet
on this job.

412
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,322
Each one of them's got his own story.

413
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,158
And sometimes...

414
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,495
...I, uh, run across people
who make me wonder,

415
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,581
just why is this life
so damn cruel to them?

416
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,293
Just the same, though...

417
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,295
...they stick it out.

418
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,757
I hope that you think about it.

419
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,135
It... it'd be a pity.

420
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,512
'Cause you are...

421
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,141
You're such a nice young girl, yeah?

422
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,224
Right.

423
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,144
You're such a...

424
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,227
Huh?

425
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,397
What are you saying?

426
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
What?

427
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,317
You began saying something.

428
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,401
Jihyo!

429
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,741
Yes, sir.

430
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,411
One moment. Yes, Mr. Hong.
I just found her. Yes.

431
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,877
I didn't tell your father
about you being at the police station.

432
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,754
Can you tell me about this?

433
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,840
Where did you run off to
in the middle of dinner?

434
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,176
And what's this have to do
with the police?

435
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,972
Siguk.

436
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,891
About your friend Doc.

437
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,603
The magician. Magician Hyungwoo. Huh?

438
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,730
Why are you talking about him?

439
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,983
He opened a counseling office.
Do you know where it is?

440
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,652
He told me to drop over,
but I haven't yet.

441
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,070
Should I go over there?

442
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:45,158
Why are you suddenly talking about this?
That's not what we were talking about.

443
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,661
What's all this about
professional baseball and your magician?

444
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,413
What... what's gotten into you?

445
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,082
Will yuo please tell me what's going on?

446
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,717
What were you up to on that rooftop alone?

447
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,427
Not suicide.

448
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,846
Then what were you doing?

449
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,567
Hey, Jihyo...
Are we going to live together?

450
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,863
Siguk, I'm really sorry.
Can we not talk about this right now?

451
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,495
That's what I've been doing
for four years.

452
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,082
I've waited patiently for you.

453
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,919
Years and years, lingering.

454
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,131
I wish you'd make a decision.

455
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:49,055
What are you saying?
Isn't it clear how I feel by now?

456
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,604
Isn't it obvious
that I love you?

457
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,227
I love you. You're the only one for me.

458
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,605
Can we talk later, Nayoung?
I need to get to work now.

459
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,190
HAPPY CHILD

460
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,483
Yes, me too.

461
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,528
- Hyungwoo.
- Oh my God!

462
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,906
You scared the shit out of me.

463
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,951
To the new opening.

464
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,372
You're giving me this already?

465
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,708
We've only been open seven months.

466
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,920
Why are you here without Siguk?
Did you break up?

467
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,047
I'm seeing them, Hyungwoo.

468
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,927
They've... reappeared.

469
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,306
The green helmet guy.

470
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,687
This time, the issue is even bigger.

471
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,064
And I mean, literally bigger.

472
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,775
What I'm saying
is the size of it was huge.

473
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,777
It was an enormous one!

474
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,656
It was so big
that I just couldn't ignore it.

475
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,824
And then?

476
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,535
How did you deal with it?

477
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,413
I ran. I... I began to run, and...

478
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,540
to my surprise, I ended up in reeds and...

479
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,169
- But there was this van.
- Reeds? Van?

480
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,546
Tell me more about this van.

481
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,672
Oh...

482
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,258
It's something from the past.

483
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,639
In middle school,
my friend and I would hang out

484
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,554
in a weird old van
behind our neighborhood.

485
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,556
How's that for a hallucination?

486
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,100
All these crazy memories
mixed together, aah...

487
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,938
This is so not cool.

488
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,731
Who's the friend from middle school?

489
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,736
It's just a random illusion.
It's not a crisis or anything.

490
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,615
I need to hear what happened, in order
to determine if it's important or not.

491
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,159
The thing most important in counseling

492
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:36,496
is learning about the person you are
and how you feel inside.

493
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,832
And to do that, you have
to look back into your past.

494
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,043
It seems... it seems useless. For what?

495
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,628
So why did you come around, huh?

496
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,673
'Cause I wanna stop seeing Martians!

497
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,217
No more aliens, please!

498
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,300
And why...

499
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,929
why are they appearing to me?

500
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,015
- Hmm.
- Why is it like this? And why...

501
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,851
Why...

502
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,772
What about the Unicorns I saw?

503
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,192
Okay...

504
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,403
What about your daily habits lately?

505
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:15,451
I suppose one could say that I'm probably
livng the ideal existence.

506
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,037
I'm the only one acting stupid.

507
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,456
And your relationship to others?

508
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,167
Oh, they're fine, I guess you could say.

509
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,754
Sehee is a lot more annoying than usual.

510
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,840
- Much more.
- Oh yeah?

511
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,885
Weren't Siguk, you and Sehee
like the Three Musketeers in college?

512
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:33,970
We were.

513
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,179
Then...

514
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,433
my dating Siguk
changed the picture.

515
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,061
Sehee began acting
like she was my ex-sweetheart.

516
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,439
Oh God.

517
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,941
It's like she's jealous of Siguk.

518
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,861
If she's like this now,

519
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,613
just think what will happen
when I move in with Siguk.

520
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,533
Stop. You're gonna live with Siguk?

521
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,243
Uh-huh.

522
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,864
Didn't I tell you about this?

523
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,874
I've been asking you about that.

524
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,585
I should have known about this
from the start.

525
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,755
Jihyo.

526
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,593
Are you quite sure
that this will work out?

527
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,472
Is there maybe something that bothers you?

528
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:24,896

HAPPY CHILD - MA HYUNGWOO

529
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,383
Welcome home.

530
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,534
You haven't gone to bed yet?

531
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,412
I'm going now.

532
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,415
You going to work tomorrow?

533
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,167
Yes.

534
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,378
Good night.

535
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,339
Hey, Hong Jihyo.

536
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,763
Come have a seat for a moment.

537
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,391
How much longer are you gonna act
like that towards your mother?

538
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,353
- What do you mean?
- What upset you at dinner yesterday?

539
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,313
What happened?

540
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,859
You need to tell me about anything
that might be concerning for you.

541
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,072
Was there an issue? With us?

542
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,908
If there was, I would tell you.

543
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,411
It's no one in particular.

544
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,788
Then why did you do that?

545
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,125
I have no idea. Really.

546
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,295
How is that possible?

547
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,966
I think you can explain it if you try.

548
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,384
Huh? Hey.

549
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:41,055
Do you plan to behave like this, Jihyo,
in front of Siguk's family?

550
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,184
Your future in-laws will criticize you
because of your crazy manners!

551
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,445
Hey, we're in the middle
of a conversation.

552
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,447
Come back here and sit down. Hey!

553
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,741
Hello! Where do you think you're going?

554
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,540
Welcome.

555
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,876
- Thank you.
- Just one person?

556
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,628
Uh, I'm meeting someone here.
Oh, there she is.

557
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,338
Ugh. Give me a break.

558
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,138
You were drinking, Hong Jihyo?

559
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,891
One drink and you're down for the count.

560
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,767
Hey. Hey, Hong Jihyo.

561
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,323
Mr. Head Shrink just called.

562
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,159
Oh yeah? What'd he tell you?

563
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,204
Just some small talk
about each other's lives,

564
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,247
and all of a sudden, he asked about us.

565
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,750
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

566
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,837
- Did you go in for counseling?
- Oh, he wasn't supposed to say!

567
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,672
What'd you guys say?

568
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,801
Can you tell me anything?

569
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,891
Damn it!

570
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:14,649
Why is it that, whatever you ask,
they're always such useless questions?

571
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,732
Huh?

572
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,361
Shall I tell you?

573
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,572
Time to speak.

574
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,544
I...

575
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,046
I...

576
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,093
- I'm obsessed with lofts.
- Huh?

577
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,346
I dream of an attic
with a shitty heating system.

578
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,476
It's true that I owe my success
to connections and Unicorns.

579
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,313
I'm not at all the same girl
that I was in that van.

580
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,899
- What? What are you saying...
- What I'm saying is...

581
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:04,156
...now, if I ended up being a crazy girl,
could you live with me?

582
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,454
Yes or no?

583
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,373
I'm sure you're not.

584
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,253
Hypothetically.

585
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,423
I mean, hypothetically crazy.

586
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,426
Do you think you could?

587
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,805
But you're not.

588
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,602
Oh, you shithead...

589
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,564
You may not be crazy,
but you say crazy stuff.

590
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,738
We're done.

591
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,077
I wondered how far you'd go.

592
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,251
