She abruptly left,

00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,962
Do you mind if I ask
what the fight was about?

110
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,507
She asked if I really tried to do it.

111
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,925
Do what?

112
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,426
Commit suicide.

113
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,264
She asked if I really moved out,
bought tickets, and flew out to Thailand.

What?

118
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,693
I just met with him.

119
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,154
He's living at Miss Hong's place for now.

120
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,406
So, where has he been, then?

121
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,117
Was he actually kidnapped for real?

122
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,621
Well, I mean, we can't
rule out that possibility.

123
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,374
Looks like he doesn't remember
anything that happened.

124
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,751
<i>That's crazy.</i>

Did you find anything of importance?

126
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,339
Oh, I might've. Uh...

127
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,093
Looks like it's some kind of a register.

128
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,721
In the folder named "Direct." Take a guess
whose names popped up in here.

129
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,139
Whose?

130
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,643
Oh, do you mean the mass suicide
case victims? The nursing home?

131
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,563
Yeah, it looks like
the same day as the suicides,

132
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,815
those people
were taken off the member register.

133
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,150
Do you want to know
what's really strange, though?

134
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,651
<i>What?</i>

135
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,155
- There's one more person on the list.
<i>- What?</i>

136
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,283
This person didn't die.

137
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,369
So what was the point
of crossing off their name?

138
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,208
Maybe they knew something about
the suicides they shouldn't have.

139
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,003
<i>Maybe they know what happened.</i>

140
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,464
- Is there a contact on there?
<i>- I just sent it to you.</i>

141
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,508
Mmm, I'll head out there now.

Uh... Excuse me...

Mr. Lee?

144
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,935
Sorry but, were you just talking
about a cult? Kidnapping?

145
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,798
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

146
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,305
I know...
I know just how much you've worked...

147
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,724
to get to this point.

148
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,611
Uh, Father?

149
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,366
- I brought what you asked for.
- Great.

150
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,619
Put it inside.

151
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,587
- Nearly everyone has arrived, Father.
- Mmm.

152
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,257
What of the...

153
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,550
drugs?

154
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,638
- We've handed them out as they come in.
- Good.

155
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,557
It'll work, right?

156
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,481
Once they take it, um...
it only takes three minutes to work.

157
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,150
- And there's no pain at all.
- All right.

00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,538
Um, pardon me...

00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,124
What is it?

160
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,211
Uh, um, well, uh...

161
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,381
Uh, well, I...

162
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,593
Is this about her Holiness?

163
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,808
Would you consider
maybe postponing the ceremony for now?

164
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,728
Her body was supposed
to be revealed today.

165
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,439
Fa... Father, I know
she left behind the gospel,

166
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:15,067
but everyone was expecting
to see her body, you understand.

167
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,069
The congregation will most likely want

168
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,447
some kind of proof
of her Holiness' martyrdom.

169
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,090
- You see? So...
- Proof, is that right?

170
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,409
- So maybe we...
- I guess that's necessary, huh?

171
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,580
Without proof then...

172
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,207
they'd say that this was all scam.

173
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,691
- Isn't that right?
- No!

174
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,019
I mean, I would never say that...

175
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,712
- Look, Brother Oh.
- I just... Yes?

176
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,675
Do you fear the congregation, Brother?

177
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,635
Father?

178
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,679
I do...

179
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,599
fear them.

180
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,937
The one we've been waiting for...
Her Holiness, herself...

181
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,274
Her Holiness couldn't accept...

182
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,320
couldn't accept her calling and ran away.

183
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,368
I can't bring myself
to say what happened.

184
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,539
They've been waiting for so long.
I can't tell them, because, honestly...

185
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,044
I really am very... scared.

186
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,755
Uh, yes, Father.

187
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:18,881
Come in, welcome!

188

<i>We will be closing the entrance soon!</i>

202
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,130
- They already started.

203
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,258
Hey!

204
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:04,969
Seriously?

205
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,057
Wait. What's that? What are you planning?

206
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,685
We have no time, your Holiness.

207
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,106
The second the speech ends,
Father is going to be calling the Light.

208
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,692
So we better get going and go in now.

209
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,443
Get in how? Those people will see us.

210
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,947
Look, I'm not afraid, your Holiness.

211
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,326
- You're gonna get yourself killed!
- You'll give me salvation, won't you?

212
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,248
"On that glorious day,
the Messiah will come down,

213

overcoming the trial of death."

214
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,960
..."The Messiah said to the sheep..."

215
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:42,131
"'The body is a prison, with bars
of carbon. Follow me towards the Light.'"

216
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,803
"The Blessed Light will wear the flesh

219
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,790
- Just wait a minute!
- "The body..."

220
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,814
Hold on a minute.

221
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,528
You believe in me, am I right?

222
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,072
Yes, your Holiness. Of course.

223
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,949
Then that means...

224
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,493
so do those people, right?

225
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,623
- What?
- I mean, those people believe in me.

226
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,499
Like you do. Isn't that right?

227

Brothers and Sisters.

241
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,866
We have waited...

242
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,286
We've waited for such a long time!

243
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,666
Trust me, I know...

244
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,422
I know what sacrifices you all made
in preparation for this day.

245
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:51,427
I know some of you have even
abandoned your jobs.

246
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,929
Some of you abandoned your families too.

247
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,223
And some of you abandoned your honor.

248
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,809
I know there are even those
who gave up their own lives

249
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:02,604
because waiting was just too much
for their hearts to handle.

250
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,566
But finally, today...

251
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,151
Everyone...

252
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,195
The day has come nigh!

253
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,868
Although our Messiah...
although she has now moved on...

254
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,620
our beloved Messiah...

255
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,707
has left a gift!

256
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,668
Our magnanimous Messiah, before leaving,

257
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,296
has graciously left us
the last key to paradise!

258
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,134
Come quickly!

259
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,676
Hurry!

260
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,143
To this day...

261
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:46,023
...I remember clearly
how her Holiness appeared that day.

262
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,608
Her Holiness...

263
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,320
suffered greatly
until her very last breath,

264
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,115
all so she could bring
us the truth of ascension,

265
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,659
and grant us all salvation.

266
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,536
She's here.

267
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,122
- To save us, she endured trials...
- Confirm it quickly.

268
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,486
- ...flesh...
- Someone's coming.

269
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,711
However, her body, her mortal coil,

270
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,839
was not able to endure the heavy burden...

271
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,716
What?

272
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,136
It's the Messiah!

273
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,138
She's not dead?

274
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,351
She's alive!

275
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,316
The Messiah lives!

276
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,026
- It's her!
- Is this real?

277
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,402
The Messiah! She's come alive!

278
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,531
I can't see!

279
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,492
Does he know that she's alive?

280
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,846
Captain Price?

281
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,681
Cap!

282
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,560
Oh. Oh. Oh, hey.

283
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,646
So what... what happened, man?

284
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,106
So bad news, Cap...

285
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,234
- Your café got totally wrecked.
- Oh, I have no idea, man.

286
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,112
What about Moonhole?
You said she was here.

287
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,908
- What?
- Where'd she go?

288
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,080
Is that really her?

289
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,959
Sister Abigail!

290
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,045
Abigail, who's this person?

291
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,132
Yes, this person...

292
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,051
It's true, she's the Messiah.

293
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,139
But, but... how?

294
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,100
Father said she passed away. Didn't he?

295
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,399
The truth... the truth is...

296
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,405
Um, um, well, I'm... resurrected.

297
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,411
Huh?

298
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,126
Oh, shit...

299
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,462
Everyone!

300
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,882
I've been resurrected!

301
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,812
"And on this glorious day,

302
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,358
the Messiah will come down, overcoming...

303
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,860
overcoming the trial of death!"

304
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,991
"Those with eyes shall see!
They shall lift up their eyes!"

305
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:48,747
"Lift up their eyes!
Shall lift their eyes and seeeee!"

306
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,971
Our Messiah has come!

307
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,974
Our Messiah has risen!

308
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,059
- Oh!
- The Messiah has risen!

309
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,568
Messiah!

310
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,862
Messiah!

311
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,783
She is to save us! She will save us!

312
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,828
I need to talk to you!

313
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,496
Silence!

314
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,625
Forgive me.

315
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,795
What was that, your Holiness?

316
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,797
We need to talk, all right?

317
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,549
Of course.

318
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,511
This way, somewhere quiet.

319
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,055
No, not somewhere quiet.

320
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,723
Right here.

321
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,102
Here, in front of everyone.

322
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,564
I

323
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,192
I have nothing to hide!

324
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,154
I won't hide from my believers!

325
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,124
- Messiah!
- Messiah!

326
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,482
Excuse me?

327
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,317
- Yes?
- I have a QR...

328
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,611
Oh, Sister!

329
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,239
The memorial service, it's been canceled.
It's a miracle!

330
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,407
Huh?

331
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,659
Her Holiness is back from the dead!

332
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,119
- She has been resurrected!
- Woah!

333
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,246
- Resurrected!
- Wait, what?

334
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,417
- Uh... Wait, who... who's back?
- Her Holiness. Her Holiness has risen!

335
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,544
She has returned to bring us salvation!

336
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,254
Light be with you!

337
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,095
These people, I swear.

338
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,055
Where do they keep disappearing to?

339
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,391
What the hell is she gonna do
all by herself?

340
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,768
- What are you doing?
- Shh!

341
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,255
How's your head, sir?

342
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,840
Younggi.

343
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,259
My daughter.

344
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,345
Where is she?

345
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,432
Uh... uh...

346
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,600
Uh...

347
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,602
Well, the thing is...

348
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,765
SONG JAEDEOK NEUROPSYCHIATRY

349
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,897
Why bring him?

350
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,441
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MENTAL DISORDERS

351
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,651
I mean,
what was I supposed to do?

352
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,737
He said he wanted to come.
He was staring at me like a lost puppy.

353
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,991
How could you let a civilian
investigate with us?

354
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,712
Hey, it's fine.
It doesn't matter.

355
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,328
You're a civilian too, remember?

356
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,386
- Kim Byungjo? Please come in.
- Yes.

357
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,854
Which one of you is Kim Byungjo?

358
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,898
Detective Kim Byungjo from Geoan Station.

359
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:49,446
Doctor, you used to be a part
of the Divine Light Church, right?

360
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,283
This punk.

361
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,993
Is he causing trouble again?

362
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,460
<i>Attention,
Brothers and Sisters,</i>

363
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,539
<i>the memorial service has been canceled.</i>

364
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,792
<i>In a moment, the Father
will have an audience with the Messiah.</i>

365
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,920
<i>Please gather in the assembly hall.</i>

366
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,508
<i>I repeat, the memorial service
has been canceled.</i>

367
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,386
<i>In a moment, the Father
will have an audience with the Messiah.</i>

368
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,389
<i>Please gather in the assembly hall.</i>

369
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,979
<i>Please take a seat.</i>

370
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,315
<i>Please take a seat, quickly.</i>

371
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,598
<i>You're saying...
she can communicate with aliens?</i>

372
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,862
She told everyone she could.

373
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,406
That's why she got taken
to the welfare center.

374
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,910
Doctor, could you please tell us
what exactly a welfare center does?

375
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:41,957
It's just a center for the mentally ill,
and also the homeless, and drug addicts.

376
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,292
So, you mean Moon Hyungtae...

377
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,294
We were interns at the welfare center.

378
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,923
I mean, honestly, we worked
with many bizarre patients there.

379
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,675
Though the strangest...

380
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,011
was this woman who claimed
to be able to communicate with aliens!

381
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,015
<i>A lot of doctors took interest in her
because of that.</i>

382
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,809
<i>Hyungtae agreed she was odd.</i>

383
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,812
<i>But he didn't stop there.</i>

384
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,148
<i>He became more and more
obsessed with her, and later...</i>

385
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,651
Mmm.

386
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,780
Yeah? With his own patient he did that?

387
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,949
Do you think...

388
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,160
you could still live with me
even if I was crazy?

389
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,498
Then eventually,
he started saying strange things.

390
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,916
Such as?

391
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,168
He claimed there was
something in her head.

392
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,337
Something that aliens put in there.

393
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:34,092
In any case, there's lots more people like
Hyungtae in this world than you'd think.

394
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,051
Hurry, please.

395
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,221
<i>That's probably why the two of them
were able to start a church.</i>

396
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,806
Please keep moving.

397
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,529
- Please keep moving forward!
- Thank you.

398
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,561
- Could you please go in?
- Please make room for everyone.

399
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,731
Please keep moving, Brothers and Sisters!

400
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,901
<i>I'll be straightforward
with you, Doctor.</i>

401
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:56,239
Could you tell us, to the best of your
knowledge, whether there's any possibility

402
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,366
either he or the church
has been involved in crime?

403
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,369
Well, any crime aside
from the mass suicide case?

404
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,123
Like kidnapping, or...

405
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,208
Probably not.

406
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,794
He doesn't leave any evidence.

407
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,589
He has connections
with local law enforcement.

408
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,258
Really, I... I... I mean,
even a tiny smidge.

409
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,219
A minuscule, really tiny lead.
Just a little tiny bit of evidence?

410
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,263
Oh...

411
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,642
There. Hmm.

412
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,604
Here, see? He still sends invitations
when they have events.

413
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,113
FLESH TO LIGHT!
THE MESSIAH'S MEMORIAL SERVICE

414
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,359
I guess I should thank him
for not forgetting about me.

415
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,070
- The Messiah is here!
- The Messiah!

416
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,490
- The Messiah!
- The Messiah!

417
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,802
I need to get in there!
Let go! Let go of me! Let go!

418
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,054
Let go of me! Stop!

419
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,765
Oh! Oh, your Holiness!

420
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,266
Oh! Your Holiness!

421
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,935
Aaah! Don't you know me?

422
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,438
I gave you steak,
don't you remember? Remember?

423
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,440
Your Holiness! No! Let go!

424
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,819
Oh, my! I think she recognized me.
Did you see that?

425
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:19,698
Oh! You recognize me,
your Holiness, right?

426
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,371
Your Holiness.
It's a real honor to see you again.

427
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,584
Your followers... Impressive passion, right?

428
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,423
Well, then... Is this set up to your liking,
your Holiness?

429
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,800
We prepared everything just as you asked.

430
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,802
My chip.

431
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,679
I want it back.

432
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,097
What?

433
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,515
The chip, all right?

434
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:50,019
What those aliens implanted
right into my brain, that thing.

435
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,771
A chip, huh?

436
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,026
You mean, um... the gospel of our faith?

437
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,698
Now tell me where it is.

438
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,117
Aliens... A chip?

439
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,580
So tell me, where did you hear
silly words like that?

440
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,749
I wasn't trying to be "silly".

441
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,083
Give it back.

442
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,710
My chip.

443
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,253
It's mine.

444
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,011
Hold on.

445
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,264
Do you think you could have been...
awakened, your Holiness?

446
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,767
Awakened?

447
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,893
That's right.

448
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,650
I'm sorry to have
to bring this up, however...

449
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,236
the last time I saw you...

450
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:44,365
sadly, your Holiness...
well, you failed to be awakened.

451
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,260
<i>Your Holiness...</i>

452
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:50,622
Now, at this point,
do you remember your purpose?

453
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,372
Do you?

454
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,211
Your Holiness.

455
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,714
Honestly, I'm very afraid.

456
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:04,511
<i>The burden you've placed on my shoulders
is much too heavy</i>

457
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,429
<i>and... frightening.</i>

458
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,723
I'd like to give it to you, trust me.

459
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,184
Then I could finally free myself
of this terrible burden.

460
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,268
However...

461
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,189
all those faithfuls outside

462
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:21,569
have been following me this whole time.

463
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,781
You see, even if you have returned,
your Holiness,

464
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:28,117
how could I possibly just
hand over the gospel to you

465
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:32,664
when you don't even remember...
remember your purpose on this plane?

466
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,001
Wouldn't you agree, your Holiness?

467
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,255
Father Job.

468
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,261
I bet you have no idea
how painful and exhausting

469
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,721
coming back from the dead actually is.

470
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,557
I mean, how could you?

471
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,476
I'm the one who was resurrected.

472
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,356
Um, what the hell's this brat doing
right now?

473
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,024
Listen, Father.

474
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,736
I remember everything.

475
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,323
The reed field I was in back then.

476
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,578
That's where I first saw the ali...

477
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,126
The first time I met the Light.

478
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,711
<i>Sella.</i>

479
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,713
<i>Sella. Sella.</i>

480
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,172
<i>Sella.</i>

481
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,674
<i>- Sella.
- Sella.</i>

482
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,259
<i>Sella. Sella.</i>

483
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,760
<i>- Sella.
- Oh!</i>

484
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,057
Now give it to me.

485
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,726
I'll do it.

486
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:35,894
Do what?

487
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,315
Now I'm gonna do it for you.

488
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,859
I'll bring your blessed Light.

489
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,528
- I'll call it and bring your salvation.
- Messiah!

490
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,947
Isn't that the Messiah's purpose, Father?

491
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,699
Messiah!

492
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,744
<i>- You want to receive salvation.</i>
- Messiah! Messiah!

493
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,746
<i>- You've all waited this long.</i>
- It's true!

494
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,334
Isn't that right? Believers?

495
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,418
You need salvation.

496
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,129
<i>Together, let's get it!</i>

497
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:25,985
Oh no!

498
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,154
- She's got a gun!
- Why are you doing this?

499
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,073
Put down the gun.

500
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,741
Put the gun down.

501
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,327
- Drop the gun now!
- Don't hurt the Messiah!

502
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,579
- Bora?
- Jihyo, let's go!

503
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,873
- Oh, oh...
- Oh my God!

504
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,793
Cut the bullshit! Come on, let's go!

505
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,544
- How did you...
- Get the fuck back!

506
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,512
Hey. Come on!

507
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,059
- Get her!
- Grab her, grab her now!

508
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,478
- Get her out, now!
- Jihyo! What are you doing!

509
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,147
- Hey, open the door!
- Let go! Let go! Let go!

510
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,732
Jihyo! Let go!

511
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,442
Open the door!

512
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,987
Jihyo! What are you doing?
- Get her out of here!

513
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,535
FROM FLESH TO LIGHT
DIVINE LIGHT CHURCH

514
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,671
- Oh, wait. Your Holiness, wait.
- Hey! Gah!

515
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,382
Get out of here!
Don't grab me like that again!

516
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,843
I need to talk to her,
so please give us the room.

517
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,469
Yes, your Holiness.

518
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,439
Well, aren't you Little Miss Popular?

519
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,531
Leave.

520
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,201
I'll let you go.

521
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,704
What are you saying? And you?

522
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,042
Cap, where is he?

523
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,919
- You here alone?
- I'm not leaving you here.

524
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,509
Seriously, what in the hell
are you even doing here, Jihyo?

525
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,595
You know that already.

526
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,929
Know what already?

527
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,183
So you're gonna defend the Earth yourself?

528
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,808
Yeah.

529
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,104
Christ, you've really lost it.

530
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,107
Bora.

531
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,860
Listen to me. I'm aware you think
I'm crazy, all right?

532
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,696
Well, uh... I am being a bit nuts...

533
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,158
This is my only chance to find it.
My chip may have the answers.

534
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,203
Almost everyone's convinced now.
And that Father's position is-

535
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,371
You believe what he says, really?

536
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,082
Hey, no, of course not.

537
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,667
If I get this chip back,

538
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,920
then I'll take off first chance I get.

539
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,005
No, not that, you moron.

540
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,591
No, I mean the destruction of mankind.

541
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,635
Do you actually believe all that?

542
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,682
You don't believe it?

543
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,019
You think a UFO will come down?

544
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,605
And that the world will end too?

545
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,691
Oh, fuck, seriously,
how does that make any sense?

546
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,653
Are you really gonna drink the Kool-Aid
with the rest of them?

547
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,949
That's bold, coming from you.

548
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,410
Why's that?
Am I not allowed to be rational?

549
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,122
The whole reason I'm even here
is because of you.

550
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:28,251
I never said we should put
our lives on the line over this nonsense.

551
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,169
- Look, I just...
- Oh, hell, no!

552
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,839
Then what about me, then? Huh?

553
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,509
The... the implant...

554
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,220
You mean the field,
everything, was all just bullshit?

555
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,390
If that's true, then what have
I been doing this whole time? Tell me.

556
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,284
- Jihyo.
- I'm not the only one who's seen them.

557
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,601
You said you saw them too!

558
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,645
So was that really all a lie?

559
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:07,914
No...

560
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,797
So then why...

561
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,718
Really, Bora, come on,
why are you being like this?

562
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,262
Ah, fuck, I don't care
if the world ends or not.

563
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,975
Seriously, though,
I'm not letting you get brainwashed.

564
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,226
We're leaving together.

565
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,567
Thank you, Bora.

566
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,820
I...

567
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,323
Listen, I just wanted
to explain this myself...

568
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,453
Let's just go. Let's just leave and...

569
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,662
Come in!

570
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,956
Yes, your Holiness.

571
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,375
- She's a non-believer. Take her away.
- What?

572
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,293
- Yes.
- Hey!

573
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,730
Get her out of the compound.
Make sure she doesn't get hurt.

574
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,923
- Cut the bullshit, Jihyo!
- Take her away immediately.

575
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,424
Let go! Let go of me!

576
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,259
Hey! Jihyo!

577
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,971
Fuck! Let go! Let go of me!

578
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,097
Let go!

579
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,901
I can do this.

580
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,492

ALTAR

582
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,080
You didn't...

583
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,540
You didn't have to kick her out.

584
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,715
That was for me to decide.

585
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:54,522
- So to continue what we were talking...
- Do whatever you want, your Holiness.

586
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,606
What?

587
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,610
I'll give you back the gospel.

588
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,531
Do as you wish.

589
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,491
Um, why?

590
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,621
What you said earlier... You were right.

591
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,083
Real faith is just believing.

592
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,085
With my lack of wisdom,

593
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,505
I acted very arrogant in front of you...

594
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,090
It was presumptuous of me.

595
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,676
Please forgive me.

596
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,886
Your Divine Holiness.

597
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,196
Take it easy.

598
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,660
God damn it!

599
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,082
<i>Sorry to bother you,
but can I get a light?</i>

600
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,379
Do you like that kinda stuff?

601
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,131
Aliens, UFOs, that kinda stuff?

602
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,841
Ah, no!

603
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,885
Yeah. It was you, you fucking bitch!

604
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,806
Are you crazy?

605
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,724
<i>I thought everything was your fault.</i>

606
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,310
So I honestly don't really know
why I came here.

607
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:57,937
Hmm.
