Believe me, it's all too common.

00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:58,455
Don't post on the forum about the meeting.
Please use nicknames in offline meetings.

316
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,874
I'm Cho Phillip. Captain Price.

317
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,335
And Donghyuk. And...

318
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,504
Just drop the introductions.

319
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,467
Anyway, a big welcome to Petite!

320
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,094
Welcome, Petite. Welcome!

321
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,612
It's deep in the night.

322
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:34,157
So from this moment on,
I'm appointing one person to be Mafia.

323
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,579
All right. The Mafia has been determined.

324
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,874
It's morning now.
All participants, please raise your heads.

325
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:49,714
From now on, citizens can try to deduce
who the Mafia is through open discussion.

326
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,049
Good luck.

327
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,055
Hey, but don't you think playing the game
with four people is a little difficult?

328
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,182
Isn't the balance off?
There's only one Mafia.

329
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:02,435
Ohh! Captain Price
is suspicious right off the bat.

330
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,272
- What's that?
- You sound like a Mafia character.

331
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,482
- For real.
- Excuse me, but...

332
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,734
Do you think I'll sit here
and listen to this crap?

333
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,498
You sound so uptight.

334
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,756
- Forgive me interrupting...
- Are you mad?

335
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,990
Did I touch your sore spot?

336
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,701
Mmm. You look a little suspicious
for acting so desperate.

337
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,620
One question. I really must get going...

338
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,664
Hey, hey!

339
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,916
The Mafia was picked totally at random.

340
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,210
So don't you go misunderstanding.

341
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,005
Excluding these two here,

342
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,550
let's try to point out
who you think is the Mafia.

343
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,552
Her.

344
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,887
And the grounds for your decision?

345
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,891
She looks like
she'd be really good at lying!

346
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,226
Huh? You...

347
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,894
You think I...

348
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,315
I wonder. Your MBTI type?

349
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,528
- What?
- Oh, no, wait.

350
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,615
Let me have a guess. Uh...

351
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,242
INFJ.

352
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,493
Am I right?

353
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,999
Yes, that's it.

354
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,044
INFJs are so damned untrustworthy.

355
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,796
Or, to put it like this, uh...

356
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,341
Shitty little liars, yeah?

357
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,093
Do you hear what I'm sayin'?

358
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:21,973
You pretend to be a normal person
and to be considerate of others,

359
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:26,186
and on the inside,
you're judging everyone.

360
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,855
And always criticizing people.
I hate you guys!

361
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:29,939
Uh...

362
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,108
Say... I what?

363
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,570
And how about the shit you were saying
when we were outside earlier?

364
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,531
The shit about how we were <i>otakus.</i>

365
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,909
Oh...

366
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,705
I... I really didn't say such things...

367
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,208
And it looks to me
like you have a boyfriend too.

368
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,793
The poor little sucker.

369
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,587
I bet that soon, he'll get ditched.

370
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,636
What is it you're up to?

371
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,932
Oh, how I hate you.

372
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,188
Why's she like that
all of a sudden?

373
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,111
- Where are you going?
- What the hell?

374
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,989
What the hell's wrong with her?
What a bitch.

375
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,573
What the hell?

376
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,588
Oh! Oh shit!

377
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,717
Hold on! I need to ask you something!

378
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,009
Just wait up a minute!

379
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,971
Don't go!

380
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,807
So who was the Mafia?

381
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,020
Ah, no!

382
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,650
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait a second. Wait.

383
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,944
- Wh... what was that person's nickname?
- Who?

384
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,446
- That girl.
- Ah, that's Moonhole.

385
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,947
Are you telling me that's Moonhole?

386
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,783
We're going to play LoL.
Wanna come with us? A team of four?

387
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,786
That's if you could stand
the smell of dirty <i>otakus.</i>

388
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,871
Petite...

389
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:11,040
- Or whatever. See you later.
- No socializing outside the meeting.

390
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,041
MR. EOM

391
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,605
<i>The meeting starts
in 15 minutes. You're on your way?</i>

392
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,230
<i>- You can't be late.</i>
- I'm first.

393
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,006
Run!

394
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,631
Oh, yeah!

<i>The green light is on.
You may now cross.</i>

00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,722
Ah, damn it!

398
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,572
Oh!

399
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,575
Shit!

400

Ah, shit.

401
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,836
Ugh!

MR. EOM

403
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,688
Hello, Mr. Eom.

404
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,900
Uh... I, uh...

405
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,863
I'm having kind of an emergency right now.

406
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,781
I'm so sorry.

407
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,708
If I take a taxi now,
it'll take 20 minutes...

408
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,913
No, it'll take me ten minutes
to get there yes. I'm sorry.

409
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,656
- Did you see the message I left you?
- Damn it!

410
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,911
I'm telling you that
I posted a message on your site today!

411
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,790
I wouldn't know.
I haven't logged in lately.

412
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,583
Now move!

413
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,421
Sorry, I can't. Time's up for me,
so I'm just going to ask.

414
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,674
Ah! Ow! What the...

415
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,424
What is this?

416
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,052
How'd you get this?

417
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,472
Where did you get it?

418
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,641
You didn't draw this by yourself, did you?

419
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,643
Are you some kind of idiot?

420
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,104
- Uh, no...
- You were the one who drew it.

You don't recall it? Remember me?

424
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,871
I'm gonna tell everything!

425
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,248
I will!

426
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,342
Amazing.

427
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,805
- So amazing!
- Yeah.

428
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,145
Now it's ours.
We mustn't tell anyone about it.

429
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,773
Yeah. And we'll use this place
for drinking alcohol, right?

430
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,818
We shouldn't use it like that.
We've found an observatory.

431
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,446
- Whatever.
- It's a place for observing stars.

432
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,655
And natural phenomena.

433
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,699

00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,452
<i>So after that,
I didn't hang out with her much.</i>

473
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:07,165
<i>It was the first time in a long time.
But why the Unicorns?</i>

474
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,750
<i>Unicorn Aliens.</i>

475
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,210
Unicorns.

476
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,294
What?

477
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,090
The Unicorns.

478
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,091
<i>All right.</i>

479
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,135
It's not like there was nothing gained.

480
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,388
You figured out an essential element.
The damn Unicorns.

481
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,183
Anyway, you're pretty amazing
in a way, huh?

482
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,853
- The first person I've ever encountered...
- Unicorns!

483
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,938
...capable of comprehending their symbols.

484
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,691
Unicorns! Unicorns!

485
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,027
Poor girl. Who the fuck you speaking to?

486
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,863
Yes, Mr. Eom.

487
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Yes, sir.

488
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,619
Yes. Yes.

489
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,748
- Ms. Hong.
- Yes...

490
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:50,916
Director.

491
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,962
It takes some nerve to keep
your client waiting for nearly an hour.

492
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,132
I will assume the liability for this
in any way possible.

493
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:02,178
Liability? And how?

494
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,101
The thing about liability is

495
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,939
that only those who have responsibility
can assume liability!

496
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,691
Are you in such a position now?
You are not!

497
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,693
Then who must assume it?

498
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,654
I do! I must assume it!

499
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,365
You know...

500
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,950
DIRECTOR KWON YOUNG-WOONG

501
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,202
I really liked the way you worked.

502
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:30,206
You never missed work, you're firm-handed
and don't act like today's kids.

503
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,252
I never thought you'd drag your private
affairs into your work station.

504
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,675
I hear you broke up
with your boyfriend not so long ago.

505
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,680
<i>Where in the world
did he hear that from?</i>

506
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,777
Hmm.

507
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,362
Banished to the doghouse?

508
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,489
<i>It was definitely Oh Sehee.</i>

509
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,615
It had to be her.

510
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,826
Can't be another person.

511
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:09,704
You don't know that.
It could have been your father.

512
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,787
Oh!

513
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,497
You know...

514
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,961
I mean, I wonder where that bastard went.
And why he doesn't call any more.

515
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,671
That bastard? Which bastard?

516
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,465
Who else but Siguk?

517
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,426
Oh. So...

518
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,223
- Didn't I tell you?
- Hey, now...

519
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,018
Did you forget to tell me something again?

520
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,542
Gah...

521
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,883
Oh!

522
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,511
Who are you?

523
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,388
- Did you come for the open house?
- What?

524
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,475
Ah, did you have an appointment with me?

525
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,319
- It's just that I'm a little busy.
- What's this about an open house?

526
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,608
Hey, where are you going?

527
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,333
- Where is everything?
- What do you mean?

528
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:41,170
Okay, where's the occupant
and all the stuff that was in here?

529
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,048
The tenant just packed up his things
and left.

530
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,674
- When?
- Uh...

531
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,843
Two days ago.

532
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,179
And did you actually see him in person?

533
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,532
No, but who are you? Why the questions?

534
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,724
KIM BYUNGJO

535
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,244
- Do you know the previous tenant?
- Is there a problem?

536
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,145
- Something wrong?
- No. Don't worry.

537
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,068
- Hello?
<i>- Yes, Ms. Hong.</i>

538
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,694
<i>This is Officer Kim Byungjo.</i>

539
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,739
<i>We received Mr. Lee Siguk's
bank account details.</i>

540
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,663
There's returns from the moving company,
a deposit from a used car shop.

541
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,037
The most recent transaction
was made at 4:20 a.m. to Sky Air.

542
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,539
That one's a payment for a flight.

543
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,498
TRANSACTION
SKY AIR

544
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,708
<i>I don't know the destination,
but based on the price,</i>

545
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,253
<i>I think he went somewhere overseas.</i>

546
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,462
<i>I would guess.</i>

547
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,759
<i>Hello? Hello, Ms. Hong? Are you listening?</i>

548
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,804
<i>Ms. Hong. Hello?</i>

549
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,035
Ms. Hong, let's go for a smoke.

550
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,956
Ms. Oh. Ms. Hong, where is she?

551
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,168
Ah, she took vacation leave.

552
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,879
Wow. A vacation leave?

553
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,422
She must be really ill.

554
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,217
She's not ill, she's heartbroken.

555
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:55,930
- Heartbroken? What are you talking about?
- You didn't hear the news?

556
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,850
- No, what is it?
- It's about Jihyo's boyfriend.

557
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,061
What happened?

558
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,301
<i>I've been giving you space
for years.</i>

559
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,138
Where's my space in all this?

560
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,942
Hmm?

561
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,520
Oh.

562
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,566
Oh.

563
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,419
Huh?

564
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,880
Whoa.

565
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,717
Huh...

566
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,658
Huh...

567
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,123
What... What is all this?

568
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,764
Wait...

569
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,100
Wait. Help me!
