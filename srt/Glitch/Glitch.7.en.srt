1
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,682
Mmph.

2
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:20,770
Hmm?

3
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,815
Oh!

4
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,293
<i>Tell me, do you have
someone that you can really trust?</i>

5
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,128
Bora! Over here!

6
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,884
<i>- Someone you can open up to?</i>
- Jihyo, what are you doing?

7
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:55,597
<i>Someone you can reveal
your deepest, darkest secrets to?</i>

8
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,558
<i>Do you have someone like that?</i>

9
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,061
I thought for sure
I'd get captured and killed.

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,649
Or that I would be...
just dragged away by them.

11
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,568
Like Siguk.

12
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,154
So then, what happened after that?

13
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,493
I don't know.

14
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,205
I don't really remember
what happened after that.

15
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,376
I don't get it.
How did I come back unharmed?

16
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,298
Well, it's great that,
uh, you came back safe.

17
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,344
No, it's really not.
I came back without achieving anything.

18
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,012
But is that really it?

19
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,057
What?

20
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,018
I mean the reason
that you went all the way over there<i>.</i>

21
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,782
Was it really just to save your boyfriend?

22
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,023
- There was no other reason?
- I mean, why else would I go?

23
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,733
Didn't you go there to find something?

24
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,528
For example, some sort of evidence,
or an answer of some kind?

25
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,488
If that's not it, maybe a memory?

26
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,492
What kind of memory is it?

27
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,744
Tell me, when is the memory from?

28
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,412
When I was in middle school.

29
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:02,997
From middle school?

30
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,290
MA HYUNGWOO

31
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,751
The location?

32
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,549
A field of reeds.

33
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,717
- A field of reeds.
- Yeah.

34
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,345
That's the place I would go to meet Bora.

35
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,764
Field of reeds. Bora.

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,569
So...

37
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,820
What's wrong?

38
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,951
Oh...

39
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,579
Nothing. It's nothing.

40
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,329
Okay.

41
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,334
Now really try to remember
what happened that day, okay?

42
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,337
In middle school, in the field of reeds.

43
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,089
What happened there?

44
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,430
- Well, um...
- What happened there?

45
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,143
Quickly, tell me.

46
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,397
<i>What happened there?</i>

47
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,483
<i>In middle school... in middle school...</i>

48
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,777
<i>Middle school. Middle school. School.</i>

49
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,363
<i>- In a field of reeds.
- Field of reeds. Field of reeds.</i>

50
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,885
<i>- What happened there? What happened there?
- What happened there? What happened there?</i>

51
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,869
<i>In middle school, in a field of reeds.
Tell me.</i>

52
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,747
<i>In middle school. What happened there,
happened there, happened there?</i>

53
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,498
<i>In the field of reeds?</i>

54
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,459
Do you think you can remember?

55
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,670
Um...

56
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,254
What?

57
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,382
No, it's, um...

58
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,552
What happened? Why aren't you going?

59
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,222
I'm sorry. The... the screen suddenly...

60
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,891
What's wrong with it?

61
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,452
Abigail!

62
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,667
- Grab her! Hold still!
- What's happening? What are you doing?

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,003
- Come here. Grab her! Come on!
- Who are you? Let me go! Who are you?

64
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,588
- Abigail!
- Let go!

65
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,801
No! Stop! Let me go!

66
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,388
Stop! Aaah!

67
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,515
Let me go! Fuck!

68
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,226
- I'm sorry, your Holiness.
- Let go!

69
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,910
So it was at night three days
ago when you last talked to her.

70
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,079
Did she say anything in particular?

71
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,642
You know, like about what she might
be doing or where she might have gone?

72
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,894
She said she was going
on a business trip, then went out.

73
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,753
A trip? Um, to... to where, about?

74
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,381
It really doesn't matter what she said.

75
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,716
It's all just a lie.

76
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,800
I...

77
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,135
I looked into it.

78
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,762
God, I thought she was
on her way to go see you.

79
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,930
That wasn't the case.

80
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,681
No.

81
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,977
Okay, so do you know of any place
that she might be?

82
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,812
She went to find Siguk, that little shit.

83
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,356
Oh, honey,
don't be ridiculous.

84
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,858
What's ridiculous about it?

85
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,404
They were head over heels in love
with each other for over four years.

86
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,990
You really think she'd pack
so little if she left the country?

87
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,160
That'd be completely
out of character for her.

88
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,596
- There's definitely something wrong.
- Oh my God.

89
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,664
You know so little
about your own daughter.

90
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,874
Ah!

91
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,627
Ju... ju... just a second. I... So sorry.

92
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,921
This is Detective Kim Byungjo.

93
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,051
Really? He says they've
got her credit card details.

94
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,552
Ah... ah, yes, but when?

95
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,305
Two days ago. But where was it used?

96
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,433
Wh... which tollgate?

97
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,685
Jeonju?

98
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,312
- Jeonju?
- Sorry?

99
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,440
Uh...

100
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,608
Who's "Joe"?

101
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,526
<i>No! Not Joe.</i>

102
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,987
Job. Job! Job, like the Bible.

103
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,365
Okay, so what's with his name?
And who is he?

104
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,618
He's the pastor of that one cult.
They call him Moon Hyungtae.

105
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,913
I think those people
call him Job among themselves.

106
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:12,914
<i>You know what?</i>

107
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,601
<i>The more I thought about the church,
the more suspicious it seemed.</i>

108
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,001
<i>So I did some research on it.</i>

109
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,962
<i>And when I did, do you know where
I saw this man's name come up?</i>

110
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,130
Where did it come up?

111
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,216
- The register.
<i>- The register?</i>

112
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,219
Yes, the register of the hospital
where the suicide case took place<i>.</i>

113
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,888
The current owner of that building
is this person<i>.</i>

114
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:33,976
You see, the transfer of ownership
happened after that cop lady got let go.

115
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,479
Oh my God. I bet that is why
she had absolutely no idea

116
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,439
about this obvious connection!

117
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,277
Wait, is that the psychiatric hospital...

118
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,780
in Jeonju?

119
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,583
COME IN

120
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,599
SISTER JUNG:
THIS IS THE WORD OF THE MESSIAH

121
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,671
SISTER KIM: SENT A PICTURE

122
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,395
SISTER YANG:
THE MESSIAH IS TRULY THE LIGHT

123
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,479
SISTER JUNG: SELLA...

124
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,369
<i>The person you have dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a message.</i>

125
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,875
Hello, Chanwoo<i>.</i>

126
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,502
This is Hwajung Seo<i>.</i>

127
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,671
Now you're the President,
you must be busy.

128
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,840
Why haven't you been answering my calls?

129
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,550
I was just wondering...

130
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,553
if by any chance
you have some free time.

131
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,848
Maybe we can catch up over lunch
or something, It's been a while.

132
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,602
Oh damn.
You know, recently, I've been really down.

133
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,562
Ugh!

134
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,899
Anyway, if you get this,
call me back, please.

135
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,193
All right. Bye.

136
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,458
Let go of me!

137
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,753
Oh!

138
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:11,968
Shit.

139
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,468
Fuck!

140
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,641
Bo... Bora.

141
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,892
Just calm down.

142
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:21,978
Come on.

143
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,979
Give it.

144
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,023
Give it. Come on.

145
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,441
Give it here.

146
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,370
Ah, fuck!

147
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,042
Piece of crap!

148
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,086
What are you doing right now? Huh?

149
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,837
You crazy?

150
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,633
Wha... what were you gonna do, huh?
Try to kill her?

151
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,011
Would this even kill her? Ugh!

152
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,763
Where now? Huh?

153
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,391
Fuck, where are you going?

154
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,102
Are you really planning
to capture and torture Sister Seo?

155
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,354
Come on, you know
that won't solve anything.

156
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,859
For now, we just need
to sit back and watch.

157
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,486
Do you really think I'm like you?

158
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,032
Ugh. I know your friend won't die.

159
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,827
- And how would you even fucking know that?
- I just do. Okay?

160
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,039
They can't ever kill Jihyo.

161
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,961
Oh, really? Why not?
Why can't they kill her?

162
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,798
The Messiah.

163
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,883
What?

164
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,802
Hong Jihyo is... the Messiah.

165
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,544
Stay there a little longer.

166
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,654
You're probably still a little dizzy.

167
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,879
I'm sorry we had to bind your wrists.

168
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,173
It couldn't be helped.

169
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,884
You were being so threatening.

170
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,260
Why are you doing this?

171
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,055
Tell me who you are?

172
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,057
Jihyo.

173
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,728
I know that you're a bit surprised.

174
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,564
But if you can try to calm down,
because I'd...

175
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:35,152
Well, I'd like to explain
this whole situation we find ourselves in.

176
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,738
Tell me where Siguk is.

177
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,783
Um... Wait, you mean your boyfriend?

178
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,702
Where is he?

179
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,495
Listen, I know you guys took him.

180
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,581
Would you believe me
if I said it wasn't us?

181
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,417
Tell me where Siguk is right now!

182
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,586
This isn't good.

183
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,381
If you keep acting like this,
we can't have a conversation.

184
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,508
I'm not interested in a conversation.

185
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:01,053
Then could you just
answer my questions?

186
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,848
- They're very simple questions.
- No. I don't think so.

187
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,933
- Bring Siguk right...
- It's not an illusion.

188
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,106
You know that strange...
figure that you sometimes see?

189
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,401
I'm telling you, it's not an illusion.

190
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,528
It's something very real.

191
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,612
What?

192
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,411
Simply put, they're like a GPS, you see.

193
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,664
It's real. They led you here to us,
don't you see?

194
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,751
They work like a homing device.

195
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,421
Uh, no. No. Wait, wait.
So that's... that's...

196
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,382
Jihyo, you've had multiple experiences

197
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,887
with electronic devices malfunctioning
for no reason, isn't that true?

198
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:48,976
<i>Aren't you curious?</i>

199
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:53,773
Curious about why these strange
things keep happening to you?

200
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,693
Yes.

201
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,284
- Wait, wait. Hold on, don't go!
- Yes, yes, yes. Yeah.

202
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,455
- Wait just a second. Just tell me again.
- Uh... I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

203
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,373
Wait! No! Tell me what you mean!

204
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,043
Wait, what? Wait!
It's not a hallucination?

205
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,797
What...

206
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,382
What is it, if it's not a hallucination?

207
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,847
A Messiah?

208
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,017
- Wait, Jihyo is?
- That's what they're saying.

209
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,062
I have no clue what's going on.
God damn it, this is giving me a headache.

210
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,481
Wait, so then what will happen to Jihyo?

211
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,192
I don't know, but they probably
won't harm her,

212
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,152
because they think she's their Messiah.

213
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,153
"Probably"?

214
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,404
But are you sure they won't?

215
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,449
How am I supposed to know what
those lunatics are really thinking?

216
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,495
That's all the information
I was able to get from Sister Seo.

217
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,414
And only a few people from the church
know about this for now.

218
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,838
Anyway, what I'm saying is that
you should be more careful, huh?

219
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,674
It'll just get more dangerous
if you try to push too fast.

220
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,343
Fortunately, though,
she's not in imminent danger.

221
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,979
Now I get it.

222
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,566
You see, you wasted four years
because you have that kind of attitude.

223
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,068
Because it wasn't urgent for you.

224
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,820
Because you needed to be careful.

225
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,657
Unlike you, I don't have time
to waste all that time.

226
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,740
How do you know?

227
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,910
Because this is all my fault.

228
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,290
It's all my fault

229
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,377
that this happened to Jihyo.

230
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,173
You should just go home.

231
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,552
There's nothing that either
one of us can do right now.

232
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,510
<i>How am I supposed to know
what those lunatics are really thinking?</i>

233
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,938
<i>- That's all I got from Sister Seo.</i>
- Fuck.

234
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,108
<i>And only a few people from the church
know about this, for now.</i>

235
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,115
Don't try so hard.

236
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,284
Everything's already been uploaded
to the cloud.

237
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,454
You should have been more careful, huh?

238
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,582
Listen, If you don't do exactly as I say,

239
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,025
your little church buddies will be
very disappointed in you.

240
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,545
We are going to rescue Jihyo together.

241
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,839
DON'T DRIVE STRAIGHT

242
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,050
Pure in flesh and in spirit.

243
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,719
You are the Light in the darkness.

244
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,138
May your Light be used...

245
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,683
<i>Jihyo, do you want me
to tell you an old story?</i>

246
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,062
<i>Believe it or not,
there once was a woman just like you.</i>

247
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,148
<i>Everyone pointed fingers at her
and called her crazy.</i>

248
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,987
<i>Just like you, she saw things
that others could not see.</i>

249
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,531
<i>Eventually, she could even hear things.</i>

250
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,118
<i>And then one day,
she began to write down...</i>

251
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,536
THE WORD OF LIGHT

252
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,498
<i>...all the things that she saw and heard.</i>

253
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,626
<i>Word by word, she wrote everything.</i>

254
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,586
<i>And she never, ever gave up.</i>

255
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,188
<i>And she never doubted herself,</i>

256
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,316
<i>nor the things she heard and saw.</i>

257
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,569
<i>Even until the very end.</i>

258
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,158
<i>And everyone came to know
that she was not crazy.</i>

259
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,829
We will escape from this prison...

260
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,667
And this is all of her writings organized.

261
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,005
While we were at it, we changed it
slightly, making it easier to understand.

262
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,425
And it eventually
became a religion.

263
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,342
Who...

264
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,094
who is that person?

265
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,806
I'm sure that you've met her before.

266
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,891
You came into our house before, right?

267
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,729
You saw everything there.
The prophecies made by my wife.

268
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,022
Back Yoonsun?

269
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,105
Mm-hm.

270
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,486
She was a special case among those
who came in contact with them.

271
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,947
You see, she's just like you.

272
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,866
Wait, what do you mean, contact?

273
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:21,623
You don't remember what happened
in the field of reeds, do you?

274
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,793
You don't remember exactly what happened.

275
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,339
It was probably then.

276
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,342
The time you came in contact with them.

277
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,053
Wha... what do you mean, them?

278
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:41,435
Photon-informed aggregation system.

279
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,897
People usually

280
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,649
just call all of them aliens.

281
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,735
What?

282
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,572
You don't need to be so surprised.
It's actually pretty common.

283
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,785
It's just that no one remembers
their encounters with aliens.

284
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,246
Uh, wait just a second.

285
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,125
Wait, aliens?

286
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,585
Is that what you mean?

287
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,254
That never happened to me. I just...

288
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,839
Yeah, back then, I just...

289
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,382
I just sniffed glue. Yeah.

290
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,884
Just some glue.

291
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,055
CHAMISUL

292
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,933
No.

293
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,269
I just sniffed glue.

294
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,105
What is it?

295
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,649
- Do you not remember very well?
- It's not... Huh?

296
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,942
Just that moment?

297
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,151
Jihyo.

298
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,654
You know.

299
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,699
You came here in order to remember that.

300
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:42,079
Those aliens want you
to remember what happened.

301
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:46,500
What are you talking about, huh?
I... I... I just came here to find Siguk!

302
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,668
No, you didn't!

303
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,630
You yourself know that that's not true.

304
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,881
What... what are...

305
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,803
Did you really come all the way back
and risk your life to find a man?

306
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,972
A man you don't even love?

307
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,058
So, then, what are you going to do?

308
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,728
You going to marry him, have a baby,
and live happily ever after?

309
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,773
Do you really think
that's what your mission is?

310
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,525
To live such a petty life?

311
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,366
What mission is that?

312
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,286
What in the world do you want me to do?

313
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:26,456
You must retrieve your memory.

314
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,880
Every single thing you saw and heard
in the field of reeds in middle school.

315
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,298
Everything!

316
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,591
I can help you.

317
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,387
Only once you remember
will you be able to help the others.

318
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,472
Aah!

319
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,768
So tell me the truth.

320
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,623
What does everything you're telling me
have to do with you? Huh?

321
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,858
It has to do with all of us.

322
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,571
Jihyo! Whatever's in your memory...

323
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,283
that...

324
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,995
that will bring salvation to us all.

325
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,788
What do you mean?

326
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,211
Salvation?

327
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,547
- Chanwoo.
- Ah, yes?

328
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,090
You know Longinus, right?

329
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,302
They called him Longinus the Centurion?

330
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,845
The one from Mother's book.

331
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,431
Ah, yes, yes of course.
I know about him.

332
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,766
You know what?

333
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,268
I think, out of all the prophecies
in her book,

334
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,354
his story has to be
my favorite story I read.

335
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,941
When the Messiah is, you know,
wandering alone in the wilderness,

336
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:37,945
Longinus is the one who sends
an army to bring back the Messiah.

337
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,491
It's the very last part
of the book, right? The highlight, no?

338
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,575
Yes, that's right.

339
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,620
I just think that it's so wonderful,
don't you?

340
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,248
<i>Sella.</i>

341
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,583
<i>Sella.</i>

342
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,044
But why did you bring that up?

343
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,421
The thing is...

344
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,134
It's crazy, but I once thought
that I could be Longinus.

345
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,679
- What are you saying?
- It's funny.

346
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,848
Gosh, it's just...

347
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,519
I was under that undeserved
delusion for a while.

348
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,607
Whew, seriously, I don't know
why I feel like this.

349
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,654
Such a great thing has happened.
I should be happy about it.

350
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,241
You know, she came and found me
at my first real estate agency.

351
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,327
<i>But of course, I didn't recognize her.</i>

352
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,498
<i>She probably doesn't even care about
someone as insignificant as me, does she?</i>

353
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,709
All Hwajung Seo will ever be

354
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,961
is the one who cuts apples for Mother.

355
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,929
- And why don't you try meeting her?
- Who?

356
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,389
Holy Mother.

357
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,476
You mean meet with her?

358
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,145
Me?

359
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,649
<i>Go and see her.
Uh... talk to her.</i>

360
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,736
In other words, uh,
you could be friends with her.

361
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,199
I'll go with you if it's too difficult.

362
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,120
You're crazy! Crazy!

363
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,789
What if Father finds out?
He'll be furious!

364
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,583
We won't get caught.

365
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,710
You think so?

366
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,005
Well, you know, Father isn't there
all hours of the day.

367
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,007
That's true.

368
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,762
And everyone who works there,
they're all your people.

369
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,307
You... you're... you're right.

370
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,769
"The events of the future
will not be recorded further."

371
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,938
"For the one who comes after
will be the one to show you."

372
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,735
History after the Messiah will be made
by our own hands from here on.

373
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,822
Whether you catch her attention
or not will be up to you.

374
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,869
<i>Chanwoo, if it wasn't for you,
how would I have kept attending church?</i>

375
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,922
<i>Do you actually remember
what happened?</i>

376
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,050
Do you remember anything?

377
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,177
No, I was completely unconscious by then.

378
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,102
Jihyo. Miss Hong.

379
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,064
You should sleep lying down.
Why are you sitting up?

380
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:25,112
So tell me, did you think at all
about what we talked about?

381
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,118
Try it.

382
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,703
What?

383
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,748
Let's try it.

384
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,333
I don't know what it is,

385
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,836
but try retrieving my memory.

386
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,298
You made a wise decision.

387
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:50,262
Yes, there's no need to think
it's something too complicated.

388
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,931
It's basically the same
as regular hypnotherapy.

389
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,685
This VR will just
help you immerse yourself.

390
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,478
Try it.

391
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,731
Ah.

392
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,278
Okay.

393
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:15,370
There. I know that I'm nothing
compared to your therapist,

394
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:20,459
but think of it
as a very sacred session with him.

395
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,004
Yeah. It's important for us to build
a trust between the two of us.

396
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,986
Ah.
We can't continue like this.

397
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,738
She's resisting too much.

398
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,787
Should I... surgically take out the chip?

399
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,788
Do it.

400
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,542
It could possibly
result in nerve damage.

401
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,293
Discard her after surgery.

402
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,045
We don't need the body.

403
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,131
But are you sure that's okay?
The believers might disagree with you.

404
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,635
Oh, don't mind them.

405
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,720
Messiahs are usually...

406
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,392
all... martyred eventually.

407
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,020
Then I'll start getting things ready.

408
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,533
You've been through so much hardship.

409
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,994
Don't worry, it's almost over now.

410
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,886
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

411
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,687
Why'd we stop? Are we there?

412
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,563
Come out.

413
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,570
- Where the hell are we?
- Downtown Jeonju. Get out and wait here.

414
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,615
I'm supposed to meet Sister Seo
and go in with her.

415
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,284
Hey, I told you I'm going too.
I can just stay hidden in here.

416
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,745
Please just cut out the nonsense
and come out of the car!

417
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,164
Everyone there already knows your face.

418
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,631
We're not rescuing her today.
I'll be back after collecting information.

419
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,129
Fuck, there you go again,
being frustrating.

420
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,547
Then what do I do here?

421
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,299
I can't just do nothing.

422
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,968
Please stop trying
to do everything by yourself.

423
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,722
I get scared to death every time
you do something crazy.

424
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Wait.

425
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,666
MOTORCYCLE RENTALS

426
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,756
- Are we in the right place?
- I'm wondering.

427
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,343
Ah, I mean seriously, is there even
a hospital here? Where the hell are we?

428
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:44,097
Uh, so... are all men
enemies of the GPS lady?

429
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,598
Why don't you ever listen to her?

430
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:49,018
Ugh, will you ever stop nagging me,
please? I'm really begging you!

431
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,646
Why did you come with me?
I told you to go to work.

432
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,066
You really think I could go to work
in a situation like this?

433
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,406
How close are you with Jihyo, anyway?

434
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,825
What? I already told you.

435
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,678
- We're like soulmates...
- Oh, sure, soulmates.

436
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,287
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I get that.

437
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,914
But do friends really have
to go this far for each other?

438
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,583
You even took off work for her.

439
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,753
You must have never heard
the meaning of the word "loyal."

440
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,423
No, it's not an issue of loyalty.

441
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,674
- I'm loyal too.
- Huh?

442
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:21,801
- Look!
- Wait, what?

443
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,220
Right there. Isn't that it?

444
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,639
What? Is that a hospital?

445
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,558
It looks more like a prison.

446
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:33,938
Hello.

447
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,357
We're currently restricting
entry for visitors.

448
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,320
- Please turn around and leave, thank you.
- Thanks, I'm a police officer. Yeah.

449
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,158
Oh, I'd like to ask a few things
regarding the case I'm investigating.

450
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,327
So, may I visit the hospital today?

451
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,745
I'm sorry, but...

452
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,706
what case are you talking about, sir?

453
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,295
Uh, well...

454
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,007
Well...

455
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,342
An assault case, actually.

456
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:03,927
- What?
- What?

457
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,973
You know about the brutal assault and
mugging that happened in the town, right?

458
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,657
One witness claims a patient
from this hospital was the assailant.

459
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,354
They said it was someone
who recently escaped from here.

460
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,939
They mugged the victim and ran.

461
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,817
A... a mugging?

462
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,610
An escapee?

463
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,071
- But there's no way patients can escape...
- Oh, we know.

464
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,322
It's probably not true.

465
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,907
You're probably doing a great job.

466
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,160
But we still need to follow
the procedures and check things out.

467
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,662
Don't worry, we'll be quick.

00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,045
This is security team two.

470
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,506
The police are here.

471
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,008
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

472
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,138
- Joseph!
- Huh? Sister Seo?

473
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,641
You've been working so hard.

474
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,727
Oh. How long has it been?

475
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,730
Sister Seo, what made
you want to come here today?

476
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,315
Ah.

477
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,862
You know what they say.
Work and faith are all powered by food.

478
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,239
Uh... What is this?

479
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,492
Kimchi? Vegetables?

480
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,452
Ah, right.

481
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,329
I should introduce you guys. Chanwoo.

482
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,415
Oh, wait, no. Sorry. President Kim.

483
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,666
Yes.

484
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,753
This is President Chanwoo Kim.
He actually just recently joined.

485
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,547
And this is Brother Joseph.

486
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,969
Light be with you.

487
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,804
Ah, yes.

488
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,431
Light be with you.

489
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,479
But, tell me, Sister,
what brings you back here again?

490
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,733
I just came to see her face.

491
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,904
The person in there.

492
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:46,987
Ah.

493
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,949
But wait a minute, did the elders
give their approval of this?

494
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,033
Hey!

495
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,745
- Don't be like that.
- Ah, but what if I get caught?

496
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,914
You won't.
Father isn't even here right now.

497
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,667
Besides, I'll go in quietly,
and quietly leave!

498
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,170
Come on, please let me
see her face just one time.

499
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,672
We wanna be able
to experience her grace too.

500
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:10,428
Fine. My shift is 40 minutes.
You get five minutes with her.

501
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,514
Oh... Come on, a bit longer.

502
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,184
Fine, ten minutes.

503
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:20,271
You can't tell anyone about this, Sister.

504
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,369
- Uh, wait.
- Hm?

505
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,329
Only one person can visit at a time.

506
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,667
- Wait a minute, who made that rule?
- Only one person.

507
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,670
But we traveled all the way here
to experience this.

508
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,588
No, it's... it's fine, Sister.

509
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,172
You go in.

510
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,674
Really?

511
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,053
I'll just wait here for you.

512
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,136
Oh!

513
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,805
Good luck!

514
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,975
Thank you!

515
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,561
I can do it!

516
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,818
NEW HOPE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

517
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,988
You know, compared to the outside,
the inside seems pretty normal.

518
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,323
Yeah, I thought there would be,
you know,

519
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,785
people smashing their heads against
the walls and screaming and stuff, right?

520
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,412
Ms. Oh.

521
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,748
Listen, please don't ever do that again.

522
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,167
What? What did I do?

523
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,503
You lied to the security guard earlier.

524
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:30,633
You'll ruin your life if you get convicted
for posing as a public official. Okay?

525
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,177
Yeah, but we got inside
because I did that, right?

526
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,639
So... it was good that I came with you, hm?

527
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,769
- Excuse me. Are you the police officers?
- Ah, yes.

528
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,064
The security guards let me know you were
here. May I ask what brought you here?

529
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:48,401
Thank you so much. Well,
I'm actually looking for the chairman.

530
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,528
Is there a person here
by the name of Moon Hyungtae?

531
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,822
I'm so sorry,
but he's not here at the moment.

532
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,745
Is there a reason
you're trying to contact him?

533
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,035
Ah, yes. I had a few questions
I'd like to ask him,

534
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,454
but I don't have
his contact information.

535
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,873
But If you could give me his phone number?

536
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:05,126
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you
the chariman's personal phone number.

537
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,127
Have a nice day.

538
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,212
Ah, come on, listen,
it's just a phone numb...

539
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,673
- Excuse me. Do you know a Hong Jihyo?
- Hey!

540
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,719
Hong Jihyo. A woman, she's my same age.

541
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,262
Did she happen to come here?

542
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,785
- Hello?
- Not now.

543
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,515
- Ms. Oh.
- Here, I'll show you a photo.

544
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,184
Ms. Oh. What are you doing?

545
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,478
Here.

546
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,813
What is that creature?

547
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,942
- Is it too much?
- Is it too <i>much?</i>

548
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,694
Wait a moment, I have a different photo.

549
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,500
Oh my.

550
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,336
Oh my God.

551
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,296
You're going through so much,
your Holiness.

552
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,467
Bringing the world salvation,
it's not easy, is it?

553
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,594
It's not easy.

554
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,178
Thank you.

555
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,266
I don't know what to do.

556
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,525
- Hey there, Brother.
- Hello, President.

557
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,276
Ah, I'm sorry, but where's the lavatory?

558
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,821
Oh, the bathroom. It's this way.

559
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,239
Ah, okay. Thank you.

560
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,408
<i>Now I get it.</i>

561
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,995
You see, you wasted four years
because you have that kind of attitude.

562
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,747
Because it wasn't urgent for you.

563
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,499
Because you needed to be careful.

564
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,719
What did you do, Dad?

565
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,431
You didn't do anything.

566
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,476
Where were you? I needed you.

567
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,062
<i>When Grandma died,</i>

568
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,398
<i>what did you do?</i>

569
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,569
Tell me, why didn't you do anything?

570
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:04,036
Ahh. So I made this
for you all by myself,

571
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,122
with the freshest ingredients.

572
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:09,000
Please try to come to your senses
and have some.

573
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,334
Eat something, won't you?

574
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,920
Please.

575
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,214
I just don't get it.

576
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:19,302
How did such a young person like yourself
come to carry such a heavy burden?

577
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,099
Gosh, that scared me!

578
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,810
Hold on. Wait just a second.

579
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,689
What do you want? What?

580
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,524
What? I have to leave already?

581
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,488
Please, It's already
been more than ten minutes.

582
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,111
- If I get caught, huge trouble.
- Wait.

583
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,281
I just laid out all the food for her.
Just give us some more time.

584
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,533
Just let her enjoy a little meat. Come on!

585
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,370
She'll get really sick
if she only eats hospital food.

586
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,748
Huh?

587
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,675
Your Holi...

588
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,760
Aah! Ow!

589
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,679
- Shut up! Be quiet!
- My...

590
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,474
Don't say a word!

591
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,559
Don't hurt me.

592
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,153
Ms. Oh.

593
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,032
Please, for God's sake,
just be quiet when I'm talking.

594
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,493
I don't get it, why do you keep
butting in, huh?

595
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,037
Because it was frustrating
to watch you with her!

596
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,240
"Ah, I'm sorry, uh, but
could you give me his number?"

597
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,667
I thought you were trying to hit on her!

598
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,336
Wow! Do you have
any experience investigating? Huh?

599
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,337
No, you don't!

600
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,130
Wh... when did I hit on her?

601
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,359
- Show me proof.
- Why are you stuttering, then?

602
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,846
RESTRICTED AREA

603
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,522
What the...

604
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,192
Uh...

605
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,860
Oh, shit.

606
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,417
Come on.

607
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,055
Listen carefully. There are
volunteers all over the place.

608
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,601
What?

609
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,021
Mr. Kim?

610
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,107
You gotta get it together!

611
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,190
Yes! Yes, yes!

612
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,569
All right, listen carefully.

613
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,655
If you want to leave here,
you need to follow my instructions, okay?

614
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,282
Can you do that?

615
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,826
Mmm.

616
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:03,466
<i>This is the security office.
All personnel, report to the front desk.</i>

617
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,510
<i>I repeat. All personnel,
report to the front desk.</i>

618
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,181
- Hurry! Come on!
- Where are they?

619
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,724
- Let's go.
- Hurry, hurry.

620
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,807
Whoa...

621
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,611
I think she has...
Yeah. A knife. A knife to his throat.

622
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,904
Move!

623
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,032
Brothers and Sisters!

624
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,532
Out of the way!

625
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,577
Her... Holiness?

626
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,538
Her Holiness is absolutely infuriated!

627
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,539
Oh!

628
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,792
And I don't know the reason yet either.

629
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,586
- Go back.
- Wait, wait, wait.

630
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,300
- Oh, please don't kill me!
- No! Chanwoo!

631
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,469
- Huh?
- Cha... Chanwoo!

632
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,764
Tell me what's wrong!
What's wrong, Your Holiness? Oh!

633
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,642
Hey! Don't do anything!

634
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,686
Don't do anything ridiculous.
Don't do anything.

635
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,397
If there's even a single scratch...

636
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,649
- Step back!
- ...on Chanwoo's body, you're dead.

637
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,529
- Car. My car.
- Huh?

638
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,696
Car, my car.

639
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,573
- What?
- Car.

640
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,409
My car. My...

641
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:16,330
Her Holiness says...
says what she wants is my car!

642
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,456
- Huh?
- Car?

643
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,624
Give it to her!

644
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,459
Give it to her!

645
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,628
Uh, uh... Get it!

646
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,547
Bring it to the entrance!

647
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,758
It's an i40, 3991.

648
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,345
- 3991! i40!
- 3991. It's an i40!

649
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,097
3991, it's an i40!

650
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,099
3991!

651
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,934
3991, i40!

652
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,019
Yeah! 3991, yeah.

653
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,354
Do it quickly!

654
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,399
- What are you doing? Go, quickly!
- Get it, go!

655
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,818
- Do it now!
- Aah! Aah!

656
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,695
- Oh! Everybody, move!
- Aah!

657
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,657
Move! Move! Move!
You wanna get hurt? Get back!

658
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,242
Hey!

659
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,453
Aah!

660
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,873
- Aaaah!
- Get back! Back!

661
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,676
...hatred,
and direct us towards your Light!

662
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,209
- Oh! Chanwoo!
- Come back here!

663
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,587
I'm the experienced one in this field.

664
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,898
- I am. Got it? If you don't listen...
- Yeah, yeah.

665
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,482
- I'll kill him!
- Don't hurt him!

666
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,009
- Ah! Please.
- I'll kill him!

667
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,760
- Move! Move!
- Stop!

668
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,988
Huh?

669
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,474
Jihyo?

670
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,058
Drive! Drive!

671
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,769
Drive!

672
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,022
Aah! Aah!

673
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,985
Get them! Get them quickly!

674
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,823
Get them! Everyone!

675
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:38,037
- Ah! Look out! No! No! Look out!
- Hold on tight!

676
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,464
Oh! Jihyo!

677
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,636
DO NOT ENTER

678
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,600
- Get down!
- Oh!

679
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,351
Tell me.

680
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,229
Why are you doing all this?

681
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,364
- Hurry!
- She went that way. Come on.

682
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,615
Get 'em. Get 'em.

683
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,928
- Check the car.
- Yeah, right here.

684
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,161
- Where is she?
- Over here.

685
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,330
- Look inside. Is she in there?
- Where did they go?

686
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,957
Go up! Up this way. Do you see them?

687
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,520
- They can't have gone far.
- I'm a police officer! Stop! Stop!

688
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,752
Police?

689
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,715
Hold it there!

690
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:16,135
Police! I'm a police officer!
Police! Police.

691
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,554
Police, police. Coming through. Move.

692
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,766
Shit.

693
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,610
Yes, this is Kim Byungjo
from Geoan Station.

694
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,069
Some...

695
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,158
Someone has been kidnapped and has escaped
from the New Hope Psychiatric Hospital.

696
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,702
Please send backup here right away. Yeah.

697
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,372
Stay.

698
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,608
Hey. Split into two groups.
You go over there, you go over there.

699
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:13,734
- Yeah.
- Understood.

700
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,159
Security team one.

701
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,863
It's me.

702
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,660
Bora...

703
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,162
Bora.

704
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,552
NEWBEGINNINGS PEACE CORPS
DIVINE LIGHT CHURCH

705
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,784
Papa? Oh!

706
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,863
Shit, he's not answering again.

707
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,285
Hey, what's wrong with you? You okay?

708
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:33,165
- Bora, you need to hit me.
- Huh?

709
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,626
Just hit me once, and do it quickly.

710
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,003
- What the...
- Hit me!

711
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,715
- Hell, no! Why would I hit you?
- Why not?

712
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,177
I've hit you, you know, so you can
hit me back! I've hit you, just do it.

713
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,845
Just do what I say! Go on!

714
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,013
Aah!

715
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,101
Did it hurt?

716
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,452
Oh, Bora...

717
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:13,996
Oh, Bora!

718
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,628
I thought I was going to die!

719
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,049
Bora!

720
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:54,913
Does it fit?

721
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,706
Yeah.

722
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,541
Basically.

723
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,053
Does that hurt?

724
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,388
Huh?

725
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,516
No, not really.

726
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,060
So what is that from?

727
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,980
What the hell did they do to you there?

728
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,442
Bora.

729
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,155
There's somewhere I have to go right now.

730
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,594
You scared me!

731
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:51,720
What?

732
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,305
Sorry it's so late.

733
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,015
Is this him?

734
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:58,518
Who are you?

735
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,853
I'm Jihyo's friend.

736
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,106
Doc, can you do me a favor?

737
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,861
I want you to hypnotize me.

738
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,196
To get back my memory.

739
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,282
It's a really important memory.

740
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,451
You have to help me.

741
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,128
You're now floating.

742
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,048
You're now floating
throughout outer space...

743
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,636
You're very sleepy

744
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,721
and comfortable

745
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,266
in your own personal space.

746
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,605
So am I breathing okay?

747
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,650
Uh, well, I mean, you just are.

748
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,153
Am I wearing
some kind of spacesuit?

749
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,573
Just imagine what I'm saying. Huh?

750
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,657
Just imagine it.

751
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,410
Do you really know how to do this?

752
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,414
Now, on the count of three,

753
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,499
you will be able to see

754
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,251
a door appear in front of you.

755
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,336
All right, focus.

756
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,254
One.

757
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,340
Two.

758
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,967
Three.

759
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:15,636
Do you...

760
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,221
see the door?

761
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:19,890
Yes.

762
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,036
Beyond the door,

763
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,288
there is a memory that is waiting for you.

764
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,749
One you had forgotten a long time ago.

765
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,208
A very special memory.

766
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:50,714
Okay, on the count of three,
you will open that door.

767
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,298
<i>One.</i>

768
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,300
Two.

769
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,095
Three.

770
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:02,350
Did the... door open?

771
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,067
It won't open.

772
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,902
Look at the door again. Put your hand on...

773
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,487
- No...
- Open it.

774
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,406
It won't open at all.

775
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,787
Take a deep breath.
Take a slow, deep breath.

776
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,998
<i>Look at the door again,
and put your hand on...</i>

777
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,586
No, it...

778
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,589
it just won't budge at all.

779
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,556
But I don't really want to open it.

780
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,191
Jihyo. It's okay.

781
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,985
I'll be watching you here.

782
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,714
- Ahh. Relax.
- It tickles.

783
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,550
Ah, stop it.

784
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,094
- Stop what?
- Oh! Oh my God.

785
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,554
Okay. You like it?

786
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,307
It tickles.
