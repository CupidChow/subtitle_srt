1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,469
So, she looks like she's from Korea,
am I wrong?

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,096
God...

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:17,559
Those big eyes look like those
of a typical Korean beauty, right?

4
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,645
- Mmm.
- However, she looks so youthful.

5
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,355
I imagined she'd be older.

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,858
- Don't you think so?
- Come on!

7
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,944
When you think about it,
all saviors are young.

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,613
- Wasn't Jesus 33 years old?
- Mmm.

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,490
- The moment he died?
- Oh yeah!

10
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,218
- I think so. Yeah, that's true.
- Exactly!

11
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,995
Yeah, but since the average
lifespan is longer now,

12
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,248
aren't the 30s from now
very different from the 30s back then?

13
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:44,461
So today, Jesus would be around
until his 40s or 50s.

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,712
- Yes! Right?
- Mm-hm.

15
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,631
Or he could've just looked
young for his age. Hm?

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,592
- Yeah?
- I think so too. Yeah.

17
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,852
Aaaaah.

18
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:06,232
Anyway... where in the world
are we gonna find this girl?

19
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,547
Gosh... I don't get it.

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,112
Why didn't she draw a location
like she always does?

21
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,782
Why would she just draw
a portrait this time instead?

22
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,327
The prophecy is so specific
that it complicates it all, you know?

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,329
Mh-hm. I was thinking...

24
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:25,919
We have an issue. What are we going
to do about the other... Messiah candidates?

25
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,089
I mean, we already took them
to the hospital

26
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,633
and we also have experimented with them.

27
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,134
We've busted our...

28
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,678
Uh... we've been working hard.

29
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,432
If the Messiah was going to be revealed
to us so simply, then somebody explain.

30
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,702
- What have we been doing all this time?
- Listen.

31
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:45,897
We should consider it a joy every time we
face an opportunity to question our creed.

32
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:51,986
You know that the testing of our faith
certainly... leads to endurance.

33
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,615
For us, every single moment
brings a series of trials.

34
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,368
So we falter. We fear the worst.

35
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,370
We also mistrust.

36
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,163
No, Father. I'm very sorry.

37
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,458
I apologize, I didn't mean that.
I didn't question our faith.

38
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,087
Gambling is consuming, they say.

39
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,297
Believing is worse.

40
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,218
Putting faith into something fantastic...

41
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,346
it's nothing other than
true devotion and trust.

42
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,848
Don't you think?

43
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,226
If you think your faith is not real,

44
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,811
that's criminal judgment.

45
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,437
I'm sorry, sir.

46
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:32,569
We all are so shortsighted.
We all are, for sure.

47
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,574
Unless the Light
blesses us with its shine,

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,743
we're in the dark, completely blindfolded.

49
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,871
<i>Sella.</i>

50
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,997
<i>Sella.</i>

51
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,421
Aaaah.

52
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,787
Ah, Sister Seo.

53
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:29,709
Have you... happened to see
the album I left here?

54
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,379
- No, Father. I didn't see it.
- Oh.

55
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,633
It's all right. Please, go ahead. Hm?

56
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,984
Ah, yeah, Sister Seo.

57
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,778
I've just arrived at the church.

58
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,739
<i>So sorry, Chanwoo,
for making you... go back and forth.</i>

59
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,033
Oh no, it's okay.
What do you need, Sister?

60
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,534
<i>I just want to give you something.</i>

61
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,370
<i>- It's a little gift for you.</i>
- What?

62
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,497
Oh my God!

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,254
Aah! Ha-ha! The large cabinet
behind your desk, am I right?

64
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,672
All right!

65
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,298
Aah!

66
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,886
What is this?

67
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,180
Ah, well... shall I open it?

68
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,058
<i>Of course you should open it.
It's a gift, Chanwoo.</i>

69
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,141
Okay.

70
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,023
Wow!

71
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,651
Aah.

72
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,695
Whoa.

73
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,547
<i>Ta-daah!</i>

74
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,798
Have you opened it?

75
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,967
Do you like it?

76
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,970
<i>Chanwoo?</i>

77
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,680
<i>Are you there?</i>

78
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,764
Yeah, yeah.

79
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,932
<i>Chanwoo...</i>

80
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,476
<i>Can I ask you for a little favor?</i>

81
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,732
SISTER SEO HWAJUNG

82
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,651
Use your present
to bring this person to me.

83
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,946
Do not hurt her.
I need her unharmed, okay?

84
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,325
<i>But there's still more.
Bring her, and in return,</i>

85
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,286
<i>I will immediately sign you up
as NPC's President.</i>

86
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,624
Chanwoo. You've worked so hard to earn
you place in our very exclusive group.

87
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,710
<i>Chanwoo, listen carefully.</i>

88
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,046
<i>It's important.</i>

89
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,048
Please, I need this. No...

90
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,426
<i>We</i> need this, okay?

91
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,928
You and I<i>. </i>The elders can't do it<i>.</i>

92
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,306
You understand?

93
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,433
Yes.

94
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,376
CHEONAN

95
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,104
- Cap! A rest stop!
- We're not stopping.

96
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,315
- You can get a <i>bibimbap</i> in Jeonju.
- Come on!

97
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,300
- You have to refuel anyway.
- Actually, the tank is full.

98
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,405
- What was that noise?
- What's that smell?

99
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,324
- It's burning! Pull over!
- Whoa!

100
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,243
- What about the smoke?
- Pull over! It's gonna explode!

101
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,812
PAINT / MAINTENANCE

102
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,441
Uh...

103
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,029
- Oh, I see. The serpentine belt broke.
- Oh...

104
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,489
- Meaning what?
- Uh...

105
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,658
- Oh, but do we need it?
- Just a minute, guys...

106
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,410
And the antifreeze is very low.

107
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,079
Well, basically, this car's a mess.

108
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,581
And so how did you manage to get so far?

109
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,501
- So how long does the repair take, sir?
- Uh...

110
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,169
Grab some coffee and then come back.

111
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,171
20 cups will do.

112
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,093
Can we really find him before tomorrow?

113
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,678
- I mean your boyfriend.
- Huh?

114
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,222
Oh. I don't know.

115
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,558
And why did you two break up?

116
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,560
Uh...

117
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,604
How should I put this?

118
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,733
- Adult issues.
- Ugh!

119
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,946
A boyfriend who vanishes
in thin air right after you break up.

120
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,197
Convenient.

121
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,200
There is no need for reflection or regret.

122
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,828
That's what I call a clean breakup.

123
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,458
What?

124
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,876
Wha... wha... wha... what?

125
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,878
Phillip.

126
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:47,550
You're knowledgeable
about aliens and UFOs and stuff.

127
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,760
Oh, wow...

128
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,972
- Yeah.
- Well, then, let me ask you a question.

129
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,017
Well, you know if the people
who have been abducted...

130
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,353
ever come back or get released?

131
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,148
Like she did?

132
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,567
Yeah. Well, in general, they do return.

133
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,820
When? Years, months, weeks?
How long are they gone?

134
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,447
Usually doesn't take long.

135
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,909
Goes from few minutes
to even two or three days.

136
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,661
But most abductees
don't even remember anything.

137
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,832
Why hasn't my boyfriend... returned yet?
Is that normal?

138
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:24,086
Hmm... Maybe it's because
he wasn't actually taken by aliens at all.

139
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,216
Mmm. Hm.

140
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,847
MR. DIRECT KIM

141
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,266
Oh, hello, Mr. Kim.

142
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,395
Uh, yeah.

143
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,897
Uh, well...

144
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,398
No, but I'm not...

145
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,568
- I came to Cheonan for... just a while.
- Where is it?

146
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:51,280
Cheonan? Out of the blue? Why?

147
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:57,328
<i>Uh... Well, I was wondering if I should
call you or not. Sorry I didn't tell you.</i>

148
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,329
CLOSED TODAY

149
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,957
Right now we're on our way
to a hospital in Jeonju.

150
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,501
So, it's called
New Hope Psychiatric Hospital..

151
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:08,673
<i>I think we can find some important clues
about my boyfriend's whereabouts.</i>

152
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,799
And, um...

153
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,803
also clues about
the disappearance of your daughter.

154
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,850
What is it?

155
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,103
- Open it!
- What's going on with this guy?

156
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,946
- Open it up!
- Cap Hyung!

157
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,791
- Open it!
- What's going on?

158
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,535
- Are you all right?
- Help!

159
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,044
- I'm trying!
- Oh God, no! Oh God, no!

160
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,963
- Whoa! Oh no!
- You all right?

161
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,506
- Let me see!
- You okay?

162
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,198
What is it, Captain Hyung?

163
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,617
- Show us your hands.
- Let me see. Okay.

164
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,244
Stop, no!

165
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,388
- Aaaah!
- Oh!

166
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,789
That's so gross!

167
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,541
Oh, man.

168
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,210
- It looks bad.
- Even his fingers are tough.

169
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,670
Oh, man...

170
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,423
Hey, Phillip. Can you drive?

171
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,426
I don't have a license.
They're not eco-friendly.

172
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,511
- The average carbon emission per driver...
- Aah! Forget it!

173
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,221
Who's gonna drive us now?

174
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,919
BAEK-IL NATIONAL WELFARE CENTER

175
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,763
Hey, Troll, we'll never make it
to Jeonju at this pace.

176
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,307
Can you go at least
50 miles an hour, please?

177
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,035
Yoo-hoo! Please, Troll!

178
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,186
What? Oh... Sure.

179
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,523
- Wow!
- Wow! Whoa!

180
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,025
Oh, no! I take it back! Sorry.

181
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,819
Hey, Bora. Bora.

182
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,989
Do you think that hospital
was a secret facility for research?

183
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,991
I don't know.

184
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,745
But since it was called a wellness center,
it was probably a good cover.

185
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,374
If someone broke out and started spouting
nonsense, no one would think it was weird.

186
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,086
Wow! So they kidnapped Back Yoonsun,
experimented and tortured her?

187
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,047
"You've met the fuckin' aliens!"
Saying shit like that?

188
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,384
That's nothing but hearsay.
Based on that logic, everything is true.

189
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,427
Why don't you ever believe anything?

190
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,137
- Don't play <i>otaku, </i>please!
- Moonhole.

191
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,281
Questioning and believing are entwined.

192
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,142
So then... she was abducted twice..

193
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,644
Back Yoonsun, that person.

194
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,562
Right? Twice.

195
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,690
Once by extraterrestrials.

196
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,193
Then by humans. Right?

197
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,905
<i>- At the next exit, turn right.</i>
- Aah! Aah! Aah!

198
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,865
- There! Just take the exit! There!
- Oh! Oh!

199
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,617
- Turn right! Over there!
- Oh! Oh my God!

200
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,345
Take the exit!

201
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,513
No! Wait!

202
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,456
<i>You have deviated from the route.
Rerouting.</i>

203
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,500
<i>- Please wait.</i>
- We're screwed!

204
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,466
Hey, how are you?

205
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,220
I'm Oh Sehee, the Assistant Manager
at Gawa Integrated Design Studio.

206
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,763
Uh...

207
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,891
Stop that. You're an informant.

208
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,228
Okay... Now what? What do you want?
I'm not playing along.

209
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,397
And why would you bring
an informant with you?

210
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,151
Ma'am, please. Do you recognize
this drawing from the mass suicide scene?

211
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,402
LETTER OF APOLOGY

212
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,201
Was it, like... some kind of nursing home
or something like that?

213
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,328
The location of the suicide.

214
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,999
- Before it shut down, yeah...
- Shut down?

215
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,294
Uh... Because of that case?

216
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,090
Obviously, the incident was too relevant
to keep the facility running.

217
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,969
But after that...
I don't know what happened, to be honest.

218
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,056
It's just that... it was turned
into a mental health clinic.

219
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,725
What was the name?

220
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,518
Uh...

221
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,395
NEW HOPE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

222
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,230
Oh. New Hope Psychiatric Hospital.

223
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,025
I also did some research, you know?

224
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,860
Uh-huh...

225
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,614
Those who died,
do you believe they were...

226
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,908
part of some kind of religious group?

227
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,202
Like a Christian cult?

228
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,371
The Divine Light Church? Of course.
Ugh! Goosebumps.

229
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,124
Just by remembering the name.

230
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,712
According to people from the church,
those who committed suicide

231
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,590
shared a pattern and
were eccentric believers.

232
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,433
The church considered them
a pain in the ass.

233
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,010
So they said their church is normal,

234
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,263
but then a few cultist members...
got out to make a mess.

235
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,325
- Don't you think it's bold...
- It's typical.

236
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,768
It's a textbook example of what cults say.

237
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,731
That's precisely what I thought.

238
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,319
That's why I started by investigating
the pastor working at the church.

239
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,404
And what happened?
What else did you learn?

240
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,741
It was closed.

241
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,825
What?

242
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,869
You mean, the case got closed?

243
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,914
- Why?
- I don't know, but it was closed.

244
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,791
It's obvious for everyone.

245
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,752
- It wasn't a normal mass suicide, right?
- Mm-hm.

246
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,420
But they closed it anyway.

247
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,923
I made a huge scene.

248
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,759
I begged to re-open the case,
and then they kicked me out.

249
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,636
Ugh...

250
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,141
So, ma'am.

251
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,395
Did you keep the files you worked on,

252
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,022
from the research, I mean, by chance?

253
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,335
What's wrong with this thing?
Come on, piece of shit.

254
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,046
Still no signal?

255
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,632
Damn, I don't know what to press.

256
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,595
Everyone, I think we're lost.

257
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,557
Uh-huh. Oh my God, I haven't noticed.
Thanks for letting us know.

258
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,393
Wow... Where are we?

259
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,104
Whoa, shit!

260
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,439
We're in a jungle!

261
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,692
I don't understand, you have
a working GPS, how can you get lost?

262
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,444
All you have to do is follow it.

263
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,607
There were so many things
to look at, I got confused.

264
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,949
Look at the road, look at the GPS,
and why do I need so many mirrors?

265
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,386
Troll, promise me
you will never ever drive again.

266
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,704
The fact that we're still alive
is a miracle.

267
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,917
- Uh...
- Ow!

268
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,293
What was that?

269
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,798
Oh, fuck, that really hurt! Ow

270
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,801
One, two... three!

271
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,643
- Again, again!
- Come on!

272
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,062
One, two, three!

273
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,941
- Again!
- Come on. One!

274
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,693
Two! Three!

275
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,118
Oh! I can't, I can't. It hurts.
I can't. My back hurts.

276
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,621
Guys.

277
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:59,166
Hey, guys. Do you believe
that shaking your heads will fix this?

278
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,376
You need to move your legs.

279
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,087
Oh! It hasn't moved an inch.

280
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,715
Hey! Bora, where are you going?

281
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,133
I'm going to smoke.

282
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,803
How could you not see
this horrendous massive hole?

283
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,304
This is basically a canyon!

284
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,223
- For fuck's sake!
- Phillip. Look at me.

285
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,392
Okay? When you push,
you have to use your abs.

286
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,686
- Tssh! Tssh! You have to...
- Shut up, God damn it!

287
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,104
Shut up? Shut up?

288
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,107
I just want to help.
I don't want you to injure your back.

289
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,275
This is not about just breathing.
It's about bracing.

290
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,820
It helps protect your spine when you...

291
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,116
This car is junk.

292
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,952
Whatever.

293
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,166
Man...

294
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,044
Ow!

295
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,883
Bora. Just please take a look.

296
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,971
You know how we made a circle 'cause
we couldn't take all that exit, right?

297
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,305
Then shouldn't we be at...

298
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,599
Hey!

299
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,817
<i>Your destination is within one kilometer.</i>

300
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,662
Check, check. Check, check.

301
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,166
Uh, I've finally joined this voice app,
so can you hear me now?

302
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,209
Bora, you hear me?

303
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,127
Bora?

304
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,047
She's right behind you.
How can she not hear you?

305
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,758
This makes me feel like
we're in a battle royale game.

306
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,634
Roger that.

307
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,721
I don't get it.
Why are we using this app here?

308
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,473
We see each other's locations.

309
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,642
What? But we're all together.
Why do we need that?

310

HOPE AND LIGHT FACILITY
MASS SUICIDE

311
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,939
Isn't that a little strange?
Why did the investigation suddenly end?

312
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,941
Maybe due to the lack of evidence.

313
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,569
Is there
anyone important involved?

314
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,073
Could you please not flip through
so roughly on those?

315
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,866
They're already in tatters.

316
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,618
And don't lick your fingers.

317
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,118
Oh!

318
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,621
What? What is it?

319
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,791
This must be the guy. The cult's pastor.

320
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,169
It's strange, though.

321
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,505
Why would they gather
at a hospital to die?

It looks like no one's here.

324
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,565
- We'll split into two teams as we go in.
- Huh?

325
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,151
Cap and I will team up.

326
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,320
- The rest will be joining Jihyo.
- Yeah.

327
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,822
- Okay.
- Done.

328
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,408
Hey, you guys! Trespassing is illegal...

329
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,879
- I don't think it will open.
- Captain, do your thing.

330
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,805
Aren't you in the 1,000 Pound Club, bro?
Can't you do it?

331
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,391
Even if that were true,
I wouldn't be able to do it.

332
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,810
Ugh! At least try!
What's the point of working out?

333
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,688
Working out has no purpose.
Working out itself is the whole point.

334
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,660
Wow.

335
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,539
Your upper strength is amazing.

336
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,416
- Cool!
- Your physique is enviable.

337
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,168
That was so cool. My turn.

338
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,880
Oh! Donghyuk, be careful!
You could... could... could die!

339
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,841
Okay. My turn.

340
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,428
Captain.

341
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,596
Ugh, seriously?

342
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,266
Ugh...

343
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,772
- There! You've got a grip, right?
- Uh-huh.

344
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,150
Very well!
Push yourself up using your back.

345
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,320
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Just pull as hard as you can.

346
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,829
Come on, do it! Use all your strength.

347
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,539
What do you think I'm doing right now?

348
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,790
Ugh! Come on!

349
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,001
Just squeeze the chest
and tighten the rib cage.

350
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,545
- Connect that strength to your upper back...
- What? Oh, boy.

351
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,629
Hmm?

352
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,217
Hm?

353
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,573
- Come, come, come, come, come!
- Whoa, whoa whoa...

354

- Huh?

00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,467
I need to see what's
inside the SUV's trunk.

No, no, no, no! That would be suicide!

Stop right there.

377
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,258
How did you get here?

378
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,014
I've been in an accident. I need help.

Sorry?

You'll see my car is stuck.

I had an accident. Now it's stuck.

He's so fucking suspicious!

I just need to know,
what are you doing here?

driving my car and...

387

I think I got lost!

However, from this point on,
it's private property.

You're not allowed access.

- So go back where you came fro-
- I just need a little help!

392
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,719
My car's stuck!

393
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,351
It is stuck.

394
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,563
Okay, sir, so where's your vehicle?

395

Oh... Uh... There!

This is the front gate.

Suspicious person on site.
Suspicious person on site.

398
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,291
So? Will it be possible to pull it out?

399
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,694
Good afternoon!

400
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,864
So you said you were passing by?

401
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,825
Oh, yeah. That's right.
Say, I was going to my uncle's.

402
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:15,537
Then you should've kept going.
Why cause trouble? I'm pretty busy.

403
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,622
I... I'm sorry...

404

- Get his car out.
- Yes, ma'am.

405
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,063
What are you doing? Get in your car.

406
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,647
Huh?

407
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,191
Uh, yeah!

408
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,915
Hey, sir, come on.
What are you doing in the back seat?

409
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:05,961
Ah, you're right.

Ha, ha!

411
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,858
Jeez! Release the handbrake, would ya?

412
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,569
The handbrake...

413
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,322
Yeah. Which one is the... Ugh!

414

Sorry, I've just bought the car, so...

00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,204
You can't drive.

416
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,048
Who did you come with, sir?

417
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,348
You are pure in flesh
and in spirit.

418
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,643
You are nothing but the Light
that from the darkness emerges.

419
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:05,605
Be merciful and free us from
our eternal shackles of foolishness

420
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,482
due to our sins of our past life.

421
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,152
Under our Holy Mother,

- Take this guy with you, he's very noisy.
- Stop cursing, Mom.

464
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,098
Why do you always have
to use profanities, huh?

465
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,019
Oh, that again? You know that's not true.

466
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,314
Hey, don't yell at me.
I can do it tomorrow.

467
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,047
- ...and pure in spirit.
- Can you see inside the truck?

468
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,740
You are nothing but the Light
that emerges from the darkness.

469
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,105
- Let your Light...
- What are the NPCs doing here?

470
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,495
How's this hospital
connected to the church?

471
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,664
...and train in righteousness.

472
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,751
Be merciful and free us
from our eternal shackles of foolishness

473
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,213
due to our sins of our past life.
So... do you think Direct Kim was right?

474
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,049
- About what?
- About his daughter and Siguk?

475
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,511
- ...and lead us towards your Light.
- Maybe they abducted both of them.

476
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,889
What? You saw the crop circle
with your own eyes, dude.

477
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,725
They were abducted by aliens,
weren't they?

478
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,852
- Spread your true...
- What do you mean?

479
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,645
...those who are walking down the road...

480
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,896
Okay, bear with me.

481
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,692
What happened to Back Yoonsun
years ago happened to them too.

482
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,587
At first, they were abducted by aliens,
or whatever you wanna call them,

483
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,697
but then they were abducted again
by humans.

484
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,992
Then dragged away to the...
What did they call it?

485
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,637
- Secret research institute.
- Give us the wisdom...

486
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:10,999
The people who were abducted by the aliens
were abducted again.

487
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,543
- ...each of our...
<i>- Sella!</i>

488
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,129
And we move forward on a path
of ascension and unity.

489
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:19,632
<i>Sella!</i>

490
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,542
One, two, three!

491
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,928
Hey!

492
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,595
But did you see...

493
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,022
What the fuck are you saying?

494
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,411
Okay, they're loading some boxes
on the truck.

495
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,497
Sorry, from here,
I can't see what's in the boxes.

496
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,915
Ah, shit...

497
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Bora.

498
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,221
Bora. Bora.

499
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,848
Bora.

500
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,767
Bora! Hey!

501
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,522
Hey! Hey! Hey!

502
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,399
Bora!

503
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,901
<i>Hey! What are you doing? Are you nuts?</i>

504
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,528
Quick! Come here!

505
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,532
Come here.

506
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,621
By the way, did you hear?
They want to strengthen security.

507
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,374
No, but I've heard they're
not recruiting any more volunteers.

508
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,545
I know many brothers who want
to join the NPC, as a matter of fact.

509
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,007
- You're staying after this, right?
- I think so.

510
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,384
Did you sleep?

511
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,467
Not yet.

512
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,724
Lately, the congregation has provided
more help with the enlistment

513
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,975
than the president has.

514
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,728
We must work hard.

515
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:41,149
At this point, being part of the NPC
is proof of your faith.

516
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,984
Everyone else is crazy.

517
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,445
I get many calls from
the brothers every day.

518
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,833
I've heard they want
to build a new facility,

519
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,410
but I don't think it's a good idea.

520
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,870
Hey, Bora.

521
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,456
Yeah?

522
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,583
Yeah, we have a great view.

523
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,959
Go and shoot.

524
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,836
- Huh?
- You go in.

525
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,881
- I'll go check it out.
- Well, that's crazy. I mean...

526
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,383
See you at the car once
you're done with the mission, okay?

527
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,429
- Is that clear?
- Okay.

528
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,769
Wow! It's finally out!
Hah! It's finally out!

529
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:05,233
Uh... Hey! Thanks a lot.
I have no words to express my grat...

530
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,316
Where's your uncle?

531
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,195
- Where's his cabin?
- What?

532
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,239
You said you're going
to your uncle's, right?

533
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,491
What neighborhood does he live in?

534
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,494
Uh, it's... somewhere near here.

535
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,746
Something "-ri."

536
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,959
Ri? Ri...

537
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,003
Ri?

538
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,880
Oh! Is it Hoedong-ri?

539
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,632
Yeah! Thank you! Hoedong-ri.

540
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,676
Huh...

541
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,804
- Hoedong-ri?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

542
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:39,100
Ha, ha! I thought I was on my way there,
but I totally got lost with so many roads...

543
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,853
This forest feels almost like a maze.

544
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,312
And it needs lots of signs.

545
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,565
It's easy to get lost,
so for a first-timer...

546
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,733
Oh!

547
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,237
Only we don't have a place called that.

548
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,367
Why... Why are you doing this?

549
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,660
Car inspection.

550
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,744
Ma'am.

551
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,248
What are you doing here?

552
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,332
I...

553
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,960
I've... I've already told you.

554
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,547
- I... I... I was just... just passing by...
- Ma'am.

555
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,640
Huh.

556
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,730
So, where are your friends?

557
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,858
Speak or I'll shoot!

558
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,241
I'm sick and tired of the way
my mom treats me all the time, you know?

559
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,578
Why do all parents always think that
everything their children say is bullshit?

560
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,830
To be fair, you do talk a lot of bullshit.

561
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,250
Well, I told her I'd be staying
at a friend's before I left.

562
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,396
She acts like it's the first time she's
heard it. I ain't doing anything wrong.

563
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,588
- Hey!
- Whoa...

564
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,924
What on earth are you guys doing here?

565
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,592
Why won't you answer?

566
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,761
Hey, answer me now!

567
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,055
- What were you doing here?
- Huh?

568
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,099
- Answer me. Where did your friends go?
- What?

569
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,101
- Where did they all go?
- Phillip.

570
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,978
If you don't start talking now,
you'll regret it!

571
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,783
NEW HOPE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

572
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,874
RESTRICTED AREA

573
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,960
CLOSED WARD

574
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,255
Room 301 has already been cleared.
They're all in the lobby.

575
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,382
Everything went well.

576
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,219
We can improve efficiency,
but we're on the right track.

577
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,817
<i>Hey, Jihyo.</i>

578
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,986
<i>- Do you copy?</i>
- You scared me.

579
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,154
<i>This is very strange.</i>

580
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,907
There are no patients in this hospital.

581
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,744
There are too many rooms, though.

582
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,538
<i>But there are no nurses or doctors.</i>

583
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,627
Hey! Zip it, please.
I can't speak at the moment.

584
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,263
YOU CAME IN THE FLESH
CLOTHED IN RIGHTEOUSNESS

585
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,300
ROOMS 306-310
3F

586
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,105
Oh, shit!

587
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,982
Shit! Shit!

588
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,242
YOU CAME IN THE FLESH
CLOTHED IN RIGHTEOUSNESS

589
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,321
- Very good wine, though.
- Yeah. I know.

590
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,453
What time is it, anyway?

591
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,746
I don't know.

592
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,630
Huh?

593
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,050
- Did you lock the door?
- Uh, no.

594
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,053
It must be stuck again.
Why don't you try lifting and pulling?

595
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,891
Ugh! You should handle
the facilities with more care. Okay?

596
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,203
- Gosh!
- 'Scuse me. I'll take care of it.

597
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,646
Why isn't it working? It always works.

598
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,190
- What's going on?
- Pull it up.

599
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,284
I swear, ma'am,
we're just passing by...

600
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,787
Shut up! If you say that again,
I swear I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

601
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,211
- Is he really crying?
- Ma'am, take a look?

602
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,486
Hyung, hit it!

603
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,569
Go! Go!

604
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,031
Jeez! Oh, God!

605
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,408
- Oh!
- Oh!

606
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,079
Aah!

607
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,914
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

608
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,749
- Whoa! Argh!
- He's fast!

609
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,752
Donghyuk!

610
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,962
Come on, move, move, move! Let's go!

611
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,090
Let's go!

612
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,760
- Whoa! Oh, God!
- What was that?

613
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,138
Whoa! Donghyuk!

614
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,392
- Oh!
- Fuck! We're gonna die!

615
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,684
Oh, what... Oh, shit!

616
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,437
- Huh?
- Whoa! Oh!

617
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,775
- A fucking shotgun!
- They'll kill us!

618
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,193
- Don't push me!
- Hurry!

619
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:14,262
- Get us outta here!
- What are you doing? Phillip!

620
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,997
- She's gonna shoot again!
- Hey, hold on! Boys, give me a minute.

621
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,960
- Aah, aah! Aah!
- What happened?

622
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,923
Phillip Hyung! Phillip got shot!

623
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,755
Oh, fuck, are you serious?

624
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,800
- Where did you get shot?
- Is he okay?

625
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:28,963
Don't die on me!

626
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:43,649
This is Security Team One.
Code 17. I repeat. Code 17.

627
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,734
<i>- I repeat. Code 17.</i>
- What is this? What...

628
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,778
<i>All members, stop activities.</i>

629
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,613
<i>We require vehicles
and security personnel.</i>

630
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,573
- What?
<i>- Over.</i>

631
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,116
Everybody out! Damn it!

632
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,827
Hurry, it's this way! This way! Over here!

633
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,038
This way, come on.

634
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,707
This way. Hurry! Over here.

635
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,333
Go help!

636
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,295
Hurry!

637
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,058
Hey, Jihyo.

638
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,560
You copy?

639
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,690
You've been right all along.

640
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,275
Huh?

641
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,109
About what?

642
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,447
They're all here, the people.

643
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,367
What do you mean?

644
00:42:58,909 --> 00:42:59,909
Uh, who?

645
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,912
They're all unconscious.

646
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:05,749
They've got these VR sets...
They're just lying here.

647
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,586
What do you mean?

648
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,004
<i>People who were abducted.</i>

649
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,506
Remember those boxes?
Well, they contained people.

650
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:20,639
About Direct Kim's daughter and Siguk.
Maybe they abducted both of them.

651
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,727
Oh, shit!

652
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,938
These fuckers...
They have abducted too many!

653
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,357
<i>Bora, is... is Siguk there?</i>

654
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,985
Do you see him there?

655
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,240
Actually, I can only see women here.

656
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,119
<i>Have all the men been taken away already?</i>

657
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,830
<i>Why don't you take a look at the truck?</i>

658
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,375
<i>Do you think all the men
could be in the truck?</i>

659
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:57,444
I WILL SHOW YOU GREAT
AND HIDDEN THINGS YOU DO NOT KNOW

660
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,420
Back Yoonsun...

661
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,171
Beautiful, isn't she?

662
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:21,468
She was quite beautiful
in her younger days.

663
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,761
Who the hell are you?

664
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,264
I'm the one who should
be asking that question.

665
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,015
I own this hospital.

666
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,732
Could you please put that down?

667
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,789
You seem to be very curious,
to come all this way.

668
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,000
It takes courage to come alone.

669
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,963
It's an obsession of mine.

670
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,674
Hmm. Mm-hm.

671
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,676
Indeed, it is.

672
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,264
This is how youth should be.

673
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,644
Do you want to know who that lady is?

674
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,233
Back Yoonsun,
of the Seoul UFO incident.

675
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,820
She established contact, pretty much
like all the people in this room.

676
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,529
Why?

677
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,450
Is there anything else you wanna say?

678
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,914
You're a very smart girl
for your age, aren't you?

679
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:35,417
That's surprising.
My goodness, that's sobering.

680
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,925
All right, all right... Pfft.

681
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,010
Very well, here's what we'll do.

682
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:48,222
We're going to take turns asking
each other questions. Huh?

683
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:51,850
One asks a question first,
and then the other has a turn. Deal?

684
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,691
Fair enough. Sounds fun, right?

685
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,944
Ladies first.

686
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,445
Oh...

687
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,323
What is this place, exactly?

688
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:12,412
This place is where my wife and I met.

689
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:16,792
- Don't tell me Back Yoonsun is your...
- Oh! Oop, oop, oop, oop. My turn.

690
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,674
So, are you the one who took my album?

691
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,469
Precisely.

692
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,138
Hmm. Could you give it back to...

693
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,266
Oh! Oop, oop, oop.

694
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,269
My turn.

695
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,729
Oh. Oh!

696
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,690
Hmm.

697
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,317
Mmm.

698
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,571
I have an idea of the kind of stuff
you people do here.

699
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,156
Mm-hm. That's not a question, is it?

700
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,581
Why are you abducting them?

701
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,583
Those who made contact?

702
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,087
What exactly do you want
from these people?

703
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,468
True redemption.

704
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,434
Really? How is that?

705
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,147
<i>Even if I tell you...
you wouldn't understand.</i>

706
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,985
Say what? That's not even an answer.

707
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,405
Okay...

708
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,283
What is so special about this woman?

709
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,705
What on Earth are you guys looking for?

710
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,918
I'd love to tell you everything.

711
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:46,006
Although it's my turn to ask,
and we're still on the clock.

712
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,299
All right!

713
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,095
My last question.

714
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,267
Do you know why I'm confessing
all of these things to you?

715
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,602
Do you?

716
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,314
'Cause you're gonna kill me anyway.

717
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,109
You're a very smart cookie!

718
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,240
Hmm. It's me.

719
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,868
There's a little bug in my room.

720
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,662
Come get it for me.

721
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,210
I'm very sorry
to keep stating the obvious,

722
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,713
but personally,
I think this is such a shame.

723
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:30,258
To be completely honest,
I think we'd have a good time.

724
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,637
Maybe have a drink or two
and chat about many things.

725
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,100
Don't you think?

726
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,273
You're definitely right.

727
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,115
You're very good at stating
the obvious, huh?

728
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,950
Could you please put that out?

729
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,578
What's the matter?
You said I'm gonna die anyway.

730
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,999
Is it forbidden to smoke in here?

731
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:04,959
Hmm?

732
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,091
Because of...

733
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,261
some stupid cherished memory?

734
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,562
Oh!

735
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,150
No! No, no! Jeez! Oh, no!

736
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,319
Oh, no!

737
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:35,991
I WILL SHOW YOU GREAT
AND HIDDEN THINGS YOU DO NOT KNOW

738
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,706
We have an escape!

739
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,542
She's over here!

740
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,794
- Stop!
- Get her!

741
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,088
Escape?

742
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,424
But... Oh, no. Damn it!

743
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,176
Oh shit! Oh!

744
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,474
Aah! Fuck!

745
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,309
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop!

746
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,939
Bora! Over here!

747
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,858
Oh!

748
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,152
Hurry up!

749
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,533
The door! The door!

750
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,701
What are you doing?

751
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,995
- Get out!
- Get out!

752
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,499
Jeez! Move out the way!

753
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,375
- Push the pedal!
- I'm on it! Oh...

754
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,211
I don't know what to press! Oh, no!

755
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,428
Oh, shit! God damn it!

756
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,097
Outta my way!

757
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,521
We're good! We're good!
We're good! Goodbye!

758
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,152
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah! Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! I did it!

759
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,948
Goodbye!

760
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,701
- Whoo!
- Gate! Gate! Gate!

761
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,054
- Just knock the gates down!
- Oh!

762
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,162
- Faster, faster!
- Oh!

763
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,792
- Hold on tight!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

764
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,086
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Yeah!

765
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,879
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

766
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,131
Whoa! Come on!

767
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,574
- Whoo!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

768
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,134
- Go through it!
- Aaaah!

769
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,266
Shit.

770
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,809
Huh?

771
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,269
Let's go!

772
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,272
Over there, over there!

773
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,698
Get out of there! Get out!

774
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:40,782
- Get out!
- Now what?

since you didn't have any sort of ID.

you return and get back to your country.
